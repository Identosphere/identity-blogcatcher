  <p>Microsoft has recently introduced a range of new security tools and features for the Microsoft Entra product family, aimed at helping organizations improve their security posture. With the ever-increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks and the increasing use of cloud-based services and the proliferation of mobile devices, it is essential that organizations have effective tools in place to manage their security scope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re sharing the new feature releases for the last quarter (July – September 2023) and the change announcements (September 2023 change management train). We also communicate these changes on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/whats-new">release notes</a> and via email. We’re continuing to make it easier for our customers to manage lifecycle changes (deprecations, retirements, service breaking changes) within the new <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">Entra admin center</a> as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These recent updates have been organized into Microsoft Entra product areas, making it easy to quickly find and access the latest updates. With these new features, we aim to provide our customers with an identity and access solution for a connected world.</p>

 Change announcements: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to FIDO2 authentication methods </p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning January 2024, Microsoft Entra ID will support <a href="https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#device-bound-passkey">device-bound passkeys</a> stored on computers and mobile devices as an authentication method in public preview, in addition to the existing support for FIDO2 security keys. This enables your users to perform phishing-resistant authentication using the devices that they already have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will expand the existing FIDO2 authentication methods policy and end user registration experience to support this preview release. If your organization requires or prefers FIDO2 authentication using physical security keys only, then please enforce key restrictions to only allow security key models that you accept in your FIDO2 policy. Otherwise, the new preview capabilities will enable your users to register for device-bound passkeys stored on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. Learn more about FIDO2 key restrictions <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Updates</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a three-year deprecation period, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">announced in June 2023</a> that we are entering the retirement, or shut down, cycle for Azure AD Graph APIs, which are now out of support (other than security-related fixes). This aligns with our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/versioning-and-support">Breaking Change Policy</a> that promises a minimum two (2) year deprecation period before API retirement. In June, we also described that this retirement would happen in stages and with advanced notice between each stage. The first stage will involve newly created Applications being unable to use Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While there are limited substantial updates to share at this point, we do want to provide an interim update. Our goal is to be transparent and establish a regular cadence of communication as we work with and support our customers through this service retirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>September 2023 updates:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Some customers have told us that it is hard to identify or find which applications are using the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs, and at what scale. We are now working to deliver an analytics experience through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations">Identity Recommendations</a> that will provide the information that you need to identify and prioritize applications that require update or modification to avoid further disruption. We will provide an estimated release date for this experience soon. 
 As described in our prior communication, the first stage of retirement for Azure AD Graph APIs will involve a change that prevents newly-created <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0">Applications</a> from using Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). We will provide a minimum of three (3) months advance notice before this date. At this first stage, only newly created Applications, and not existing Applications, will be impacted.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a near-future update, we will provide more detail on the timeline and actions needed to avoid disruption for (new) Applications that are not yet migrated to Microsoft Graph. We have not yet set the date at which newly created Applications will be prevented from using Azure AD Graph APIs, but we are working diligently towards providing that clarity and to deliver experiences that will help support customer efforts in migrating applications away from this retiring API service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Required Action:</p>
<p>Identify and migrate applications that are using Azure AD Graph to use equivalent Microsoft Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph is a feature rich API platform that provides a unified API surface for many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Entra, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint, and the full Microsoft 365 portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Migrate Sign-in risk policy and User risk policy and from Entra ID Protection to Conditional Access</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have User risk policy or Sign-in risk policy enabled in Entra ID Protection (formerly Identity Protection) today, we invite you to migrate them to Conditional Access following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies#migrate-risk-policies-from-identity-protection-to-conditional-access">these steps</a>. The UX in Entra ID Protection for these two risk policies will be retired on October 1, 2026</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configuring Sign-in risk and User risk policies in Conditional Access provides these benefits:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Manage all access policies in one place. 
 Report-only mode and Graph API support.&nbsp; 
 Greater flexibility by combining risk conditions with other conditions like location for granular access control.&nbsp; 
 Enhanced security with multiple risk-based policies targeting different user groups or risk levels.&nbsp; 
 Improved diagnostics experience by viewing which risk-based policy applied in Sign-in Logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Registration campaign improvements</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help your users&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/it-s-time-to-hang-up-on-phone-transports-for-authentication/ba-p/1751752">move away from publicly switched telephone networks (PSTN) such as SMS and voice</a>, we’re making improvements to the&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-registration-campaign">Registration campaign feature (aka Nudge)</a>. We’ll allow users to skip the prompt a maximum of three times, after which they will have to go through the registration flow. Note: admins can decide if they want to opt out of the “limited” 3 snooze configuration or give their end users the ability to snooze indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for Entra ID tenants that are Microsoft managed, we’re enabling the feature for users that are fully dependent on PSTN methods (SMS and voice) today for their MFA. Beginning&nbsp;September 2023, we will initiate a phased rollout of this change for Entra ID premium tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Support for Authenticator Lite in the per-user MFA policy</p>

The first supported application is&nbsp;Outlook mobile. It’s a great alternative for users who can’t or aren’t willing to download another&nbsp;work&nbsp;app on their phone but already have&nbsp;Outlook set up on their mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, Authenticator Lite is only available to organizations who manage Microsoft Authenticator in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fconcept-authentication-methods-manage%23authentication-methods-policy&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=xRuXa6iKsZ92fRhu2QzLGrM6vrQf1Rk2mxs%2B6J22vyI%3D&amp;reserved=0">modern authentication methods policy</a>.

<p>Optimized MFA OTP delivery via WhatsApp</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>Today,&nbsp;Entra ID&nbsp;(Azure AD) MFA supports delivering one-time passcodes (OTPs) via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-phone-options#sms-message-verification">text message</a>. These texts get sent to the default messaging app on a user's phone depending on the phone's operating system. In many countries though, these default apps aren't users' primary messaging apps. To help deliver OTPs to users on their preferred messaging platforms, Entra ID will roll out OTP delivery to WhatsApp in select regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting mid-September 2023, users&nbsp;in India, Indonesia, and New Zealand may start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Users that fit the following criteria are subject, but not guaranteed, to receive the updated experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enabled for text messages / SMS as an authentication method 
 Already use WhatsApp 
 Have a phone number with a country code in one of the listed countries

<p>Changes to My Groups admin controls</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>Starting June 2024, the existing Self Service Group Management setting in the Microsoft Entra admin center which states, “Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access,” will be retired. This means disabling My Groups will no longer be possible. In June, a new setting that enables admins to restrict end users from viewing and managing security groups in My Groups will take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will occur automatically—admins and users won’t need to take any action:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 If the existing setting for Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Panel is configured as Yes, the new setting will restrict users' ability to see and edit security groups in My Groups. 
 &nbsp;If the existing setting is configured as No, the new setting will expose security groups in My Groups. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more, please see this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#make-a-group-available-for-user-self-service">documentation</a>. Note: Admins can still manage end users' ability to create Microsoft 365 and security groups using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#group-settings">group settings</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable HTTP/2 on the Graph service endpoint</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-change-announcements-september-2022-train/ba-p/2967454">previously announced</a> in September of 2022, the Microsoft Graph engineering team plans to begin rollout of HTTP/2 support on the Microsoft Graph service endpoint on September 15, 2023. HTTP/2 support will be in addition to existing HTTP/1.1 version support. Once HTTP/2 is enabled on the Microsoft Graph endpoints, clients that support HTTP/2 will negotiate this version when making requests to Microsoft Graph. Focus for improvements in the HTTP/2 specification concern performance, including perceived latency, and network and service resource usage (reference <a href="https://http2.github.io">https://http2.github.io</a>), including multiplexing, parallelism, and efficiency through binary encoding and header compression. These benefits may offer substantial value to Microsoft Graph clients and customers. HTTP/2 is expected to be entirely backwards-compatible with HTTP/1.1 and to require no code changes in client applications. It's possible, in rare cases, that negative impact may occur with some client applications, if the application does not adhere to HTTP specifications concerning case-insensitive comparisons for Header keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recent rise of generative <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/open-source-large-language-models-benefits-risks-and-types/">large language models (LLMs)</a> has inspired organizations in every industry to consider how AI can drive innovation. Leaders are increasingly recognizing the power of AI as well as its potential limitations and risks.&nbsp;It’s critical that leaders think carefully about how AI is created and applied and take a human-centric, principled approach to each use case.</p>



<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation is considering the opportunities and potential risks of solutions harnessing AI, particularly related to skills-based hiring. The organization sought to explore a test case for job seekers, examining if AI models could help learners and workers identify and recognize their skills, and convey them in the form of digital credentials. If proven possible, then future use cases of AI models could be explored, like matching users to potential employment and education opportunities based on their skill profiles. They discovered that AI models could in fact take someone’s past experiences—in different data formats—and convert them into digital credentials that that could then be validated by the job seeker and shared with potential employers.</p>



<p>The U.S. Chamber Foundation asked IBM’s Open Innovation Community to run a collaborative initiative to help further assess the potential risks of using AI models like this, leveraging the deep AI expertise of IBM Consulting.</p>



<p>The users of this solution would represent a wide variety of communities. This made it critical to bring together global, diverse and multi-disciplinary people with a wide spectrum of lived world experiences to drive the exercises and explore the potential for inadvertent impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building off of the use cases developed by the U.S. Chamber Foundation and their lead partner, Education Design Lab, the team identified four personas: a caregiver, a ride-share driver, a soldier and an incarcerated person.</p>



<p>The four personas became the focus of design thinking sessions customized by IBM Design to align teams on what unintended outcomes could occur when users interacted with an AI model like this, such as bias, data privacy concerns or accessibility issues related to language or computer literacy. The U.S. Chamber Foundation established four principles for earning trust, including safety, accountability, fairness and efficacy, and the team used those principles to help determine the rights of these individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of these sessions, the eight teams worked with the U.S. Chamber Foundation to demonstrate they had thoughtfully considered how to help mitigate potential risks associated with using AI. The teams presented their results on July 18 at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFLPkIIKSjTwdqqG2_Da9gybWJoBqM21N">Experience You Demonstration Event</a>.&nbsp;The outputs of this work set an excellent foundation to aid in reducing and helping to mitigate potential unintended outcomes as AI solutions get deployed at scale.</p>



<p>The U.S. Chamber Foundation and Education Design Lab are committed to continuing the momentum of this experience and are currently working to explore future phases of the project.</p>



<p>Developing and deploying trustworthy in AI is not a technical problem with a technical solution. It is a socio-technical challenge that, to solve, requires a holistic approach encompassing people, processes and tools. Trustworthy AI starts with people and culture, not technology. It’s important to use human-centered frameworks rooted in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/">design thinking</a> practices to keep the focus on user needs.&nbsp;</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 26th September to 2nd&nbsp;October <p>Welcome to the latest edition of our Veriscope Regulatory Recap, where we bring clarity to the key regulatory developments influencing the world of cryptocurrency.</p><p>In this issue, we explore Brazil’s responsive strategies to rising crypto engagement and the United States’ initiatives for clearer transactional insights. We also delve into Hong Kong’s evolving stance on stablecoin regulation and review the global efforts by the World Federation of Exchanges to standardize procedures in crypto trading platforms. So, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Regulatory Roundup: A Convergence of Oversight and Innovation <p>Brazil: With Brazil experiencing a crypto boom, the Central Bank found itself walking on a tightrope, as it has to tighten regulations around digital assets without stifling innovation. A 44.2% surge in crypto engagement prompted it to look closer at stablecoins and refine frameworks to mitigate risks and ensure compliance, striving for equilibrium between innovation and oversight.</p><p>The United States: Representative Don Beyer is championing legislation to enhance clarity in crypto transactions by mandating the disclosure of internal asset flows by exchanges. This move seeks to fortify the integrity and reliability of digital asset transactions, carving a path to a more secure and well-organized crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Hong Kong: Keeping in line with its efforts to construct a solid regulatory environment for stablecoins, Hong Kong intends to publish definitive guidelines by 2024. This pursuit reflects the region’s dedication to assimilating digital assets effectively within its financial domain, offering a platform for innovation while maintaining stringent regulatory practices to safeguard market stability.</p><p>International: The World Federation of Exchanges outlines six foundational principles aiming to standardize operations across crypto trading platforms. It highlights the necessity of parallel regulatory approaches for comparable activities in the crypto and traditional financial sectors, with an eye on sustaining market integrity and secure, responsible growth in the crypto industry.</p><p>Now, let’s analyze two of these significant developments to see how they may impact the broader crypto ecosystem.</p> US Legislative Push for Transparent Crypto Asset Flow: A Closer Examination <p>The proposed legislation by Rep. Don Beyer seeks to mitigate risks in the crypto space by enforcing enhanced transparency around asset flows within major exchanges.</p><p>This legislative initiative necessitates recording internal crypto transactions in regulated repositories, a move designed to standardize internal record-keeping and reduce susceptibility to fraud and manipulation.</p><p>Such uniformity in transaction reporting could serve as a protective layer for investors and consumers, ensuring that the variances in internal record-keeping don’t compromise the security and integrity of digital asset transactions.</p> Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects <p>Investor Protection:</p><p>The mandatory reporting of internal transactions can significantly minimize risks associated with inaccuracies and inconsistencies in transaction recording, thereby safeguarding investor interests.</p><p>Market Integrity:</p><p>Uniform reporting and record-keeping can uphold the reliability and authenticity of transactions, reinforcing the credibility of the crypto&nbsp;market.</p> Negative Aspects <p>Operational Strain:</p><p>The legislation could impose additional compliance burdens, necessitating substantial adjustments in operational practices and inducing potential delays in transaction processes.</p><p>Privacy Concerns:</p><p>The mandatory sharing of transaction data may raise apprehensions regarding the confidentiality and privacy of user information and transaction details, potentially leading to reluctance among prospective participants.</p> Regulatory Evolution Amid Rising Crypto Adoption: Brazil’s Proactive Approach <p>With Brazil experiencing an unprecedented surge in cryptocurrency adoption, reflected in a 44.2% increase in crypto imports, reaching approximately $7.4 billion from January to August 2023, it finds itself at the intersection of innovation and regulation. The Central Bank of Brazil, recognizing the metamorphosis of stablecoins from investment vehicles to transactional tools, is keen on recalibrating its regulatory stance to curb potential financial misdemeanors.</p><p>Simultaneously, Brazil is not shying away from embracing the digital asset revolution. The unveiling of a Central Bank Digital Currency, Drex, and enabling cryptocurrency for tax payments via Banco do Brasil underscore the country’s commitment to integrating digital currencies into the financial fabric.</p> Impact on Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects <p>Market Maturity:</p><p>Regulatory advancements and governmental adoption can signal market maturity, potentially attracting more sophisticated and institutional investors to the Brazilian crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>Consumer Protection:</p><p>The enhanced regulatory environment aims at providing a safer ecosystem for consumers, potentially reducing fraud and enhancing the overall trust in digital&nbsp;assets.</p> Negative Aspects <p>Innovation Dilemma:</p><p>The intensified regulatory scrutiny may impose barriers on creative initiatives and could potentially deter small-scale innovators and startups from entering the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Privacy Concerns:</p><p>The development and adoption of state-backed digital assets like Drex could raise concerns over user privacy and financial autonomy, potentially influencing user preferences and market dynamics.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 How to submit bugs? 
<p>At the moment, active members can only submit bugs via the official SelfKey DAO discord group. If you aren’t part of it, you are welcomed to join by clicking on the following <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mtfrm4pw">link</a>.</p>
<p>There is a dedicated channel on discord where you can submit errors or bugs and in which you can open a <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/897002577831526460/1154686519525789756">ticket</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take note of the following requirements before submitting a bug report:</p>
 
 Make sure that the bug isn't already listed in the <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/897002577831526460/1154686899907199027">known-bugs</a> channel. Support will not take duplicates into consideration. 
 Provide a detailed step-by-step walkthrough and screenshots for bug reproduction. The report needs to be clear and contain precise information on the error. 
 Please include essential technical details, such as OS and browser versions, with your report. 
 Only bugs found on app.selfkey.org and selfkey.org web apps will be accepted at the moment. 
 
 How will support handle the bug reports? 
<p>After you’ve made sure you have correctly submitted a bug report, please wait patiently for support to handle the process. If your submission respects the requirements listed above, you will be informed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Support will check and determine if you qualify for SELF tokens, including the amount of SELF you may be eligible for if your submission is accepted. The severity* of the bug you’ve reported will have a huge influence on determining how much SELF you may qualify for:</p>
 
 For one minor bug - 1 SELF 
 For one medium bug - 3 SELF 
 For one critical bug - 10 SELF 
 
<p>*Please note that support will determine the severity of the bug.</p>
<p>Be aware that the quantity of SELF tokens you may be eligible for bug report submissions may vary over time. Stay updated and continue contributing to ensure you benefit from this initiative.</p>
<p>Additionally, if support determines you qualify for SELF, you will see the respective tokens in the DApp.</p>
<p></p>
 Other Ways To Qualify For SELF Tokens 
<p>Given that decentralization is against having a single authority control and manage the whole system, SelfKey DAO values participation from all members. The purpose is to include members by inviting them to contribute to the development of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, SelfKey DAO has opened another opportunity for participants to qualify for SELF tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated above, you must be a SelfKey iD owner in order to participate in the SelfKey DAO and benefit from the privileges it offers. By introducing an eligible member to the SelfKey DAO, you may qualify for more SELF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is indeed as effortless as that - simply invite another eligible member to become part of the thriving SelfKey DAO, and you may be eligible for SELF tokens yourself.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>DAOs may also provide numerous benefits for its active participants, including the ability to vote for changes in the benefit of the whole community, and have their voice heard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In turn, active participation and consistent engagement from members are vital for a DAO to function properly and to thrive over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to participate in the SelfKey DAO, get your very own SelfKey iD and join a community of like-minded individuals!</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai">recent IBV study</a>, 64% of surveyed CEOs face pressure to accelerate adoption of generative AI, and 60% lack a consistent, enterprise-wide method for implementing it.</p>



<p>An AI and data platform, such as watsonx, can help empower businesses to leverage foundation models and accelerate the pace of generative AI adoption across their organization.</p>



<p>The newly launched features and capabilities of watsonx.ai, a capability within watsonx, include new general-purpose and code-generation foundation models, an increased variety of open-source model options, and additional data options and tuning capabilities that can broaden the potential business impact of generative AI. These enhancements have been guided by IBM’s fundamental strategic considerations that AI should be <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/exploring-the-ai-and-data-capabilities-of-watsonx/">open, trusted, targeted and empowering</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">Learn more about watsonx.ai, our enterprise-focused studio for AI builders.</a></p>



 Business-targeted, IBM-developed foundation models built from sound data 



<p>Business leaders charged with adopting generative AI need model flexibility and choice. They also need secured access to business-relevant models that can help accelerate time to value and insights. Recognizing that one size doesn’t fit all, IBM’s watsonx.ai studio provides a family of language and code foundation models of different sizes and architectures to help clients deliver performance, speed, and efficiency.</p>



<p>“In an environment where the integration with our systems and seamless interconnection with various software are paramount, watsonx.ai emerges as a compelling solution,” says Atsushi Hasegawa, Chief Engineer, Honda R&amp;D. “Its inherent flexibility and agile deployment capabilities, coupled with a robust commitment to information security, accentuates its appeal.”</p>



<p>The initial release of watsonx.ai included the Slate family of encoder-only models useful for enterprise NLP tasks. We’re happy to now introduce the first iteration of our IBM-developed generative foundation models, Granite. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/building-ai-for-business-ibms-granite-foundation-models/">Granite</a> model series is built on a decoder-only architecture and is suited to generative tasks such as summarization, content generation, retrieval-augmented generation, classification, and extracting insights.</p>



<p>All Granite foundation models have been trained on enterprise-focused datasets curated by IBM. &nbsp;To provide even deeper domain expertise, the Granite family of models was trained on enterprise-relevant datasets from five domains: internet, academic, code, legal and finance, all scrutinized to root out objectionable content, and benchmarked against internal and external models. This process is designed to help mitigate risks so that model outputs can be deployed responsibly with the assistance of watsonx.data and watsonx.governance (coming soon).</p>



<p>Based on initial <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/X9W4O6BM">IBM Research evaluations and testing</a>, <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/1316299398793"></a>across 11 different financial tasks, the results show that by training Granite-13B models with high-quality finance data, they are some of the top performing models on finance tasks, and have the potential to achieve either similar or even better performance than much larger models. Financial tasks evaluated includes: providing sentiment scores for stock and earnings call transcripts, classifying news headlines, extracting credit risk assessments, summarizing financial long-form text and answering financial or insurance-related questions.</p>



 Building transparency into IBM-developed AI models 



<p>To date, many available AI models lack information about data provenance, testing and safety or performance parameters.&nbsp;For many businesses and organizations, this can introduce uncertainties that slow adoption of generative AI, particularly in highly regulated industries.</p>



<p>Today, IBM is sharing the following data sources used in the training of the Granite models (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/X9W4O6BM">learn more about how these models are trained and data sources used</a>):<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/X9W4O6BM"></a></p>

<p>IBM’s approach to AI development is guided by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/policy/trust-transparency-new/?_gl=1*npf8yo*_ga*NjI3OTU2MTEwLjE2MzQwNDk4Mzc.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5MDU1NjY5My42Ny4wLjE2OTA1NTY2OTMuMC4wLjA.">core principles</a> grounded in commitments to trust and transparency. As a testament to the rigor IBM puts into the development and testing of its foundation models,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models">IBM will indemnify</a>&nbsp;clients against third party IP claims against IBM-developed foundation models. And contrary to some other providers of Large Language Models and consistent with IBM’s standard approach on indemnification, IBM does not require its customers to indemnify IBM for a customer’s use of IBM developed models. Also consistent with IBM’s approach to its indemnification obligation, IBM does not cap its IP indemnification liability for the IBM-developed models.</p>



<p>As clients look to use our IBM-developed models to create differentiated AI assets, we encourage clients to further customize IBM models to meet specific downstream tasks. Through prompt engineering and tuning techniques underway, clients can responsibly use their own enterprise data to achieve greater accuracy in the model outputs, to create a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>



 Helping organizations responsibly use third-party models 



<p>Considering there are thousands of open-source large language models to work with, it’s difficult to know where to get started and how to choose the right model for the right task. However, choosing the “right” LLM from a collection of thousands of open-source models is not an easy endeavor and requires a careful examination of the tradeoffs between cost and performance. And considering the unpredictability of many LLMs, it’s important to also factor in AI ethics and governance into the model building, training, tuning, testing, and outputs.</p>



<p>Knowing that one model won’t be enough – we’ve created a foundation model library in watsonx.ai for clients and partners to work with. Starting with 5 curated open-source models from Hugging Face, we chose these models based on rigorous technical, licensing and performance reviews, and includes understanding the range of use cases that the models are best for. The latest open-source LLM model we added this month includes Meta’s 70 billion parameter model Llama 2-chat inside the watsonx.ai studio. Llama 2 is useful for chat and code generation. It is pretrained with publicly available online data and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288">fine-tuned using reinforcement learning</a> from human feedback. Useful for enhancing virtual agent and chat applications, Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research scenarios.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder">StarCoder LLM</a> from BigCode is also now available in watsonx.ai. Trained on permissively licensed data from GitHub, the model can be used as a technical assistant, explaining, and answering general questions about code in natural language. It can also help autocomplete code, modify code and explain code snippets in natural language.</p>



<p>Users of third-party models in watsonx.ai can also toggle on an AI guardrails function to help automatically remove offensive language from input prompts and generated output.</p>



 Reducing model-training risk with synthetic data 



<p>In the conventional process of anonymizing data, errors can be introduced that severely compromise outputs and predictions. But <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/synthetic-data#:~:text=Synthetic%20data%20is%20data%20that,aid%20in%20data%20science%20experiments.">synthetic data</a> offers organizations the ability to address data gaps and reduce the risk of exposing any individual’s personal data by taking advantage of data created artificially through computer simulation or algorithms.</p>



<p>The synthetic data generator service in watsonx.ai will enable organizations to create synthetic tabular data that is pre-labeled and preserves the statistical properties of their original enterprise data. &nbsp;This data can then be used to tune AI models more quickly or improve their accuracy by injecting more variety into datasets (shortcutting the long data-collection timeframes required to capture the wide variation in real data). Being able to build and test models with synthetic data can help organizations overcome data gaps and, in turn, improve their speed to market with new AI solutions.</p>



 Enabling business-focused use cases with prompt tuning 



<p>The official release of Tuning Studio in watsonx.ai lets business users customize foundation models to their business-specific downstream needs across a variety of use cases including Q&amp;A, content generation, named entity recognition, insight extraction, summarization, and classification.</p>



<p>The first release of the Tuning Studio will support prompt tuning. By using advanced prompt tuning within watsonx.ai (based on as few as 100 to 1,000 examples), organizations can customize existing foundation models to their proprietary data. <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-ai-prompt-tuning?_gl=1*1ua34d*_ga*MTgyMjU0NTQ0MS4xNjY4NzA4NjQ2*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5NDQ1NzUwMS4xMjIuMS4xNjk0NDU5NDA0LjAuMC4w">Prompt-tuning</a> allows a company with limited data to tailor a massive model to a narrow task, with the potential to reduce computing and energy use without having to retrain an AI model.</p>



 Advancing and supporting AI for business 



<p>The IBM watsonx AI and data platform is built for business, designed to help more individuals in your organization scale and accelerate the impact of AI with your trusted data. As AI technologies advance, the watsonx architecture is designed to smoothly integrate new business-targeted foundation models such as those developed by IBM Research, and to accommodate third-party models such as those provided on the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/awb-hugging-face-and-ibm-working-together-in-open-source/">Hugging Face</a> open-source platform, while providing critical governance guardrails with the future release of watsonx.governance.</p>



<p>The watsonx platform is just one part of IBM’s generative AI solutions. With IBM Consulting clients can get help tuning and operationalizing models for targeted business use cases with access to the specialized generative AI expertise of more than 1,000 consultants.</p>

<p>As the pace and volume of digital business continue to increase, organizations are facing mounting pressure to accelerate the speed at which they do business. The ability to quickly respond to shifting customer and market dynamics has become key for contending with today’s growing digital economy.</p>



<p>In a survey run by IDC, a leading provider of global IT research and advice, 43% of technology leaders indicated that they were “planning to deliver innovative digital products and services at a faster pace.” [1]</p>



 Real-time intelligence helps improve responsiveness 



<p>To accelerate the speed of business, organizations should acquire the ability to access, interpret and act on real-time information about unique situations arising across the entire organization.</p>



<p>In the same survey run by IDC, 36% of IT leaders rated “using technology to achieve real-time decision-making” as critical to business success. [1]</p>



<p>The need to improve real-time decision-making is contributing to a growing demand for event-driven solutions and their ability to help businesses achieve continuous intelligence and situation awareness.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/event-driven-architecture">event-driven architecture</a> focuses on the publication, capture, processing and storage of events. When an application or service performs an action or undergoes a change, it publishes an event—a real-time record of that action or change. Those events can then be consumed and processed to help inform smarter decisions and trigger automations.</p>



 Putting business events to work 



<p>However, becoming an event-driven business involves more than just collecting events from applications and services. Streams of events need to be processed—by applying operations like filtering, aggregating, transforming or joining with other streams of events—to define a time-sensitive scenario that the business needs to detect.</p>



<p>To show this with an example, consider one stream of business events sourced from an order management system. This stream provides a persistent, real-time log of all orders received. Though this stream of events can be useful on its own, allowing us to detect any time a customer transacts and places an order, we can unlock more value by combining this with other streams of events to define a critical business scenario.</p>



<p>Now, consider processing this stream of events to filter it to new orders that have a value greater than $100 and are placed within 24 hours of a new customer account creation. Now, beyond just the notification of a transaction, we are detecting a key scenario that warrants action from the business—namely, an opportunity to foster new customer growth and loyalty. This was just one example, and business events can be collected from a wide variety of systems, applications, devices and services across an organization. But no matter the source, getting the most value out of events requires that we process and correlate streams of events together to define a business scenario. &nbsp;</p>



 Get started with IBM Event Automation 



<p>By putting events to work, companies can help teams proactively respond to key customer opportunities, issues or potential threats as they arise. They can also help quickly adjust to shifting market dynamics and external factors affecting business operations, like changes in levels of demand, costs and more.</p>



<p>And these benefits shouldn’t be available only to highly technical teams. By lowering the skills barrier to processing events, line-of-business teams can be empowered to define and detect time-sensitive situations. This is especially important as companies continue to grapple with the impact of the Great Resignation.</p>



<p>In a survey run by IDC, 45% of IT leaders reported “a general shortage of people with the right skills” as “the main reason vacancies are hard to fill” for their real-time use cases. [1]</p>



<p>IBM Event Automation’s event processing capability is designed to be intuitive and accessible by users across the business. With it, both business and IT teams can start working with events and defining business scenarios without writing code or being an expert in SQL.</p>

<p>Regular cleanup is part of all account administration and security best practices, not just for cloud environments. In our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/cloud-security-identify-inactive-identities/">blog post on identifying inactive identities</a>, we looked at the APIs offered by IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) and how to utilize them to obtain details on IAM identities and API keys. Some readers provided feedback and asked on how to proceed and act on identified inactive identities.</p>



<p>In response, we are going lay out possible steps to take. We show how to find and revoke existing privileges and what to consider. Moreover, we discuss how the different identity types can be removed from an account. We also provide some directions on how to script and possibly automate these administrative tasks:</p>



An inactive trusted profile before it is removed from access groups.



 Recap: Inactive identities 



<p>IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) supports <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-identity-overview">different forms of identities</a>. They include users and service IDs—both with associated API keys—as well as trusted profiles. When such an identity or an associated API key has not been used to authenticate for a set time, it is considered inactive.</p>



<p>IBM Cloud IAM provides <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-id-inactive-identities">functionality to create reports on inactive identities</a>. By default, identities are considered inactive when they haven’t logged in or been in use in 30 days. When creating a report by utilizing the API or an SDK, you can specify other time frames (e.g., 90 days).</p>



<p>Inactive identities pose a security risk because they might be no longer maintained and be easier to attack. To improve security, you should revoke access privileges from inactive identities and maybe even entirely remove them from the cloud account.</p>



<p>There is, however, an operational risk with special identities that are only used for quarterly or annual processing (which, in our opinion, is bad security design). If cleaned up, their associated tasks may fail. This scenario could be addressed by keeping tabs on how inactive identities and their privileges are cleaned up.</p>



 Automated cleanup 



<p>Acting on discovered inactive identities could be done manually, but should be automated for efficiency and improved security. Both manual and automated cleanup could follow a process like this:</p>



 
 Generate and retrieve a <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-id-inactive-identities">report on inactive identities</a> for the desired date range. 



 Check the reported identities against a list of exempted IDs. 



 Loop over each non-exempted identity and <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-access-groups#remove-member-from-all-access-groups">remove it from all IBM Cloud IAM access groups</a>. Also, make sure that no <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-policy-management#list-v2-policies">directly granted permissions</a> exist. 



 Go over found <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-identity-token-api#delete-api-key">API keys and delete them</a>. 
 



<p>For all steps, log the findings and actions taken for audit and improvements.</p>



<p>Depending on your corporate policies, you might want to clean up monthly or quarterly. When <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-identity-token-api#create-report">triggering the report generation</a> in the first step, you can specify the duration (the range in hours) for what to consider as inactive. To avoid the risk of shutting down important identities, you should maintain a list or database with identities that are excluded from cleanup (Step 2 above). That list could also be used to distinguish between different policies like monthly or quarterly checks.</p>



<p>When processing each found inactive identity (e.g., users, service IDs, trusted profiles), it is fairly easy to revoke assigned privileges. IBM Cloud IAM provides a <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-access-groups#remove-member-from-all-access-groups">REST API with a DELETE to remove an IAM identity from all associated access groups</a> (Step 3 above, see screenshot below).</p>



<p>If following best practices, permissions should only be assigned through access groups and not directly. You can verify this rule by retrieving the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-policy-management#list-v2-policies">list of directly granted privileges for the IAM identity</a>. If such a privilege (access management policy) is found, there is an <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-policy-management#delete-v2-policy">API to delete that policy</a> (Step 3). You can see our blog post “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-cloud-security-how-to-clean-up-unused-access-policies/">IBM Cloud security: How to clean up unused access policies</a>” for additional information.</p>



<p>The report on inactive identities also includes a section on API keys. API keys are associated with either a user or service ID. The question is how soon to clean them up by <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-identity-token-api#delete-api-key">deleting the API key</a>. Similar to removing privileges from an identity, deleting an associated API key may break applications. Decide what is best for your cloud environment and meets corporate standards.</p>



<p>The above cleanup steps can be scripted and run manually. You could also automate the cleanup by taking an approach similar to what we describe in this <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/data-scraping-made-easy-thanks-to-ibm-code-engine-jobs/">blog post on automated data scraping</a>. Use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine">IBM Cloud Code Engine</a> with a cron subscription to trigger execution on set dates or intervals:</p>



Remove an IAM identity from all access groups.



 Users, service IDs and trusted profiles 



<p>Above, we discussed how to revoke privileges from inactive identities. To further clean up the account and enhance security, you should consider deleting unused service IDs and trusted profiles and removing users from the account. Those actions could be a follow-up after stripping permissions—when it is clear that those identities no longer are needed. Additionally, you could periodically <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/user-management#list-users">list all users</a> and check <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/user-management#user-states">their states</a>. Remove users from your account that have an invalid, suspended or (kind of) deleted state.</p>



<p>IBM Cloud has API functions to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/user-management#remove-user">remove a user from an account</a>, to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-identity-token-api#delete-service-id">delete a service ID and its associated API keys</a> and to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-identity-token-api#delete-profile">delete a trusted profile</a>.</p>



 Conclusions 



<p>Regular account cleanup is part of account administration and security best practices, not just for cloud environments. In our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/cloud-security-identify-inactive-identities/">blog post on identifying inactive identities</a>, we looked at the APIs offered by IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) and how to utilize them to obtain details on IAM identities and API keys.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we discussed an approach on how to automatically clean up privileges that were granted to now inactive identities. It is important to note that some housekeeping in the form of (audit) logs and a list of exempted identities is needed to keep your apps and workloads running. In that sense, do it, but don’t overdo it.</p>

			 Ali Naci Arbak is a Senior Software Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>I’m Ali. I was born in 1997 and currently reside in Istanbul, where I work as a software developer at Tokeny. My journey into programming began during my primary school years when I aspired to create my own game modes. Determining my career path at a young age made things easier. As I entered high school, I made the decision to fully commit to programming, kickstarting my career with freelance projects. Since then, I have worked in various domains and technologies, and my ongoing journey has now led me to blockchain.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>A few years ago, I had no experience with blockchain, but some friends and I decided to start a project using blockchain technology. We began developing smart contracts, and I became really interested in it. That’s when I decided to explore opportunities in this field and started researching blockchain companies. My main criteria were finding a company that was solving real-world problems with meaningful products. Tokenization is crucial in bringing blockchain to the financial industry, and Tokeny is a leader in providing the technology for it. It seemed like a perfect fit for me 😊.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>One thing that stood out to me during the interviews was that everyone was sincere and clear. I didn’t hear any empty buzzwords, which I appreciated. Now that I am an employee, my experience with internal communication has been just as good. We’re a team that works well together, and it’s easy to reach out to anyone for help when needed.</p>
<p>Our product is based on cutting-edge technology, so there’s a lot of room for learning and self-improvement. On top of that, since blockchain is a field that’s always evolving, we have the chance to help shape industry standards. We’ve already made progress with the ERC-3643 protocol, and I believe we’ll achieve even more with ONCHAINID and the new solutions we’re developing. It’s truly exciting to be a part of all this.</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream is that people can work when they want, where they want, and how much they want, rather than working out of necessity. They should have the time and freedom to pursue their personal goals and fulfillment. This dream may not be a reality today, but with the progress of artificial intelligence and automation, it might be achievable in the future, perhaps a century from now. Of course, this depends on how well we distribute resources fairly and justly.</p>
<p>When the technical limitations are no longer an issue, and human labor in production becomes less necessary, I’d like to see where humanity goes.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>What excites me about Tokeny’s future is the potential of tokenization to become increasingly prevalent in financial markets and everyday life as time goes on. Having entered the industry during its early stages and contributed to solutions, I believe that we can play a crucial role in this development and make significant contributions to the adoption of blockchain in the industry.

 Introducing WalletConnect V2: Discover the New Upgrades 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in September 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>At Tokeny, we’re firm believers that accelerating mass adoption doesn’t mean drowning issuers and users in the complexities of blockchain. It’s about offering a user-friendly experience that mirrors the platforms and interfaces they already know.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we’ve integrated blockchain wallets in a way that’s transparent to the end user. Moreover, we’re thrilled to support connections to third-party protocols, like WalletConnect, opening doors to a broader spectrum of blockchain applications.</p>
<p>For those new to it, WalletConnect is a protocol enabling users to link their blockchain wallets to decentralized applications (DApps) via a straightforward QR code scan — all without exposing their private keys.</p>
<p>With protocols like WalletConnect, Tokeny’s platform readies and verifies the blockchain transaction, then forwards the prepped transaction to the selected wallet provider. This allows customers to review and authorize it.</p>
<p>Here’s a practical guide for clarity:</p>
<p>Background context: Investor 1 has invested in company X and stores their shares in a self-custody wallet on their computer. MetaMask is an example of a popular wallet.</p>
<p>Step 1: The investor holds their shares in their self-custody wallet that is connected to Tokeny’s platform</p>
<p>Step 2: The investor is seeking liquidity and sees that a certain decentralized exchange is an eligible platform to sell/swap their shares</p>
<p>Step 3: The investor goes to the decentralized exhange’s website, receives the QR code then scans the QR code directly from Tokeny which creates a secure ‘bridge’ between Tokeny and the decentralized exchange</p>
<p>Step 4: Once the secure connection is established, the investor is prompted to confirm the transaction details on their self-custody wallet, ensuring that the correct amount and share type are being transacted</p>
<p>Step 5: After verifying the transaction details, the investor confirms the sale or swap on their wallet</p>
<p>Step 6: The decentralized exchange processes the transaction, updating both the exchange’s ledger and Tokeny’s platform to reflect the new status of the investor’s shares</p>
<p>Here is a visual representation of what it could look like:</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Excitingly, WalletConnect’s team has elevated the experience even further. They’ve recently launched V2, and we’re elated to declare our successful migration, making the new updates accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>Here’s a glimpse into V2’s enhanced offerings:</p>
 
 Multi-Chain Support: Embracing all EVM-compatible blockchains and more 
 Increased Session Duration Times: Enhance stability with prolonged session durations, minimizing disconnections 
 Improved User Experience: While the interface’s visuals remain consistent, users will notice a swifter, more dependable, and streamlined experience 
 
<p>With these upgrades, our users and investors can seamlessly connect to a wide range of supported blockchain applications using WalletConnect, all directly from their self-custody wallet.</p>
<p>We continuously refine our tech stack and integrations to provide an unparalleled tokenization platform for the future of finance to ultimately benefit all of our users.</p>
<p>Thank you for staying updated with us. Looking forward to next month’s edition!</p>

  <p>A Zero Trust breach prevention strategy based on user risk is critical for organizations in today's digital landscape. However, managing user risks in hybrid environments has posed several challenges. Today, we’re making it easier to manage user risk in hybrid environments in Microsoft Entra ID Protection (formerly Azure AD Identity Protection) – on-premises password change can now automatically remediate user risk!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we recommend mastering password changes in Entra ID to take advantage of Password Protection, hybrid customers who do password changes on-premises found it challenging to enable user risk policies. Users would get blocked when becoming risky and could not self-remediate by resetting passwords on-premises because the password change wasn’t visible to Entra ID, and so couldn’t dismiss the risk. This has resulted in a build-up of users marked at risk who may or may not have changed their passwords on-prem, making it challenging for some customers to take advantage of Entra ID Protection signals, and to leverage risk-based policies to protect their hybrid tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, we’re introducing the new setting called "Allow on-premises password change to reset user risk" in Entra ID Protection. Customers that have Password Hash Synchronization enabled on their tenants can now enable this setting. When enabled, users’ risks will be automatically remediated when their passwords are changed on-premises, and customers can confidently deploy user risk policy to effectively protect their hybrid users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change settings to allow on-premises password changes to reset user risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enhancement empowers our customers with two main advantages:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Efficient Remediation: With this capability, risky hybrid users can efficiently self-remediate without manual interventions from administrators, reducing the administrative burden. When a password is changed on-premises, user risk will be automatically remediated within Entra ID Protection, bringing the user to a safe state. 
 Proactive Security: Organizations can now proactively deploy user risk policies that require password changes to confidently protect their hybrid users and environments. This proactive approach strengthens your organization's security posture, simplifies security management with access control policies while ensuring that user risks are promptly addressed, even in complex hybrid environments. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable the “Allow on-premises password change to reset user risk” setting today in <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/IdentityProtectionMenuBlade/~/OverviewNew">Identity Protection - Microsoft Entra admin center</a> and visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock">Remediate risks and unblock users in Azure AD Identity Protection - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are committed to continually improving our services to provide the best security solutions. Thank you for trusting Entra ID Protection.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Hi everyone. Welcome to our latest vlog. My name is Rob MacDonald. I’m vice president of product marketing here at 1Kosmos, and I’m joined today by Mike Engle. Mike, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Doing great. Thanks for having me, Rob. I’m a co-founder here at 1Kosmos, and excited to be here on this Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Listen, it’s always good to sit down and chat with you. Today, we’re going to talk a little bit about the latest cyber attack that we’ve seen come across the newswire this week. MGM, I think being part of the high-tech world, we’ve all been to Vegas for various different events. I know that I’ve stayed in a couple of MGM resorts. Mike, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your initial thoughts on it and explain what happened?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Well, sadly, this has happened countless times over the past couple of years. This one was a bad actor getting in through the front door by coercing some type of help desk to give out a credential. The rumor has it that the bad guy found out about employee information on LinkedIn. You’re Robert MacDonald, you work at 1Kosmos, and then use that information to engage with the help desk to figure out how to trick the help desk into giving them something they shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
I think the hack is something referred to as vishing.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
You’ve touched, just kind of quickly on that just now. Why don’t you tell us a little bit about what vishing is and the concept behind that, and why it’s become so significant in terms of a cybersecurity threat over the last little while?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
There’s a couple of ishings out there.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Lots of ishings.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
I think we all know phishing very well because we’ve been using email for so long. That’s P-H-I-S-H-I-N-G, right? Well, vishing is using your voice, using a phone call or voiceover IP call to reach out to somebody and pull information from them or convince them to do something. So it’s similar. In emails, you get an email. You’re tricked into clicking a link or changing a routing number. It’s really a similar concept, just a different medium. There’s other terms for SMS phishing, I think that’s called smishing or… I can’t keep up with all the issues, but they’re all the same basic principle.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
All fun terms, just they have pretty serious consequences behind them. Listen, MGM’s not a small organization, they’re worth billions with a B. Do you find it surprising, and again, not to pick on MGM, but do you find it surprising something like this happened and that they were vulnerable to an attack such as this?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
It’s surprising that they got impacted as badly as they did. I’m not surprised that it happened because people are fallible. It’s just things are going to happen. Could I accidentally leave my super trusted authenticator and something sitting somewhere by accident? Of course. You could leave the bank vault open by mistake. But what surprised me is that it took them, I think it was 12 days to get back in operational, and that’s, I don’t know, some serious business continuity challenges that they had there, so that part is really surprising.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
What did they need to do to get back online? I’m assuming there was ransomware or something along those lines. Can you tell me a little bit about what happened there and maybe what some of the consequences are?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
I don’t have details. I just heard about 15 hours ago that they’re back to being pretty fully operational, so that’s in the 12th day or 10 plus days, and I didn’t hear that they paid the ransom. Caesars, on the other hand, paid double-digit millions of dollars to get their systems put back online. MGM must have decided not to do that, which you’re not supposed to, because it encourages the bad behavior.</p>
<p>But that means the bad guys locked up all of their data that made their systems not work and would not give it back. Now MGM was forced to go to probably backups or alternate data centers to try to get things back online, so that’s the recovery process that needs to happen.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
That’s interesting because I think the Caesars happened on the very same day as the MGM one from what I can recall. Listen, how can organizations better prepare themselves against a social engineering attack like vishing or phishing or any of the other ishings in the future?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
I mean, it’s really, a lot of it is user education, so there’s security awareness training and monitoring too. If you monitor those help desk calls and then the subsequent actions that happen. There’s all kinds of InfoSec things that companies typically do. You test your systems regularly, etc.</p>
<p>But one of the things that struck me about this is they said the organization did use multifactor authentication. Username, password, plus some type of one-time code, etc. and they bypassed that as well. There’s probably an opportunity to shore up that part of the vector and provide some options there that might be a little harder for bad guys to get their hands on.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
For sure. Now, one of the things that pops up over your shoulder every now and again is, know who’s behind the device.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
What? Really?</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Look at that.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Coincidentally. How could knowing who’s behind the device help companies like MGM prevent these types of attacks?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
It sounds so simple. Know who it is, but digitally, that’s not easy to do, but something we’ve gotten really good at here at 1Kosmos obviously. Flip the script a little bit. Bad actor calls the help desk says, “I’m Bob Smith,” and the help desk pushes a button that says, prove it. Not tell me about your first day of employment or the amount of your last direct deposit. All that stuff is stealable. Or fetch me this thing over there.</p>
<p>But what if they had to look into a camera and match Bob’s photo? Now you’ve upped the game quite a bit. Bad actor in this case, sitting behind their computer in Eastern Europe or wherever it was they were. I don’t want to pick on Eastern Europe, I love the place. But now that’s a much harder attack. Now they have to do deep fakes, or there’s all kinds of other things that takes it to another level. That’s something that we’re seeing more companies have a lot of interest in, is a way to reach out and prove who it is that’s there.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Awesome. Again, not to pick on MGM or even Caesars for that matter, or any organization that runs into an issue like this because it is pretty serious. But what lessons can we take from this, that organizations or individuals can learn from what happened at MGM, for what happened at Caesars from a cyber attack standpoint to enhance their cybersecurity practices going forward?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
First is always keep your resume current. I think understanding the gaps in the authentication controls and the reset password, reset controls are a big deal. I’ll give you an example. What if my authenticator, which many people use mobiles, they’re very secure, but there’s ways now for the authentication data on here to replicate to my cloud, to iCloud or Google Cloud. If that happens, you’re exposing now the organization or whatever you’re logging into to the cloud security. It’s only as secure then as my Google Cloud password in that example.</p>
<p>There are some rumors that they might’ve had that type of exposure. But in general, understanding that whole process of proving who you are to a help desk and ensuring that you truly know who is behind the device is one of the most important steps. Of course, training and business having really good backups and testing them regularly and stuff is other things that lots of other companies do as well.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Speaking of which, I have training I have to do today.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, get busy or you get yelled at.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
For our own certification. Mike, I appreciate you coming by to tell us a little bit about the latest breach, and I look forward to having another vlog with you again sometime soon. Thanks everybody.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Let’s do that. Thank you very much.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF56 rewards. DF57 runs Sep 28 — Oct 05,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 56 (DF56) has completed. 150K OCEAN was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Sep 21, 2023 and ended 12:01am Sep 28. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>DF57 is live today, Sep 28. It concludes on Oct 05. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF57   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF57 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Extrimian y zkSync se asocian para llevar QuarkID y la identidad digital auto-soberana y descentralizada a los ciudadanos de Buenos Aires. 
 
 
 La iniciativa pionera permitirá a los ciudadanos reclamar la propiedad de sus documentos y datos personales y brindar mayor seguridad y privacidad. 
 
 
 QuarkID, un protocolo de identidad digital de código abierto (open source), utilizará zkSync Era para empoderar a los usuarios y garantizar la privacidad. 
 
 
 La colaboración establece a la Ciudad de Buenos Aires como líder en la adopción de tecnologías blockchain para el beneficio de sus ciudadanos. 
 
 
 El proyecto tiene como objetivo expandirse a nivel nacional, beneficiando a más de 45 millones de personas en Argentina. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://quarkid.com">QuarkID </a>&nbsp;es el protocolo de Identidad Digital Descentralizado anclado en <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync </a>Era, desarrollado por <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian</a>, e impulsado por el Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires y otras empresas con gran experiencia en tecnologías descentralizadas, y seguridad de datos. Esta iniciativa&nbsp;busca poner el poder de los datos en manos de los ciudadanos.<br>
</p>
<p>El principal protocolo de Identidad Descentralizada de América Latina se asocia con zkSync para transformar la Identidad Digital en la región, empezando por la Ciudad de Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>En el siempre cambiante panorama de la tecnología blockchain, la búsqueda de mil millones de usuarios sigue siendo un objetivo constante. Entonces, ¿Qué tecnología o casos de uso deberíamos impulsar para lograr mayor adopción de la tecnología Blockchain?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Y es que, teniendo en cuenta las necesidades de privacidad y seguridad digital debido al incremento de cibercrimen y robo de identidad que está sucediendo en estos tiempos, un sistema de identidad y verificación de datos privados que ponga al usuario en el centro, es imperioso.</p>
<p>En el corazón de la ética de Web3 se encuentra la soberanía personal, un principio que se extiende mucho más allá de los activos financieros para abarcar aplicaciones más amplias y prácticas. Hoy, nos complace anunciar una iniciativa innovadora en esta dirección: la identidad digital de propiedad ciudadana. Buenos Aires, Argentina, está lista para liderar la carga, introduciendo gradualmente soluciones de identidad Web3 impulsadas por las propiedades centradas en la privacidad de zkSync Era.</p>
<p>En el esfuerzo por llevar las soluciones de identidad Web3 al escenario global, es imperativo que la privacidad siga siendo una preocupación primordial en las tecnologías que permiten la propiedad de datos personales. Un mundo descentralizado que descuida las consideraciones de privacidad va en contra de la esencia misma de Web3.</p>
<p>Visualizamos un futuro en el que la libertad personal y la identidad digital autónoma capaciten a las personas para administrar sus datos de manera segura.</p>
 Empoderando a los Ciudadanos de Buenos Aires con la Identidad Digital Descentralizada y Auto-Soberana. 
<p>Bajo la iniciativa de identificación basada en blockchain de Argentina, los ciudadanos obtendrán el control sobre sus documentos personales, datos de salud y, en el futuro, el procesamiento de pagos. Para construir la infraestructura de este programa transformador, Buenos Aires se ha asociado con QuarkID, un protocolo de identidad digital de código abierto desarrollado por Extrimian, la principal empresa de identidad descentralizada de América Latina. QuarkID utiliza zkSync Era como su protocolo ancla, alimentando las billeteras a través de las cuales los individuos reclamarán sus documentos.</p>
<p>“Esto marca un salto monumental hacia un futuro más seguro y eficiente para los servicios gubernamentales en América Latina”, afirma <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillevillanueva/">Guillermo Villanueva</a>, CEO de Extrimian. “QuarkID fomenta vínculos más estrechos entre los gobiernos y los ciudadanos al mismo tiempo que introduce prácticas de identidad digital y estándares de seguridad en América Latina”.</p>
<p>Los datos almacenados en las billeteras de QuarkID son autónomos, lo que permite a los ciudadanos controlar la entrega de sus credenciales al interactuar con servicios administrativos. zkSync Era sirve como capa de liquidación para QuarkID, asegurando que cada ciudadano participante mantenga la propiedad de sus credenciales legítimas.</p>
<p>Si bien QuarkID hace su debut en Buenos Aires, su arquitectura está diseñada para escalar globalmente. Cumpliendo con estándares internacionales como W3C, Trust Over IP y Sovrin Foundation, QuarkID es interoperable con redes de todo el mundo.</p>
 Aprovechando la Tecnología ZK para Empoderar a 650 Millones de Personas en América Latina 
<p>Si bien la identidad digital basada en blockchain promete un cambio revolucionario en la propiedad de datos, a menudo genera controversia en cuanto a la verdadera descentralización de estos procesos. Eventos recientes, como las preocupaciones del gobierno de Kenia sobre la privacidad de los datos en un proyecto de criptomoneda biométrica, resaltan estos problemas.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, la transparencia y la seguridad inherentes a la vanguardia de la tecnología de Conocimiento Cero (ZK), combinadas con Ethereum, tienen el potencial de disipar tales preocupaciones. Esta asociación desbloquea la aplicación de identidad digital preservadora de la privacidad para naciones enteras.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Con zkSync y Ethereum como columna vertebral de esta iniciativa, los datos personales almacenados en cadena mitigan el robo de identidad y los ataques de información personal comúnmente asociados con tecnologías centralizadas de almacenamiento de datos. zkSync garantiza que la propiedad digital sea confiable, sin necesidad de confianza y segura, al tiempo que prioriza la privacidad.</p>
<p>El gobierno argentino y la Ciudad de Buenos Aires tienen como objetivo establecer su marco de identidad digital como un bien público, lo que permite a las personas realizar transacciones de información de manera fluida entre el gobierno, las empresas y sus pares.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhfernandez/?locale=es_ES">Diego Fernandez</a>, Secretario de Innovación del Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, enfatiza: “Con este desarrollo, Buenos Aires se convierte en la primera ciudad de América Latina y una de las primeras en el mundo en integrar y promover esta nueva tecnología y establecer el estándar de cómo otros países de la región deberían utilizar la tecnología blockchain en beneficio de su gente”.</p>
<p>Lee esta <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/09/28/buenos-aires-government-blockchain-birth-certificate-zero-knowledge-proofs/">Nota a Diego Fernandez en Fortune Crypto</a> para conocer más sobre esta alianza y cómo se llevará a cabo.</p>
QuarkID protocolo de confianza digital descentralizado, y verificación de datos privados
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comenzando en octubre, los residentes de Buenos Aires podrán descargar una billetera QuarkID para reclamar documentos de identificación personal, incluyendo certificados de nacimiento y matrimonio. QuarkID estará disponible para todos los ciudadanos argentinos y eventualmente se convertirá en obligatorio en todo el país. En noviembre, documentos como comprobantes de ingresos y verificaciones académicas estarán disponibles para obtener en las billeteras de QuarkID. A fines de 2023, el gobierno establecerá la hoja de ruta futura de QuarkID y delineará los hitos de expansión para brindar inicialmente sus servicios a más de 3&nbsp;millones de ciudadanos.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires lidera esta iniciativa, marcando el comienzo de una nueva era de Internet a través de la propiedad digital. Esperamos que las naciones de todo el mundo vean a Argentina como un ejemplo de cómo la identidad Web3 puede prosperar a nivel gubernamental.</p>

<p>Modern application environments need real-time automated <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> to have visibility and insights into what is going on. Because of the highly dynamic nature of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a> and the numerous interdependencies among application components, having an automated approach to observability is essential. That’s why traditional solutions like New Relic struggle to keep up with monitoring in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> environments.&nbsp;</p>



 Automation in observability is a requirement 



<p>When an application is not performing properly, customers are unhappy and your business can suffer. If your observability platform relies on manual instrumentation or configuration, you will undoubtedly suffer the consequences of slower resolution of incidents, visibility gaps and a lack of understanding of your application environments.&nbsp; That’s why automation is an essential component of any observability solution.</p>



<p>Installation and setup are crucial components of any modern, automated observability platform. If you are a New Relic user, you know that it requires manual instrumentation and configuration. In fact, New Relic requires you to deploy a custom “application” to facilitate the full use of their analytics tool. New Relic users must change the configuration files and update the code, depending on the technology being monitored.&nbsp; New Relic also uses different agents for different technologies and requires multiple agents per host. All of this requires manual effort and takes considerable time and resources to install, set up and continuously maintain New Relic monitoring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you have to manually configure instrumentation, chances are you’ll leave visibility gaps because you can’t possibly know all the interdependencies between application services and infrastructure components. Further, manually configuring any of those connections and relationships requires time and resources. To handle modern applications and higher velocity development processes, you need a solution that maximizes visibility with the least amount of effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Automate installation and setup 



<p>Contrast that with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana">IBM Instana’s</a> automated, single-agent architecture that makes installation and setup a breeze. There’s no guessing which agent(s) need to be installed on which hosts. There’s no need to manually identify and configure interdependencies. Instana does all of that for you—automatically. It saves you time and effort and helps accelerate the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ci-cd-pipeline/">CI/CD pipeline</a>.</p>



 Instana goes even further to automate everything 



<p>IBM Instana automates every aspect of the performance monitoring lifecycle. It automates installation and configuration. It automates application discovery. It automates dashboards. It automates profiling. It automates alerts, troubleshooting and change detection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does your current observability solution automate all of those things? If not, you need to consider IBM Instana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Instana not only captures every performance metric in real-time, it automates tracing every single user request and profiles every process. It combines the data from metrics, traces, events and profiles, making it available (in context) to the people who need it. So when a problem occurs, Instana automatically identifies the slowest service or component of the causal event. And with one-second metric granularity, Instana can detect issues that others, including New Relic, might miss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For troubleshooting in complex environments, automated root-cause analysis is a requirement. Instana streamlines the troubleshooting process by employing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> algorithms, anomaly detection techniques and predictive analytics to automatically identify potential trouble patterns that would likely be missed by human operators. By automating the analysis work, Instana can reduce the time required to identify the root cause of an incident and improve the accuracy of detection, leading to faster resolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Instana even automates remediation actions with the Instana Action Catalog™, allowing you to build custom actions or reuse existing automation inventories like Ansible or PagerDuty. These actions can be linked with Instana events and will then be visible to each event instance as a potential action to run. The Action Catalog lets you run actions manually or automatically and can leverage <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to get recommended actions to run based on event context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instana’s sensors automatically collect changes, metrics and events. Instana delivers&nbsp;high-fidelity data in monitoring, with unmatched granularity (one-second) and high cardinality—capturing an end-to-end trace of each and every request. When it comes to proactive, automated health monitoring, each sensor has an out-of-the-box curated knowledge base of health signatures that are evaluated continuously against the incoming metrics and are used to raise issues or incidents depending on user impact.&nbsp;A component’s health is determined by applying machine learning and preset health rules.</p>



<p>Instana’s automatic, full-stack visibility spans across the entire monitoring lifecycle. From the single, self-monitoring and auto-updating agent to the automatic and continuous discovery, deployment, configuration and dependency mapping, Instana fills the gaps that many APM tools, like New Relic, don’t. With zero-configuration dashboards, alerting, troubleshooting and remediation, Instana relieves teams from manual and time-consuming processes.</p>

 IDCheck.io is now certified by the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. Here’s why it’s important. 



 



<p>It’s been over a year since the UK government released its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-alpha-version-2">Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> (DIATF) – a set of rules and standards for digital identity providers to follow. The Framework gives an authoritative jab to the concept of digital identity verification in the UK, or at least that’s what the UK government hopes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the UK market still lags significantly behind some of its European counterparts, digital identity verification has the potential to optimize the user experience and improve business efficiencies in hundreds of use cases across the UK’s public and private sector. From account opening in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">banking</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>, age verification in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a>, automated check-in processes in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel</a>, financial risk checks in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gambling</a>, and contract signing in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">telecommunication</a>. The UK government has decided to start off with the release of guidelines and requirements for a few initial use cases: Right to Work, Right to Rent, and DBS Checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is understandable, considering the UK’s government services are the area perhaps most in need of a digital update, as anyone who has recently tried to update their <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dwp-please-dont-hang-up-i-want-to-top-up-my-state-pension-b0wjznrt6">National Insurance contributions</a> can attest. In fact, there are almost <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/blair-institute-its-possible-to-transform-uk-public-services-with-digital-id">200 different ways</a> for people to access local and national government services in the United Kingdom, with a head-scratching 44 different sign-in methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leading by example, in February 2022, the UK government rolled outs its GOV.uk One Login digital identity app. By June 2023, <a href="https://www.thinkdigitalpartners.com/news/2023/06/27/gov-uk-one-login-rolling-out-across-government/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork">eight government departments</a> were using the digital identity service, with more than 1.5 million verified identities issued. The government has pledged that by the end of 2024, most governmental services would be available via the one platform.</p>

 Why the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework is important. 



<p>With the release of the Framework, the journey toward a brave new digital world in the UK has once again begun, but this time with more confidence, direction, and sense of collective buy-in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although it’s unlikely the British public will ever actually know what the Framework is, they will undoubtedly benefit from the guidelines and best practices contained therein, for example, whenever they open bank accounts, sign contracts, or join a gaming or crypto platform. As such, the Framework will be pivotal when&nbsp;businesses decide which identity service provider to choose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to become certified, providers are required to adhere to rules and requirements in the following areas:</p>



 1. Ensuring products and services are inclusive 



<p>Providers should ensure everyone can use their products and services, regardless of who they are or where they’re from. Offering a wide range of accepted identity documents is key.</p>



 2. Privacy and data protection 



<p>Providers must follow data protection legislation and ensure users can easily find out why providers are collecting personal data; what it will be used for; and who it might be shared with. Providers must also receive user agreements, and let users access and update their personal data at any point.</p>



 3. Fraud management 



<p>Providers must follow best practice guidance on fraud management, from, for example the <a href="https://www.cipfa.org/policy-and-guidance">Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy</a>. They must also be able to regularly monitor threats and fraud, and have a way of identifying, notifying, and supporting a user whose identity, attribute or account has been compromised. They must also engage in regular fraud reporting, and a way to look for suspicious activity.</p>



 4. Security 



<p>Providers must have an information management system that follows an industry standard, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-gmbh-iso-iec-27001-certification/">ISO/IEC 27001:2017</a>, and adhere to the principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p>



 5. Future-proof 



<p>Choosing a DIATF-certified identity verification provider is a sure-fire way of futureproofing your digital identify proofing offering in the UK market, even for use cases other than the three currently available.</p>



<p>As certification against the Framework requires a thorough assessment against Home Office requirements, users of any certified identity verification provider’s services can rest assured that they meet the requisite standards of safety and security regarding customers’ personal data.&nbsp;Equally as important are the guardrails it plants in UK infrastructure to ensure sustainable growth and widespread adoption of digital identity in the UK.</p>

 Fully automated IDCheck.io passes guidelines for government use cases in the UK 



<p>London, September 28, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, has received the accreditation on the levels medium and high for the UK’s Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) for its fully automated, AI-based solution IDCheck.io. Valid for two years, IDnow received this badge from <a href="https://www.accscheme.com/services/identity-assurance/digital-identity-systems-certification">government-accredited Digital Identity Systems Certification</a>.</p>



<p>The DIATF is a set of rules and standards designed by the UK government to establish trust in digital identity products coupled with proper governance on how identity service providers (IDSPs) should verify claimed identities via remote methods. Currently, the Framework sets out guidelines and requirements for a few use cases, namely “Right to Work”, “Right to Rent”, and “Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Checks”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Handling identity data in a secure and consistent way</p>



<p>To become certified under <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/diatf-certified-framework-identity-verirification-provider/">DIATF</a>, IDnow was required to adhere to specific rules and requirements. For instance, the identity proofing provider had to ensure that IDCheck.io is inclusive by offering a wide range of accepted identity documents. Certified providers must also follow data protection legislation and ensure that users can easily find out why and how their personal data is stored. Additionally, IDnow was required to have an information management system (IMS) in place that follows a recognized industry standard, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-gmbh-iso-iec-27001-certification/">ISO/IEC 27001</a>. </p>



<p>Finally, the accreditation confirms that IDnow follows best practice fraud management guidelines including regular fraud reporting. Under DIATF, IDnow is able to monitor threats and fraud regularly, and has a way to identify, notify, and assist a user whose identity, attribute, or account has been compromised. </p>



<p>Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow, explains: “In the UK, there has historically been a sense of caution in how an individual’s data is being stored and used. This extends to concern in the systems’ privacy, security, and governance. The Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework should act as a wakeup call for all service providers to prepare for the next generation of digital identity proofing solutions in the UK”.</p>



<p>“The Framework can go a long way to encourage UK businesses to implement digital identity solutions by enabling smoother, more secure online transactions that lead to higher conversion. This will instill trust and save businesses considerable time and money. Because of these benefits, there are likely to be many more use cases across multiple industries released in the coming years. With the accreditation for our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">AI-powered IDCheck.io solution</a>, we are ready for these developments on the UK market”, she adds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Accelerate threat detection and response (TDR) using AI-powered centralized log management and security observability</p>



<p>It is not news to most that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack?">cyberattacks</a> have become easier to launch and harder to stop as attackers have gotten smarter and faster. For those defending against cyberthreats, things continue to get more complicated. The list of challenges is long: cloud <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface">attack surface</a> sprawl, complex application environments, information overload from disparate tools, noise from false positives and low-risk events, just to name a few. The burden is further exacerbated for the many organizations that struggle with overstretched cyberteams, manual processes, and a chronic cybersecurity skills gap.</p>



<p>The average <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">cost of a data breach</a> set a new record in 2023 of USD 4.45 million, and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index</a> revealed a threat landscape with a predominance of extortion-motivated attacks and signs of increased collaboration between cybercriminal groups. On the bright side, data also shows that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> can improve security readiness and speed response to attacks, to help dramatically shrink the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-breach">data breach</a> window before causing real harm.</p>



<p>Greater visibility and speed are core requirements for effective cybersecurity. Security leaders must proactively address the expanding attack surface and bolster their threat detection and response (TDR) strategy to significantly reduce the risk of costly data breaches.</p>



 A pragmatic approach to security operations is long overdue&nbsp; 



<p>Now, more than ever, security observability and threat detection and response workflows require purpose-built solutions designed for cloud scale and automation.</p>



<p>Over the years, an overwhelming surplus of security-related data and alerts from the rapidly expanding cloud digital footprint has put an enormous load on security solutions that need greater scalability, speed and efficiency than ever before. Legacy systems and architectures led to unsustainable costs of data ingestion, analysis, and storage, as well as performance issues when searching and analyzing threats across massive datasets.</p>



<p>A modern log management platform, optimized for security and compliance use cases, can be vital to modernizing security operations, improving security readiness and reducing risk in a more cost-effective way. This pragmatic approach can be the right measure for organizations:</p>



 
 Looking for a scalable and cost-efficient solution to meet compliance and foundational threat detection and investigation needs, 



 Lacking the staff and expertise to use and benefit from more complex security solutions, such as SIEMs, 



 Needing faster and more efficient search of huge datasets across disparate data sources in order to better support threat hunting and analytics requirements. 
 



 Log management and observability for the modern SOC is finally here 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/qradar-log-insights">IBM Security QRadar Log Insights</a> is a log management and security observability platform that is AI-powered and purpose-built to meet the needs of modern security operations in a simple and cost-effective manner. Delivered as a service on AWS and available on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-p2llj6q6wlsq4">AWS Marketplace</a> as a built-in solution with quick onboarding and multiple integrations for fast time to value. Some examples include AWS IAM Identity Center, AWS Control Tower, and AWS Cloud Trail.</p>



<p>With QRadar Log Insights, SOC teams gain near real-time visibility into the organization’s digital footprint and respond fast empowered by:</p>



 
 New Unified Analyst Experience (UAX) across clouds and on-premises, 



 Extended threat hunting with “ingestionless” federated search and embedded expertise, 



 Cloud-scale ingestion to pull all the data you need into one place, 



 Sub-second search speeds for faster threat hunting and analysis, 



 High-fidelity findings and insightful visualizations for efficient investigations. 
 



 Key use cases 



 Accelerate TDR with AI-powered unified analyst experience (UAX) 



<p>QRadar Log Insights provides a simplified and unified analyst experience so your security operations team can visualize and perform analytics using all your security-related data, regardless of the location or the type of data source. For instance, while investigating an incident, you can run a single search, at lightning speed, that checks for indicators of comprise (IoCs) and runs analytics on both your ingested data and data gathered by third-party tools in other clouds or on-premises. See some common sources in the screenshot below.</p>







<p>UAX provides a common interface and open language to access all security intelligence and collaborate with your team and community peers.</p>







<p>Capabilities included in QRadar Log Insights UAX:</p>



 
 Automated machine learning-based risk prioritization, 



 Self-learning noise reduction from past actions, 



 AI-powered automated investigation with built-in threat intelligence and recommended actions, 



 Sub-second search and analysis of large datasets, 



 Federated search that enables “ingestionless” threat search across disparate and third-party data sources, 



 End-to-end case management throughout the entire threat lifecycle, and 



 MITRE ATT&amp;CK mapping that shows the attack from an adversarial intent perspective. 
 







<p>In stark contrast with existing workflows, UAX provides a real gain in analyst productiveness, particularly with a large impact on organizations’ ability to fight threats. See below for an example of how much faster analysts can work with UAX.</p>







 Enable powerful threat hunting with embedded expertise 



<p>QRadar Log Insights’ UAX embedded intelligence and automation saves SOC teams significant time, which allows these teams to focus on higher-value tasks, such as proactive threat hunting.</p>



<p>Threat hunting is provided with <a href="https://research.ibm.com/projects/kestrel">Kestrel,</a>&nbsp; an open source threat hunting language that integrates lightning-fast federated search, threat intelligence, and analytics all in one engine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A visual builder simplifies the hunting experience with a library of command templates and in-context explanations and examples.</p>







<p>QRadar Log Insights’ AI model acts as a security analyst who knows exactly what to hunt for. The attack-path view shows which hosts and assets have been impacted, while the network activity view shows if data has leaked and lateral movement has happened where malicious actions have taken place.</p>



<p>When zero-days or attack campaigns rise, QRadar Log Insight provides a quick “Am I Affected” assessment of impact with timely IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence, closing skill gaps that could favor attackers when time matters the most. If you would like to know more about the “Am I Affected” feature and use cases, check out how to <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/security/blogs/gladys-koskas1/2023/06/19/detect-moveit-transfer-zero-day-with-qradarli">Detect MOVEit Transfer Zero-Day with QRadar Log Insights</a>.</p>







<p>Hunting playbooks can be created by threat hunting experts and saved for use by less experienced analysts. Integrated case management for identified threats helps streamline the collection of attack evidence and artifacts and keeps track of all response tasks.</p>



<p>With QRadar Log Insights, your team can easily develop threat hunting skills, identify threats that elude existing defenses, analyze the techniques being used, and strengthen protection against existing and emerging threats.</p>



 Get a fast track to clarity: Single view with near real-time visibility and interactive dashboards 



<p>QRadar Log Insights uses a modern open-source OLAP data warehouse, ClickHouse, which ingests, automatically indexes, searches and analyzes large datasets at sub-second speed. You get near real-time visibility and insights from your ingested data.</p>



<p>QRadar Log Insights rapidly ingests, analyzes and presents data in interactive, built-in dashboards designed by cybersecurity experts. The underlying search queries and source data is available at a click for deeper inspection. Its Kusto query language (KQL) is human-readable and intuitive, requiring no prior training.</p>







<p>Dashboards are fully customizable and come with a widget library and Grafana plugin for frictionless visualization of full-stack data across teams.</p>







 Manage security and compliance costs&nbsp; 



<p>Managing cost has become a top priority for any organization. The explosive growth of data used for security is resulting in unsustainable storage cost of legacy solutions. This is especially true for organizations in regulated markets that must retain data for longer periods of time to meet compliance requirements. To help meet such a wide range of storage needs and requirements, QRadar Log Insights supports hot, warm and cold storage.&nbsp; With flexible retention options, organizations can optimize data storage and better manage their costs.</p>



 Working faster and smarter is the only true option

				  Phishing attacks are all too common, and as a few casinos in Las Vegas are finding out, incredibly costly. As we continue to interact online, the only way to really stop these attacks is to have cryptographic confidence in who you are speaking with.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>The MGM Grand recently made headlines <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/09/15/mgm-casinos-still-reeling-from-cybersecurity-issue/">for all the wrong reasons.</a> A very public cyber attack wreaked havoc with slot machines, guests’ hotel room keys, and even elevators. For a brief summary, a group called <a href="https://cybernews.com/editorial/mgm-caesars-explained-scattered-spider/">Scattered Spider</a> was believed to be using a <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/">Ransomware-as-a-Service</a> (RaaS) made by <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/breaking-down-the-blackcat-ransomware-operation">BlackCat</a>. RaaS is an ongoing issue, allowing even new and inexperienced would-be criminals access to sophisticated tools. What’s more interesting, however, is how they got in: a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/mgm-grand-cyberattack-caused-by-10-minute-phone-call-1850834558">10-minute call with IT.</a></p>
<p>According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/general-information">90% of ransomware attacks</a> begin with phishing. It is a massive problem in our ever-online world, and many groups are very good at appearing to be someone you already know. Even “advanced” security measures like multi-factor authentication have proven to be less than effective at stopping all attacks. We need something new. We need real confidence in who we are talking to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#:~:text=A%20verifiable%20credential%20is%20a,certificates%2C%20and%20digital%20educational%20certificates.">Verifiable credentials</a> and <a href="https://didcomm.org">DIDComm</a> help establish this confidence. Unlike passwords and recovery questions / email recovery, verifiable credentials cannot be guessed, lost, stolen, or spoofed, and they can be presented to establish proof of identity, even on phone calls or chats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These technologies accomplish this by providing a fundamentally different approach to the ones we have used in the past: Rather than granting access to an account or resource through a shared secret, such as a password, verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and DIDComm create a secure connection in which participants can mutually authenticate each other’s identity through cryptography before sharing any information.</p>
<p>By using verifiable credentials to manage access to critical systems, casino staff can use the secure connection created by DIDComm to confirm that the person they are talking to is, in fact, the person they claim to be. The verification takes place in parallel with the phone conversation and is much harder to attack. After verification, both parties on the phone call can now be confident in the identity of each other, in spite of the lack of security of the phone call itself. While no solution is fully attack-proof, this approach will yield substantially increased security and a reduction in phishing attacks.</p>
<p>These casinos have lost income, time, and most importantly, the trust of their consumers,&nbsp; because of their inability to securely verify the identity of the person on the other end of the line. Situations like this are reminders that even the biggest of organizations, with expensive security systems, have holes in their defenses. As long as you rely on a human knowing who they are speaking with as a part of your security strategy — whether it be the average employee or security professional — they are liable to be fooled. We have the technology now to have cryptographic certainty in who we are interacting with. It’s on us to start using it.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about these new tools we would be happy to discuss them with you. Please feel free to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact the Indicio team</a> here.</p>

<p>Given the stunning success of the recent hacks at MGM and Caesars, it’s a safe bet what happened in Vegas won’t stay there for long. Even though technology to prevent such breaches is readily available, there’s every reason to believe large organizations in any number of sectors could soon face a rude awakening.</p>
<p>Success breeds success, after all. It also inspires copycats. The attacks on Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International in early September appear to have been perpetrated by a group of <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/9/15/23875113/mgm-hack-casino-vishing-cybersecurity-ransomware">teenagers and young adults</a> that employs simple social engineering techniques to infiltrate corporate systems for fun and serious profit.</p>
<p>Dubbed “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a25d2897-b0ce-4ba7-92ed-ff5df09d1b47">Scattered Spider</a>” by some security analysts and UNC3944 or “Muddled Libra” by others, the group of Gen-Z threat actors is believed to have pulled off a series of cryptocurrency heists before breaching and then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/09/22/mgm-hack-laid-to-star-fraud/">extorting Western Digital</a> and other technology firms over the past few years. Reuters reports the group has been implicated in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/power-influence-notoriety-gen-z-hackers-who-struck-mgm-caesars-2023-09-22/">52 attacks</a> spanning multiple industries worldwide since 2022.</p>
<p>Specifics in the casino breaches are still emerging. However, it appears that operatives in the MGM attack used <a href="https://specopssoft.com/blog/mgm-resorts-service-desk-hack/">LinkedIn</a> profile information to impersonate a resort employee in “vishing” calls to an outsourced IT support vendor, requesting access to the employee’s corporate accounts after getting “accidentally” locked out. After gaining entry, the hackers gained super administrator rights to MGM’s Okta environment. They even configured a second identity provider to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and impersonate highly privileged users within the corporate systems.</p>
<p>In a word: diabolical, especially for a group of suspected 17- to 22-year-olds. But as the Washington Post reports, Scattered Spider’s Vegas jackpot also represents a troubling new escalation in the group’s MO. The hackers threw the company into utter chaos by deploying crippling ransomware from notorious Russian cyber gang ALPHV into MGM’s systems. Ten days into the breach, MGM was <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/9/15/23875113/mgm-hack-casino-vishing-cybersecurity-ransomware">still struggling</a> to repair corporate email, restaurant reservation systems, hotel booking operations, slot machines, and digital keycard access at its Aria, Bellagio, and MGM Grand properties. There’s little reason to believe Scattered Spider isn’t already scouting new prey.</p>
 Gaming the System: Harvesting Passwords, Short-Circuiting MFA 
<p>Ransomware attacks are nothing new, of course. Last year, more than <a href="https://www.getastra.com/blog/security-audit/ransomware-attack-statistics/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20ransomware%20attacks%20per%20year%20is%20around%20620.5,(USD)%20annually%20by%202031.">620 million</a> ransomware attacks worldwide cost victims more than $30 billion. According to Verizon’s 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-train-employees-to-avoid-ransomware">74% of breaches</a> stem from credentials stolen through phishing, vishing, and SIM-swapping attacks.</p>
<p>Indeed, stolen passwords are implicated in up to <a href="https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/cyber-risk-and-cfos">$25 million</a> in average losses suffered by a third of all businesses that have fallen victim to cyberattacks over the last 36 months. When an ATO leads to a data breach, it can mean an average additional cost of <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/ransomware-and-data-breaches-impacts-continue-to-grow-louder">$9.5 million</a> per incident for US-based companies. ATOs account for more than $300 million in losses annually. And as WAPO points out, Scattered Spider and its Eastern European business partners could worsen matters in coming weeks.</p>
<p>For one thing, you have financially motivated, English-speaking hackers with a proven talent for pulling off <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mgm-and-caesars-hacked-by-scattered-spider-in-span-of-few-weeks-1.1971066">social engineering</a> and data exfiltration schemes. Now add the Russian “ransomware-as-a-service” operatives believed to be behind the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/10/colonial-pipeline-gas-oil-markets/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9">Colonial Pipeline</a> attack and an underworld network as technologically sophisticated as any modern enterprise.</p>
<p>Mix in plentiful targets with outsourced IT support and call center operations crewed by untrained, often short-term employees <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vishing+call+center&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=safari&amp;sca_esv=568238426&amp;biw=1279&amp;bih=1046&amp;tbm=nws&amp;ei=lssRZc73MLeTwPAPuZWKuAM&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOmpfGrMaBAxW3CRAIHbmKAjcQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=vishing+call+center&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LW5ld3MiE3Zpc2hpbmcgY2FsbCBjZW50ZXIyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMggQABiKBRiGAzIIEAAYigUYhgNIvSNQ9hFY3SJwAHgAkAEAmAHuBqABhiOqAQkzLTEuNS4yLjG4AQPIAQD4AQHCAgUQABiiBMICCBAAGIoFGJECwgIOEAAYigUYsQMYgwEYkQLCAgsQABiKBRixAxiDAcICCBAAGIAEGLEDwgILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwHCAgsQABiKBRixAxiRAsICBxAAGIAEGAqIBgE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-news">vulnerable to vishing</a>. And sprinkle in emerging, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fbi-hackers-are-having-a-field-day-with-open-source-ai-programs">AI-powered phishing</a> and vishing tactics and automated <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/can-singapore-become-a-passwordless-nation/">credentials-stuffing</a> technologies. Put it together, and far too many organizations in health care, telecom, government, financial services, and others <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/american-companies-too-vulnerable-to-attacks-like-mgm-hack-cybersecurity-expert-says/">may be vulnerable</a> to an emboldened Scattered Spider and copycat groups. The good news: Organizations can quickly deploy effective defenses. But they’d better move fast.</p>
 No More Rolling the Dice with Outdated Forms of MFA 
<p>According to a recent survey from <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/11/17/marketers-must-be-proactive-data-privacy-maintain-customer-trust">Google and Ipsos</a>, a successful data breach can erode customer trust by as much as 44%. As the MGM and Caesars breaches so vividly illustrate, legacy forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) won’t cut it anymore. Cybercriminal organizations like Scattered Spider have clearly developed inventive ways to acquire login credentials and circumvent things like one-time passcodes and limited biometric authentication systems designed to confirm the legitimate user is attempting to access their account.</p>
<p>The problem: Traditional forms of MFA are built around login passwords and a device instead of the identity of the person accessing an account. Even with Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) and Okta Verify Authenticator, anybody with administrative access can register things like user biometrics to any device they can access—or set up an alternative identity provider to bypass authentication measures altogether.</p>
<p>For some business applications, that may not be a significant risk. But it still leaves the door open to account compromise that puts IT and security teams in reactive mode against data breaches and ransomware after access to systems has already been granted. Fortunately, a new generation of strong, non-phishable biometric identity solutions is changing all that.</p>
 Enter: “Liveness”-based Biometric Authentication 
<p>With traditional forms of MFA becoming so unreliable as a means of identity verification, modern forms of biometric authentication are helping to set a new standard for security and convenience. Solutions certified to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a> , <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics-</a>, and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a> standards, for instance, use “live” biometric markers tied to a registered identity to provide reliable, strong authentication impervious to account takeover.</p>
<p>These modern biometric solutions offer machine-verified identity to government-issued credentials (driver’s license, state ID, passport, etc.) and enable non-phishable multi-factor authentication when users login to digital services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-mfa/">1Kosmos BlockID</a>, for instance, uses the private key of a matched public-private pair in the user’s device as a possession factor (ie, “what you have”), while a live facial scan becomes the “what you are” or inherent authentication element. To access a site, app, or system, a live image scan is compared to an image scan captured at the time of enrollment. If they match, the identity of the person of authentication is confirmed to be in fact, the authorized user—and not a bot, deep fake or imposter—with 99.9% accuracy.</p>
<p>This technology is widely available and supports a consistent onboarding and authentication experience into all apps, devices, systems, and environments—including existing privileged access management systems. Any organization can stop phishing, ransomware attacks, and data breaches before hackers can infiltrate accounts. Scattered Spider simply provided an urgent new reason to stop gambling with security now.</p>

<p>Today, we’re delving into another misconception about observability—the belief that it’s solely applicable to a specific part of your stack or application.</p>



<p>This misconception arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of observability’s core concept. By viewing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> as limited to one layer, it overlooks its holistic nature, which spans across all stack layers and their interconnections. By dispelling this myth, our goal is to illuminate observability’s essence as a comprehensive practice offering profound insights into the functionality and performance of entire systems.</p>



 Why is this a myth? 



<p>In modern software and system management, observability goes beyond focusing on just one part of the stack. It encompasses the entire system—from the application layer to the infrastructure layer and everything in between.</p>



<p>The myth likely stems from a narrow view that only monitoring one specific component, such as the application layer, is sufficient for understanding system behavior. However, this approach can overlook intricate interactions and dependencies between different parts of the stack.</p>



<p>True observability requires observing and analyzing data from all layers of the system, including application metrics, traces, and infrastructure telemetry. This comprehensive approach enables teams to uncover insights into how the entire system operates, identify performance bottlenecks, detect anomalies and, ultimately, deliver a more reliable and efficient experience for users.</p>



 Fact: Observability is applicable from mobile to mainframe 



<p>Observability is applicable across various platforms—including mobile, web, cloud and mainframe systems—because it encompasses a wide range of technologies and environments.</p>



<p>Let’s explore the technical details of how observability works in different technology stacks and why it should be adopted universally:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana/mobile-application-monitoring">Mobile applications</a>: Observability in mobile applications involves instrumenting code to capture relevant events, metrics and logs. It is achieved through observing real-time frameworks, performance-monitoring libraries and crash-reporting tools. By integrating observability mechanisms into mobile apps, developers can gain insights into user interactions, performance bottlenecks and errors, helping improve user experience and overall app quality. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana/website-monitoring">Web applications</a>: In web applications, observability revolves around capturing and analyzing data from different layers, such as frontend, backend and infrastructure. This includes logging HTTP requests, database queries, server response times and system resource utilization. By aggregating and analyzing this data using observability tools, teams can identify performance issues, detect errors and optimize application performance. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana/cloud-monitoring">Cloud-based services</a>: For cloud-based services, observability focuses on monitoring and analyzing distributed systems and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a> architectures. This involves capturing and correlating logs, metrics and traces across various components and services. Technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/distributed-tracing">distributed tracing</a> and service mesh enable end-to-end visibility, allowing teams to understand request flows, identify latency bottlenecks and troubleshoot issues across different service boundaries. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana/mainframe-monitoring">Mainframe systems</a>: Even in mainframe systems, observability plays a vital role. Monitoring tools and frameworks designed specifically for mainframes can capture metrics, transaction logs, and resource usage data. By leveraging observability in mainframes, organizations can gain insights into system performance, identify inefficiencies, and optimize resource allocation for critical business processes. 
 



 Why should observability be applicable to all parts of your stack? 



 
 Comprehensive system understanding: Observability provides a holistic view of the entire system stack, enabling teams to understand the interactions, dependencies and performance characteristics across different components and technologies. 



 Faster troubleshooting and debugging: Observability data helps teams quickly identify and resolve issues by providing granular insights into system behavior, allowing for efficient troubleshooting and debugging. 
 



 
 Proactive issue detection and prevention: With observability, organizations can detect anomalies, monitor key metrics and set up alerts to proactively identify and address potential issues—minimizing downtime and improving system reliability. 



 Improved customer experience: By leveraging observability across all platforms, organizations can continuously monitor user interactions, identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the customer experience, leading to higher satisfaction and retention rates. 
 



<p>Overall, embracing observability universally empowers organizations to gain actionable insights, enhance system performance and deliver better experiences across diverse technology stacks and environments.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) are <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models">foundation models</a> that use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), deep learning and massive data sets, including websites, articles and books, to generate text, translate between languages and write many types of content. There are two types of these generative AI models: proprietary large language models and open source large language models. </p>



 

 In this video, Martin Keen briefly explains large language models, how they relate to foundation models, how they work and how they can be used to address various business problems.



<p>Proprietary LLMs are owned by a company and can only be used by customers that purchase a license. The license may restrict how the LLM can be used. On the other hand, open source LLMs are free and available for anyone to access, use for any purpose, modify and distribute.</p>



<p>The term “open source” refers to the LLM code and underlying architecture being accessible to the public, meaning developers and researchers are free to use, improve or otherwise modify the model.</p>



 What are the benefits of open source LLMs? 



<p>Previously it seemed that the bigger an LLM was, the better, but now enterprises are realizing they can be prohibitively expensive in terms of research and innovation. In response, an <a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/05/08/open-source-llms-moats/">open source model</a> ecosystem began showing promise and challenging the LLM business model.</p>



 Transparency and flexibility 



<p>Enterprises that don’t have in-house machine learning talent can use open source LLMs, which provide transparency and flexibility, within their own infrastructure, whether in the cloud or on premises. That gives them full control over their data and means sensitive information stays within their network. All this reduces the risk of a data leak or unauthorized access.</p>



<p>An open source LLM offers transparency regarding how it works, its architecture and training data and methodologies, and how it’s used. Being able to inspect code and having visibility into algorithms allows an enterprise more trust, assists regarding audits and helps ensure ethical and legal compliance. Additionally, efficiently optimizing an open source LLM can reduce latency and increase performance.</p>



 Cost savings 



<p>They are generally much less expensive in the long term than proprietary LLMs because no licensing fees are involved. However, the cost of operating an LLM does include the cloud or on-premises infrastructure costs, and they typically involve a significant initial rollout cost.</p>



 Added features and community contributions 



<p>Pre-trained, open source LLMs allow fine-tuning. Enterprises can add features to the LLM that benefit their specific use, and the LLMs can also be trained on specific datasets. Making these changes or specifications on a proprietary LLM entails working with a vendor and costs time and money.</p>



<p>While proprietary LLMs mean an enterprise must rely on a single provider, an open source one lets the enterprise take advantage of community contributions, multiple service providers and possibly internal teams to handle updates, development, maintenance and support. Open source allows enterprises to experiment and use contributions from people with varying perspectives. That can result in solutions allowing enterprises to stay at the cutting edge of technology. It also gives businesses using open source LLMs more control over their technology and decisions regarding how they use it.</p>



 What types of projects can open source LLM models enable? 



<p>Organizations can use open source LLM models to create virtually any project useful to their employees or, when the open source license allows, that can be offered as commercial products. These include:</p>



 Text generation 



<p>Open source LLM models allow you to create an app with language generation abilities, such as writing emails, blog posts or creative stories. An LLM like Falcon-40B, offered under an Apache 2.0 license, can respond to a prompt with high-quality text suggestions you can then refine and polish.</p>



 Code generation 



<p>Open source LLMs trained on existing code and programming languages can assist developers in building applications and finding errors and security-related faults.</p>



 Virtual tutoring 



<p>Open source LLMs let you create applications that offer personalized learning experiences, which can be customized and fine-tuned to particular learning styles.</p>



 Content summarization 



<p>An open source LLM tool that summarizes long articles, news stories, research reports and more can make it easy to extract key data.</p>



 AI-driven chatbots 



<p>These can understand and answer questions, offer suggestions and engage in natural language conversation.</p>



 Language translation 



<p>Open source LLMs that train on multilingual datasets can provide accurate and fluent translations in many languages.</p>



 Sentiment analysis 



<p>LLMs can analyze text to determine emotional or sentiment tone, which is valuable in brand reputation management and analysis of customer feedback.</p>



 Content filtering and moderation  



<p>LLMs can be valuable in identifying and filtering out inappropriate or harmful online content, which is a huge help in maintaining a safer online environment.</p>



 What kinds of organizations use open source LLMs? 



<p>A wide range of organization types use open source LLMs. For example, IBM and NASA developed an open source LLM trained on geospatial data to help scientists and their organizations fight <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/nasa-hugging-face-ibm">climate change</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://digiday.com/media/the-case-for-and-against-open-source-large-language-models-for-use-in-newsrooms/">Publishers and journalists</a> use open source LLMs internally to analyze, identify and summarize information without sharing proprietary data outside the newsroom.</p>



<p>Some <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/clinicalgpt-the-llm-clinician-5e1f7866b6d1">healthcare organizations</a> use open source LLMs for healthcare software, including diagnosis tools, treatment optimizations and tools handling patient information, public health and more.</p>



<p>The open source LLM <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4489826">FinGPT</a> was developed specifically for the financial industry.</p>



 Some of the best open source, curated LLMs 



<p>The <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard">Open LLM Leaderboard</a> aims to track, rank and evaluate open source LLMs and chatbots on different benchmarks.</p>



 
 One well-performing open source LLM with a license that allows agreements for commercial use is <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-08-09-IBM-Plans-to-Make-Llama-2-Available-within-its-Watsonx-AI-and-Data-Platform">LLaMa 2</a> by Meta AI, which encompasses pre-trained and fine-tuned generative text models with 7 to 70 billion parameters and is available in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">Watsonx.ai</a> studio. It’s also available through the Hugging Face ecosystem and transformer library. 



 Vicuna and Alpaca were created on top of the LLaMa model and, like Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, are fine-tuned to follow instructions. Vicuna, which outperforms Alpaca, matches GPT-4 performance. 



 <a href="https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom">Bloom</a> by BigScience is a multilingual language model created by more than 1,000 AI researchers. It’s the first multilingual LLM trained in complete transparency. 



 The <a href="https://falconllm.tii.ae/">Falcon</a> LLM from Technology Innovation Institute (TII) can be used with chatbots to generate creative text, solve complex problems and reduce and automate repetitive tasks. Both Falcon 6B and 40B are available as raw models for fine-tuning or as already instruction-tuned models that can be used as-is. Falcon uses only about 75% of GPT-3’s training compute budget and significantly outperforms it. 



 MPT-7B and <a href="https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b">MPT-30B</a> are open source LLMs licensed for commercial use from MosaicML (recently acquired by Databricks). MPT-7B matches the performance of LlaMA. MPT-30B outperforms GPT-3. Both are trained on 1T tokens. 



 FLAN-T5, launched by Google AI, can handle more than 1,800 diverse tasks. 



 <a href="https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder">StarCoder</a> from Hugging Face is an open source LLM coding assistant trained on permissive code from GitHub. 



 <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-7B-Base">RedPajama-INCITE</a>, licensed under Apache-2, is a 6.9B parameter pre-trained language model developed by Together and leaders from various institutions, including the University of Montreal and the Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models. 



 <a href="https://www.cerebras.net/blog/cerebras-gpt-a-family-of-open-compute-efficient-large-language-models/">Cerebras-GPT</a> from Cerebras is a family of seven GPT models that range from 111 million to 13 billion parameters. 



 StableLM is an open source LLM from Stability AI, which made the AI image generator Stable Diffusion. It trained on a dataset containing 1.5 trillion tokens called “The Pile” and is fine-tuned with a combination of open source datasets from Alpaca, GPT4All (which offers a range of models based on GPT-J, MPT and LlaMa), Dolly, ShareGPT and HH. 
 



 Risks associated with large language models 



<p>Although LLM outputs sound fluent and authoritative, there can be <a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/Risk+of+Large+Language+Models+%28LLM%29/1_nwjchpzl">risks</a> that include offering information based on “hallucinations” as well as problems with bias, consent or security. Education on these risks is one answer to these issues of data and AI.</p>



 
 Hallucinations, or falsehoods, can result from the LLM being trained on incomplete, contradictory, or inaccurate data or from predicting the next accurate word based on context without understanding meaning. 



 Bias happens when the source of data is not diverse or representative. 



 Consent refers to whether the training data was gathered with accountability, meaning it follows AI governance processes that make it compliant with laws and regulations and offers ways for people to incorporate feedback. 



 Security problems can include leaking PII, cyber criminals using the LLM for malicious tasks such as phishing and spamming, and hackers changing original programming.

 The relevance of a promise 



<p>The fundamental principle of commerce is the concept of a “promise.” A promise of accuracy in product detail, product capabilities, quality, price and delivery.</p>



<p>The promise of accuracy in inventory—or, more importantly, in the availability of inventory—is very important when there are competing demands for the same unit of inventory and unpredictable disruptions to sources of supply. It becomes very challenging to uphold the promise when so much is changing in the processes that trigger demand and supply.</p>



 The challenges of keeping a promise 



<p>The challenge is particularly true in highly competitive areas like omnichannel retail or even B2B domains—wholesale distribution and dealer-based after-market parts. This is a space where <a href="https://www.ibm.com/order-management">IBM Sterling Order Management</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/intelligent-promising">IBM Sterling Intelligent Promising</a> have been leaders since the early days of eCommerce.</p>



<p>The secret to success is making sure that changes to supply and demand are tracked and processed at ultra-scale in real-time and that an accurate Available to Promise quantity (ATP) is presented to the channels of promise. It is not enough to just present a quantity; demanding shoppers also want to see an expected date of delivery—not an estimated date of when a product will be shipped, but a precise date of delivery at their doorstep or a confirmed date for in-store pickup, etc. This means keeping track of stock availability, capacity availability and possibly, the availability of specific delivery slots for pickup. In the wider context of flash-sales, in-store campaigns, marketplaces and omni-channel connected commerce initiatives, staying on top of this dynamic environment can be very challenging to companies.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tanglelabs.io/">Tangle Labs</a> are no strangers to building technology for social good, and over the past nine months we have been focusing on exploring the value verifiable identity can provide to support opportunities in line with the <a href="https://www.uil.unesco.org/en/unesco-institute/mandate#:~:text=The%20UNESCO%20Institute%20for%20Lifelong,education%20and%20learning%20throughout%20life.">UNESCO mandate for lifelong learning</a> through decentralised identity, open badges, and verifiable credentials for learners.</p><p>Earlier this year we announced our role as one of two leading technology partners within the <a href="https://ngdil.com/">NGDIL</a> (Next Generation Digital Identity in Learning) project. Working alongside <a href="https://www.talentencampusoss.nl/">UNESCO learning city Oss</a> and <a href="https://www.kw1c.nl/">UNESCO learning institute Koning Willem I College</a>, in the Netherlands, we spent the past nine months researching and developing a live demonstration of self-sovereign identity technology that can support learners with seamless lifelong learning experiences. Putting the privacy and security of the user front and centre, the demo, built using the backend for the upcoming AuvoID no-code identity platform from Tangle Labs, was a valuable illustration of the interoperability of the technology, displayed by the use of not only the <a href="https://www.tanglelabs.io/vira">Vira identity wallet</a> from Tangle Labs, but also the UniMe wallet from <a href="https://impierce.com/">Impierce Technologies</a>.&nbsp;</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
          
          
            <p>Vira and UniMe identity wallet applications on two mobile devices laying in front of a laptop with the NGDIL demo on the screen.</p>
          
        
      
        
      

    
  


  





   Why interoperability matters. <p>The technology used to build out the wallets, both at Tangle Labs and Impierce, follows the EU guidelines for <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">European Digital Identity Wallet</a> framework. These standards-based frameworks will be coming into effect in 2025 and provide a guideline for interoperability between different technology providers, to establish an EU wide ecosystem that can support reusable verifiable identity and credentials across borders.</p><p>What we achieved with the <a href="https://demo.ngdil.com/">NGDIL demo</a> is to show that the technology already works in a live implementation. Having multiple technology providers interacting in the same ecosystem shows that there is no necessary vendor lock-in and that if the standards are used, anyone can build and gain value from participating in such an ecosystem.</p><p>The importance of interoperability and a collaborative approach to the adoption of the technology is centred around the value it brings to everyone within an ecosystem. In current identity ecosystems a centralised approach is taken, with one central party having oversight over everything, take Google single sign on as an example. With a more decentralised approach, the user can securely interact using self-sovereign identity, without the need of a third party. This allows for complete control over who learners share their data with and how. This also allows for more streamlined experiences, through the portability of user data. Rather than having to share numerous paper documents, or go through laborious verification processes, a simple sharing of instantly verifiable credentials is all that is required – cutting down onboarding times, simplifying verification, and creating accessible user experiences that can offer more inclusive and obtainable lifelong learning opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

   Where do we go from here? <p>As eIDAS 2.0 comes into effect in 2025, this technology will become <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281#:~:text=IDENTIFICATION%20MEANS%E2%80%99%3B-,(16),-the%20following%20Articles">mandatory for numerous sectors</a> – including education, banking, healthcare – which means it’s time to start integrating now. And, after presenting the NGDIL project and live technology demonstration at numerous events across Europe, it has evidently opened the eyes of many to the potential this technology can provide within the context of lifelong learning. &nbsp;</p><p>Through the research and development of this year we have opened doors to new partnerships, projects, and opportunities that will bring this technology into the real world in 2024.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This week we are discussing verifiable credentials. I am joined by Riley Hughes, the host of <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast/">The Future of Identity Podcast</a>, to explore some of the most recent success stories of verifiable credentials and how we can work to improve adoption moving forward. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Hello, and thank you for joining a new episode over Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. One term that has been in our radar for the last – I would say four or five years has been verifiable credentials. Which I will say personally, I’m feeling that is becoming in the last one, two years pretty crystallised. And we have not talked too much about this lately, so I have a very special guest who has a lot of insight – what’s going on worldwide about verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Our guest today is Riley Hughes. He is the CEO and Co-founder of Trinsic, a reusable identity infrastructure provider. As a leader in the decentralised identity community, Riley has pioneered efforts on making emerging privacy preserving technologies – such as identity wallets and verifiable credentials – adoptable to the masses. He began his career in the decentralised identity space as the second employee hired at the Sovrin Foundation, where he established and led several teams. Hello, Riley.</p>
<p>Riley Hughes: Hi, Oscar. Great to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s great to have this conversation with you. So very welcome. And let’s talk about digital identity. And as usual, I want to hear more about our guests. So, if you can tell us about yourself, and especially your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Riley: Happy to do so. I am very fortunate to have totally fallen into this amazing industry. And it happened because while I was at college, I was seeing all those smart people around me going and getting jobs at elite places, you know, investment banks and management consulting firms, and so forth. And I thought that I wanted to kind of differentiate my resume enough that I could, maybe I could get an interview as well at one of these places. So, I thought, “What is the most, kind of, off the wall internship that I could get that would differentiate me from all of my peers?”</p>
<p>And I ended up getting a job at the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>, as you mentioned. Sovrin at that time was very early. I was, as mentioned, the second employee hired, and it was kind of a blockchain meets identity meets nonprofit, you know, meets early employee kind of a role. And so, it, sort of, fit my criteria for differentiating my resume. But it was also just really, really exciting to be part of an early organisation. It grew up to about 25 employees in short order. And I was able to participate in some of that growth. And that was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>And what I realised is that there are a lot of problems to solve in this world of digital identity. I remember just thinking, “Man, it seems crazy that we are sending people to outer space, and we’re editing genes, and we’re doing all kinds of unbelievable things with science and technology. And yet, the best way to prove who I am on the internet is to take a photograph of my government-issued document and a selfie, or something. It just seems kind of backwards.” It seems like the future of identity will be much better than it is today.</p>
<p>And so, although I didn’t necessarily know whether Sovrin would be the ultimate manifestation of that better digital identity future, I did know that something would happen here that would lead to that better future. And so, I thought I would stick around in this space. I decided not to go for those other kind of recruiting opportunities that I alluded to. And instead, I started Trinsic with a couple of -. And that’s kind of how we got to where we are today. That was a little over four years ago.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, super interesting that one of the first jobs – when you start to differentiate yourself – it was Sovrin. How did they find you? How did you find them?</p>
<p>Riley: The Chair of the Board of Sovrin was Phil Windley. And he was a professor at the university that I was attending. So, they had a job posting out for university students. And they didn’t have any money yet so they couldn’t pay very much and so they needed a university student and that’s sort of where I came in.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right place, right time. Fantastic, those coincidences that sometimes happened.</p>
<p>So, you’ve been around, as you said, four years/five years in this space already. So, what would you say has been something that has surprised you the most, something special you would like to tell us?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, that’s a great question. I think that when I started in this space, and the way we were talking about verifiable credentials, was as if it was a digital representation of a physical document. Right? And we can get into more about what verifiable credentials are and what they aspire to be. But the thing that was most kind of interesting and surprising recently, is – at Trinsic we are an infrastructure provider for verifiable credentials. And so, when companies want to incorporate a verifiable credential-based solution into their offerings, we’re an infrastructure to enable them to do that.</p>
<p>And as we did a kind of – an inventory or a survey of the landscape, of all of our customers and the ones that were most successful. What we realised was that people were not using verifiable credentials as a replacement for a physical document, generally. Instead, what they were using it for, is – in the same way that a FinTech developer might use an open banking API, right?</p>
<p>Basically, open banking allows you to unlock your data from its original silo, which is your bank account, and reuse that financial data and make it interoperable across other third-party applications. And, you know, what our customers were using verifiable credentials to do is something similar, but for personal data. Unlocking that personal data from its original silos and making it useful and interoperable and reusable across multiple applications.</p>
<p>And so, it actually changed, Oscar, the kind of form factor of the product we needed to build, right? And we realised that the correct – you know, we needed to change some things about how we were approaching our product.</p>
<p>So that’s been what we’ve been in the thick of doing for the last few months. And it’s been a fun journey. Startups are always a little bit of a roller coaster. And this is a fun part of that roller coaster.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, super interesting, Riley. So, let’s jump into the main topic. So, tell us please, what are verifiable credentials?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I alluded to verifiable credentials often being talked about as a digital representation of a physical document. And generally, when you hear the term verifiable and credential – a credential is sort of an attestation, or a claim made about one party by another party. So, in healthcare, right, your credentials are something that you’ve obtained, from a trusted source, that you can use to prove to somebody else certain things about you, and what your qualifications are, et cetera. And verifiable credentials are a way to do that verifiably, cryptographically in a digital form.</p>
<p>Now, if we’re talking about – I think there’s two ways that people use the term ‘verifiable credentials’ today. One is with an uppercase, V and C, an uppercase Verifiable Credentials, that is the formal official W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model Standard. And that is a specific kind of verifiable credential that is sort of an interoperable, and probably the most well-adopted, and well talked about kind of verifiable credential.</p>
<p>And then you have the lowercase, vc, verifiable credential. And there are lots of different kinds of lowercase verifiable credentials. Lots of things that can fit this model of an attestation that is given to you by some trusted party, and used to get access to the things you need throughout your life. So, I guess it depends on which of those you’re talking about. But I hope that that’s a helpful kind of intro.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, thank you for that. And the same term can mean different things from different perspectives. Let’s make even more concrete.</p>
<p>So, let’s hear from you some concrete examples. If you can tell us something that is already widely used, some that most of us might already know about. So, tell us a bit of some examples of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I mean, again, if we’re to zoom out a little bit and talk about verifiable credentials in the broadest sense. Even something like a credit card could be considered a verifiable credential. It is something that was given to you by a trusted source, likely a bank, and you can use it with third party merchants in a way that they can authenticate that card and charge your account based on your actions with that card. And so it is, you know, in the broadest sense, even something like a credit card or a government-issued ID could be considered a form of a verifiable credential.</p>
<p>But if we’re talking about specifically, the new W3C Verifiable Credential Standard, I think, one example that is helpful to conceptualise what this looks like, is the vaccine, or the sort of travel pass type products – that many of us used throughout the pandemic. I think this is where – this is the first use case that we found that Trinsic received broad adoption. And, you know, these are products that allowed you to prove that you were vaccinated against COVID, or that you had obtained a recent COVID test, and that you are therefore eligible to travel. And you know that is a form of verifiable credential, Apple and Google even were accepting those credentials into their native operating system wallets as verifiable credentials as well. And so that is maybe an example that a lot of people have used in the recent years.</p>
<p>Oscar: And those were already based on the W3C standards.</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, technically, I think the smart health cards was what they were based on, and smart health cards were based on the W3C standard, so yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yes, definitely that has been a case that millions of people have used. Those helped us during the pandemic without knowing the term of ‘verifiable credential’. So that definitely has been widely used in different regions, different implementations. But yeah, that’s correct.</p>
<p>OK, if you tell us also some other examples, how has been, yeah, across different sectors, let’s say verifiable credentials are being implemented and as well, interesting stories.</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah. So, I think when you look at Trinsic, we are, again, an infrastructure provider. And so, we see companies all across the spectrum using Trinsic to accomplish their verifiable credential use cases. Everybody from a car manufacturer to a B2B supplier, an invoice management solution to a consumer product application for events and concerts, to education and healthcare use cases, I think.</p>
<p>A use case that I really like, is the medical staff passport. It is something that’s easy to conceptualise, really, it’s an identity wallet that a provider, a physician or a nurse could use to prove that they have the correct credentials and qualifications to do that job.</p>
<p>And so, if you’re a physician that needs to go to a new hospital, to substitute for some staffing shortage or something. The way this works today is there’s a big, long credentialing process where the new hospital needs to spend a lot of time checking lots of different things to make sure that you are eligible to do your job. And still, there’s fraud that gets through. With a digital staff passport, a doctor could simply prove who they are much faster, prove their credentials much faster, and get to work serving patients much sooner. So that’s a use case that I think is pretty helpful and has been succeeding, I think there’s four or five projects that I’m aware of around the world that are that are doing that, including some that are being built on Trinsic.</p>
<p>But I think regardless of where you look across all of those different industries that I mentioned, you see a couple of common patterns. And one of those common patterns is – you often need to anchor that credential in something, some foundational verifiable credential. So, what we’re seeing is, you know, if you’re a doctor, and you want to get your credentials in a digital verifiable credential form. The first thing that you’ll do is not actually go get your doctor credentials. But instead, the first thing that you do is verify your identity, scan a government document and authenticate yourself against some authoritative, again, government type document. And then when you obtain your doctor credentials, you can then make sure that those match. And then when you prove who you are in subsequent interactions, it’s much higher trust. Because you can cross reference the two credentials, and that brings a high degree of trust.</p>
<p>And so, what we see across a lot of these use cases are people doing, sort of, an identity verification step. In addition, and that becomes the foundational verifiable credential, or reusable identity (as we call it) that anchors some of these verifiable credentials. And that step is something that we at Trinsic help facilitate as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, so the very first identity verification. So, when you mentioned that for this healthcare professionals, credential, you mentioned, there are a few worldwide. So, will these initiatives, I don’t know how much if they are in production, or is still in development? I don’t know, but if you know enough about the difference of these projects, do you think they will become interoperable or they are following different paths? What’s your view?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I think that, yeah, I think that they will become interoperable. It’s hard for me to say a blanket statement that every single one will definitely be. But yeah, but I think that many of these projects are based on the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model. And if they’re not based on that data model, they’re based on something else that is very similar. And I think the important thing to remember as it relates to interoperability is there’s a little bit of a conflict, actually, between two very important things.</p>
<p>When you’re launching a product, you want the ability to move fast, to iterate on the form factor, and change things to the extent that they’re not working, and bring the best technologies to bear, to build the best product that you can for the customer. And at the same time, you also want interoperability and compatibility across applications. And these things come into conflict because in order to be interoperable or compatible with other applications, you sort of need to slow down and agree upon a set of standards. But to be sort of innovative and moving fast, you kind of need to speed up and be willing to throw away your old solution and replace it with something better. And so, you get is this tension between innovation and interoperability.</p>
<p>So many of the solutions that you see out in the market today are not interoperable simply because they’re focusing more on the innovation side of the equation. And yes, there are proof points of kind of interoperability testing and interoperability suites that people can come into compliance to. But oftentimes, that’s kind of a steppingstone and will come into compliance with that. And then you’ll see another divergence of different attempts, and then they’ll sort of converge back to another point of interoperability at some point in the future. And so, it’s never quite as cut and dry as just interoperable or not.</p>
<p>And so, the important thing, before you build a bridge between your island and someone else’s island, you need to make sure there’s stuff on the islands for people to do, right? You need to make sure that people actually get to drive their car across the bridge. And so, in my opinion, the most important thing to do first, is get a product out there and get people using it and get happy customers where you’re solving their problem. And once you’ve done that, you can incorporate interoperability to make your product even better for those customers and solve even more problems. But I think trying to solve interoperability before you have a product in market is a little bit of putting the cart before the horse in some ways.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. Definitely a good observation. And I agree that, yeah, you need adoption, you need adoption, you need to solve problems. To see that yeah, this new technology, this new product is really solving, solving problems for a big enough mass of users. And from that perspective also, my impression is that most of the companies who are building these products are not the big ones, right? Not the big companies, that’s my impression. So, it’s like, startup entrepreneurs, mostly. So how is the – are they doing profit in this space of verifiable credentials? What is, what you have seen?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I don’t think I can say that there’s a, you know, hundreds of really successful, kind of, high profit generating companies out there. But there’s definitely companies earning revenue. To the extent that their revenues exceed their costs, I don’t know. But from a revenue standpoint, I think, you know, the key to making money with verifiable credentials is not the verifiable credentials. The key to making money with verifiable credentials is to – solving a problem with a customer. And to the extent that verifiable credentials can help you do that better and more effectively, that’s the extent that you will profit with verifiable credentials, right? So, you know, what we’ve seen is really not a whole cloth reinventing of the fundamental economics of the internet, or anything like that.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a few ways that people are making money. The first way is they build a consumer product that makes a person’s life better, and they charge the consumer for that product. Right? Password managers cost a few bucks a month. CLEAR is an identity product that you might see in airports, especially in the United States, you know, where you can skip the line at the security by enrolling in this identity company called CLEAR. These are examples of consumer products that consumers pay for because it makes their lives a little bit easier.</p>
<p>And I’ve seen verifiable credential type products that do the same thing. I’ve also seen products that solve a problem for our business, and they take, maybe it’s a subscription revenue, maybe it’s a usage-based fee for that. And they follow the software as a service playbook that is sort of tried and true. And, you know, this is – I mentioned the doctor, kind of the staff passport solutions a minute ago.</p>
<p>And I’ve seen some of these types of solutions that have done really well by leaning into a vertical, a vertical software approach. And using the kind of verification of individuals and employees of a given hospital or something like that, as a benefit, a value-add to their existing software as a service product. And so that just sort of strengthens their revenue proposition there.</p>
<p>And then the third way that I’ve seen are companies that are already doing some kind of an attestation, but in a non-verifiable credential way. So, for example, this might be an identity verification company, a background check company, a student ID verification company, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>And I’ve seen, you know, these kinds of companies incorporate reusable identity or incorporate verifiable credentials into their product. Or in other words, issue their attestation as a verifiable credential, instead of just simply, you know, an API response, and continue charging the same business model that they always have, and actually make more money than they were making previously. Because now that it’s a reusable credential, people can use it more places than they otherwise would have. Or it becomes their go-to resource for authenticating themselves, which then leads to even more revenue for the attestation provider. So, these are a few ways I’ve seen people make money with verifiable credentials, and then our fundamental kind of transformations of the business models that may have come before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, but it’s very interesting to see that there is value generation on top of solving problems and solving people’s problem. Excellent. So, one, relatively new term that is relatively new is wallets. And that is a term that I feel that is already reaching the masses, so people hear about that more commonly at this point, 2023, that we are having these conversations. So, what is the relationship between – or the connection between verifiable credentials and wallets?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, it’s pretty simple. I think the easy answer is wallets are where your verifiable credentials are stored. So, you get – just like in real life, you obtain a driving license. Where do you put it? Well, generally speaking, you put it in a wallet. And in a verifiable credential world, that holds true. I think this breaks down just a little bit if you think about wallet in the way that most people use the term. Most people associate a wallet with payment of some kind.</p>
<p>So today, your verifiable credentials are unlikely to fit inside of your Apple wallet. They’re unlikely to fit inside of your crypto wallet. They’re unlikely to fit inside of some other things, which are called wallets today. But I think that’s just a function of the maturity of the technology. I think, you know, we’ll get there.</p>
<p>For now, the term that I use are ID wallets, right? They’re sort of wallets that are built for verifiable credentials. And today, they sit alongside other kinds of wallets. So, in the Web3 space, we have some customers in that world. And for the users of their products, the ID wallet is a separate container or a separate data store or separate wallet that sits alongside or next to a crypto wallet for those Web3 applications. And, you know, in a Web2 world, again, a user ends up getting a wallet, oftentimes, they don’t even know that it is a wallet, they don’t even know that we refer to it as a wallet. To them, it’s just storage of their verifiable credential, or of their staff passport or something. But, yeah, hopefully that helps.</p>
<p>Oscar: But the ID wallet that you mentioned, it’s also from a normal user perspective, you just want one more app in the mobile, something like that?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, it could be an app. It also could not be an app. I think oftentimes if you are requiring your user to redirect out to an app store, download an app, authenticate to the app and get on boarded through the onboarding screens, and then obtain a verifiable credential. Also, that they can verify themselves and get the thing they actually want, that user experience becomes pretty tricky.</p>
<p>So, while we have seen some apps, you know, mobile apps, you know, succeeding and that is a model that is definitely a viable option. It definitely should not be the only option. And I think we’ve even seen web-based wallets or cloud-based wallets really taking off in much, much greater numbers than a lot of the mobile app wallets that we have, that we’ve seen. And I think it’s just a function of the friction required for a user to go through that journey is just so much less.</p>
<p>So yeah, it could be an app on your phone, it could be embedded into an existing app you already use. Or it could be a web resource that you, you know, authenticate to and get access to your credentials that way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Looking at the future from where we are now, what do you say is needed in order to see a broader adoption of verifiable credentials?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I think we need more products, and more focus on product. So, you may have kind of heard from some of my previous answers that I, you know, I tend to think a lot about adoption. I think a lot about product. And I think a lot about business models. And that’s obviously because of my background. You know, I’m not an engineer by training.</p>
<p>But I do think that a lot of times, people get a little bit lost into the weeds with the technology. There’s a lot of cases where, you know, we’re talking about theoreticals in the technology, before anybody is actually using the product and we’re sort of holding up these, you know, certain technology principles as gold standards or best practices. When in reality, many verifiable credential approaches do not have product market fit yet. And so, we could build the most amazing, elegant, utopian technological solution. But if nobody uses that solution, then what’s the point?</p>
<p>So, I think really, the thing we need to focus on so much more is adoption and product execution over anything else. The technology is there, it’s good enough, it’s plenty good enough. It’s been good enough for – I mean, four years ago, literally, we launched the first version of our product, which allowed any developer to issue a credential within five minutes on Sovrin. And then a few weeks later, we expanded it to where there was a dashboard where even a non-technical person could issue credentials within five minutes.</p>
<p>So, the technology has been really accessible for a long time now. And when we look at our customer base, and we look at the success rates, and then we try to correlate those success rates with something and see what predicts success in this market. Every single time it comes down to product execution, and just being focused on solving a real problem for people. And so really what we need to get more verifiable credential adoption, is we just need – more of that, more problems being solved for businesses and people who are willing to pay for it. Right?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I agree. All right, thank you for the explanation of what’s going on verifiable credentials. And I agree a lot of your views on the focus on solving problems. So, leaving us with a final question, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Riley: Well, I am going to piggyback off my last answer for this one, Oscar. I’m going to say, if you are a company that has an identity product, or some kind of attestation service for people, or something like that. You should write on your agenda to explore how verifiable credentials could augment your business, because it’s likely that there’s some startup out there that is sort of doing something using verifiable credentials in your space or an adjacent space. And, you know, and they’re learning fast about what’s working and what doesn’t, and what this new world will look like. And so, as the world moves to fully digital and moves to reusable identity, the ones that sort of obtain those insights fastest and move first are going to get a lot of the benefits. And so, that’s the first thing.</p>
<p>If you are not in that category of a company that would sort of incorporate verifiable credentials, then the action item that I would give to you is to be a user of one of these products. And if you can’t find a product that uses verifiable credentials, if you can’t find an ID wallet that solves a problem for you, that’s maybe a little bit of an indicative of where we are as a space. But if there is something that you can use and try out and actually use it in the real world to solve some problem for you, I encourage you to do it, give it a try and give feedback to the developer of that product and let them know your experience. Because these are the kinds of things that will drive adoption of better identity systems in the future than what we have today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. Oh, thanks a lot for this very interesting interview, Riley. Please let us know how people can follow the conversation with you.</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I – so the first thing I’ll say is that we do a podcast as well. This has been a blast, Oscar. This is a great podcast. I love it. I think if you’re interested in reusable identity, specifically, and diving deeper into some of the stories of companies that have launched reusable identity products, or verifiable credential-based products out into the wild, I have a podcast that we do, called <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast/">The Future of Identity podcast</a>. And so that’s what I would encourage you to check out.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in following me or getting in touch, you can email me at riley@trinsic.id. Find me on Twitter @rileyphughes. I’m also accessible on LinkedIn. If you search my name, I’m sure you’ll find us. And I’m always open to feedback and love the conversation so please reach out if you think there’s a way we could work together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, thank you and indeed I’ve been listening to your podcasts, The Future of Identity, so it’s highly, highly recommended. So, if you want to learn more in identity especially the topics that Riley has been bringing us today. So again, thanks a lot Riley for joining us. And all the best.</p>
<p>Riley: Thanks, as well, Oscar. You as well.</p>

<p>Mattereum has recently announced a <a href="https://mattereum.com/2023/07/23/announcing-swarm-x-mattereum-partnership/">partnership with Swarm</a>, a German exchange, and, you may ask, why is this one so important? Well, while we’ve made crucial partnerships with companies like <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/11/24/announcing-neoswap-x-mattereum-partnership/">NeoSwap</a> and <a href="https://mattereum.com/2023/04/21/announcing-crypto-real-estate-x-mattereum-partnership/">Crypto Real Estate</a> this year, connecting to Swarm is the link that can really make things happen and act as a force multiplier for all these other partnerships, and for others we’ll make in the future. The combination of Mattereum’s legaltech innovation and Swarm’s ability to create fractional ownership tokens has enabled what is literally the Holy Grail of the blockchain - creating legally enforceable fractional ownership of real world assets with tokens that can be traded on-chain - and that has the potential to change everything. Let’s look at&nbsp;why.</p><blockquote>Creating legally enforceable fractional ownership of real world assets with tokens that can be traded on-chain has the potential to change everything</blockquote><p><a href="https://swarm.com/">Swarm</a> is a really, really well-established company in the crypto space, going back as far as 2014, and they are German. In Germany, they just put the same criteria around crypto as you would for any other class of financial instruments that were issued in the normal way, the old-fashioned way, the TradFi [traditional finance] way. So Swarm got their licences, and now they are just like real-world finance in Germany, but they have a license that lets them do things with crypto, and they’ve got the attitude, they’ve got the experience, they’ve got the institutional knowledge... So, they’re not really TradFi, and they’re not really DeFi; they’re just Fi. They don’t have the whizzy kind of craziness of DeFi, they also don’t have the dullness of traditional finance; they use the blockchain to get things done, and they’re exactly the kind of institution that we thought mainstream banks were going to turn into in the 2016 era. This means that what they do is backed by all kinds of regulatory oversight and legal compliances; they are not going to take anyone’s money and do something crazy and unexpected with it. This meshes perfectly with the Mattereum approach, where our <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> provides evidence that the owner of the token issued by Swarm has full legal ownership of the underlying physical asset, or their fraction of it, and this works in 172 jurisdictions worldwide. With Swarm as Mattereum’s fractionization partner you have full legal protection at every stage of the&nbsp;process.</p><blockquote>With Swarm as our fractionization partner you have full legal protection at every&nbsp;stage</blockquote><p>Swarm is the first really serious way of joining together TradFi and DeFi, and then Mattereum comes in and says, “Okay, so you want to do something like take a thousand acres of rainforest, you want to take an industrial facility, you want to take a collection of fine art that’s been accumulated over a few centuries... You want to take these things, and you want to split them into shares and allow people to buy them, you want to split them into tokens and allow people to buy them, you want to take revenue streams and allow people to buy those, you want to do governance...” For all of these things, you have to know for certain that the assets are real and that there’s no fraud in the assets, you need insurance, you need underwriting, you need machine-readable definitions of those assets so that you can do things like automated investment portfolio management.</p><blockquote>You have to know for certain that the assets are real and that there’s no fraud in the&nbsp;assets</blockquote><p>You need specialised entities external to regular financial organisations that put together those kinds of deals, and Mattereum is one of the those entities. In the real world, Mattereum might be seen as something a bit like KPMG or one of the other big-four accounting firms. It could have some overlap with the kind of stuff that some of the more entrepreneurial merchant functions that are out there. What we’re seeing here is the buildout of real-world finance, neither TradFi nor DeFi, but real-world finance with many of the same kind of business models that you get in the real world, but all implemented on the new technological backbone of the blockchain. This is really what we always thought Ethereum was going to be, this is back to the original vision – we can now implement through Mattereum all of the stuff that we talked about at Ethereum nearly 10 years&nbsp;ago.</p><blockquote>You need external entities that put together the deals, and Mattereum is one of the audit-like entities that helps put together the&nbsp;deals</blockquote><p>If Ethereum was a Jedi, Swarm is the lightsabre, because it’s going to cut right through the separation between the Ethereum community and the real world. Once we can get through that door, you can buy-and-sell 20% of a house as Ethereum tokens in a way that is government-approved, and at the end the lawyer who is involved in the deal can read the paperwork and go “Sure, that’s fine, that’s just a transaction”. There’s been a frothy, very delicate kind of enthusiasm with tokens, where the enthusiasm goes away and then suddenly all the money goes away. How different would it be, if all of the enthusiasm around NFTs a couple of years ago had been for instruments that had durable value, like real estate or gold or fine art? You wouldn’t have a situation where there was this sudden dramatic popping of a bubble. Real estate bubbles pop, but when a real estate bubble pops, people lose 20% of their value; when a token bubble pops, people lose <a href="https://www.levelup.com/en/news/756539/Report-95-of-NFTs-Have-Lost-All-Their-Value-Theyre-Now-Worth-Nothing#:~:text=New%20information%20suggests%20that%20NFTs,have%20lost%20all%20their%20value.">99.9% of their value</a>, and then sue a celebrity.</p><blockquote>If Ethereum was a Jedi, Swarm is the lightsabre</blockquote><p>With real-world stuff when you buy something it doesn’t have this kind of inherent volatility. This is because what you’re not buying is “Does this asset class really exist or not?” which is where we are with NFTs, it’s where we are with DeFi, it’s where we are with ICO tokens, You’re not making a bet on whether the asset class turns into something; you’re taking an asset class that, in some instances, is tens of thousands of years old and you’re making a bet on an individual thing inside of that asset class. It’s a completely different kind of risk, it’s a much lower risk in most cases, it’s certainly a much more easy-to-understand risk, and it doesn’t have the same kind of correlation, because even if one piece of real estate turns out to be a bad deal, somewhere in the world all the rest of the real estate is much the same as it ever&nbsp;was.</p><blockquote>You’re not buying “Does this asset class really exist or&nbsp;not?”</blockquote><p>Right now, the only way to buy things if you cannot afford them yourself is credit. You want something, the thing is expensive, you need something, the thing is expensive... The only way that you’re going to get that thing is if you can borrow money from one or more people, and then you take all of that money, you buy the thing outright, and now there’s your thing. That as an approach involves paying interest: 2-3% for a long time, when interest rates were super low, now interest rates are high, high, high and they’re probably going to go higher, and you start thinking like 30% APR [annual percentage rate] on credit cards, and even higher instances in some instances... But even the core borrowing from bank base rates, the interest rate numbers are going up and up and up – it’s getting more and more difficult and dangerous to use debt to finance&nbsp;things.</p><blockquote>Right now the only way to buy things if you cannot afford them yourself is&nbsp;credit</blockquote><p>The other way of doing this thing is that you get people together to buy things collectively. Equity, not debt. “Hey, I want to buy this thing; I can’t afford it. How about I take two-thirds of it, and you take one-third of it? How would that be? – Oh yeah, that’s fine. Sure, absolutely.” Now, if that’s something like a riding lawn mower, then you sort of divide this up in terms of who’s going to use it when, and you’re sort of dividing these things up in time. That is a very, very small set of use cases. Most of the time, what people do is they divide things up in terms of value: here’s an enormous building, four different companies, each put money into that building, and one of them owns 5%, one of them owns 10%, one of them owns 25%, the other owns the rest of the building with rules, governance, for how the entities that all own parts of the thing interact. If you get to the really big-scale things, like publicly-traded companies, you could have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of shareholders. At the end of that you can do transactions at really huge scale and the thing that they own collectively together, is something like a power grid or an airline. These mechanisms are really alternatives to&nbsp;debt.</p><blockquote>The other way of doing this is that you get people together to buy things collectively.</blockquote><p>What tokenisation does is it takes the transactional costs of doing those kinds of deals down 10, 100, 1,000 times in time. Rather than getting a lot of different partners together and it costing $350,000 in legal paperwork you get something like that, but it’s a set of operations done on DeFi, and it costs you, maybe $18 worth of gas because you did it on one of the L2s [layer two platforms]. It’s going to take us a few years before we can get those prices down to those kinds of levels because it needs an established ecosystem, templated legals and so on, but when you can offer these kinds of things as services all kinds of new things become possible. Imagine you want to buy a house. Your grandparents and your parents and your cousins are going to put up 30% of the money for the house in exchange for so many shares to the house, that’s what you’re going to do, instead of taking this enormous loan from the bank; you could get a smaller loan at a much better interest rate, and you could put together these kind of combined debt-and-equity packages for the day-to-day business of staying alive as an ordinary person that works for a living. It takes these super powerful tools from high finance, and it brings them down as a way of replacing massive mortgages and credit card debt. It gets us out of a debt paradigm and into a debt and equity paradigm, or even a pure equity paradigm. That really changes our relationships with each other, because not everything is then mediated by an adversarial relationship of who owes who money; these things then become mediated by a collaborative relationship, which is that we own this thing together. That changes the whole tone of your society, debt society is hostile; co-ownership society is much, much more benign, much friendlier.</p><blockquote>Debt society is hostile; co-ownership society is much friendlier.</blockquote><p>Democratising access to fractional ownership of assets is going to revolutionise the world much more than the credit card itself did. The credit card was a huge deal, because before that people only really had cash economies. So the first transformation was that ordinary people got access to debt: you got mortgages, then you got credit cards, and that fuelled this enormous burst of people making long-term plans. “I am going to buy this thing on credit, I’m going to take out a loan, or I’m going to put it on my credit cards,” and so people’s lives speeded up enormously, because they could bring money from the future into the&nbsp;present.</p><blockquote>Democratising fractional ownership of assets is going to revolutionise the world much more than the credit card&nbsp;did</blockquote><p>Now you say, “Well, what happens if we start replacing this debt-based society and debt based economy that we have now with a debt-and-equity-based economy?” There are $42 trillion of transactions a year on<br>credit cards – the numbers are staggering! Imagine a similar transformation, where we give people access to equity as an instrument. It’s a percentage of the entire mortgage market, it’s a percentage of every car purchase, it might be a percentage for every time somebody buys resalable consumer electronics like laptops. There are just staggering things that can happen once you’ve got equity on the table, and the level of social transformation I expect to be even larger than the social transformation caused by credit cards and the debt revolution.</p><blockquote>There are just staggering things that can happen once you’ve got equity on the&nbsp;table,</blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">DAOs [decentralised autonomous organisation]</a> can be created based on this, reshaping collective ownership and governance of physical assets. DAOs have massive potential as a way of managing and governing collective ownership of real world assets, but so far, without that as a purpose to shape them, they’ve struggled to find a niche in the real world. But to me DAOs are the best example of an Ethereum technology which is poised to take over the world, and it just needs that extra step — connecting them to real world assets — and then suddenly they’re going to be everywhere. I know a lot of people in the DAO community had very high hopes for them as an instrument that would change everything and then, a bit like Ethereum itself, they’ve had this phenomenon where you just keep stamping on the accelerator and the wheels don’t move. It’s the gearbox problem – DAOs also need a gearbox; what we’re providing is the&nbsp;gearbox.</p><blockquote>DAOs need a gearbox; what Mattereum is providing is the&nbsp;gearbox.</blockquote><p>The approximate real-world equivalent of the DAO is the publicly-traded company: you buy a share of stock, you now have some economic rights. The board cannot just screw you over and disenfranchise you, because you have legal protections, and they have to consider your wishes when they make decisions. They can do things like get together and elect board members. If you think of the CEO of the company as kind of like the president, the board are kind of like the supreme court, they sit over the president, they enforce law. The shareholders pick the board, the board then picks the CEO. It’s kind of slightly democratic, but in practice it doesn’t seem very democratic because the people that run large companies have gotten very good at fighting shareholder democracy. But in principle, shareholder democracy can work, maybe one fine&nbsp;day.</p><blockquote>People that run large companies have gotten very good at fighting shareholder democracy</blockquote><p>The DAOs have the ability to automate this governance: you own some tokens in a project, you have some rights, there is some protection for your interests as a result of those economic rights, there is some contract law, there might be even some statute law, but these things all together create a situation where we are collectively governing an asset that we co-own together. “Here is a thousand acres of rainforest. 50,000 people own some of that rainforest. They collectively have voted that they’re going to preserve that rainforest for the next 25 years, and they will not even consider selling land to any entity that isn’t a better rainforest protector than the one they are currently themselves.” Those rules can be written into the process, and then no future set of owners can change those rules because this stuff is immutable. All of that stuff, if you try to do it with lawyers, the time and the cost and the expense is massive, if you try to get the voting done and people have to turn up at shareholders’ meetings and they have to fill in proxy forms... It’s hard. That’s one of the reasons why shareholder democracy is not so effective in large companies, but if all of that stuff was brought online and it was all managed through DAOs with properly set-up legals and contract law and all the rest of this, proper voting rights, proper economic protection for minority token holders, the rest of these necessary steps, then what you get is an economic democracy revolution. All of the technology that’s been worked out by the DAOs is suddenly applied to collective ownership of the world’s assets. The DAOs suddenly have an enormous amount of work to do in the real world, the software will get better and better and easier and easier, and in ten years you could see hundreds of millions of people participating in DAOs, in the same way that hundreds of millions of people participate in social media&nbsp;today.</p><blockquote>What you get is an economic democracy revolution.</blockquote><p>We never really thought that individuals were going to go out there and become one-person movie studios, and now that's a huge sector of the economy. In the same way, you don’t think that individuals are going to become governance geeks and they’re going to wind up managing investment portfolios and they’re going to wind up as sort of stewards of planetary resources. I think that that transformation is necessary and inevitable, because we know that we cannot run the global economy in the way that we’re doing it today. It’s a disaster zone, and we can only fix that by re-democratising the world. That doesn’t just mean going to<br>a ballot box and voting once every four years; it also means direct engagement and direct ownership of the world’s productive assets, from the rainforests to the airlines so that these things are well-stewarded by the people that are affected by how they are run, rather than just being controlled by a very small corporate elite that does everything possible to make sure that shareholders have no actual&nbsp;power.</p><blockquote>The global economy today is a disaster zone, and we can only fix that by re-democratising the&nbsp;world</blockquote><p>With the combination of Mattereum and Swarm, all this becomes possible, and ultimately easy. Any real world asset can be tokenized, people can use the tokens to share equity for their own purposes, they can form DAOs to manage larger assets and they can re-democratise things at a level that doesn’t need governments to be involved, beyond providing the legal framework in which these things operate. This is something we are doing now, not something that we are hoping to make possible in the future; the Mattereum system is<a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/09/26/mattereum-customer-west-london-city-lets-launch-first-real-estate-physical-asset-nft-for-land-in-uk/"> live and working</a>, and has been for two years. Swarm are up and running and have been for even longer. It’s two mature and effective players coming together to create a synergy that can change the world from day one, putting real world assets securely on-chain and giving people the tools to manage them; we’re not some new hopefuls promising vapourware for some indeterminate, distant&nbsp;date.</p><p>The future is here, now, and ready for&nbsp;use.</p><blockquote><a href="https://mattereum.com/sell-assets/">Contact us</a> if you have assets you would like to fractionalize using the Mattereum system</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/fractional-ownership-rwa-daos-and-the-holy-grail-557b99e8e045">Fractional Ownership, RWA DAOs, and the Holy Grail</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Generative AI has emerged as a transformative force. These advanced large language models can autonomously create content ranging from text to images and even music, offering unprecedented capabilities for creativity and innovation. However, as with any groundbreaking technology, generative AI presents a host of cybersecurity challenges that demand immediate attention.</p>
<p>Understanding Generative AI</p>
<p>Before delving into the cybersecurity challenges, let’s grasp the basics of generative AI. At its core, generative AI employs deep learning techniques to generate data that is almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. ChatGPT, a prime example, has amazed the world with its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, sparking applications in content creation, chatbots, and more. Generative AI models like ChatGPT can be fine-tuned for various tasks, making them incredibly versatile.</p>
<p>The Dual-Edged Sword of Generative AI</p>
<p>The versatility of generative AI is both its greatest strength and a cybersecurity Achilles’ heel. While these algorithms have limitless potential for good, they also possess the capacity to wreak havoc in the wrong hands. Here are some of the significant cybersecurity challenges that arise from generative AI:</p>
 
 Deepfakes and Misinformation: Generative AI can create highly realistic deepfake videos, audio clips, and texts. This poses a severe threat to individuals, organizations, and even governments, as malicious actors can use these creations to spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion, and even impersonate others including important people, celebrities, or even a boss or loved one. 
 Data Privacy and Theft: Generative AI models often require massive amounts of data for training. The misuse of this data, whether through unauthorized access or data breaches, can have catastrophic consequences for individuals and organizations, leading to identity theft, fraud, and privacy violations. 
 Automated Phishing Attacks: Cybercriminals can leverage generative AI to craft highly convincing phishing emails and messages. These messages can mimic the writing style of trusted contacts, making it difficult for users to distinguish between genuine and malicious communication. 
 Content Spam: Generative AI can be exploited to generate vast quantities of spam content, saturating online platforms ranging from social media to forums and open-source code repositories and degrading the user experience. This can result in content poisoning and increased susceptibility to phishing and malware attacks. 
 Adversarial Attacks: Generative AI models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight alterations to input data can produce unexpected and often malicious outputs. This makes it challenging to secure applications that rely on these models, such as image recognition systems and natural language processing. 
 Bias and Discrimination: Generative AI models can inadvertently perpetuate bias and discrimination present in their training data. This raises ethical concerns and can lead to discrimination in various applications, such as hiring processes or content moderation. 
 
<p>Mitigating Generative AI Cybersecurity Challenges</p>
<p>Addressing the cybersecurity challenges associated with generative AI requires a multifaceted approach:</p>
 
 Robust Model Testing: Developers must rigorously test generative AI models to identify vulnerabilities and potential misuse cases. This includes assessing the model’s response to adversarial inputs and ensuring it adheres to ethical guidelines. 
 Data Privacy Measures: Organizations should implement stringent data privacy measures to protect sensitive data used in training generative AI models. Encryption, access controls, and regular security audits are essential. 
 User Education: Raising awareness among users about the existence of generative AI and its potential for misuse is crucial. Users should be educated on how to spot deepfakes, phishing attempts, and other malicious uses of AI-generated content. 
 Regulation and Legislation: Governments and regulatory bodies should establish clear guidelines and regulations for the responsible use of generative AI. These regulations should address issues like data privacy, deepfakes, and the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. 
 Advanced Authentication: Organizations should implement robust authentication mechanisms to protect against AI-generated attacks, such as biometric authentication and phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
 AI Ethics and Bias Mitigation: Developers should prioritize ethical considerations when training generative AI models. Efforts to reduce bias and discrimination in AI-generated content must be ongoing. 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Generative AI holds immense promise for innovation and creativity, but it also presents a host of cybersecurity challenges that cannot be ignored. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from developers, organizations, and governments alike. However, AI is also a great tool for helping us to meet these challenges. Furthermore, by implementing robust security measures, educating users, and regulating the responsible use of generative AI, we can harness its potential while safeguarding against its misuse in an increasingly digital world. The future of generative AI hinges on our ability to navigate these uncharted waters with wisdom and foresight.</p>

  <p>Innovations in cybersecurity have typically taken hold on the business side before making their way to consumers as controls gained broad acceptance. However, with passwordless multi-factor authentication, or MFA, the script is flipped.</p>

<p>Consumers have grown accustomed to logging in to the latest Apple device and web application using biometrics — fingerprint, voice, or facial scanners — instead of typing in passwords that can be lost, forgotten, or stolen. They have embraced the idea of stronger security and a more seamless digital experience by ditching the password and using passwordless authentication.</p>

 "Where's my passwordless MFA?" 

<p>Now, internal employees, contractors, and stakeholders (collectively known as workforce users) are asking the same question: "Where's my passwordless MFA?"</p>

<p>We recently met with <a href="http://www.doubleoctopus.com">Secret Double Octopus</a> (SDO), a leader in workforce passwordless MFA and a collaboration partner in the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/enterprise-connect-passwordless">ForgeRock Enterprise Connect Passwordless</a> solution. We set out to explore this question and outline a realistic path to secure, frictionless passwordless MFA for the workforce. Our discussion revealed that the roadblocks for workforce users have stemmed from three common perceptions — or misperceptions — about passwordless MFA:</p>

  The password policy/2FA/MFA we already have is "good enough" 
	 Passwordless MFA isn't ready for the workforce 
	 The change to get there won't be worth the effort 
  The "good enough" paradox 

<p>Many organizations operate with passwords and some MFA for high-value applications. However, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">Verizon</a> estimates that phishing and compromised credentials still factor into 85% of security breaches. These attacks include modern, highly automated ransomware, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover</a> (ATO), and business email compromise (BEC), and often target crown-jewel assets. In other words, the password approach is not even close to "good enough."</p>

<p>New regulations, security frameworks, and cyber insurance all place a premium on stopping phishing. Businesses continue to invest in education, monitoring and detection, endpoint protection, and cloud security. But most look to MFA and user education to stop the relentless exploitation of user credentials.</p>

<p>While MFA supplements vulnerable passwords, cybercriminals continue to develop sophisticated workarounds like advanced man-in-the-middle (MiTM) and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/how-attackers-are-circumventing-mfa-and-how-stop-them">MFA prompt bombing</a> or "MFA fatigue" attacks that target authentication itself. Modern passwordless methods solve the problem at the source by taking away attackers' ability to exploit passwords or phish users.</p>

<p>But stronger security is just one part of passwordless MFA's compelling value proposition. Many organizations are lulled into thinking their current MFA is good enough, but it won't pass security or regulatory muster, and it will continue to frustrate and perplex users.</p>

 Securing a better user experience 

<p>At the top of many executives' priority list is improving their organizations' security posture, but some place equal or greater importance on improving user experience (UX). Passwords represent a huge hassle for all involved, as employees and help desk technicians waste cycles setting, resetting, and rotating passwords, and improving cyber hygiene.</p>

<p>Horacio Zambrano, CMO at Secret Double Octopus (SDO), says passwordless MFA delivers greater speed and flexibility. "Ideally, you want to deliver a simple, universal login experience that strengthens security and takes the burden of managing passwords away from users," Zambrano says. He noted that "MFA sprawl" — using multiple login screens, devices, and workflows — compounds user frustration. "We all have our phones with us all the time, so using them to authenticate makes great sense. If you can use the same app for everything and eliminate having to remember different passwords for the desktop, VPN access, and web applications, it's a big win. A universal experience with biometrics, and fast, ubiquitous connectivity from a mobile device is as modern as it gets."</p>

<p>Though there may be resistance at first, consumers and employees will flock to solutions that secure their digital identity and data — so long as it's easy. "Change is hard and there's always concern about user inertia," Zambrano says. "But once users experience passwordless and see how it makes their lives easier, they typically love the simplicity."</p>

 Passwordless offers exponentially greater business value 

<p>ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/enterprise-connect-passwordless">Enterprise Connect Passwordless</a> integrates SDO's Octopus platform for passwordless MFA to deliver a greater return on investment (ROI) than traditional MFA methods that rely on passwords. "Organizations can 'buy down' cyber-risk by stopping phishing — and the disruptive breaches that follow — while meeting new compliance mandates and possibly lowering cyber insurance premiums," says Fred Kost, VP of Product and Solutions Marketing at ForgeRock.</p>

<p>Getting rid of passwords eliminates a huge portion of annual help desk calls, each of which costs companies $70 or more on average. When all is said and done, SDO estimates the transition saves organizations nearly $2M within two years of implementing passwordless MFA.</p>

<p>It has the added benefit of reducing administration costs and relieving the burden on IT.</p>

<p>Passwordless MFA delivers the rare trifecta — less risk, less cost, less effort — so why isn't every business doing it already? Where the budget is already earmarked for MFA, the hesitation centers around the second misconception about modern MFA.</p>

 "Is passwordless ready for workforce primetime?" 

<p>Doing away with passwords effectively takes the phish out of the sea by replacing shared secrets with cryptographically strong authentication. But in order to achieve phishing resistance, organizations must be able to upgrade all or most applications to support passwordless, something those in IT generally don't consider feasible. Skeptics continue to question whether passwordless MFA can prove to be robust enough for workforce authentication.</p>

<p>To keep semantics from clouding the benefits, SDO defines passwordless MFA as:</p>

<blockquote><p>Authentication that works for all workforce applications — on-premises, remote, and in the cloud — without requiring users to set, remember, or reset passwords ever again.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Octopus platform decouples user authentication from backend identity management to enable comprehensive coverage for workforce use cases. The decoupling allows companies to extend a safe <a href="https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">passwordless authentication</a> experience to users of any application, including password-centric legacy and custom solutions, without having to retool those apps and directories.</p>

<p>"ForgeRock and SDO give customers the ability to roll out passwordless MFA to any workforce application quickly without retooling applications or disrupting identity infrastructures," says Kost. "Digital identity managers can make changes at any time with a non-technical staff, so you're not always having to involve developers and coders."</p>

<p>The integrated ForgeRock/SDO approach immediately improves security by virtue of fast, easy onboarding, with IT free to modernize the backend identity infrastructure at its optimal pace. Even with a win-win value proposition for employees and IT, it can be hard to navigate change.</p>

 "How much, how soon?" 

<p>Passwordless MFA delivers on ROI — less risk with less effort at less cost — leading some progressive enterprises to become early adopters. Once the passwordless MFA champion in your organization gains support for the project, the question becomes, "Where do we start?"</p>

<p>Though not always easy, answering this question produces valuable insight into priorities:</p>

<blockquote>
	  Should you start with high-profile users likely to be targeted by spear-phishing or "whaling" attacks? 
		 Should you start with remote workers and VPN users authenticating via the open internet? 
		 Or should you start with the group that, for whatever reason, requires inordinate support to reset and rotate their passwords? Or the one that requires detailed auditing to solidify compliance? 
	 </blockquote>

<p>There may be no one right answer, but there is at least one solid best practice to follow: don't tackle too much too soon.</p>

<p>"The implementation of passwordless login doesn't need to happen all at once; it can be something you roll out over time and get there incrementally," says Kost.</p>

<p>For example, the first phase might include entering a username and having that trigger a prompt for passwordless authentication that helps users become accustomed to logging in using biometrics. The next step might be taking the username and password out of the user workflow, and the final stage getting rid of passwords completely.</p>

<p>"The greatest successes we see are when customers choose one or two applications to start with and get those done within the first year," says Kost. "Where we see projects go sideways is when companies try to do something for everybody all at once and the whole project gets derailed. Initially, we advise taking things in bite-size increments."</p>

 Security, simplicity, and savings — in time to meet new mandates 

<p>Together, ForgeRock and SDO deliver enterprise-class security with consumer-grade simplicity. The combination may be the key to surviving pressure from cybercriminals and regulators alike.</p>

<p>"We're already seeing Zero Trust mandates from the Biden administration and other governments worldwide specifically calling for phishing-resistant MFA," SDO's Zambrano says. "It's only a matter of time before most if not all security standards and frameworks do the same and acknowledge that phishing-resistance requires a passwordless approach to authentication."</p>

<p>ForgeRock's Kost concurs. "Companies that upgrade now or go directly to passwordless will be lightyears ahead of the game compliance-wise. More importantly, they'll be far less likely to get hit with ransomware and other attacks that put data at risk and companies out of business."</p>

<p>By Sheridan Johns, co-founder of <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, and Leonard Dorlöchter, co-founder at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peaq.network/">peaq</a></p><p>Let’s play a game: We give you the setup, and you come up with a punchline. Here we go — what does Italy have in common with Twitter’s ex-Chief Twit and the creators staging an online protest at ArtStation? “They all know how to make a statement that goes&nbsp;viral!”</p><p>The above punchline was proudly brought to you by none other than ChatGPT, everyone’s favorite AI overlord, but this questionable sense of humor is not what got the model a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65139406">temporary ban</a> in Italy. The country restricted access to the application due to the concerns over user privacy and data. Rome lifted the restrictions after tweaks that allowed users to opt out of letting OpenAI use their dialogues with ChatGPT to help train&nbsp;it.</p><p>Data, or rather its allegedly <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1648784955655192577?s=20">illegal</a> usage, was also what prompted Elon Musk to lash out at Microsoft, accusing it of using Twitter’s data to train an AI model. After all, user data is a crucial pillar of the business model embraced by today’s social media platforms and Big Tech in general. By harvesting user data, they can hyper-personalize the ads they feed to their users to the point where it sometimes feels like they know us better than we know ourselves.</p><p>And, as you have correctly guessed it, data was at the heart of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/artstation-artists-stage-mass-protest-against-ai-generated-artwork/">ArtStation protests</a> against AI-generated imagery. Art is also a type of data, the kind you need to train a model with hardcore applied statistics to approximate an artist’s genius. The same goes for literature, music, and pretty much anything else. If it can be created, it can also be turned into data, and if it can be turned into data, you can train a model that can generate more data of the same&nbsp;sort.</p><p>So yes, data is the punchline. But as the age of AI takes off, this punchline will draw only a few laughs — and a ton of&nbsp;turmoil.</p><p>New oil, new&nbsp;clashes</p><p>In the age of AI, data is indeed the new oil, as old as this Big Data-era wisdom may sound. It’s the fuel that drives machine learning, the core technology powering AI, and scale is the name of the game: In most cases, the more data you throw in the machine-learning furnace, the better the model you&nbsp;get.</p><p>And much like oil, again, data isn’t just a resource, but a source of power. Whoever controls the spice, controls the universe, and whoever controls the data, controls the future of the AI&nbsp;boom.</p><p>While we hopefully won’t see data being a factor in actual wars, the age of AI will surely see its fair share of spats and arguments over who gets to do what with data. Even though it’s not regarded as a finite resource, and is easily replicated with a good ol’ copy-paste, there is a zero-sum game element here. If Alice owns the data Bob needs to train his BobGPT, she has a vested interest in making sure he’s not doing that for&nbsp;free.</p><p>While she’s at it, though, Alice may want to seriously consider another piece of this puzzle:&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>At a first glance, there’s an inherent tension between AI and privacy. While training an AI model takes vast amounts of data, the way this data is being harvested often infringes on our privacy. In some cases, as it apparently happened with <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/privacy/ftc-facebook-broke-terms-5b-data-privacy-settlement">Meta</a>, this violation is more clear-cut, and in others, as with the artists’ protest, it is more nuanced. Part of the dataset that StableDiffusion was trained on came from the publicly-available art on ArtStation, and its result is a model that you can use for commercial and non-commercial purposes alike… with some terms and conditions. So it’s not too difficult to see why the creators were outraged.</p><p>AI’s privacy struggles are indicative of a larger and more deep-seated issue. The digital economy’s business model is predicated on surveillance and monetization of user data. This model, often referred to as “surveillance capitalism,” goes against privacy if not in the letter, but definitely in the spirit. The advent of AI will only kick this problem into a whole new&nbsp;gear.</p><p>So while data is growing more valuable by the day, all the disputes we’ve seen so far are just the tip of the iceberg, in terms of companies and platforms clashing over data ownership, as well as users and regulators protesting the infringement on privacy. But what if there was a way to reconcile AI’s insatiable hunger for data with the need for&nbsp;privacy?</p><p>Enter Web3, the next evolution of the internet, where users, not tech companies, are in control of their data, and enter the second part of this blog post, published by peaq, the Web3 network powering the Economy of Things (EoT).

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 12th September to 25th September <p>Welcome to the latest edition of our Veriscope Crypto Regulatory Newsletter, your trusted source for the latest regulatory developments shaping the global cryptocurrency space.</p><p>In this edition, we will navigate through the evolving regulatory frameworks in the European Union and the United Kingdom, touching on significant legislations like the DAC8 and the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill and highlighting the collaborative endeavors of regulatory bodies with crypto enterprises.</p><p>We will also glance at Malta’s alignment with the MiCA regulation and scrutinize the broader international call for harmonized cryptocurrency oversight.</p> Emerging EU Regulations Set Global Precedence <p>European Union: The crystallization of crypto regulations within the European Union is casting ripples through the global financial waters.</p><p>Recently, DAC8, a directive empowering tax authorities, received robust backing in the European Parliament, indicating a united front in the enhanced oversight of crypto transactions to curb tax evasion and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>This directive aligns itself with the overarching MiCA legislation and the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), forming a cohesive monitoring network for all EU-based crypto transactions.</p><p>However, the critics argue that DAC8 barely differentiates itself from CARF, potentially impacting individual member states’ autonomy in digital oversight.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1702377358898962724?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The United Kingdom: Parallelly, the United Kingdom is on the cusp of endorsing the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill.</p><p>This legislation, sharpened over time, is aimed at addressing financial crimes related to digital currencies. It underlines the necessity for precise modifications to maintain focus on illicit funds while upholding corporate integrity.</p><p>Additionally, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK is actively seeking collaboration with crypto businesses. Their ambition is to forge balanced and conducive guidelines that foster growth while ensuring a stronghold on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing protocols.</p><p>Malta: Venturing south, Malta’s Financial Services Authority (MFSA) is aligning its stance with MiCA, illustrating a worldwide movement towards unified regulatory frameworks.</p><p>This adaptation is critical for establishing orderly transition and operational stability in the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1704505385430695991?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>International Perspective: The concerted movement towards comprehensive regulation is reflective of a wider international push for harmonized oversight.</p><p>The European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) advocates for such harmonization, spotlighting the disjointed policies prevalent in the U.S. and spotlighting potential risks inherent to varied regulatory actions across the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>These unfolding regulatory developments depict a balanced interplay between innovation and governance in the crypto realm, raising pivotal questions about the convergence of international crypto norms and the future trajectory of the digital financial ecosystem.</p><p>The repercussions of these regulatory symphonies will inevitably sculpt the crypto landscape, defining its global resonance and directional flow.</p><p>Now, let’s analyze two of these major developments and look into their possible impact on the broader crypto ecosystem.</p> UK Nears Crucial Legislative Milestone: A Closer Look at the Impending Crypto Regulations <p>The UK’s meticulous legislative journey around cryptocurrency regulation is poised at a critical juncture, with the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill inching closer to becoming&nbsp;law.</p><p>Initiated last September, the legislation aims to alleviate financial crime concerns linked to cryptocurrencies, having evolved through extensive evaluations.</p><p>The bill seeks to preserve the focus on funds accrued from illicit activities while clarifying corporate integrity guidelines, especially for foreign entities operating within the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also articulated its willingness to work with crypto enterprises to formulate a holistic regulatory framework, emphasizing mutual cooperation and adherence to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing protocols.</p> The Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects:   Enhanced Trust and Legitimacy: The collaborative approach between regulators and industry could elevate trust and legitimacy within the&nbsp;sector.  Market Stability: Clear, well-defined guidelines could contribute to greater market stability and reduced fraudulent activities.   Negative Aspects:   Operational Constraints: Strict adherence to the regulatory framework may impose operational constraints on crypto entities, potentially impacting innovation.  Market Participation: The stringent regulatory environment might deter new entrants and could influence market dynamics, impacting both consumers and businesses.   EU Urges Non-EU Regulators for Tighter Crypto Oversight <p>The European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) has underscored the critical need for cohesive regulation in the global cryptocurrency market, especially beyond the European Union, as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) Act progresses towards its December 2024 enactment.</p><p>The EPRS report warns of potential risks to the EU’s financial system and autonomy, citing divergent policies in the U.S. and anticipated regulatory divergence between the UK and the EU, which could lead to a lack of legal clarity and regulatory certainty.</p> The Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects:   International Cohesion: The EPRS’s emphasis on unified regulations could propel a movement toward international cohesion in crypto policies, potentially fostering a harmonized global environment for crypto development and investment.  Enhanced Legitimacy: The pursuit of regulatory alignment can elevate the legitimacy of the crypto sector, possibly resulting in increased trust and participation from both individual and institutional stakeholders.   Negative Aspects:   Regulatory Overreach: The call for tighter oversight may spur stringent and inflexible regulatory frameworks, possibly imposing barriers to entry and constraining the dynamism inherent to the crypto industry.

<p>As a healthcare activist, a mom to a fertility preservation miracle, a business owner and a cancer survivor,&nbsp;<a href="https://ovumhealth.com/team-1">Alice Crisci</a>&nbsp;has dedicated her life to ending the spread of health misinformation. She founded&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medanswers.com/">MedAnswers</a> and its telemedicine spinout, <a href="https://ovumhealth.com/">Ovum Health</a>,&nbsp;with the hopes of providing increased access to family-building solutions like pre-pregnancy, prenatal and postnatal healthcare.</p>



<p>Ovum Health’s platform provides medical software, clinical decision support, advanced lab testing and analytics to deliver a personalized approach to a healthy pregnancy. With the generative AI boom in full effect, Crisci decided it was time to enlist a partner that could scale Ovum’s web and mobile app-based chat and scheduling solution with AI.</p>



 Embedding IBM AI capabilities to drive the digital front door to Ovum’s network 



<p>After evaluating many products and partners, Ovum turned to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus">IBM Ecosystem</a> and IBM watsonx Assistant to build transformative digital service wherever patients might be. IBM helped Ovum embed watsonx Assistant in their website and mobile application, called FertilityAnswers Bot.</p>



<p>The bot addresses personal and private fertility questions vetted by a panel of board-certified healthcare experts engaged by Ovum. The solution also features a scheduling component that allows patients to schedule medical appointments in available states.</p>



<p>With over 67,000 registered FertilityAnswers iOS and Android users on Ovum Health’s free question-and-answer platform, the bot can interact with patients at scale while maintaining the care and empathy of a healthcare professional. Since 2017, the FertilityAnswers network of more than 400 medical professionals has been providing responses to anonymous user questions, but the company was concerned about scaling their volunteer-based system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through the collaboration with IBM, Ovum Health’s FertilityAnswers App in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fertilityanswers/id1418650176">iOS</a> has been updated with the IBM-powered bot now driving the first question-and-answer interaction for users. The “Ask a Question” button in the app, newly integrated with IBM watsonx Assistant capabilities, includes the first 150 questions and answers from Ovum Health’s content library of 18,000 user-generated questions with clinically validated responses provided by multidisciplinary reproductive experts engaged by Ovum.</p>



<p>The FertilityAnswers Bot is a powerful tool that helps people with fertility concerns get the information they need to help them make decisions about their healthcare. It is a confidential and convenient way to get clinically validated responses to questions about fertility, and it can also connect people with the right medical care providers in the Ovum Health network which takes both Medicaid and commercial insurance in certain states.</p>



 A no-code solution with long-term technical benefits 



<p>When IBM works with partners like Ovum, they help stakeholders identify the return on investment (ROI) of embedding IBM’s AI technology into their products and services, and then IBM helps partners take that technology to market. IBM assisted Ovum Health in the creation of a no-code platform for an AI assistant that leverages natural language models—which became the FertilityAnswers Bot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using a no-code platform as the foundation of the FertilityAnswers Bot allowed Ovum to fully integrate watsonx Assistant into its web interface and iOS app in less than two months. The company now expects to scale its user base in a way that was not possible before. Ovum also expects to drive appointment setting for its telemedicine clinics.</p>



<p>Ovum continues to work with IBM to develop new AI-powered solutions. The IBM <a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus/isv">Build Fund</a> provides financial support to Ovum as well as other early-stage startups that are developing innovative AI solutions.</p>

<p>Amid the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">global data privacy crisis</a>, where <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">concerns</a> about online <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> and safety continue to grow, individuals and businesses are increasingly turning to <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/safe-browsing/">safe browsing</a> and <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/cyber-safety/virtual-private-network/">virtual private networks</a> (VPNs) for protection. In fact, over the past few years, global advisory companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">McKinsey</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">Cisco</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/trusted-tech.html">PwC</a>&nbsp;have identified that:<br>&nbsp;</p>



 
 High profile, significant, and regular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;have spooked consumers.&nbsp; 



 Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data.&nbsp; 



 Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can. 



 Consumers will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a>&nbsp;brands or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay&nbsp;purchases</a>&nbsp;where they perceive a risk to their personal data. 



 The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers. 
 



<p><br>None of this is a surprise: we’ve said for a while now that privacy is a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">defining issue</a>&nbsp;of this decade, which means it makes good business sense to offer powerful privacy and security tools wherever you can. We believe one of the most lucrative product combinations is safe browsing and VPNs and here are 4 reasons why:</p>







<p></p>



 1. Safe browsing and VPNs safeguard user data and build a foundation of trust for your brand 



<p>Safe browsing and VPNs go hand in hand for protecting user data from malicious threats and unauthorized access. A safe browsing product gives access to private browsers, ad and tracker blockers, and site reputation services, while a VPN encrypts the user’s internet traffic and activity and keeps it safe from prying eyes. Offering both products sends a clear privacy-first message to your customers and employees, can attract new customers from the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">growing cohort</a> demanding strong privacy protection, and sets a foundation of trust and security that promotes brand loyalty and more revenue.</p>



 2. Offering safe browser and VPN expands your target markets 



<p>With incidents of data breaches and other privacy infringements growing annually, more <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers are actively seeking</a> secure online experiences. By integrating safe browsing and VPNs into your online business model, you could reach those <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">target markets</a> whose concerns for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">privacy and security</a> are high and growing. And, typically, the more customers the more revenue, right?</p>



 3. Your brand can monetize its VPN service, which is especially attractive in some key industries 



<p>Many VPN providers offer subscription-based models, giving users access to enhanced privacy features, region-restricted content, and faster internet connections. By partnering with a reputable VPN provider and offering their services as part of your business package or as an upsell, you could create an additional revenue stream. This is particularly relevant for businesses operating in industries where data privacy and secure online communication are paramount, such as finance, legal services, and healthcare.</p>



 4. Brands that get privacy and safety right will disrupt the market 



<p>It’s a clever move to decide that data privacy will be your brand’s competitive advantage. The 2020 PwC Trusted Tech&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/trusted-tech.html">report</a>&nbsp;put it like this: Brands that get consumer trust and safety right will disrupt the market. In fact, nine out of 10 business leaders said that building and maintaining customer trust will be&nbsp;the&nbsp;competitive advantage of this decade. The <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">privacy actives</a> first reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">Cisco</a>&nbsp;see respect for privacy as central to the brands with whom they want to do business. Brands that take conscious, positive steps to protect their customers’ privacy and safety and put privacy tools in their hands will come out the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">winners</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>So, it makes good business sense to build the products that consumers want. Leading brands are already building <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy by design</a> into consumer applications, and delivering products and services that offer security and privacy by default. You can too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a perfect world, there would be no ransomware, phishing, or unauthorized access. Every resource you need is right at your fingertips. Security is a given, regardless of user identity, device, or location. And here’s the best part: Your organization would be safe and sound, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Sounds perfect, right?</p>
<p>Sadly, this dream scenario is exactly that — just make-believe. In the real world, bad actors are targeting your sensitive data in leaps and bounds. They’re evaluating your organization’s defenses, testing its network security, and taking note of every weakness. All the while, insider threats and unwitting employees are leaking credentials, exposing the organization to potential attacks from the open web.</p>
<p>So, how can you be sure your users are who they say they are? The answer is strong and continuous authentication. As one of the basic building blocks of a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> architecture, your enterprise must have a series of user verification strategies at its disposal.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure where to begin, don’t worry. Read on to learn how you can start implementing Zero Trust throughout your organization with a series of strong authentication procedures.</p>
 The role of user authentication in enterprise security 
<p>In simple terms, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/authenticators">authentication</a> is the process of identifying users who request access to a system, network, data, server, application, device, or other company asset.<br>
The goal is simple: Ensure a user is who they claim to be. Once authenticated, the user encounters an authorization process that determines whether they can access whatever resource they requested.</p>
 Why is strong authentication important? 
<p>Authentication is foundational to cybersecurity in general. It enables your security team to ensure that only authorized users can access protected network resources, such as applications, databases, and more.</p>
<p>Although authenticating users has always been critical, it’s even more important given the rising demand for remote access. It’s becoming increasingly difficult for classic security tools to verify identities now that people are requesting access across a sprawling and distributed environment. From Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policies to cloud applications, the authentication process is more complex than ever before.</p>
<p>Perhaps most significantly, strong authentication is essential to Zero Trust security (but more on that later).</p>
 How does authentication work? 
<p>Traditionally, most organizations deploy password-based authentication processes. Users type in their credentials, the system checks them against a directory, and if it finds a match the user is granted network access.</p>
<p>However, for many enterprises, this is merely a one-and-done process. The user identity is confirmed once and assumed to be trustworthy for the duration of the session. That’s a problem, and here’s why:</p>
<p>If a hacker manages to get hold of a user’s credentials, they’d gain unfettered and unauthorized access to any number of critical applications, allowing them to exfiltrate, manipulate, or destroy sensitive data with ease. And in fact, that’s exactly how the majority of cyber incidents begin. According to Verizon’s 2021 Data Breach report, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-2021-data-breach-investigations-report">stolen or compromised credentials</a> are the most common attack vector, accounting for almost two-thirds of all breaches.</p>
<p>One way to mitigate this risk is to use more granular access control policies. This means restricting permissions based on user identity and other parameters, thereby reducing the impact of a compromised credential. Whereas some people may have the authority to open one resource, others may not have the same permission.</p>
<p>However, even with strict access management policies, organizations may still be vulnerable to attack. Bad actors don’t take their foot off the gas; they simply get more focused, homing in on “high-value” credentials as their primary targets.</p>
<p>Simply put, privileged accounts open more doors than the average identity. Hackers consider users with privileged access especially high-value targets, as these accounts have more access and typically are authorized to use an organization’s most critical assets. When the locks on these doors are cracked, there’s almost nothing stopping bad actors from using a wealth of corporate information for nefarious purposes. For instance, a cybercriminal may leverage stolen data in exchange for ransom payment or sell it to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>Worse yet, these attacks are often successful. Roughly <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/about-26-million-fortune-1000-employee-credentials-available-on-the-dark-web-password-reuse-rampant/">540 million assets</a> associated with Fortune 1,000 employees were circulating the internet in 2021 — a 29% increase compared to 2020. This total included over 133,000 C-suite credentials, marking an average of almost 26,000 stolen passwords per organization.</p>
 Challenges of traditional authentication 
<p>Organizations are likely to be more vulnerable to attack if they stick with their security status quo. Traditional authentication and secure access tools are falling short of the mark. Why? Because they’re running into several obstacles that have rendered them inadequate:</p>
 
 Implicit trust: Classic network security tools and authenticators run on a policy of implicit trust, meaning they assume all users, devices, and so on are inherently trustworthy once they’ve been authenticated. 
 Lack of visibility: Legacy methods are often siloed and aren’t scalable. This makes it difficult to enforce a comprehensive access policy across the entire enterprise. 
 Weak password security: Many authenticators are still password-based. This is worrisome given that <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/06/10/employees-reuse-passwords-across-multiple-work-accounts/">over half of employees</a> reuse passwords for multiple accounts across applications and services. More often than not these are weak passwords that are easy to break or guess. If they fall into the wrong hands, it could spell disaster. 
 No context or risk signals: Traditional tools may not be context-aware or take important risk signals into account, such as device security, location, and so on. 
 
<p>It should also be noted that some authentication strategies are burdensome on the user experience. They may derail productivity or require employees to jump through hoops, so organizations should bear this in mind when designing authentication schemes.</p>
 What is strong authentication for Zero Trust? 
<p>The Zero Trust security model assumes all users, devices, applications, and resources are vulnerable at any given time. It considers all connections potential threats, even after they’ve already been verified. By eliminating implicit trust, this framework mandates strong and continuous authentication and reduces the risk of a stolen credential compromising the rest of your security posture.</p>
<p>Generally, there are three concepts fundamental to a Zero Trust architecture. They apply to all areas of cybersecurity, including access control and authentication. These include:</p>
 
 Continuous authentication: The Zero Trust framework advocates for explicit verification based on multiple risk signals, including user identity, device, location, workload, sensitive data classification, and more. Moreover, organizations must constantly evaluate these signals every time a request is made to access a resource or data — not just once at the beginning of a session. 
 Least privilege access: This extremely granular access policy limits user access only to the specific network resources required to do someone’s job or complete certain tasks. 
 Assume Breach: With inevitable breaches, it is critical to minimize the blast radius during a cyberattack through strong encryption and segmentation of users, devices, and networks. 
 
<p>When organizations apply Zero Trust principles to user access, they’re effectively creating a Zero Trust authentication process. This includes three basic steps:</p>
 
 Once a user requests access, they must verify their identity through <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA). In its simplest form, this involves providing a combination of identity factors such as a username, password, or one-time passcode. A truly robust Zero Trust architecture will deploy more advanced MFA techniques, such as phishing-resistant MFA with continuous risk assessment (but more on that later). 
 The device in use must also be authenticated to ensure it complies with the requisite security policies. 
 Once both are authenticated, they are then authorized to access the desired resource — but no more. Because the Zero Trust model advocates for continuous authentication, the user is continuously evaluated and verified in the background during every access request to ensure their identity hasn’t been compromised during a session. Additionally, this helps the organization enforce the principle of least privilege. 
 
 Benefits of strong authentication for Zero Trust 
<p>Implementing the Zero Trust framework has plenty of advantages. For example, strong authentication allows you to:</p>
 
 Prevent lateral movement through continuous authentication, thereby minimizing the attack surface. 
 Expedite threat detection by increasing visibility across the corporate network as well as public and private cloud environments. 
 Improve security policy enforcement through repeated, continuous authentication. 
 
 Supporting Zero Trust with layered authentication strategies 
<p>Zero Trust security draws upon a range of identity and access management (IAM) technologies, including cloud security, identity protection, and encryption.</p>
<p>The more effectively organizations implement these solutions, the more mature their security posture. However, it’s impossible to truly advance your place on the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/zero-trust-maturity-model/">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> without strong authentication.</p>
<p>There’s a vast ocean of authentication options available, ranging from basic to advanced. Each operates a bit differently, but all serve the same purpose. Rather than choosing just one, your security may deploy a combination of the following methods:</p>
 Single sign-on (SSO) 
<p>SSO allows the user to authenticate once across multiple applications or services with a single identity. The benefit of this approach is that you don’t have to remember a mixed bag of login credentials, making it exceptionally easy and user-friendly.</p>
<p>SSO helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access. On the downside, it can create a single point of failure, which is why it’s wise to implement multiple layers of authentication.</p>
 Multi-factor authentication 
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Multi-factor authentication</a> requires a user to provide at least two verification factors to receive access to a particular resource. These factors include:</p>
 
 Knowledge 
 Possession 
 Biometrics 
 Location 
 
<p>There are many types of MFA, but phishing-resistant passwordless MFA is considered one of the safest. This method doesn’t require a static password, instead using a combination of biometrics and digital certificates or security keys to act as verification.</p>
 Device authentication 
<p>The Zero Trust model recognizes the fact that remote access is greatly lengthening the classic network perimeter. Therefore, it encourages authentication strategies that account for all levels of risk, including those at the device level.</p>
<p>Organizations can deploy a variety of authenticators to verify device security. These may involve provisioning digital certificates on each device, evaluating its reputation, and more. Combining user and device certificate-based authentication provides the highest level of assurance for identities and protects against phishing and MFA bypass attacks.</p>
 Risk-based authentication 
<p>Also known as risk-based step-up or <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/adaptive-authentication">adaptive authentication</a>, this strategy evaluates the risk associated with a user or device. If the risk is deemed to be too high, it issues another challenge or denies the request outright based on the risk levels configured by the administrator.</p>
<p>This method is context-aware, meaning it factors various attributes into the authorization decision. It monitors user activity and dynamically adjusts authentication requirements, thereby “stepping up” security when it’s needed most.</p>
 Challenges of implementing Zero Trust 
<p>Unfortunately, embarking on a Zero Trust journey is easier said than done, especially as it relates to authentication. There are several roadblocks you may face that could complicate the process, including:</p>
 
 Complexity: Implementing Zero Trust can be difficult, especially in large and expansive IT infrastructures. Integrating a robust authentication framework requires careful planning and execution. 
 User experience: It can be challenging to strike the right balance between security and a frictionless user experience. Ideally, organizations want to enforce policies and authenticate identities without hindering productivity and only adding friction to the process when necessary. 
 Legacy technology: Custom or legacy applications and systems may not integrate well with modern methods. Adapting legacy systems to fit within the Zero Trust architecture could require significant effort. 
 Scalability: Growing organizations need IAM solutions that will evolve alongside them without skipping a beat. Scaling up Zero Trust technologies to accommodate new users, devices, and applications can be difficult without the right guidance.

			 The APAC Tokenization Region is Heating Up 
 
<p>Compared to many other regions around the world, the APAC region has consistently been one of the leaders at the forefront of technological advancement. This is a familiar concept to us as most of Tokeny’s initial clients were domiciled here.</p>
<p>With boots on the ground once again, we were pleasantly surprised by some of the discussions we were having in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>While many crypto-centric events over the years have often sidestepped tokenization topics, our recent engagements at Korea Blockchain Week, Token2049, and Digital Assets Week in Singapore suggested a positive shift. The momentum seems to be swinging back in our favor, evidenced by our substantive conversations with leading financial institutions and banks.</p>
<p>We particularly observed a consistent sentiment among the region’s leading financial players, one that resonated with our longstanding vision:</p>
<p>To develop a standardized, shared, and open-source protocol tailored for permissioned use-cases, with an emphasis on tokenized securities.</p>
<p>Many are realizing that for true sustainable liquidity and to harness the full potential of blockchain, relying solely on private blockchains and siloed ecosystems isn’t the optimal approach.</p>
<p>Although these private systems offer a foundational understanding of tokenization, their inherent limitations could counteract the advancements made.</p>
<p>One driving factor behind institutions’ preference for private blockchains is the apprehension about compliance enforcement on public blockchains. In response, Tokeny initially developed the open-source ERC3643 to address this. When integrated with ONCHAINID, it ensures on-chain compliance enforcement.</p>
<p>It’s clear to us that the global capital markets are on a steadfast journey towards comprehensive on-chain operations in a compliant environment, bringing the vision of tokenization closer to fruition.</p>
<p>A special acknowledgment goes to our new partners, the Klaytn Foundation in South Korea, for their immense support and hospitality. We eagerly await the opportunity to return the gesture when you join us in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>During our time in Asia, we had the honor and pleasure to speak on panels and participate in collaborative conversations with other tokenization leaders.</p>

  Have you ever experienced a major IT outage caused by issues with directory services such as Microsoft Active Directory? If not, you surely have heard about others that came into trouble here. Directory Services, with the Microsoft Active Directory still forming an essential part of the IT backbone in about 90% of medium-sized to large organizations, are critical for a working IT. If they fail, authentication fails (or, at best, stumbles). If data gets “corrupted”, this even can lead to the propagation of erroneous changes to other systems. SAP systems not working anymore because mass deletions from AD were propagated to SAP are not a one-of-a-kind disaster.

Directory Services must work. And if they fail, you must be able to put them back to work again rapidly. This requires a plan. This is where DR (Disaster Recovery) comes into play. It is not just about a tool for backup and for restore. DR is about a plan on how to restore, about defined responsibilities, about exercises, etc.

It also is aligned to monitoring of systems and to ITDR (Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response): When do you need to act?

<p></p><p>Web5 prescribes that users maintain control of their content by <a>decoupling their identity and data</a> from the applications that they use. I'm frequently asked why major companies, who have made billions of dollars off of our data, would buy into this model.</p><p>I challenge you to think of this from a different perspective. In the ever-evolving technological landscape, Web5 is not a call to convince the giants to relinquish control over our data, but about expanding what's possible on the web.</p><p>A decentralized app model might not immediately grab the attention of today's market leaders, but it opens up exciting possibilities for the innovators of tomorrow, particularly around open data models.</p> The Incentive<a title="Direct link to The Incentive">​</a> <p>Web5 enables a web that eliminates the traditional barriers of centralized data control. Developers who resonate with this philosophy, or those intrigued by the many advantages of a decentralized approach, will find Web5 to be a vast playground.</p><p>Let's take AI-driven applications as an example. Through today's lens, it may appear that data equates to unparalleled value and thus, retaining control of that data would be attractive. However, as AI technologies evolve, they increasingly depend on rich, diverse, and open datasets — the kind that are best obtained by participating in a more open, decentralized data ecosystem.</p><p>But this shift isn't limited to AI. Web5 creates an ideal setting for innovation for all sorts of companies from many different verticals. Up-and-coming apps, unburdened by legacy systems and the status quo, can fully embrace the benefits of Web5, paving the way for a new era of web applications. This unique advantage allows them to immediately offer something that top companies don't: the ability for users to take their data with them.</p> Consumer Expectations<a title="Direct link to Consumer Expectations">​</a> <p>Here’s where things get interesting. As early adopters interact with and understand the value of applications built on Web5, their demands will shift. They'll start to expect more portability and interoperability of their data between applications across the web. In time, this change in expectations will exert pressure even on larger players to adapt or offer similar flexibility.</p><p>We’ve seen this unfold with products like Google Search and StackOverflow in the wake of <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>. These players have dominated their respective markets for quite some time. Not even a year ago, the thought of a new app threatening these business models seemed improbable... comical even. And yet, almost overnight, we saw consumers’ expectations change. All of a sudden, asking a question and clicking through multiple links to get to the answer felt outdated. Dealing with snarky users in order to get technical help no longer seemed worth the trouble.</p><p>This new expectation forced these companies, who are the market leaders in their spaces, to reassess their business models and innovate accordingly in order to appease their user base.</p> The Journey to Adoption<a title="Direct link to The Journey to Adoption">​</a> <p>Here’s how I envision the journey of Web5 adoption.</p><p></p> Evolution<a title="Direct link to Evolution">​</a> <p>It’s worth emphasizing that Web5 isn’t about replacing the old with the new, but an invitation to explore a new application model. It's about enabling a world where data isn't hoarded, but shared, and where developers can create applications free of traditional restraints.</p><p>In this unfolding story of the web's evolution, it's not the dominant players who will dictate the narrative. Instead, the stage is set for those who see beyond the status quo, for applications that redefine what's possible, and for consumers who champion their own data rights.</p><p>Web5 is less about disruption and more about evolution; the future awaits those brave enough to embrace it.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Maintaining the privacy of our personal data is crucial for our safety and the safety of our loved ones as we navigate the online world. However, the question arises: how anonymous can we be before losing our sense of “self” in the sea of faceless identities?</p>
<p>SelfKey introduces a possible solution with Customizable <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NTFs), called Normies.</p>
<p>SelfKey iD may be the best approach to managing digital identities with the data owner at the helm. And, by attaching Normies to a SelfKey iD, individuals may be able to build the outer layer of their online identity. With a wide variety of digital assets that can be combined in countless ways, Normies can be designed directly by the user, so that they will fit the user’s personal preference or needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, individuals may continue to express their personality and creativity online, while keeping the security of their valuable, private information.</p>
<p>In this article, we will thoroughly explore the possibilities SelfKey’s NFT packs offer, as well as how to obtain and mint them.</p>

 SelfKey iD and NFTs 
 A brief introduction of SelfKey iD 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative approach to online identity verification which may be a better solution than traditional KYC (know your customer) checks. It emphasizes digital security and privacy, so that individuals may safely navigate the online world.</p>
<p>One of the key <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">benefits</a> of SelfKey iD is its ease of use and affordability, which may make it more accessible to users. The overall process is streamlined and easier, removing the need for complex and time-consuming traditional KYC checks. This may not only save time for users but also reduce costs associated with the verification process.</p>
<p>Additionally, the onboarding process with SelfKey iD is quick and efficient, which may enable users to establish their online identity swiftly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, SelfKey iD eliminates the need for repeated collection and storage of personally identifiable information (PII). Existing KYC checks are reused, which may lower the risk of PII display and reduce the potential for identity theft. This may enhance the overall security and privacy of users' personal information, which is crucial in today's data-driven world.</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey iD may provide a more accessible, efficient, and secure solution for establishing online identity while enhancing user privacy.&nbsp;</p>
 SelfKey iD and NFTs 
<p>The ability to customize one's digital identity can be a powerful tool for self-expression. Individuals may be able to showcase their personality, creativity, and style in the online world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To increase user-friendliness, SelfKey introduces a unique feature that allows users to attach a distinct NFT series to their SelfKey iD profile picture. This innovative component may not only add a touch of personalization and originality to the user's digital identity but it also reflects the growing trend of NFTs in the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By embracing the boundless possibilities of this new element, individuals may have the opportunity to develop a digital avatar that perfectly aligns with their unique preferences and interests.</p>
<p>This customization aspect may empower users to truly own and personalize their digital presence. Such an element may result in a sense of ownership and confidence in their virtual identity. Furthermore, it may lead to a more immersive and enjoyable user experience. Members can express themselves in a way that reflects their individuality while increasing their privacy.</p>
<p>The addition of the NFT series feature to the SelfKey iD platform is a testament to SelfKey's commitment to user-friendliness, personalization, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
 SelfKey’s Customizable NTFs 
 The Normies Project 
<p>The Normies Project aims to offer individuals an unparalleled experience in the world of digital assets. It consists of two well defined NFT collections, each with its own unique features and offerings:</p>
 
 Base NFTs 
 Wearables 
 
 What are Base NFTs? 
<p>Base NFTs are equipable avatars that can be personalized with wearables to dress up one’s Normies. With Base NFTs, all verified users&nbsp; may have the power to mint their own avatar. As there is no maximum supply, Base NFTs allow for limitless creativity and customization.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, every SelfKey iD owner will receive one free Base NFT, making it accessible to all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users may express their individuality by customizing their own avatar with a wide range of wearables. Furthermore, they may use their Normies in virtual spaces, social gatherings, and gaming adventures.</p>
 How to obtain a Base NTF Avatar 
<p>Obtaining a Base NTF Avatar may be an exciting step towards personalizing your virtual identity in the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process is rather simple:</p>
 
 To begin, you'll need to go through a simple <a href="https://selfkey.org/a-guide-to-using-selfkey-id-for-digital-identity-verification/">verification process</a>. 
 Once you're verified, you'll gain access to the standard customizations available for your Base NFT Avatar. This may allow you to create a unique digital representation of yourself. 
 After customizing your Base NFT Avatar, you can mint it for free, making it officially yours in the virtual world.&nbsp; 
 With your Base NFT in hand, you have the option to further enhance your avatar by purchasing wearable packs. Community members may sell these packs, along with individual NFTs, on OpenSea and other popular NFT marketplaces. 
 
<p>These wearables and NFTs may help you express your personality, interests, and style within the metaverse. Likewise, they may add a layer of originality and individuality to your digital presence.</p>
 What are wearables? 
<p>Wearables are an exciting addition to the world of NFTs, offering users the ability to further customize and personalize their Base NFT avatars.</p>
<p>From hairstyles to shirts, hats, and beyond, wearables come in various categories, allowing users to express their individuality and style in the metaverse. By adding wearables to their Base NFTs, users can increase the rarity of their NFTs, making them even more unique.</p>
<p>Obtaining wearables is typically done through NFT packs. These packs may contain a wide selection of digital items that users can add to their avatars. The packs may also allow users to acquire new wearables to enhance their Base NFT avatars. This way, users may feel a thrilling experience of discovery.</p>
<p>With wearables, users have the power to transform their digital personas into something truly one-of-a-kind. This gives users a good opportunity to showcase their creativity and personality in the metaverse. All in all, wearables are a key tool in personalizing Base NFT avatars to make them truly original and special. Customization includes, but is not limited to: trendy hairstyles, stylish shirts, or fashionable hats. All of which may make your NFT reflect your uniqueness.</p>
 NFT Packs and How to Obtain Them 
 Purchasing NFT packs 
<p>Users have the option to purchase NFT packs, which contain a curated selection of wearables to customize their Base NFT avatars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the chosen pack, users may reveal up to 10 different wearables, from hairstyles to shirts, hats, and more. The number of packs users can buy have no limits, which may offer members endless chances to design their NFTs.</p>
<p>Users can buy NFT packs, or redeem NFT packs using SELF tokens, minted by performing tasks that benefit SelfKey DAO. This unique approach allows users to actively participate in the community. Active participants may mint tokens that can be used to obtain NFT packs and further customize their Base NFT avatars.</p>
 Alchemy 
<p>Members have the option to use their duplicate wearables for a chance to generate super rare wearables, adding an exciting element of rarity and exclusivity to the customization process. By utilizing duplicates, users can participate in a special feature that regulates the number of wearables in existence. This element may make them even more original.</p>
<p>This feature adds an element of gamification to the NFT experience, allowing users to engage in strategic decision-making to potentially unlock unique and highly coveted wearables.</p>
<p>Such an innovative approach may encourage users to actively manage their collection. Simultaneously, it contribute to the rarity and scarcity of certain wearables, making them highly desirable among collectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be an exciting way for users to participate in the evolution of their NFT ecosystem and potentially obtain one-of-a-kind, super rare wearables to further customize their Base NFT avatars.</p>
 Expansion Packs 
<p>With changing seasons, exclusive and time-limited collectible NFTs may be introduced into the packs. These limited-edition NFTs offer a unique opportunity for users to acquire rare and highly sought-after digital assets that are only available for a limited time.</p>
<p>With each new period or season, the NFT packs may be updated with a fresh batch of exclusive collectibles. This may add excitement and anticipation to the design process. These limited-edition NFTs may feature special designs, themes, or functionalities that are only available for a specific timeframe. This method may create a sense of urgency and exclusivity among collectors.</p>
<p>Users who are eager to expand their collection and obtain unique NFTs may be motivated to keep an eye out for these periodic updates and seize the opportunity to acquire these exclusive assets before they are no longer available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This dynamic and ever-changing aspect of the NFT ecosystem adds a layer of excitement and rarity to the customization experience, allowing users to continually enhance and evolve their Base NFT avatars with new and exclusive collectible NFTs.</p>
 NTFs and Web3 
<p>In the future, Normies may play a significant role in Web3 games, granting access to exclusive areas within the games and providing bonuses to the play-to-earn rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These digital assets will serve as keys to unlock special traits, areas, or uses that are otherwise out of reach to regular players. By owning specific NFTs, players may gain entry to exclusive areas of the game world, revealing hidden treasures, unique challenges, or rare resources and bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This integration of NFTs in Web3 games may add a new side of ownership and utility to these digital assets. Furthermore, it may allow players to not only design their Base NFT avatars. At the same time, it may also enhance their gameplay and overall experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It creates a favorable relationship between NFT holding and in-game achievements. This may incentivize players to collect and utilize these digital assets to gain an edge in the virtual world.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>SelfKey iD may offer a diverse range of assets that can be utilized for customization, allowing us to express ourselves freely in the online world while striving to safeguard our private information from prying eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With SelfKey iD, we may confidently navigate both Web2 and Web3 spaces, knowing that our data may remain under our personal control and ownership. However, we can still make ourselves stand out and be recognized by our unique and one-of-a-kind NFTs.</p>
<p>By utilizing SelfKey iD, we may strike a balance between privacy and self-expression, creating a personalized online presence while increasing control over our sensitive information. Overall, it may be an ideal way to operate in the digital world with confidence and freedom.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Traditional domain names have been in use for decades and are widely recognized. However, they come with certain limitations due to their centralized nature. Organizations that registered these domains are usually the ones who own them, which means that individuals have no control over them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized alternative to traditional domain names that offers additional functionalities. It represents a significant change in the way we think about and use domain names on the internet. ENS provides users with more control over their domain names, making it a powerful tool for individuals and businesses alike.</p>
<p>Given these options, SelfKey aims to provide subdomains with self-sovereign identity in mind. With SelfKey's ENS subdomains, individuals may enjoy all the benefits of owning a regular ENS domain on the Ethereum Mainnet without the recurring additional costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By offering greater control and flexibility, SelfKey’s ENS subdomains may enable users to better manage their digital identities and online presence. And this may make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to build a presence on the internet.</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the benefits of ENS (Ethereum Name Service) over DNS (Domain Name System), as well as the advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomains.&nbsp;</p>
 Highlights 
 
 The Basics of DNS 
 ENS Unpacked: A Quick Overview 
 The Benefits of ENS compared to DNS 
 The Benefits of SelfKey ENS Subdomains 
 Conclusions 
 
 The Basics of DNS 
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS</a> (Domain Name System) is a traditional system that facilitates the translation of human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, into IP addresses. Every device connected to the internet has an IP address, which represents a unique numerical identifier.</p>
<p>This process is necessary because while people can easily remember and recognize domain names, computers and other devices require IP addresses to communicate with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS is an essential part of the internet infrastructure and is utilized in a variety of applications, including website hosting, email communication, online gaming, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without DNS, users would have to memorize the IP addresses of every website they wish to visit, which would be highly impractical and inconvenient.</p>
 ENS Unpacked: A Quick Overview 
 A brief description 
<p><a href="https://thedefiant.io/what-is-ens">ENS</a> (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register human-readable domain names, similar to how traditional DNS works, but with added features and benefits.</p>
<p>With ENS, users can register domain names in the form of "name.eth" instead of the traditional "www.example.com" format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting that these domain names are unique, one can use them to identify various Ethereum-based resources, such as wallets, contracts, and decentralized applications.</p>
 ENS and individuals 
<p>One of the main advantages of ENS is that it is decentralized. This means that no single entity or authority owns or controls it.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Even more, resistance to censorship is boosted and individuals are allowed to have more control over their online identities and assets by being decentralized.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it is interoperable, meaning it can be used across different applications and services on the Ethereum blockchain. This could help create a more seamless and integrated user experience.</p>

<p>Both ENS and DNS are used for assigning user-friendly names to machine-readable addresses on the internet. However, there are several key differences between them, namely:</p>
 
 Centralization 
 Ownership 
 Security 
 Functionality 
 
<p>Below, we will discuss these important aspects more in depth.</p>
 Centralization 
<p>The traditional DNS system is centralized, with domain names being registered and managed by a single authority, ICANN. On the other hand, ENS is a decentralized system that operates on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>As a decentralized system, ENS is not controlled by a single entity, which gives individuals the freedom to manage their very own domain. This liberty allows users to express themselves and utilize their domains to their personal needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ENS users may stand out more if they are not attached to a centralized giant. And this, in turn, may give them the opportunity to attract and engage with other individuals. All in all, having the freedom to manage their own domain in the online world comes with a large number of chances for users to show off their services or skills.</p>
 Ownership 
<p>Ownership is another key difference between ENS and traditional DNS. With traditional DNS, the organization that register domain names typically own them. ENS allows individuals to own their domain names directly, without intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that individuals can have complete control over their domain names, which can be particularly useful for businesses and individuals who value their online presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owning an ENS domain that matches their business or brand name may help individuals build brand recognition and increase trust among customers.</p>
 Security 
<p>Security is another major advantage of ENS over traditional DNS. Most centralized systems have weak security, which often leads to data breaches. Those whose data was compromised might suffer dire consequences as a result of this.&nbsp;Being a centralized system, DNS might be quite risky in this sense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ENS's decentralized architecture makes it highly effective in preventing security threats. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the same cryptographic standards as Ethereum, providing an additional layer of protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature makes it very difficult for bad players to compromise the system or steal user data. It may also make the systems more resilient to hacking or domain hijacking. As a result, ENS offers a much higher level of security.</p>
 Functionality 
<p>ENS provides unique functionality compared to traditional DNS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such feature is the ability to link multiple addresses, including cryptocurrency wallets, to a single domain name. This capability makes identity management more simple for users and it enables seamless interaction with decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it allows users to build their online identity and streamline their transactions. On the opposite side, traditional DNS only offers basic domain name resolution. This added functionality is another reason why ENS is becoming a more and more popular choice for those seeking a more flexible and user-friendly domain name resolution system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, ENS and traditional DNS serve the same purpose, but they differ significantly in terms of centralization, ownership, security, and functionality. And all of these aspects are highly important to take into account as society becomes more digitized.</p>
<p>With these possibilities in mind, SelfKey is aiming to create a subdomain that offers the same benefits as the current ENS, along with additional features that may enhance accessibility for individuals.</p>

<p>Nowadays, applications and websites have become so common that we consider them an integral part of our daily lives. And, because we have normalized it, individuals blindly share their private information with little thought given to the implications of doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We rarely ever stop to consider what happens to our personal data once we share it with large technology corporations. And that’s because we live with the illusion that our valuable or sensitive private information is safe. That cyber attacks cannot possibly reach us.</p>
<p>However, some serious privacy violations have occurred in the past several months. And they have exposed the severe effects of sharing personal information without proper caution to safety and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite data breaches occurring on a daily basis, they aren’t discussed as often as they should be. Individuals who have not experienced such incidents may assume that they are immune to them. But anyone can fall victim at any time, and the consequences of a data breach can be irreversibly harmful.</p>
<p>In this article, SelfKey aims to provide an in-depth analysis of data breaches, recent events, and the potential aftermath for individuals whose personal information is compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly important to spread awareness about the possible consequences of data breaches. To attempt to prevent them from happening at all. With SelfKey’s decentralized solutions, a safer digital future may await us.</p>
<p>Let us elaborate on these crucial aspects in the paragraphs below.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 Defining data breaches: Meaning and Overview 
 A brief, but fundamental introduction 
<p>Data breaches are serious security violations where confidential, protected or sensitive data is accessed, stolen or used by an unauthorized person or organization. These devastating incidents are also known as data spills, data leaks, or information disclosures, and they can occur in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>These digital attacks are typically well organized and initiated by malicious players, including organized crime, political activists, and national governments. However, even individuals who accidentally gain unauthorized access to systems with poor security configurations can cause data breaches.</p>
<p>The information that hackers may disclose can range from matters that may compromise national security to information that government officials want to keep hidden. When a person who has access to such information deliberately exposes it, for political reasons, it is usually referred to as a "leak".</p>
 The negative effects of a cyber attack: What happens after? 
<p>Data breaches can have far-reaching consequences, impacting a variety of information types including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 financial data, such as credit card information and bank details. 
 personally identifiable information (PII), such as full name, full address, IDs, birth certificate information, etc. 
 personal health information (PHI), such as full name, home address, or dates related to the health or identity of individuals. 
 trade secrets, and intellectual property.&nbsp; 
 sensitive or valuable information, like photos or videos. 
 
<p>Unstructured data, such as files, documents, and private information, can also become exposed and vulnerable if proper security measures are not in place to protect them.</p>
<p>These cyberattacks aren’t limited to organizations or powerful institutions, though. Anyone could be a victim. And, worst of all, the compromise or theft of the information listed above can lead to anything from:</p>
 
 financial losses 
 identity theft 
 reputational damage 
 legal repercussions 
 
<p>It's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect their sensitive information and implement strong security measures to prevent data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey understands the devastating consequences of data breaches and emphasizes the significance of implementing preventive measures. Responding promptly and adequately in case of such incidents is also highly important.&nbsp;</p>
 Recent Data Breaches: The beginning of 2023 
<p>The frequency of data breaches has increased in recent years. Alarmingly, the past several months have seen a handful of significant incidents.&nbsp;</p>
 
 One such example is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches">TikTok’s illegal processing of data</a> belonging to 1.4 million children under 13, who were using its platform without parental consent. This breach highlights the importance of proper data management practices, particularly when dealing with children's information. 
 Another example is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kfc-pizza-hut-owner-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/">the cyberattack on Yum! Brands</a>, where attackers stole personal information belonging to some individuals, including names, driver's license numbers, and other ID card numbers. This kind of data is particularly sensitive and can be used to commit identity theft, among other crimes. 
 Finally, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kodi-discloses-data-breach-after-forum-database-for-sale-online/">the hacking of The Kodi Foundation</a> resulted in the exposure of personal information and private conversations of over 400,000 users. Such incidents can have long-term consequences for the affected individuals, including reputational damage and financial losses. These breaches emphasize the need for better cybersecurity measures and data protection practices across industries. 
 
 Factors contributing to data breaches: Why, Who, and for What? 
<p>Cyberattacks have become a prevalent threat to our digital lives, and they occur on both personal and larger scales. While most people may assume that only organizations with weak security measures are at risk, individuals are also susceptible to data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, personal cyberattacks often happen due to a lack of caution when it comes to protecting oneself online.</p>
 Why do data breaches occur? 
<p>One of the most common ways individuals make themselves vulnerable to cyberattacks is by using weak or predictable passwords. This makes it easy for hackers to access their accounts and steal sensitive information. Additionally, using the same password on multiple accounts makes it even easier for hackers to gain access to a person's entire online presence.</p>
<p>Lack of proper security measures is another way individuals put themselves at risk. Failing to have anti-malware protection on their devices can allow malware to infiltrate and infect their system. Similarly, exposing personal information publicly online, such as on social media, can provide hackers with the necessary information to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Clicking on or accessing suspicious links is another way individuals can become victims of cyberattacks. It is worth mentioning that bad players often use phishing emails to trick people into giving up sensitive information. These emails can appear legitimate, so it's important to be cautious and verify the source before clicking on any links or providing personal information.</p>
 Who is responsible for data breaches? 
<p>Anyone could carry out a cyberattack, if they have the necessary tools, and if that is their intention.</p>
<p>Data breaches are a serious concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. These breaches are often the result of bad players with malicious intent. Perpetrators can range from organized crime groups seeking financial gain to political activists looking to disrupt or expose sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some instances, national governments have conducted data breaches for espionage or other motives. Regardless of the motive, it's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect themselves from potential breaches and to respond quickly and effectively if one occurs.</p>
 What are the intentions of those who initiate cyberattacks? 
<p>Malicious individuals typically have two main intentions: financial gain or causing damage to institutions for various reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of these goals, they may carry out data breaches that can have serious consequences for their victims. These attacks can result in the exposure of personal information and sensitive data, which can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, larger feuds between hackers and their targets can result in victims becoming collateral damage and suffering the consequences of attacks that were not specifically directed at them.</p>
 Caught Off Guard: When and Where Data Breaches Strike 
<p>Data breaches can happen every second and anywhere, from major technology companies to large financial institutions, and even in our own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public places such as cafes or airports, which offer public Wi-Fi, can also provide opportunities for hackers to access personal data.</p>
<p>Recently, incidents involving Yum!Brands and TikTok have highlighted the vulnerability of powerful institutions to cyber attacks. However, individuals are also at risk in their personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any given moment, scam messages spread by viruses or hackers can target friends and family members. Weak personal security measures, such as predictable passwords and email addresses, can leave individuals vulnerable to attacks. As a result, the malware can spread to the victim’s circle of friends, family, or acquaintances via personal messages or emails.</p>
<p>One common method used by attackers is phishing emails. They appear to be legitimate messages from a trusted source but actually contain malicious links or attachments. Clicking on these links can result in the installation of malware on a device, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
 Victims of data breaches: Are you safe? 
 Who do bad players target? 
<p>The victims of data breaches can be anyone whose personal data was involved, regardless of age, gender, occupation, or level of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes children, women, men, students, teachers, and employees who trust their employers with their personal information. It also includes clients, customers, and patients who share their data with businesses and healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that anyone who uses the internet is at risk of being affected by a data breach, regardless of how small or popular they are. Constantly searching for vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them, bad actors can breach even the most seemingly secure systems.</p>
<p>That's why it's essential to take the right security measures, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and being cautious when sharing personal information online. By being proactive about data security, individuals and organizations can help protect themselves and minimize the potential impact of a breach.</p>
 How can Data Breaches affect you?&nbsp; 
<p>Individuals can be affected by data breaches in two different ways:</p>
 
 At a large scale, when a centralized system is hacked, which can affect millions of people.&nbsp; 
 On a personal level, when an individual's personal online accounts are hacked. In this case, the breach may only affect one person, but it can still have severe consequences, such as financial loss or identity theft.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In both cases, it's crucial to take steps to protect yourself and your personal information. SelfKey advises using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly monitoring your financial accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
 Large Scale: Attacking Businesses 
<p>Large-scale data breaches can have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the immediate victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While companies, institutions, and organizations are often the primary targets of such attacks, individuals can also suffer the consequences on a personal level. Even if the attack was not personally directed at them, they could still become collateral damage if the company they have trusted their PII with falls victim to a data breach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of this kind of data breach can be severe and long-lasting, for instance:</p>
 
 Companies can face financial losses, damage to their reputation, and even legal action. 
 Institutions may lose the trust of their stakeholders and customers, leading to a decline in business.&nbsp; 
 Organizations may find it difficult to attract and retain talent if they cannot demonstrate that they take data security seriously. 
 
<p>Furthermore, large-scale data breaches can lead to a loss of trust in the digital economy. If people cannot trust that their personal information is secure, they may be less likely to use online services and conduct transactions digitally. This could lead to a decline in e-commerce and other digital industries, negatively impacting the overall economy.</p>
<p>All in all, the consequences of large-scale data breaches are not limited to the immediate victims. Companies, institutions, organizations, and individuals can all suffer the effects of these attacks.</p>
<p>Below, we will examine some of these negative impacts more thoroughly.</p>
 Temporary Shut Down 
<p>Data breaches can have a significant impact on companies, not only in terms of the immediate costs but also in terms of long-term consequences. When a company experiences a data breach, it may be forced to halt its activity temporarily, which can result in millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<p>According to industry surveys, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">Gartner</a> concludes that the cost of operational downtime can be around $5,600 per minute, which translates to $300,000 per hour. This can add up quickly, especially if the breach is not resolved promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the financial costs, a data breach can also damage a company's reputation and erode the trust of its customers, leading to long-term consequences.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cyberattack-forced-a-logistics-company-to-temporarily-halt-operations-dde27a19">Expeditors International</a> is still dealing with the aftermath of a data breach that occurred in February 2022, which forced it to halt its activity temporarily. The company is likely to experience long-term consequences as a result, including a potential loss of business and damage to its reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial for companies to take proactive steps to prevent data breaches from occurring and to have a solid plan in place for responding to them if they do occur.</p>
 Financial Loss 
<p>Financial losses can arise from two main sources following a cyberattack:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ransomware 
 Legal actions 
 
<p>Ransomware attacks can result in significant financial losses for organizations, as hackers can demand large sums of money in exchange for unlocking access to their encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of ransomware attacks is a cause for concern, with experts predicting that the total cost of ransomware damages worldwide could reach <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/ransomware-payouts/">$265 billion by 2031</a>.</p>
<p>Legal actions can also result in substantial financial losses for organizations. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html">The Equifax data breach</a> in 2017 affected over 145 million people worldwide and has already cost the company more than $700 million in compensation to affected US customers. The breach also affected an estimated 15 million customers in the UK, who have launched their own separate legal action in the high court seeking £100 million in compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal actions can be costly and time-consuming, and the reputational damage caused by a data breach can have long-term consequences for an organization's financial performance.</p>
 Reputational Damage 
<p>Reputational damage is a major concern for companies that experience large-scale data breaches. Such damage can lead to revenue loss and have long-term impacts on the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a company's reputation is tarnished due to a history of data breaches, people are less likely to trust the company with their payment information, and they may choose to take their business elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loss of trust can be difficult to overcome. Therefore, companies must take steps to protect themselves and their customers from data breaches. Additionally, they must try to maintain their reputation and ensure their long-term success.</p>
 Loss of Private Data 
<p>Sensitive data and intellectual property are two key areas that hackers target in a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensitive data can include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Personal information belonging to customers, patients, and employees. 
 Private company emails that contain personal health history, home addresses, and payment information.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When this type of data is breached, it can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage for the company.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is another target of hackers, particularly designs, strategies, and blueprints. When intellectual property is stolen, the competition can take advantage of the leaked information. And this, in turn, may cause long-term damage to the company's competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Businesses within the manufacturing and construction industries are particularly vulnerable to these types of cyber threats. Therefore, many small businesses believe that they are unlikely to be targeted by hackers, but this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, 60% of all hacks target small businesses because they are often easier to attack. It is therefore crucial for businesses of all sizes to take proactive measures to protect their sensitive data and intellectual property from cyber threats.</p>
 Personal Level: Targeting the Individual 
<p>Data breaches at a personal level often occur due to a lack of caution when operating in the digital world and inadequate security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People may accidentally share sensitive information, such as their social security number or credit card details, on unsecured websites. Alternatively, they could fall victim to phishing scams that trick them into revealing their login credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, using weak passwords and not updating software and operating systems can leave personal devices vulnerable to hacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey’s decentralized solutions are centered around the individual’s privacy and security, with a strong emphasis on individuality. It is highly important for individuals to be vigilant when using digital platforms and take appropriate security measures to protect their personal data from cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
 Identify Theft 
<p>Identity theft is a serious crime that can have devastating consequences for its victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When criminals gain access to a victim's personally identifiable information (PII), such as their full name, Social Security number, and birthday, they can wreak havoc on their financial and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims can have their bank accounts emptied, credit histories ruined, and valuable possessions taken away. <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/archives/factsheets/ojpfs_idtheft.html#:~:text=Identity%20theft%20has%20profound%20consequences,crimes%20they%20did%20not%20commit.">In some cases</a>, victims have even been wrongly arrested for crimes they did not commit. This is because the criminal may use the victim's identity to commit cybercrimes or other illegal activities, leaving the victim facing legal action and potentially a criminal record.</p>
 Notable examples of identity theft 
 
 The case of <a href="https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/famous-identity-theft-cases/#nicole-mccabe-identity-theft-and-assassination">Nicole McCabe</a>, an Australian woman suspected of murder after her passport was compromised and her identity stolen.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www2.texasattorneygeneral.gov/identitytheft/real-stories-of-identity-theft">Several victims</a> of identity theft had to struggle with proving they were not responsible for the withdrawal of large amounts of cash from banks, or illegally attempting to obtain loans worth thousands.&nbsp; 
 The terrifying story of <a href="https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294978560">Andorrie Sachs</a>, whose medical identity was stolen by a pregnant woman who gave birth in Sachs' name and left the baby at the hospital, resulting in a $10,000 hospital bill.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Local authorities mistakenly reported Sachs as an unfit mother and threatened to take her children away. This could also have lifelong implications for Sachs as the perpetrator had a different blood type, and uncorrected medical records could result in Sachs' death if she ever needed a blood transfusion. A healthcare provider could even prohibit Sachs from reviewing her own medical records as they might not be in her name.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why SelfKey strongly encourages individuals to take proactive steps to protect their personal information, such as:</p>
 
 Using strong passwords. 
 Regularly checking their credit report. 
 Being cautious when sharing personal information online.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By being vigilant and taking appropriate security measures, individuals can reduce their risk of falling victim to identity theft and the devastating consequences that can follow.</p>
 Personal Health Information 
<p>The theft of personal health information (PHI) is <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">highly valuable on the Dark Web</a>, as it can be worth more than 200 times stolen credit card information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of identity theft can have serious consequences, including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 Obtaining illegal medical treatments or prescription drugs. 
 Altering the victim’s medical history. 
 Using up the victim’s medical benefits.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Hackers can also sell stolen PHI to other criminals, who can use it for a range of illegal activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given these horrifying facts, SelfKey strongly advises individuals to take steps to protect their medical identity, such as:</p>
 
 Regularly checking medical records for errors. 
 Checking for signs of fraudulent activity. 
 Ensuring that their healthcare providers have proper security measures in place to protect their PHI. 
 
 Financial loss 
<p>Once malicious individuals obtain your PII, they could potentially use it to <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">damage your credit</a> score and commit financial fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lowered credit score can make it challenging for the victim to:</p>
 
 Obtain a personal loan. 
 Secure a mortgage. 
 Even impact job prospects.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, individuals who commit identity fraud can open new bank accounts in your name, drain your existing accounts, and commit check fraud. They can also apply for credit using your information, and engage in a variety of other banking scams. All things considered, it’s important to be vigilant in safeguarding your PII. The long-term financial consequences of a data breach can be severe.</p>
 Impersonation on Social Media 
<p>Cybercriminals can use your digital identity to carry out various malicious activities that can cause significant harm. Here are only a few terrifying examples:</p>
 
 They can use your digital identity to phish for credentials from your friends and family, leading to further attacks.&nbsp; 
 They can ruin your reputation by posting obscene or profane content online, damaging your personal and professional relationships.&nbsp; 
 They may look for sensitive photos and videos in your account and use them to extort you, leading to emotional distress and financial loss.&nbsp; 
 
<p>As horrifying as this may sound, there are ways to prevent this kind of disaster from causing irreparable damage to your digital identity. For instance, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> methods may be the key to protect individuals against identity theft.</p>
 Emotional and Mental impact 
<p>A personal data breach can lead to significant mental and emotional distress. The harm caused can take a long time to recover from, depending on the extent of the damage done by the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with reputational damage, victims may also have to spend a considerable amount of time and money to mitigate the fallout. And, the steps towards recovering from such a cyberattack could be draining in themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims may have to spend endless hours or days:</p>
 
 Contacting their bank, lenders, and creditors. 
 Securing all their online accounts. 
 Replacing stolen identification documents. 
 Canceling and replacing bank accounts and credit cards. 
 Dealing with criminal charges made in their name.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Victims will also need to remove malware and viruses from their devices, while constantly proving their identity and showing that it was stolen. A process which can be emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting in itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst of all, if affected individuals fail to repair compromised information or remove malware from their devices, they will risk falling victim to the same attacks over and over again.</p>
<p>The long-lasting consequences of a data breach can be devastating, particularly if your PII or PHI end up on the Dark Web. The information could be in circulation there indefinitely, making you vulnerable to further harm.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and POI (proof of individuality), or proof of humanity locking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and POI locking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world.

 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches, or 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers POI locking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and POI Locking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>POI (Proof of Individuality), or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, POI locking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a POI credential that can be locked with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By locking KEY on their POI credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's POI locking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By locking their POI credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have locked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, locking POI credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens&nbsp;as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POI locking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By locking their POI credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD POI Locking  
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's POI locking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information to ensure the security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD POI locking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By locking their POI credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

<p>As stated above, cyberspace holds immense potential and possibilities. However, alongside these exciting prospects, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges which come with this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the metaverse indeed raises concerns about health and social isolation, among other crucial factors, we will narrow our discussion to two primary aspects:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Privacy Issues 
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
 
 Privacy Issues 
<p>The metaverse relies on the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, which, like any cutting-edge innovation, presents its own set of challenges. As an extension of the internet, cyberspace confronts similar digital privacy and security issues, but perhaps at a more concerning level.</p>
<p>VR systems may collect user data, encompassing personal information and behavioral data, with the intention of enhancing the user experience. However, the collection and handling of such data carry inherent risks, including the potential for privacy breaches or unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Moreover, when engaging with VR applications and services developed by third parties, users should be aware that these entities may gather personal data for their own purposes, raising further privacy considerations.</p>
<p>Safeguarding this data is of utmost importance, as mishandling could expose individuals to privacy breaches, compromising their personal information and leaving them susceptible to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> or misuse.</p>
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
<p>The utilization of VR within the metaverse presents a vulnerable target for identity theft. With the aid of various machine learning algorithms, it may be relatively easy to manipulate sounds and visuals to a degree where they appear genuine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, attackers can exploit virtual reality platforms by introducing deceptive features aimed at extracting personal information from users. This susceptibility, similar to augmented reality, opens the door to ransomware attacks, where hackers compromise platforms and then demand a ransom.</p>
<p>Machine learning technologies also facilitate the manipulation of voices and videos while preserving their realism. If a hacker manages to access motion detection data from a VR headset, they could potentially employ it to generate a digital replica, commonly known as a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake">deepfake</a>.</p>
<p>A deepfake could then be used by malicious players to impersonate a user, or to try and access private accounts and systems in their name. While that is indeed a terrifying scenario, there are several decentralized solutions which may prevent such disasters.</p>
 How SelfKey May Improve your Metaverse Experience 
<p>Given the multitude of benefits cyberspace offers, it comes as no surprise that malicious actors seek to exploit vulnerabilities within it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these facts in mind, SelfKey proposes several decentralized solutions which may enhance security and prevent identity theft and other privacy concerns. These methods put a strong emphasis on privacy and security. The end goal is to empower individuals to confidently navigate the digital world.</p>
 SelfKey iD

By utilizing ZK filters and AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, it strives to prevent unauthorized access to personal online accounts and systems by bots or identity thieves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">ZK filters</a> is to limit the amount of personal information shared when individuals interact with and engage with other individuals in digital spaces. If the shared data is limited, it may be insufficient for bad players to compromise. And this may enhance overall security and privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> is utilized with the aim to deter identity thieves from accessing a user’s online accounts with the latter’s stolen digital information. Thanks to AI’s ability to detect duplicates or fake, AI-generated images, SelfKey iD may be able to combat and prevent these attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, individuals may be able to enjoy the wonders of metaverse with confidence. Even more, they may ensure the privacy and security of their online persona.</p>

 What is Online Identity? 
 A brief definition 
<p>The concept of online identity refers to a persona which people establish for themselves on the internet. Also called internet identity, online personality, or internet persona, it may be used in online communities and websites. It can also be a way of intentionally showing and representing oneself.</p>
<p>Although some people choose to use their real names online, some internet users prefer to be anonymous. They identify themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, an online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Identity vs Digital Identity 
<p>Even though online identity and digital identity are often found in the same context, there is a notable distinction between them. The difference between online identity and digital identity lies in their scope and focus.</p>
<p>Online identity specifically pertains to the persona and representation of a person in the online realm. It encompasses the social identity an individual establishes in online communities, websites, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>It includes elements such as:</p>
 
 Usernames and profiles. 
 Personal information. 
 Digital footprints. 
 
<p>All in all, it is the perception others have of the individual based on their online presence.</p>
<p>Digital identity, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses the information and attributes associated with any entity, not limited to individuals. It extends beyond just personal online presence and encompasses a wider range of entities and their attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes organizational identities, system identities, device identities, and more. It focuses on how entities are identified, authenticated, and represented in the digital domain.</p>
<p>In simple terms, online identity refers to how a person appears and acts online, while digital identity is a broader concept that includes representing any entity in the digital world, such as people, organizations, apps, and devices.</p>
 Digital Footprints 
<p>While navigating the internet, it's important to remember that our online actions can have lasting effects on specific websites. These effects are referred to as digital footprints.</p>
<p>Digital footprints are the marks or records of our online activities and interactions that remain after using digital devices and platforms. They can include different types of data, like personal information, online behaviors, communications, and contributions.</p>
<p>Some examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Social Media Posts 
 Web Browsing History

 An Introduction to Web3 
 Web3 Benefits and Opportunities 
 The Dark Side of Web3 
 Web3 and SelfKey 
 Conclusions 
 
 An Introduction to Web3&nbsp; 
<p>Evolution is natural in many aspects of life. With modern technology, however, it’s especially beneficial when networking and artificial intelligence can considerably enhance the way society functions. Let us discover the concept of Web3, what it is, and how it can affect our daily lives.</p>
 What is Web3? 
<p>Web3, or Web 3.0, represents a new vision for the next phase of the World Wide Web. It aims to integrate principles like decentralization, blockchain advancements, and token-driven economies.</p>
<p>The range of emerging technologies and projects it encompasses include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 decentralized finance (DeFi) 
 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 
 decentralized applications (dApps) 
 
<p>At its core, Web3 envisions a future where individuals have greater sovereignty over their digital lives. Where trust and transparency are built into the very fabric of the internet.</p>
 Web2 to Web3: How different are they? 
<p>Web2 is the current version of the internet, encompassing all the technologies and projects people are accustomed to nowadays. While Web2 has proven to be an inclusive and dynamic form of the web, it has its limitations due to its centralized nature. In this context, Web3 aims to enhance user freedom, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>There are many differences between Web2 and Web3. For now, let us explore two of the most prominent aspects which set them apart:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
<p>Web2 platforms and services are predominantly centralized, meaning they rely on centralized servers and intermediaries to operate. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon control and manage user data and have the authority to set rules and policies. Because of this, users have limited control over their data and are dependent on these centralized entities.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, emphasizes decentralization. It operates on peer-to-peer networks and blockchain technology, where data is distributed across multiple nodes. Users have greater control over their data and can interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) without the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts and consensus mechanisms enable decentralized governance models where the community collectively makes decisions, instead of relying on a single authority.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>In Web2, user data is often collected, stored, and controlled by centralized platforms. Users typically agree to terms and conditions that grant these platforms the right to use and monetize their data. Privacy concerns arise due to the potential for data breaches, surveillance, and unauthorized access to personal information.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, prioritizes user ownership and control over data. With decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain technology provides transparency and auditability, which may reduce the risk of unauthorized manipulation or access. Users have the ability to grant and revoke access to their data on a case-by-case basis, enhancing privacy and data sovereignty.</p>
<p>All in all, these differences highlight the shift from a centralized and controlled web to a more decentralized, user-centric, and economically empowering Web3 ecosystem.</p>
 Web3 Benefits and Opportunities 
<p>Due to its decentralized nature, and not only, Web3 can offer a multitude of benefits and opportunities. Let’s examine a few:</p>
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 Economic Empowerment 
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
<p>Web3 aims to decentralize power and eliminate the need for intermediaries by leveraging blockchain technology. This can result in a more trustless and transparent online environment. Users may interact directly with each other and verify transactions without relying on centralized authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to be a decentralized and trustless digital environment, due to its emphasis on limited data sharing.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>One thing that Web3 prioritizes is user ownership and control over personal data. This is also known as <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereignty</a>, and it aims to reduce the risk of data breaches by enabling individuals to be the sole owners of their data.</p>
<p>Through decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data. They can selectively grant access to their data and have more control over how it is used and shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shift towards user-centric data ownership may enhance privacy and empower individuals to protect their personal information.</p>
 Economic Empowerment 
<p>Another advantage of Web3 is that it introduces new economic models enabled by cryptocurrencies and tokens. This may allow individuals to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, where they can lend, borrow, and invest without relying on traditional financial intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization and the concept of ownership over digital assets may open new opportunities for creators, artists, and content providers to monetize their work directly. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, Web3 could potentially create more equitable economic systems.</p>
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
<p>Web3 aims to promote interoperability between different blockchain networks and protocols. This means that users may seamlessly interact with various decentralized applications (dApps) and move assets across different platforms without facing barriers or restrictions.&nbsp;It allows for a more connected and cohesive ecosystem where users may access a wide range of services and functionalities.</p>
<p>To aid this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a decentralized solution which may enhance digital security as individuals operate in these platforms.&nbsp;</p>
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
<p>Finally, Web3 enables decentralized governance models through mechanisms like smart contracts and decentralized <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">autonomous organizations (DAOs)</a>. This allows users to have a say in the decision-making processes of the platforms they engage with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can participate in voting, propose changes, and contribute to the development and evolution of the platforms they use. And this fosters a sense of community ownership and collaboration, empowering users to shape the direction of the platforms and protocols they rely on.</p>
<p>All in all, these benefits highlight Web3’s potential to transform the internet into a more user-centric, transparent, and inclusive ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that Web3 is still an emerging concept. Therefore, its actual realization and impact will depend on the development and adoption of relevant technologies and applications.</p>
 The Dark Side of Web3 
<p>While Web3 brings potential benefits, it also presents certain risks and challenges that need to be considered. It’s important to be aware of these challenges in order to take preventive measures and remain vigilant.</p>
<p>Here are five potential risks that may occur with Web3:</p>
 
 Security and Privacy Concerns 
 Bots and Maliciously-used AI 
 User Responsibility and Risks 
 
 Security and Privacy Concerns 
<p>As Web3 relies heavily on blockchain technology and decentralized systems, it introduces unique security and privacy considerations. Although blockchain is renowned for its robust security, vulnerabilities and exploits can still occur.</p>
<p>Additionally, decentralized storage and peer-to-peer networks may face privacy challenges. Therefore, they require careful attention to encryption, data protection, and identity management to ensure user privacy.</p>
 Bots and Maliciously-used AI 
<p>In Web3, identity and reputation systems can be compromised by bots through <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/sybil-attack/#:~:text=A%20Sybil%20attack%20uses%20a,of%20influence%20in%20the%20network.">sybil attacks</a>. Bots can create multiple fake identities to gain influence, voting power, or access to certain resources within decentralized networks. This can undermine the trust and fairness of the system.</p>
<p>Bad players can also program AI to distribute spam messages or engage in phishing attacks within decentralized communication platforms. These attacks aim to deceive users into sharing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links, compromising their security and privacy.</p>
 User Responsibility and Risks 
<p>Web3 shifts more responsibility onto users, as they have greater control over their digital assets and interactions. With increased control comes increased risk, as users are solely responsible for managing their private keys. This includes securing their wallets, and avoiding scams or fraudulent activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>User error or negligence can result in irreversible loss of funds or unauthorized access to personal data, necessitating heightened user awareness and education.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize these risks and address them proactively. One can do this through responsible development, regulatory frameworks, user education, and sustainable practices. The purpose is to maximize the promising benefits of Web3 while mitigating potential downsides.</p>
 Web3 and SelfKey 
<p>Web3 could considerably enhance the internet as we know it. Through decentralization and user-centricity, it could become a digital space in which users may engage with one another without limitations to their privacy and individuality.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 What is Tokenization? 
 A brief definition&nbsp; 
<p>Tokenization, in the context of data security, involves the substitution of sensitive data with a non-sensitive equivalent, known as a token. The purpose of tokenization is to render the original data meaningless and devoid of exploitable value. Instead, a token is generated, which serves as a reference point linking back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system.</p>
<p>The tokenization process is designed with the aim to enhance data protection by reducing the risk associated with storing or transmitting sensitive information. By replacing sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personal identification details, with tokens, the likelihood of unauthorized access or misuse of the original data may be significantly minimized.</p>
<p>The tokenization system manages the mapping between the tokens and their corresponding sensitive data, ensuring that the original information can be retrieved when needed by authorized entities. This system may provide a secure and efficient way to handle sensitive data, reducing the exposure to potential breaches or theft.</p>
<p>Overall, tokenization plays a vital role in safeguarding sensitive information, preserving data privacy, and maintaining the integrity of systems that handle sensitive data elements.</p>
 Tokens Explained 
<p>Tokens may function as digital assets or representations of value that are built on top of existing blockchain networks. They can serve various purposes and operate within specific ecosystems.</p>
<p>Technically, tokens are programmable digital objects that are created and managed through smart contracts. These contracts dictate the rules and behaviors of the tokens, such as their supply, transferability, and functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals can create tokens on different blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana, using their respective token standards like ERC-20, BEP-20, or SPL. And, depending on their design, they can have different functionalities.</p>
<p>For instance, tokens can:</p>
 
 Be used as a medium of exchange and stores of value. 
 Represent ownership rights in a particular asset or project.&nbsp; 
 Have utility functions within decentralized applications (DApps), enabling access to specific features or services. 
 
<p>Overall, tokens operate within the framework of blockchain technology. They offer a flexible and programmable way to represent and exchange data or value within digital ecosystems.</p>
 Types of Tokens 
<p>In addition to the general definitions mentioned earlier, there are specific categories of cryptoassets that include the word "token" in their name. Here are a few examples:</p>
 
 DeFi tokens refer to crypto tokens issued by decentralized finance protocols, which aim to replicate traditional financial functions. These tokens serve multiple purposes within their respective protocols and can be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency. For instance, individuals may use them for lending, saving, insurance, and trading.&nbsp; 
 Governance tokens are specialized tokens which grant holders the ability to participate in decision-making processes for a protocol or application. As decentralized platforms lack central authorities or boards of directors, governance tokens provide voting rights.&nbsp; 
 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent ownership rights to unique digital or real-world assets. They have been utilized to combat unauthorized copying and sharing of digital creations. Additionally, NFTs have gained popularity in the art world for issuing limited editions of digital artwork or selling exclusive virtual assets like rare items in video games. 
 Finally, security tokens are cryptoassets which are designed to function as the cryptocurrency equivalent of traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Security tokens enable the sale of shares in companies or other ventures, including real estate, without the involvement of brokers. Major companies and startups are exploring security tokens as an alternative fundraising method. 
 
<p>By familiarizing oneself with these different categories of tokens, one can gain a better understanding of the diverse applications and functionalities within the crypto space.</p>
 The difference between Crypto and Tokenization 
<p>The difference between cryptocurrency and tokenization lies in their underlying concepts and functionalities.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that utilize cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies typically operate as independent entities with their own blockchain networks. They can function as a medium of exchange, a store of value, or a unit of account.</p>
<p>On the other hand, tokenization is the process of converting data, real-world assets, rights, or functionalities into digital tokens that exist and operate on a blockchain. Tokens can represent various forms of value, such as ownership rights, access to services, or participation in a project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that operate independently on their respective blockchain networks, while tokenization involves the creation and representation of data, assets or functionalities as digital tokens within a specific platform or ecosystem.</p>
 The Benefits of Tokenization 
<p>Tokenization offers several benefits for data security and efficiency. Here are a few key advantages of tokenization, which we will discuss more thoroughly below:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enhanced Data Security 
 Improved Data Processing Efficiency 
 Simplified Data Management and Migration 
 
 Enhanced Data Security 
<p>Tokenization helps protect sensitive information by replacing it with randomly generated tokens that have no intrinsic value or meaning. Unlike encryption, tokenization removes the need to store sensitive data, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches. Even if a hacker gains access to the tokenized data, it is almost impossible to&nbsp; reverse-engineer the original information.</p>
 Improved Data Processing Efficiency 
<p>Tokenization accelerates data processing and retrieval by replacing long and complex data strings with shorter tokens. These tokens are easier and faster to search, index, and analyze. And this leads to improved performance and efficiency in data-intensive applications such as databases, data warehousing, and big data analytics.</p>
 Simplified Data Management and Migration 
<p>Lastly, tokenization facilitates data management and migration processes, particularly when transitioning between different systems or databases. When migrating data, tokens can be used to maintain data integrity and relationships while ensuring sensitive information remains secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, tokenization simplifies data integration, as systems can exchange tokens instead of transferring actual data. This may reduce the complexity and overhead of data sharing.</p>
<p>All in all, tokenization may offer notable security advantages. However, it is crucial to prioritize the management and protection of the tokenization system itself. This will ensure comprehensive security throughout the process.</p>
 Tokenization: Challenges and Risks 
<p>While tokenization offers numerous benefits, there are also potential risks associated with its implementation, for instance:</p>
 
 Dependency on Tokenization System 
 Token Reversal Attacks 
 Token Mapping Vulnerabilities 
 Single Point of Failure 
 
 Dependency on Tokenization System 
<p>Organizations adopting tokenization may become reliant on the tokenization system and infrastructure. If the system experiences a breach, suffers from downtime, or becomes unavailable, it can disrupt operations and impact business continuity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial to implement robust security measures and backup systems to mitigate such risks.</p>
 Token Reversal Attacks 
<p>Although tokenized data is not directly reversible, attackers may attempt token reversal attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the tokenization system or its implementation. If successful, these attacks could potentially derive sensitive information from the tokens. And, in turn, it may&nbsp; undermine the security benefits of tokenization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vigilance in system design and implementation, as well as regular security audits, can help mitigate this risk.</p>
 Token Mapping Vulnerabilities 
<p>Tokenization relies on a mapping or lookup table that connects tokens to their original data. If malicious individuals compromise this mapping table, they may gain access to the original sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robust security measures are therefore essential to protect against this risk, such as:</p>
 
 strong access controls. 
 encryption of the mapping table 
 secure key management. 
 
 Single Point of Failure 
<p>Centralizing tokenization processes introduces a single point of failure. If the tokenization system or central repository is compromised, it can have widespread implications across the organization, potentially exposing sensitive data or disrupting operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing redundancy, disaster recovery mechanisms, and distributed tokenization systems can help mitigate this risk.</p>
<p>All in all, it's important to note that while these risks exist, there are methods which may mitigate them and maximize the benefits of tokenization. These methods include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 implementing proper security measures. 
 conducting regular assessments. 
 adhering to best practices. 
 
 A Glimpse into SelfKey’s Protocol 
<p>When developing decentralized solutions, SelfKey places great emphasis on digital identity privacy and security. The vision is to create a more secure decentralized network, in which members may be able to exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may be such a platform by treating its members with transparency, equality, and fairness. Within the SelfKey Protocol, there are currently two tokens which serve as pivotal elements: KEY and SELF.</p>
 KEY: A Brief Introduction 
<p>Utility tokens derive their value from their utility or functionality within the ecosystem they are associated with. One may use them within the platform to exchange for goods or services, participate in voting or governance processes, access premium features, or facilitate interactions.</p>
<p>The KEY token may find utility in various ways, including:</p>
 
 Serving as a method of exchange for services within the SelfKey Protocol. 
 Enabling users to lock their credentials more securely. 
 Empowering members to govern the SelfKey DAO. 
 Equipping users with essential tools which may allow them to take charge of their digital identity and increase privacy protection. 
 
 The Purpose of SELF 
<p>While KEY remains the vital utility token to lock credentials, SelfKey introduces the SELF tokens to facilitate tracking of an individual's locked credentials and their duration.</p>
<p>Having access to the SelfKey DAO may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. Individuals may use these tokens for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some notable attributes of SELF tokens:</p>
 
 Individuals who successfully lock a real identity may mint SELF tokens. 
 SELF tokens may serve as a metric for reputation measurement. 
 As a reputation signal, they may strengthen legitimate credentials and help identify illegitimate ones. 
 Users themselves may mint SELF tokens, and they hold no inherent value. 
 SELF tokens may also serve as a governance mechanism, granting influence to those who use the platform, accumulate reputation, or engage in "identity mining" to enhance platform security. 
 As users lock valid credentials, they accumulate reputation in the form of SELF tokens. 
 
<p>By introducing SELF tokens, SelfKey may enhance the ecosystem by providing individuals with a way to monitor their locked credentials and reputation. At the same time, it may promote the integrity and security of the platform.</p>
 Locking for Digital Safety 
<p>By locking KEY tokens on their credentials, users may mint SELF tokens. Locking credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of locking, therefore, is to enhance digital security. This may prevent data breaches, identity theft, and unlawful attempts by malicious bots to infiltrate your private online accounts and systems.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rapid progress of modern technology constantly astonishes us, bringing forth opportunities for knowledge, efficiency, communication, and speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization, a relatively new concept, has the potential to simplify private data management and enhance online security through encryption methods, offering benefits in terms of privacy, security, speed, and efficiency.</p>

 SelfKey’s Defense against Sybil attacks and Malicious AI 
 
 Sybil Attacks: The horrifying truth 
 In a nutshell 
<p>According to literature, Sybil attacks are a method of network-based attacks in which a perpetrator creates multiple fake identities or accounts to gain control or influence over a system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the term "Sybil" comes from the book "Sybil" by Flora Rheta Schreiber, which portrays a case of multiple personality disorder. In the context of digital security, this refers to a multitude of counterfeit identities which may be controlled by one, single, malicious individual.</p>
 What happens in a Sybil attack? 
<p>During this kind of cyber attack, bad players create numerous fake identities, also known as Sybil nodes or Sybil identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The perpetrators then use them to deceive a network or system into believing that each identity represents a unique and independent user. By controlling multiple identities, the attackers can manipulate the network's behavior, disrupt its operation, or undermine its security.</p>
 Who do they target? 
<p>Sybil attacks are commonly associated with decentralized systems, such as peer-to-peer networks or blockchain networks. Here, participants rely on the assumption that each identity is unique and represents a distinct user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By creating a large number of Sybil identities, an attacker can:</p>
 
 gain disproportionate influence. 
 compromise consensus mechanisms. 
 launch various malicious activities, such as spreading misinformation, performing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">Distributed Denial of Service</a> attacks, or controlling a majority of voting power. 
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks can be challenging since traditional identification methods may not be effective in decentralized systems that rely on pseudonymous identities. Mitigation strategies often involve:</p>
 
 implementing reputation systems. 
 proof-of-work mechanisms. 
 identity verification protocols to establish trust and distinguish between legitimate users and Sybil nodes. 
 
<p>Overall, Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems. Therefore, robust security measures and consensus algorithms are necessary to prevent or minimize their impact.</p>
 The dreadful consequences of Sybil Attacks 
<p>Sybil attacks can be highly dangerous to digital systems, especially in decentralized networks or systems that rely on trust and consensus. Some reasons why Sybil attacks are considered a significant threat include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
 Undermining Consensus&nbsp; 
<p>In decentralized networks, like blockchains, where consensus is essential for maintaining integrity and security, a Sybil attack can disrupt the process. By controlling multiple identities, malicious individuals may manipulate voting or decision-making processes. And this may potentially lead to false consensus or control over the network.</p>
 Disrupting Network Operations 
<p>Sybil attacks can disrupt the normal operation of a network or system. For instance, an attacker may flood the network with fake identities, overwhelming the resources and causing performance degradation or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
 Spreading Misinformation 
<p>Bad players can leverage Sybil identities to spread false information or manipulate the perception of consensus. By taking control of a significant number of identities, they can amplify their influence and create the illusion of broad support for malicious content.</p>
 Exploiting Trust and Reputation Systems 
<p>Many digital systems rely on trust and reputation systems to establish credibility and make informed decisions. During a Sybil attack, a perpetrator can create a large number of fake identities with positive reputations. This way, they may mislead others into trusting them and granting them privileges they shouldn't have.</p>
 Security Risks 
<p>Lastly, Sybil attacks can compromise user security. For instance, if a Sybil attacker gains control over multiple identities, they may have access to sensitive user information, financial data, or private communications. Horrifyingly, this may lead to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a>, fraud, or unauthorized access to personal accounts.</p>
<p>Because the consequences of Sybil attacks can be devastating to a decentralized system, it’s crucial for certain security measures to be implemented, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identity verification protocols. 
 Reputation Systems. 
 Proof-of-Work mechanisms. 
 Consensus algorithms that incentivize honest behavior. 
 
<p>By doing so, individuals may help minimize the risks and consequences of Sybil attacks, before they corrupt whole systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In spite of all these security methods, though, developing strong defenses against Sybil attacks remains a continuous challenge. Therefore, constant vigilance and research are necessary to ensure the security and integrity of digital systems.</p>
 Ways in which Sybil attacks may occur 
<p>Unlike other methods of cyberattacks, which target one type of individual in particular or have a single scope, Sybil attacks can occur in many ways, with many specific purposes. Let us examine a few of them.</p>
 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks 
<p>In this type of attack, malicious individuals can create multiple Sybil nodes and use them to flood a target system or network with requests. This process can overwhelm the system’s resources and cause it to become unresponsive. And, by controlling a large number of identities, the attackers can amplify the impact of the attack.</p>
 Influence Manipulation in Social Networks 
<p>In social networks, attackers can create multiple fake profiles and use them to manipulate discussions, spread propaganda, or artificially inflate the popularity of certain content. Because they can appear as different individuals, the attackers can exert undue influence and manipulate the perception of consensus.</p>
 Blockchain Network Attacks 
<p>In blockchain networks, malicious individuals may create numerous Sybil identities to gain control over the consensus process. By controlling a majority of identities or computing power (known as a Sybil attack on proof-of-work), the attackers may:</p>
 
 manipulate transaction verification. 
 double-spend coins. 
 launch other malicious activities that undermine the security and integrity of the blockchain. 
 
 Spamming and Reputation Manipulation 
<p>In online platforms that rely on reputation systems, such as e-commerce or review websites, an attacker can create multiple Sybil accounts to spam or manipulate ratings and reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the aid of numerous, fake identities, the attacker can artificially inflate or deflate the reputation of products, services, or individuals. And, this way, they can mislead other users and affect their decision-making.</p>
 Influence in Online Voting Systems 
<p>In online voting systems or opinion polls, attackers may create multiple Sybil identities to sway the results by casting multiple votes or skewing the perception of public opinion. In doing so, the perpetrators can distort the outcome and compromise the integrity of the voting process.</p>
<p>These examples shed a light on how Sybil attacks can be used to manipulate, disrupt, or deceive various digital systems. Preventing and minimizing these attacks often requires implementing strong security measures, such as:</p>
 
 identity verification protocols. 
 reputation systems. 
 consensus mechanisms that can differentiate between genuine users and Sybil nodes. 
 
 Sybil Attacks against Decentralized Systems 
 A brief introduction to Decentralized Systems 
<p>Decentralized systems are computing or network architectures in which authority, control, and decision-making are distributed among multiple nodes or participants. This comes in stark contrast to centralized systems, in which a single entity or central server has authority.</p>
<p>In decentralized systems, no single entity has complete control or ownership over the entire system, and participants collaborate to achieve shared goals.</p>
 Why do Sybil attacks target decentralized systems? 
<p>Sybil attacks specifically target decentralized systems because these systems rely on the assumption that each node or participant represents a unique and independent entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By creating multiple fake identities, or Sybil nodes, malicious players can exploit the inherent trust and consensus mechanisms of decentralized systems. And this, in turn, could lead to various malicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us discuss a few reasons why Sybil attacks are particularly effective against decentralized systems.</p>
 1. Exploiting Consensus Mechanisms 
<p>Decentralized systems often employ consensus mechanisms to achieve agreement among participants. Sybil attacks can undermine these mechanisms by creating a large number of fake identities that skew the consensus process. This way, attackers can manipulate voting, decision-making, or transaction verification, compromising the integrity and security of the system.</p>
 2. Gaining Disproportionate Influence 
<p>What’s commonly known about decentralized systems is that they strive to give equal power and influence to each participant. However, in a Sybil attack, a perpetrator can create numerous Sybil nodes, effectively giving them disproportionate influence over the system. This can enable the attacker to exert control, manipulate perceptions, or disrupt the normal operation of the network.</p>
 3. Exploiting Trust and Pseudonymity 
<p>Many decentralized systems rely on pseudonymous identities to protect user privacy. Unfortunately, this anonymity also creates opportunities for Sybil attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malicious individuals can create multiple fake identities that are almost indistinguishable from legitimate ones. And using these, they can deceive others into trusting them and granting them privileges or access they shouldn't have.</p>
 4. Undermining Network Resilience 
<p>Decentralized systems often emphasize resilience and fault tolerance. But, a Sybil attack can compromise these attributes by flooding the network with fake identities.</p>
<p>An attacker can overwhelm resources, disrupt communication, or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, undermining the stability and availability of the system.</p>
<p>Due to these factors, Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems. In turn, this highlights the importance of implementing strong security measures, to prevent and reduce the risks associated with Sybil attacks.</p>
 SelfKey’s Defense against Sybil Attacks and Malicious AI 
<p>The significance of digital security is amplified in decentralized systems, given the distinct challenges and vulnerabilities they entail. Some crucial aspects that require strong security measures in decentralized environments include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 preserving data integrity. 
 upholding consensus integrity. 
 mitigating network threats. 
 safeguarding digital assets. 
 fostering trust among participants. 
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks in decentralized systems can be challenging, but there are several measures that can help mitigate the risk. Let us discuss some strategies which may prevent Sybil attacks.</p>
 Identity Verification 
<p>The first step is implementing strong identity verification mechanisms to ensure that participants in the decentralized system are unique and authentic individuals. This can include verification through trusted third parties, KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, or reputation systems that assess the trustworthiness of participants based on their past behavior.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a possible solution to combat identity theft and digital duplicates. SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) to detect fake, AI-generated digital identities and identity thieves, which could considerably lower the risks associated with Sybil attacks.</p>
 Sybil Resistance Mechanisms 
<p>Another important step is to design the decentralized system with built-in Sybil resistance mechanisms. These mechanisms aim to make it difficult or costly for attackers to create and control a large number of fake identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of Sybil resistance mechanisms include proof-of-work or proof-of-stake protocols, where participants must provide computational resources or stake tokens to participate in the system.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a>, members may mint SELF tokens as a part of the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-id-poi-locking/">proof-of-individuality locking</a> protocol. Again, this is developed utilizing the power of AI to gain more accurate and quick results, as AI can read and analyze patterns which may be impossible for the naked human eye to detect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this process, SelfKey aims to prevent duplicate accounts, malicious bots, or identity thieves from accessing private accounts or systems. Locking, in this context, is done solely with the purpose of increasing digital security.</p>
 Reputation Systems 
<p>Implementing reputation systems that track and evaluate the behavior of participants in the decentralized system is another crucial step. Reputation systems can help identify suspicious or malicious activities, making it harder for attackers to blend in and gain influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants with positive reputations may be given more privileges, while those with negative reputations may be subject to additional scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this purpose, SelfKey has developed an <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">engagement system</a> which offers active members the opportunity to mint SELF tokens for their contribution to the DAO.</p>
 Consensus Algorithms 
<p>Consensus mechanisms like <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">Proof of Stake</a> (PoS) or <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practical-byzantine-fault-tolerancepbft/">Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance</a> (PBFT) can require participants to prove ownership of a significant stake. Additionally, they may require them to demonstrate a high level of computational resources. This may make it more challenging for attackers to create a large number of identities and control the network.</p>
 Randomized Node Selection 
<p>Another method which may be efficient in preventing Sybil attacks is to incorporate randomized node selection in the network's protocols and algorithms. By randomly selecting nodes for tasks, such as voting or validation, the likelihood of multiple fake identities controlled by the same attacker being chosen is reduced, making Sybil attacks less effective.</p>
 Network Monitoring and Analysis 
<p>Analyzing network traffic, node behavior, and communication patterns can help identify patterns that are indicative of Sybil attacks. Therefore, employing network monitoring tools and techniques to detect unusual or suspicious activities is crucial.</p>
 Community Engagement and Auditing 
<p>Lastly, encouraging active participation from the community in detecting and reporting potential Sybil attacks is vital. It’s also important to conduct regular audits and security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and address them promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engaging the community can create a collaborative effort to identify and mitigate the risk of Sybil attacks.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that preventing Sybil attacks entirely is challenging, and a combination of preventive measures is often necessary. The specific prevention techniques employed will depend on the nature of the decentralized system, its objectives, and the potential threat landscape.</p>
<p>What’s vital is for the community to work together and for members of a DAO to be consistently active. Not only to keep the DAO alive, but also to protect their common goals and the security and balance of the system they are a part of.</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO aims to become a digital environment which may offer both security and convenience. By utilizing the amazing potential of AI, and with the contribution of its participants, SelfKey strives to prevent cyber attacks that threaten the security and balance of our digital future.</p>

<p>What if the key to your hotel room was suddenly useless, and your personal information was floating in the digital ether? This happened after the recent MGM Resorts cyberattack; the vulnerabilities in our current cybersecurity measures have been laid bare. The incident disrupted the company’s services and jeopardized sensitive customer data, raising serious questions about the efficacy of traditional security protocols.</p>
<p>We will dive into the MGM Resorts cyberattack to uncover the shortcomings in current cybersecurity measures. You’ll also understand why traditional security measures are failing us and how adopting identity-based authentication can safeguard your organization against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.</p>
 Unpacking the Security Incident 
<p>The MGM Resorts cyberattack represents a significant breach in cybersecurity measures, disrupting the company’s services and jeopardizing customer data. The event exposes critical vulnerabilities in organizations that may appear otherwise secure and highlights the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity protocols.</p>
 What Happened? 
<p>On September 11, 2023, MGM Resorts announced they were experiencing a “cybersecurity issue,” which turned out to be more devastating than initially perceived. The company had to shut down various services, ranging from digital room keys to slot machines, resulting in many inconveniences for its guests.</p>
 Timeline of Events 
<p>The company detected the breach and shut down the affected systems to mitigate further damage. Over the next few days, guests and employees faced many problems. Websites for MGM’s numerous properties were offline, and the organization had to resort to manual operations, such as handwritten receipts for casino winnings and long lines for room check-ins.</p>
 Data Types Affected 
<p>The breach compromised a wide variety of data types, potentially including customer personal information and financial details. While the specifics are not yet fully disclosed, the scope of affected data types suggests that the breach could have far-reaching implications for the resort’s guests.</p>
 Affected Stakeholders 
<p>The cyberattack has consequences that extend beyond MGM Resorts. Guests, employees, and possibly even shareholders are affected by the breach. Customers are particularly concerned about their personal and financial information safety, and employees face the challenge of maintaining operations under compromised conditions.</p>
 Why Did It Happen? 
<p>The cyberattack was orchestrated using social engineering tactics, specifically vishing, which involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information over the phone. These tactics exploited human vulnerabilities rather than technological ones, making the attack highly effective.</p>
 Vulnerabilities Exploited 
<p>The primary vulnerability lies in MGM’s human capital. The attackers used publicly available information and a convincing phone manner to gain unauthorized access to MGM’s systems. This form of social engineering underscores the need for better staff training and awareness to prevent future attacks. But it brings to light a deeper issue. Security teams need a way to take end users out of the critical path of cyberattacks and maintain continuous control of network security. But how?</p>
 Shortcomings in Current Authentication Systems 
<p>MGM’s existing authentication protocols were inadequate in preventing a vishing-based attack. The attackers impersonated an MGM employee by calling the IT help desk to obtain the necessary credentials. This exposes critical flaws in the company’s verification systems, raising questions about the efficacy of its cybersecurity measures.</p>
 The Inadequacies of Half-Measures in Authentication 
<p>As seen from the MGM cyber attack, relying on single-factor authentication is a glaring example of outdated security. This method must be revised today when cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although a step in the right direction, multi-factor authentication can fall short if not implemented correctly. For instance, using easily accessible information as a second factor, like a text message sent to a phone, can be intercepted and exploited.</p>
<p>The evolution of security measures has brought us from simple passwords to biometrics and beyond. Yet, many businesses are stuck in the past, relying on these half-measures.</p>
<p>It’s not just about keeping up with the times; it’s about safeguarding your organization’s future. One-size-fits-all solutions are ineffective, and risk-based authentication should be the norm, not the exception.</p>
 Why They Are Insufficient 
<p>Security half-measures, like using codes, devices, or unverified biometrics as identity proxies, are more than just weak points; they open doors for cybercriminals. The MGM breach is a stark reminder of the dangers of compromised security. Beyond financial loss, the real cost lies in eroded customer trust and potential legal consequences that can linger and deeply affect your business.</p>
 Why Businesses Must Move Beyond 
<p>Inadequate security comes with a hefty price tag, and it’s about more than immediate financial losses. Legal consequences and regulatory fines can cripple a business. However, the real challenge lies in restoring customer trust once lost. The MGM breach underscores the urgency for businesses to upgrade from outdated security protocols.</p>
<p>It’s time for businesses to take this issue seriously and invest in robust, up-to-date security protocols that adapt to emerging threats.</p>
 The Case for Identity-Based Authentication 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advantages of Identity-Based Authentication 
<p>Identity-based authentication is not just a feature; it’s a paradigm shift in how we, 1Kosmos, approach security. Traditional methods often rely on something the user knows, like a password, which is vulnerable to attacks. Our platform, however, offers a more advanced and secure approach.</p>
 User Convenience 
<p>One of the standout features of our platform is the convenience it offers to users. Physical attributes used for biometric verification, such as fingerprints or iris scans, are not vulnerable to damage or unexpected alterations. This ensures a swift and user-friendly authentication process, eliminating the need for cumbersome passwords or other traditional methods.</p>
 Flexible Use Cases 
<p>We understand that different scenarios demand different authentication methods. Whether the situation calls for a fingerprint, iris scan, voice match, or any other biometric identifier, our platform provides adaptable and affordable authenticators. This flexibility ensures that the authentication methods can adjust seamlessly as business needs evolve.</p>
 Empirical Data Supporting the Case 
<p>The effectiveness of our identity-based authentication is not theoretical; it’s proven. With&nbsp; industry leading Target Accept Rate (TAR) and False Accept Rate (FAR), our platform offers high accuracy in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our capabilities and certifications to NIST, FIDO2, and iBeta PAD2 are a testament to the system’s capability to reduce the risk of unauthorized access drastically. Our capabilities mean fewer false positives and negatives, streamlining the user experience while maintaining a high level of security.</p>
 How Using 1Kosmos Helps Adopt A Proactive Approach 
 Multi-factor Authentication 
<p>Our multi-factor authentication system, bolstered by the integration of LiveID, is designed to be non-phishable, directly addressing one of the most common vulnerabilities that cybercriminals exploit.</p>
<p>What sets our multi-factor authentication apart? With LiveID, cybercriminals find themselves at a dead end. There’s nothing to steal, even if they attempt to compromise any factor. This unique feature ensures that our MFA system remains solid, secure and virtually impenetrable, providing an unparalleled layer of protection.</p>
<p>This is a game-changer for businesses striving to maintain high-security levels without compromising user convenience. By harnessing the power of LiveID, organizations can deploy a formidable defense against threats while ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>
 Biometric Encryption 
<p>Biometrics in our system are more than just a security feature; they’re foundational. Our liveness detection ensures users are genuine humans, guarding against bots or deepfake attempts essential for tasks like privileged access management and employment verification. But we elevate this with biometric encryption, where a biometric template and a public-private key pair work to encrypt and decrypt personal data, making unauthorized access nearly impossible.</p>
<p>BlockID stands out with its decentralized approach. Instead of central storage, user biometrics are kept private, minimizing attack surfaces. This bolsters security and ensures that biometrics requiring minimal user training can be swiftly and seamlessly integrated across organizations.</p>
 Compliance 
<p>Our platform, anchored in a private blockchain, is designed with user privacy as a forethought, not an afterthought. We don’t just align with GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA – we aim higher. 1Kosmos BlockID secures user personal information, easing GDPR-related challenges and cementing user trust. Additionally, our transparent log provides a clear “chain-of-custody,” which is invaluable for investigations relating to external threats or internal “friendly fraud” scenarios. In all aspects, our focus is to earn trust and ensure integrity.</p>
<p>The cyberattack on MGM Resorts highlights the pressing need for businesses to modernize their security approaches. And it can happen to anyone. While legacy systems were once the pinnacle of security, they now have fundamental limitations in the face of evolving threats. 1Kosmos BlockID advanced, identity-based verification and authentication platform, which are readily available, is user-friendly, private by design and represents the forefront of contemporary security solutions.

 Stakers can claim DF55 rewards. DF56 runs Sep 21–28,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 55 (DF55) has completed. 150K OCEAN was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Sep 14, 2023 and ended 12:01am Sep 21. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>DF56 is live today, Sep 21. It concludes on Sep 28. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF56   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF56 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Creative Destruction — How to Prepare for the Paradigm&nbsp;Shift <p>The concept in economic theory to describe new innovations that replace and make older innovations obsolete. Welcome to Ocean Protocol, aka the creative destruction tool of the 21st century and the New Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><a href="https://oxfordre.com/economics/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.001.0001/acrefore-9780190625979-e-393">Image Source</a> Background <p>The term ‘Creative Destruction’ was first claimed as a subset of Marxism by Karl Marx, but readily identified a century later by Austrian economist <a href="https://www.essentialscholars.org/schumpeter">Joseph Schumpeter</a>. Creative Destruction is the dismantling of long-standing practices in society and business, in order to make way for innovation, and is seen as a driving force of revolutionary change in a capitalist world.</p><p>Principles of Creative Destruction:</p>  Innovation: Creative destruction involves the introduction of new ideas, products, and technologies that replace the existing ones. Innovation is the driving force of creative destruction. Without innovation, creative destruction could not exist and without innovators, there would be no change agents that could make creative destruction happen.  Competition: The process of creative destruction involves intense competition between old and new technologies or products. The new products or technologies must prove to be better and more efficient than the old ones to replace them. For this reason, creative destruction is usually heavily tied to competition and competitive advantages. Companies usually strive to find the best ways to do things and are often willing to creatively destroy what they’ve done in the past to find better long-term solutions.  Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship is also critical to the process of creative destruction. The entrepreneurs who develop new products and technologies and disrupt existing markets are the agents of creative destruction. They are responsible for overseeing change management and educating both internal staff and consumers on how this change will impact them. Without clear guidance on the intention of the creative destruction, the entrepreneur will likely fail in their attempt to innovate.  Capital: A cornerstone principle of creative destruction is capital. Making sweeping, radical innovative changes is often expensive, and companies must be prepared to take on financial risks to make this change. Most often, companies will see venture capital investments to aid with funding the creative destruction.   Ocean Protocol <p>You may have heard the phrase in 2023 that ‘Data is the new oil’. The rise of globalization, e-commerce, and cross-border information sharing has led to the majority of companies globally needing a digital presence, if not functioning entirely digitally. A key driver of creative destruction in the modern economy is data. Data is the backbone of emerging industries such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. However, the current ‘data economy’ is centralized and fragmented. Right now it is quite difficult for businesses to access and use the data they need to innovate and grow. Ocean Protocol provides the solution to this problem and is the pioneer of the New Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>Fragmented data is where we lie at the time of this writing. Before this issue, platforms and services such as Shopify, Stripe, Amazon, and eBay captured product market fit for tailoring to innovation, entrepreneurship, and competition, as mentioned above in the principles of creative destruction.</p><p>Ocean Technology is already being used by a variety of businesses to power data-driven innovation. For Example, <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a>, a strategic product by Mercedes Benz, is poised to enable cross-border data exchange and allow organizations to fully unlock and leverage data for new value streams. The smartwatch &amp; wearable health company <a href="https://brainstem.health/">Brainstem</a> leverages Ocean Protocol technology to allow users to own, monetize, and share their health data generated by the smartwatch.</p><p>Ocean Protocol was founded with a thesis to level the playing field for AI and data. The protocol is an open-source suite of tools to power the New Data Economy. Primary resources that can be used by anyone in beginning their journey in conducting commerce and business in the new age include a javascript library, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js">ocean.js</a>, python library, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py">ocean.py</a>, and a smart contract library, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">see here</a>. A core function of Ocean Protocol is the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a>, a marketplace to share data privately and securely. The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market">market</a> is forkable and can be used in a closed or open-source fashion for data-sharing purposes across enterprises, DAOs, social contexts, or open government data.</p><p>Web3 is about solving business problems. This statement can sound contradictory to the last 18 months of bad actors, stolen funds, and manipulated token price markets. Over the past 18 months in the traditional enterprise space, interest in leveraging blockchain technology and crypto-native payment rails to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the speed of innovation hasn’t gone&nbsp;away.</p> Historical Examples of Creative Destruction <p>This is in anticipation that we are replacing the internet with the blockchain. For the context of a specific paradigm shift, let’s look back at some prominent examples of creative destruction throughout business&nbsp;history:</p> 1. The Automobile Replacing the Horse-Drawn Carriage <p>Old Technology: Horse-drawn carriages<br>New Technology: Automobiles</p> Background: <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, horse-drawn carriages were the primary means of urban transportation. Cities were structured around the needs of horses, with stables, troughs, and blacksmith shops being common urban services.</p> The Shift:   Innovation: In the late 1800s and early 1900s, innovators and entrepreneurs like Karl Benz, Henry Ford, and Ransom Olds began developing gasoline-powered vehicles. The Model T, introduced by Ford in 1908, was especially revolutionary because of its affordability and the adoption of assembly-line production.  Impact on the Old Industry: As automobiles became more affordable and reliable, the demand for horse-drawn carriages plummeted. Blacksmiths, carriage makers, and stable owners found their trades becoming obsolete. Cities transformed, with paved roads, gas stations, and repair shops replacing horse-centric infrastructure.  Economic and Social Implications: The automobile industry's rise created millions of jobs, from manufacturing to sales to infrastructure development. Suburbs became feasible due to increased mobility, changing the very structure of urban and suburban life. However, there were also negative externalities, such as pollution, traffic fatalities, and urban&nbsp;sprawl.   2. Digital Photography Overtaking Film Photography <p>Old Technology: Film-based cameras and photography<br>New Technology: Digital cameras and photography</p> Background: <p>For over a century, photography was dominated by film. Companies like Kodak and Fujifilm produced photographic films and paper, and the process of taking photos involved capturing images on film, developing the film in a dark room, and then printing photos on&nbsp;paper.</p> The Shift:   Innovation: The first digital cameras were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, but it wasn’t until the 1990s and 2000s that they became widely accessible and affordable to the general public. These cameras captured images electronically, allowing for immediate viewing and easy sharing and editing on computers.  Impact on the Old Industry: The rise of digital photography led to a rapid decline in the demand for film. By the 2000s, sales of film cameras had dramatically decreased, and many film manufacturers either went out of business or pivoted to other areas. Notably, Kodak, once a giant in the photography industry, filed for bankruptcy in 2012, largely due to its failure to adapt quickly to the digital&nbsp;age.  Economic and Social Implications: The digital revolution transformed the photography industry. It became cheaper and more accessible for individuals to take and share photos, leading to the rise of platforms like Instagram and Snapchat. New business models emerged, including stock photo websites and online photo printing services. However, traditional photo labs, film manufacturers, and related businesses faced significant challenges or&nbsp;closure.  <p>In both cases, the new technologies brought about vast economic and societal changes, demonstrating the dual nature of creative destruction: the decline of old industries and the rise of new, often transformative, ones. People still drive but in cars and not horses. People still take photos, but digitally and not by&nbsp;film.</p><p>For the NEXT creative destruction event, people will still use the internet, but they will own their data and online presence.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>In this episode, Jamie Smith, founder at <a href="https://www.customerfutures.com/">Customer Futures</a>, explains that true digital transformation, from a digital customer experience perspective, will only occur when we equip customers with their own tools to engage with organisations. Currently, organisations primarily interact with their customers or prospects through four main tools:</p>
 
 Messaging (Push) 
 Emailing (Push) 
 Directing them to the Company’s Website (Pull) 
 Encouraging them to open the Company’s Mobile App (Pull) 
 
<p>Jamie introduces the concept of a Fifth Channel: a new customer endpoint. This channel will not only be used for identity purposes but also for payments, preferences, and managing intent. These endpoints will have the capability to communicate directly with enterprise systems. In essence, by providing customers with this fifth channel, a trusted customer endpoint, organisations can anticipate higher conversion rates, increased revenue per user, improved customer satisfaction, and enhanced loyalty.</p>
<p>We obviously cover much more around the implications of having consumers be in control of their own endpoints..</p>
<p>Here’s a sneak peek from the episode:</p>
<p></p>  <br>
<br><br><p></p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Jamie and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Exploring Customer Engagement Channels: What are the various channels organisations use today to engage with their customers, and what are their respective pros and cons? 
 The Human Touch in Digital Interactions: In an era dominated by digital communications, is there still value in maintaining a human touch in interactions between organisations and individuals? 
 Bureaucracy in Communication: How has bureaucracy infiltrated various communication mechanisms, and what does this mean for consumers seeking genuine interactions? 
 The Role of Intermediaries: How do intermediaries like Google and Apple influence our interactions, and what role do they play in the ongoing transformation of digital identity? 
 Quality Over Quantity: How can organisations shift their focus from quantity to quality in their interactions, ensuring more meaningful and impactful engagements? 
 The Evolution of Identifiers: How have identifiers evolved in the digital age, and what role do they play in shaping the future of customer engagement? 
 Empowering Consumers with Identifiers: How can giving control of identifiers to consumers enhance their interactions with organisations and deepen relationships? 
 Organisational ID and Trust: How can organisational identifiers enhance trust and combat fraud in digital interactions? 
 The Intersection of AI and Customer Engagement: (a) What are the exciting developments in the AI space, and how can they enhance customer experiences?

 Although they may not be as glitzy or glamorous as their Las Vegas counterparts, online casinos can be just as dangerous and rife with fraud and deception. 



 



<p>The global online gambling market is estimated to be worth over $60 billion and shows no signs of slowing. In fact, for the next five years, it is projected to <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/online-gambling-market">grow by 11.34%</a> every single year, reaching over £103 billion by 2028.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the main reasons for online gambling’s steady expansion is the proliferation of smartphones, which has enabled casual and active players alike to gamble from the comfort of their home. Each of the four main types of gambling – poker, casino, lotteries and sports betting – have now firmly made the transition from brick and mortar to the digital world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online casino operators have certainly embraced innovative uses of technology to offer increasingly dynamic and action-filled player experiences. Little wonder, then, that the segment predicts an <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/online-casinos/worldwide">annual growth rate of 7.42%</a>. In the UK alone, there are at least 175 online casinos, with that figure growing every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, much like with other forms of online gambling, as online casinos handle substantial financial transactions, they tend to attract money launderers and financial criminals who attempt to compromise user accounts to harvest personal data.&nbsp;</p>



 Risk vs reward.&nbsp; 



<p>According to TransUnion’s 2022 Report, digital fraud in the global gaming market <a href="https://www.transunion.com/content/dam/transunion/hk/business/collateral/report/GFS-22-F99975%202022%20Annual%20Fraud%20Report%20v10b.pdf">rose nearly 33% in one year</a>, with identity theft, credit card fraud, and account takeover fraud being the main consumer concerns. In another Ravelin report (2022) <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/16766/study-71-rise-in-bonus-abuse-reported-by-online-gambling-firms">71% of online gambling operators</a> reported an increase in promotion abuse, and 67% of merchants reported a rise in payment details taken from customer accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like many industries, COVID proved to be a main driver for the gambling industry’s rapid digital transformation. For example, <a href="https://www.xace.io/payments/gambling-statistics-uk-2022?utm_source=google.com&amp;utm_medium=organic">online casino usage increased by 22.5% in 2021</a>, and that trajectory has only continued upward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, as online casinos are one of the biggest and fastest growing segments of the online gaming industry, let’s take a moment to understand why and how KYC processes can enable gaming operators to safeguard their online casinos against fraudulent activities.&nbsp;</p>



 What is KYC in online casinos, and why do gambling operators need it?&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20means%20%E2%80%9CKnow%20Your%20Customer,KYC%20ebook%20for%20more%20insights">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> is a process used by online casinos and other online gambling platforms to:&nbsp; 



  Verify the age and identities of customers&nbsp;  Ascertain whether identity documents are legit&nbsp;  Detect risk factors, such as problem gambling (gambling addiction, affordability issues).&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>KYC is an essential part of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/combating-financing-of-terrorism-cft/">Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF)</a> regulations in many countries. Adhering to these regulations protects operators from reputational or monetary risks, and safeguards customers and national economies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides preventing fraud and guaranteeing compliance with age restrictions, KYC helps operators ensure responsible gambling measures and filter out problem gamblers. By monitoring customers’ gambling activity and evaluating their spending patterns, operators can identify those at risk of developing gambling problems, such as gambling addiction.&nbsp;</p>



 Balancing security and user experience.&nbsp; 



<p>Due to the surge in demand for online casinos, many operators are implementing increased identity and KYC checks to enhance security while maintaining player satisfaction. In this dynamic and competitive environment, a sluggish or outdated onboarding process can lead users to abandon registration, decide not to play, or worse, head over to a rival online casino. Neglecting the KYC process, however, may expose online casinos to security threats and significant regulatory penalties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC processes in online casinos should be executed in a manner that helps gambling operators verify players’ identities without <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/">compromising on compliance</a>, convenience, or security.&nbsp;</p>



 Are online casinos without KYC worth the gamble?&nbsp; 



<p>Despite the obvious benefits to KYC processes, many players seek the allure of a “no KYC online casino,” driven by a desire for a frictionless gaming experience. They are drawn to the prospect of playing without KYC interruptions because they believe it will expedite their access to games and withdrawals. This demand has also given rise to the popularity of search engine queries such as “online casino without ID” and “UK casino no verification”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players argue that stringent KYC processes can be time-consuming and invasive. They also express concerns about privacy, fearing that the extensive collection of personal information could potentially lead to data breaches or misuse of their details. This unease may prompt players to actively seek out operators that offer an “online casino without KYC” to protect their privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s crucial for online casino operators to strike a balance between meeting regulatory requirements and addressing player objections. While players seek a streamlined, less intrusive experience, operators must ensure their platforms remain compliant with legal and security standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balancing this challenge requires careful navigation, yet discovering inventive methods to simplify KYC procedures while upholding the gaming environment’s integrity can ultimately result in a more gratifying experience for both players and operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, players are more likely to trust casinos with transparent verification processes. This is likely to result in increased customer loyalty, improved revenue, and long-term success for the operator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pursuit of ‘no KYC onboarding’ is also prevalent in the crypto industry. Read more about the dangers of forgoing KYC checks in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">‘Buying crypto without a KYC check? Here’s why it’s risky for users and platform operators.’ blog</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Explaining the KYC process in online casinos.&nbsp; 



<p>At its core, the KYC process in online casinos involves a series of identity checks that players must complete before they can engage in money wagering on online casino platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To comply with KYC requirements for online casinos, players are typically asked to provide a range of personal information (location, age), including government-issued identification documents like driver’s licenses, ID cards or passports, and proof of address such as utility bills, bank statements and paychecks. This way, apart from checking the legitimacy of the funds, i.e., the source, the casino can verify whether the user can afford to play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the steps the UK is taking to combat problem gambling by reimagining <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/affordability-financial-risk-checks/">affordability checks</a> and launching new <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">financial risk check requirements</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some cases, a photograph or video selfie is also needed to confirm a player’s identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These documents and identity data are thoroughly reviewed by the casino’s compliance team, who cross-reference them to validate the player’s age, identity, and residence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Personal data protection and privacy.&nbsp; 



<p>Similar to how reputable firms value trust in terms of providing customers with fair and safe environment, customers must also be able to trust that the data collected is properly safeguarded and handled carefully. Operators are therefore required to keep the personal data they collect completely secure during the process and handle it appropriately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling operators must prioritize both ethical practices and data security through encryption and secure storage. By implementing robust data encryption protocols as well as secure storage practices, operators can effectively reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This is particularly true regarding KYC procedures, which involve handling sensitive personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, data protection laws such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> also exist to secure data from bad actors and cybercriminals. Once again, since operators deal with sensitive information like bank account details, adhering to data protection laws is essential.&nbsp;</p>



 The technology behind KYC processes in online casinos.&nbsp; 



<p>As the demand for online gambling services increases, so does the stringency of regulatory compliance. Not only does this mean hiring a large compliance team to deal with the backlog, but online casinos are also now subject to higher costs and wait times for identity verification procedures. In this sense, manual KYC processing for casinos is a little outdated, offering a clunky solution that wastes time, squanders budgets, and is littered with errors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many online casino operators now make use of various technological and automated tools and services to streamline KYC processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the most effective technologies include automated identity verification systems. which involves biometric authentication, AI and machine learning for fraud detection. By leveraging such tools, operators can verify the identity of their customers and protect the business at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the positives, technology-driven KYC provides a more efficient and accurate way to authorize user identities and detect fraudulent behavior, along with other signs of problem gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the limitations, implementing such tools will likely involve staff training and require constant updating and maintenance. However, considering the eventual convenience and security technology-driven KYC offers, such limitations are largey outweighed by the positives.&nbsp;</p>



 The future of KYC in online casinos.&nbsp; 



<p>As the popularity of online gambling is unlikely to slow down anytime soon, fraudsters will continue to pose both reputational and business risks. Online casinos that wish to thrive in the new era of gambling must ensure they have a robust KYC process. As threats increase, regulations are only going to get more strict.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The future of KYC is likely to involve more advanced technology, such as integrating biometrics for enhanced security and additional data checks in the background, i.e., financial risk checks, as seen by a series of proposed changes in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">UK Gambling White Paper</a>. For more information about financial risk checks, and how our 6-pronged approach is the most comprehensive in the market, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">‘Reimagining affordability: Why 6 financial risk check indicators are better than 2.’ blog</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today's perpetually changing digital landscape, the importance of identity within the enterprise has taken center stage.&nbsp; As both workforce and consumer demands grow, there's a critical need for robust solutions that can manage the entire identity lifecycle, securely linking an individual's identity with who they claim to be.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> provides a comprehensive framework for managing and securing the modern user lifecycle. It ensures that organizations have the confidence that the identity of each individual aligns with who they claim to be, providing seamless validation and protection at every stage of the identity lifecycle.</p> 
 Why Is There an Increasing Need for Identity Assurance?  
<p>Organizations typically use point-in-time and ad-hoc processes to establish an individual’s identity and then assert this identity through authentication. This does not meaningfully address the continuous changes that occur in terms of attack vector, methods or risk factors. Key moments in time such as changes in the individual’s status, high-risk events like resetting credentials, or changes to the threat landscape, challenge the legacy process to establish an individual’s identity. Nearly half of organizations <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/95392-of-businesses-dont-use-a-user-verification-policy-for-password-reset-calls-to-it-service-desks">lack a user verification policy for password reset calls</a> to IT service desks. Identity assurance takes a comprehensive, integrated approach to address these limitations and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Identity and authentication attacks impact a wide range of industries, but some are more frequently targeted due to the potential for financial gain or access to sensitive information. Industries most affected include:</p> 
  
  Financial Services: Banks, credit card companies, and fintech firms are prime targets for identity theft and authentication attacks. Cybercriminals aim to gain access to financial accounts, steal funds, or commit fraud.  
  Critical Infrastructure: Including energy and utility companies, oil &amp; gas, supply chain and 13 other critical infrastructure verticals as defined by CISA are susceptible to attacks that can disrupt critical services, compromise sensitive data, and potentially lead to widespread blackouts or damage.  
  Hospitality Industry: Hotels and restaurants make attractive targets because of the valuable guest data they collect and maintain, including payment details, addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive information.  
  E-commerce and Online Marketplaces: Online marketplaces are frequently targeted by attackers aiming to compromise user accounts, engage in fraudulent transactions, and steal personal information.  
  
 What Is the Difference Between Identity Assurance and Authentication?  
<p>Authentication is primarily concerned with verifying identity at the point of access, typically for a specific session or transaction. It is the daily or multi-daily process of verifying the credentials of an entity based on the presented information, such as biometric data (e.g., fingerprints or facial recognition), smart cards or tokens. It answers the question, "Is this user who they claim to be right now?"&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance goes beyond authentication. It incorporates authentication as one of its components but also includes key complementary identity technologies and processes that together create a comprehensive and continuous trust framework. Identity Assurance involves a comprehensive assessment of identity, often incorporating factors like identity verification (also referred to as identity proofing), continuous monitoring, and risk assessment. It is not limited to a single transaction or access request, but extends to the overall trustworthiness of an identity over time, and is invoked at specific “moments in time” such as onboarding a new employee or completion of a high risk transaction.</p> 
 What Are the NIST Identity Assurance Levels (IALs)?  
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines identity assurance levels as part of its <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">Digital Identity Guidelines</a>, NIST 800-63-3. Other countries and industries may have their own frameworks and terminology for categorizing identity assurance.</p> 
<p>Identity assurance level 1 (IAL1): There is no requirement to link the applicant to a specific real-life identity. Any attributes provided in conjunction with the subject’s activities are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted (including attributes a CSP asserts to an RP). Self asserted attributes are neither validated nor verified.</p> 
<p>Identity assurance level 2 (IAL2): Evidence supports the real-world existence of the claimed identity and verifies that the applicant is appropriately associated with this real-world identity. IAL2 introduces the need for either remote or physically-present identity proofing. Attributes could be asserted by CSPs to RPs in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes. A CSP that supports IAL2 can support IAL1 transactions if the user consents.</p> 
<p>Identity assurance level 3 (IAL3): Physical presence is required for identity proofing. Identifying attributes must be verified by an authorized and trained CSP representative. As with IAL2, attributes could be asserted by CSPs to RPs in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes. A CSP that supports IAL3 can support IAL1 and IAL2 identity attributes if the user consents.</p> 
<p>The NIST IALs specifically apply to identity at&nbsp; a single point in time, and do not address ongoing authentication, risk monitoring, and other critical aspects of a broader Identity Assurance strategy.</p> 
 How Does Identity Assurance Work?  
<p>1. Authenticate</p> 
<p>A systematic Identity Assurance approach is built on a foundation of strong, phishing-resistant authentication, which completely eliminates passwords across populations, applications and locations. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">Passwordless authentication</a> that is based on FIDO2 standards replaces passwords with passkeys and is considered the gold standard for phishing-resistant authentication by CISA, the OMB and other industry bodies. This strong authentication is used for daily access to organizational systems and resources.</p> 
<p>2. Verify</p> 
<p>Before any type of access can be provisioned, the person’s identity needs to be established and verified. Under an Identity Assurance model, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/identity-verification-vs-authentication">identity verification</a> is an automated and ongoing process that is integrated into manager and help desk workflows. The verification process generally leverages multiple techniques, such as document proofing, biometrics and database verification and ideally includes additional measures such as video verification through a live video feed and manager attestation. It’s critical that the process does not use passwords or knowledge-based factors at any point.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>3. Monitor</p> 
<p>Complete assurance is maintained throughout the employee or customer lifecycle by <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">monitoring for risky or unusual behavior</a> on a per-user basis through the use of a risk and policy engine. Risks can be determined based on either the user behavior or changes in the overall threat landscape. Upon detecting an increased level of risk, the system can alert or invoke a re-authentication or re-verification based on defined policies.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>4. Unify</p> 
<p>Comprehensive Identity Assurance unifies all elements of the user lifecycle from the first point of contact with the user through offboarding. This eliminates security gaps caused by manual or disconnected processes.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Are the Benefits?  
<p>Identity Assurance takes a holistic view toward identity security, uniting a currently fragmented landscape. This creates many improvements for organizations implementing this approach, including:</p> 
  
  Preventing credential-based attacks: Weak authentication accounts for more than 60% of all breaches but many organizations struggle to even implement legacy MFA due to the challenges with the user experience. Identity Assurance is built on the foundation of strong authentication, eliminating one of the largest attack vectors while improving user experience and accelerating adoption.&nbsp;  
  
  
  Continuous assurance: With identity as the new perimeter and a strategic imperative for the business, organizations need to know which of their employees and customers are accessing what resources and that the identity presented truly matches the individual providing it.&nbsp; The risk associated with an individual continuously changes as they perform new actions or take on new responsibilities and as the threat landscape continues to evolve.&nbsp; Identity Assurance complements the strongest authentication with continuous monitoring that utilizes risk signals from endpoint, cloud, and mobile sources. &nbsp; Risky behavior can be mitigated by forcing the user to reauthenticate or even reverify their identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
  
  Business acceleration: Identity Assurance reduces risk and accelerates the business across all parts of the employee lifecycle. For employers, it directly improves the employee onboarding experience and the interactions that the employee has with the help desk and other identity-related interactions. For consumers, it eliminates processes where the consumer needs to physically interact with an organization (ie: speaking with a teller at a bank to get verified). By substantially reducing identity risk to the organization, it also enables organizations to securely and confidently make changes that save on costs.  
  
 Identity Assurance Best Practices  
<p>Here are some guidelines to get you started in building your own Identity Assurance approach.&nbsp;</p> 
1. Start with the strongest authentication
<br> 
<p>Make sure you deploy strong, phishing-resistant authentication based on the FIDO passkey standard.</p> 
2. Enhance security with integrated identity verification/proofing
<br> 
<p>Identity proofing should be integrated with ongoing authentication processes and risk-based analysis, rather than performed only at specific points in time.&nbsp;</p> 
3. Create a password-free employee or customer lifecycle&nbsp;
<br> 
<p>Integrate proofing and provisioning into the onboarding process such that people never have to use a password.</p> 
4. Take steps to prevent pre-employment fraud
<br> 
<p>Develop a profile on interviewees and contractors to ensure that the person who interviews for the job is the person who shows up.&nbsp;</p> 
5. Delegate control to managers
<br> 
<p>Empower managers to control the verification of their employees for critical tasks such as onboarding, aided by intelligent tools and AI.</p> 
6. Enable end to end visibility
<br> 
<p>Make sure your risk engine leverages real-time data from multiple sources, including mobile devices, endpoints and browsers.</p> 
 The Future of Identity Assurance&nbsp;  
<p>Identity and access management continues to rapidly evolve and the future is being written now with the concept of Identity Assurance. Some interesting trends include:</p> 
<p>Tactics and Techniques: As technology advances, so do the techniques and tactics of cybercriminals. Identity Assurance will need to adapt to emerging threats, such as deepfakes and AI-driven attacks.</p> 
<p>AI /ML: AI can be used to detect fraudulent activities and anomalous behavior by analyzing user interactions and historical data. Machine learning algorithms can improve identity verification processes.</p> 
<p>Interoperability: The ability to seamlessly and securely share identity information across different services and platforms will be crucial. Standardization efforts will play a significant role in achieving this.</p>

<p>The fourth of four reflections after <a href="https://katecarruthers.com">Kate Carruthers</a> and I spoke on her <a href="https://datarevolution.tech/2023/09/20/steve-wilson/">Data Revolution podcast</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of our conversation, we turned to practical implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lockstep asserts that if we used mobile wallets to present verified data to registration forms and login screens, then consumers and busiesses would not be vulnerable to impersonation after data breaches.</p>
<p>The user experience would be exactly like the now familiar click-to-pay. We should “click to present” our driver licence, passport, Medicare card, proof of age, working with children check and every other piece of important official data.</p>
 How to get there? 
<p>What would the pathway to adoption of mobile wallets for personal data look like? It’s not nearly as complicated as you might think.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s easy to be jaded or sceptical. Digital identity has been the slowest moving corner of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Wonderful ideas like the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">Laws of Identity</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CardSpace">Cardspace</a> came and went over 15 years ago.&nbsp; Certain big consumer businesses in Australia have been trying to build identity provision services for over 20 years without ever seeing mass adoption.&nbsp; The U.K. and U.S. governments shut down their private-public digital identity federations (which were rooted in the same <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/market-failure-of-digital-identity/">Standard Model of Digital Identity</a> as our <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/tdif">TDIF</a> — a very bad sign that has yet to register in Canberra).</p>
<p>And now I seem to be calling for some kind of radical change when I say the very idea of digital identity is just not helpful. But no, the change I want to see is to meet consumers where they are most comfortable with data protection.</p>
<p>Most consumers are already using the perfect technology for the identification problem: mobile wallets and digital credentials.</p>
<p>People are used to the patterns of click-to-pay and tap-to-pay. The very same technology could present any officially endorsed facts and figures, safely and easily.</p>
<p>The card payments industry sorted this out years ago. The card networks have just one job: distribute verified copies of account numbers worldwide in a matrix of standard rules for issuing and using them.</p>
<p>Account numbers are simply a special class of data.</p>
<p>Thanks to the card networks, a merchant anywhere in the world can accept my credit card number without knowing me — or more’s the point, without knowing my bank or anything about the Australian banking system.&nbsp; The networks distribute scheme rules and card holder metadata to all end points globally. Every merchant and every consumer in these networks know where they stand if they follow the rules.</p>
<p>Make no mistake; the chip card and smart phone wallet are verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>With mobile wallets and click-to-pay being well habituated now, a profound shift in data resilience could play out in a very mundane way. A smart phone wallet could easily hold verifiable credentials for a couple of dozen official facts that figure in what we do online day to day. Each of those facts originate from different established issuers (and not from Apple or Google or any other wallet technology provider).</p>
<p>It’s significant that the government is at pains to say their “Digital ID” does not entail any new ID. Minister Katy Gallagher describes it as “<a href="https://www.themandarin.com.au/230698-gallagher-sets-out-digital-id-expectations-to-tech-industry">the online version of showing someone your passport or your driver’s licence</a>”.</p>
<p>It seems we all agree that what’s needed is a better safer way to prove the same old real-world credentials in the digital world.</p>

				  The era of seamless travel has arrived: SITA’s Digital Travel Credential isn’t just a better way to travel and cross borders, it’s a symbol of a new era in privacy-preserving, trustworthy digital interaction.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The promise of digital interaction is that it can be frictionless, instantaneous, and effective. To fulfill this promise, technology must bridge the gap between a world built on paper and one navigated with mobile devices — and that crossing must be effortless and trusted. On the other side of paper is a world of seamless navigation, seamless processes, seamless trust.</p>
<p>That world starts in Aruba.</p>
<p>The island has stepped up to the challenge of digital transformation by embracing decentralized identity technology to build that bridge to seamless experience. And it starts with travel. Solidifying its reputation, in terms of digital innovation, as the Estonia of the Caribbean, the tourism-dependent island is working with SITA, the global leader in IT for air travel, to make visiting the island seamless.</p>
<p>The decision was built on a series of successful trials that culminated, in March this year, with a global first: air travelers were able to seamlessly cross an international border using a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) backed by a blockchain. Before leaving for the airport, passengers scanned their passports, rendering the information in a way that allowed it to be shared for border crossing ahead of travel. The 100 percent success rate in this trial led to the announcement at the ICAO Trip Conference in Montreal on September 12 that the government of Aruba is now exploring how to implement the DTC technology island wide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, a DTC would allow visitors to automatically check in to their hotels, access their hotel rooms, rent cars, and basically accomplish everything they need to do on vacation with a swipe or a scan of a mobile device. As Andrew Hoo, Director of Immigration for the Government of Aruba <a href="https://www.passengerterminaltoday.com/news/biometrics/aruba-close-to-rolling-out-digital-travel-credentials-across-the-island.html">put it</a>: “We want to use this technology so that visitors will never forget they are on vacation when they arrive on the island.”</p>
<p>But a DTC also benefits airlines by radically simplifying the check-in process, freeing up airport space, reducing lines, and providing an authoritative way to verify that everyone boarding a flight for an international destination is legally permitted to arrive in the destination country. Similar travel credentials, such as a boarding pass verifiable credential, can also be used to manage lounge access and provide additional services through the rich communications features of verifiable credentials. In addition, the DTC can also be used to enable a complete biometric experience using high quality passenger data.</p>
<p>Built in partnership with <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">Indicio</a> and following the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) standards for a digital travel credential, the DTC uses decentralized identity technology to verify the authenticity of the data in a person’s passport without that data having to be stored,&nbsp; managed by a third party, or shared through a direct integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In doing all this, decentralized identity technology provides the bridge from the world of paper documentation to digital devices by creating verifiable data that can be held by a person, organization or thing. Both the source of the data and the integrity of the data can be verified without the data itself having to be held and checked by a third party or shared directly between databases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When combined with passengers holding their data in a verifiable credential like the DTC, this eliminates data privacy issues and provides people with a genuine way to consent to sharing personal data. (If you’re new to this technology, see our “<a href="https://indicio.tech/a-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-identity/">Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Identity</a>” for a full, easy-to-follow explanation of how it works.”)</p>
<p>The result? A traveler can, effectively, cross a border while still at home on their couch, speeding up the current process of border crossing, <a href="https://www.phocuswire.com/after-successful-test-sita-indicio-advance-digital-travel-id">according</a> to Jeremy Springall, SITA Senior Vice President for Border Management, by 90 percent. As Edwin Kelly, Director General of the Department of Civil Aviation in Aruba, put it in the same article, “no lines.”</p>
<p>A world of no lines and seamless data sharing beckons. Indicio is implementing seamless solutions using the open-source decentralized identity technology behind the DTC wherever high value data needs to be trusted. As Indicio CEO, Heather Dahl puts it, “immediately verifiable data is the bridge to a new digital era. The ability to trust that who you are interacting with is who you believe you are interacting with, and whether the data they present can be trusted, have been holding back innovation, trapping us in processes and systems that are inefficient and insecure and, above all, costly. With this technology, cost-efficient digital transformation is here — and it is going to change everything.”</p>

<p>My recollection of certificate linting goes back to 2016. Linting started happening to most public trust TLS certificates after three items came together.</p>
<p>So, what is linting? </p>
<p>I am not a software developer, so the term was foreign to me, but a quick search defined it as: “…the process of performing static analysis on source code to flag patterns that might cause errors or other problems.” The linting must detect specific problems to provide errors or warnings before moving forward. As such, the linting software could be written to analyze each certificate to see if it met the TLS Baseline Requirements, EV Guidelines and RFC 5280, as applicable</p>
<p>Linting, a brief history</p>
<p>In January 2015, the Certification Authorities (CAs) were required by Google Chrome policy to <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2014/12/moving-forward-with-certificate-transparency/">log all Extended Validation (EV) TLS certificates to certificate transparency (CT) logs</a>. CT logs captured a real-time set of certificates from all CAs issuing EV TLS certificates. In addition, it also provided CT logs for all TLS certificates to be manually logged. The result was a resource of certificates to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the CT logging requirement, cert-search, also known as <a href="https://crt.sh/">crt.sh</a>, was launched. This web application allows people or applications to search all TLS certificates which have been CT logged. Cert-search also provided a growing list of tools to analyze the certificates.</p>
<p>Soon after, CA certificate managers struggled with how they were going to ensure their TLS certificates would meet all TLS Baseline Requirements, not to mention RFC 5280 (internet standards for certificate profile). The solution: Linting tools were created and published for open use through Github.</p>
<p>With everything in place, cert-search provided a 7-day real-time linting analysis of all TLS certificates. Here is an example using the cablint tool, <a href="https://crt.sh/?cablint=1+week">https://crt.sh/?cablint=1+week</a>.</p>
<p>By early 2016, the linting results indicated some certificate fatalities, and many certificate errors and warnings. This was really a name and shame game on all CAs which issued certificates not meeting the requirements. All CAs, browsers, auditors, and researchers could see if CAs had challenges when issuing TLS certificates. However, without any requirement for the CAs to review the linting results, the certificate problems slowly went away. Improvements were further increased when the CAs were required to<a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2016/11/certificate-transparency-deployment-in-2017/"> log Domain and Organization Validated TLS certificates in CT effective October 2017</a>.</p>
<p>Linting can also be deployed in a non-name and shame fashion, as it could be deployed by the CA directly as it issued its own TBS (to-be-signed) certificate, CT pre-certificate or TLS certificate. This would allow the CA to either prevent the non-complaint certificate to be issued or detect the non-complaint certificate in a short period after issuance. The CA can also extend the same methodology to other certificate types such as <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-signing/secure-email-certificates">S/MIME</a>, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-signing/code-signing-certificates">Code Signing</a> and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-certificates/verified-mark-certificates">Verified Mark Certificates.</a></p>
<p>In a future blog, I will address how linting is being deployed in both the ecosystem and by Entrust. Until then, here are some linters to explore: <a href="https://github.com/certlint">certlint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zmap/zlint">zlint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/digicert/pkilint">pkilint</a> and a tool to manually <a href="https://crt.sh/lintcert">lintcerts</a>.</p>

<p>The third of four reflections after <a href="https://katecarruthers.com">Kate Carruthers</a> and I spoke on her <a href="https://datarevolution.tech/2023/09/20/steve-wilson/">Data Revolution podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Now we turn to the vexed topic of identity.</p>
 Digital Identity is nothing like Identity 
<p>Kate and I discussed verifiable credentials and how they help with data minimisation. This brought us to digital identity practices.</p>
<p>New South Wales is one jurisdiction getting really close to good data minimisation solutions, based on the hugely popular digital driver’s license and the next generation offering they call the “NSW Digital ID”.</p>
<p>But I wish they wouldn’t call a “Digital ID” because it’s actually a lot less than identity. </p>
<p>It’s really collections of factoids.</p>
<p>Look at the archetypal use case. To enter a licensed club in Sydney as a casual visitor, I currently need to prove that I’m over 18 and that I live within a certain radius.</p>
<p>These facts are not my identity — they’re just contextually important attributes under registered club regulations. At the moment, clubs look at driver licences for these details (actually, the acute privacy problem is that clubs scan entire licences and log the details for compliance purposes).</p>
<p>But soon people will be able to prove these specific facts using the New South Wales MyServiceNSW digital wallet, without leaking any other superfluous details. This will be great but calling it a “Digital ID” or a “digital identity” is confusing and unnecessary.</p>
 Which identity are we talking about? 
<p>Terminologically, the trouble is that there’s two different sorts of identity.</p>
<p>I have my identity as Steve Wilson, the person, which is something I feel so very strongly. It’s analogue and biological and social. This identity is uniquely what makes me me. It’s sovereign (in a way).</p>
<p>But that identity is nothing like what we’re dealing with online!</p>
<p>In the digital realm, we’re dealing with many different sets of factoids that are relevant in different contexts.</p>
<p>On the podcast, Kate wasn’t as worried about the words we use. She highlighted there are “many wrong and stupid names out there” such as Web 2.0 and Web3, which we get stuck with.</p>
<p>But we continue to witness the confusion and suspicion that go with the concept of “digital identity” especially in government hands.</p>
<p>Australia’s federal Minister with carriage of digital identity, Katy Gallagher, told an industry forum last week that “Importantly, [the federal] Digital ID is not a card, nor a unique number, nor a new Form of ID … It’s just an easy way of verifying who you are online, against existing government-held identity documents without having to hand over any physical information.” Clearly our lawmakers are conscious of the baggage that goes with digital identity, especially new forms.</p>
<p>So, if the language is problematic, not to mention inaccurate, then don’t use it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new generation verifiable credentials are really all about attributes, credentials, facts and figures. We should call them precisely “attributes”, “credentials”, “facts” and “figures”.</p>
<p>Think about the scenario where I’m at home and a stranger comes to my door to fix my leaking pipe. They’re supposed to be a plumber and I want to check.&nbsp; If I asked them to “show me your identity”, they’d probably be insulted. All they want to prove (and all I need to know) is that they’re a licensed plumber.</p>
<p>So I believe it’s sloppy to keep referring to these diverse collections of facts and figures as “identity” because it’s so not identity.</p>
<p>By design, digital credentials are less than identity.</p>
<p>We all want the transactional data about us to be less than our identity. We want the data to be nothing more and nothing less than the contextualised facts needed to allow parties to do something specific together.</p>
<p>Words matter. The lack of precision in the way we talk about “digital identity” leads to over-identification, over-disclosure, and inappropriate identity re-use (usually in the name of user convenience).</p>
<p>The words we use shape the way we think about the problem. If identity is really not the thing we need to know, then it’s actual madness to misname it.</p>
<p>Identity as we’ve seen crosses over between laypeople and deeply technical engineers; between professionals and citizens. It’s critical that we speak with precision.</p>
 Identification versus Identity 
<p>This brought Kate and me to look at the none-too-subtle difference between identification and identity.</p>
<p>The process or ceremony of identification is a nearly daily experience. Some other party always wants to check who I am before dealing with me. But you don’t need to dig deep to appreciate what’s really going on here. It is extremely rare that anyone needs to know who I am.</p>
<p>Rather, an “identification” almost always checks a handful of specific facts about me. Different facts matter in different use cases. So every business does identification differently (and that is the simplest explanation for the repeated failure of large-scale identity federations).</p>
<p>So here’s the truth about the current digital “identity crisis”. Identification performed online has only bare facts to go by.</p>
<p>Look at the aftermath of the Optus breach. It is completely ridiculous that I am vulnerable to fraudsters because some simple facts and figures about me have become available on the dark web. It is ridiculous that criminals can simply replay these numbers behind my back and “assume” my identity.</p>
 Where exactly is KYC broken? 
<p>To open a new online bank account, all I need to know is somebody’s passport and driver’s license.</p>
<p>As far as I know, no criminal tries to open a fake account over the counter anymore.&nbsp; Criminals once went to shady bazaars to buy counterfeit passports for $100 and driver’s licenses for $50, then take them to a suburban bank branch to open a fake account.</p>
<p>Now they can buy the same data online for about a 10th of the price.</p>
<p>What’s really interesting is that the identification logic (the so-called Know Your Customer or KYC protocol) has not changed and is therefore still valid. </p>
<p>Whether the account is opened online or in-branch, the bank still just wants to know four or five facts to indicate it’s probably a known person opening the account. So, the same facts suffice online and offline — so long as those facts are correct.</p>
<p>The problem we have as a nation in responding to so-called identity theft is that it is actually data theft. We are failing to recognise this and deal with it appropriately because we are failing to name it correctly.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals don’t steal anyone’s identity. They just steal enough facts and figures about me that they can pretend to be me online.</p>
<p>I love that our government is responding to the data breach epidemic with real muscle.&nbsp; But it disturbs me that they seem to be moving towards a new National ID as the answer. Our collective blind spot is largely a result of being imprisoned by the language of “digital identity”.</p>
<p>So we don’t need any new ID. What we need to do is to make our existing facts and figures better so that they can’t be replayed in fraudulent identification. We don’t have any identity problem in the wake of the Optus breach; we’ve got a data problem.</p>
<p>If we were focused on the core problem and just solved the provenance of data used in identification, then we could also solve the provenance of data in multiple digital scenarios. We could use the same technology — networked digital credentials and data signing — to tackle digital authenticity across the whole of cyberspace. </p>
 Further reading: Data Supply Chain Quality 
<p>With AI, we are worried about the source of the data used to train algorithms. We’re worried about algorithmic transparency (when an adverse insurance rating is made about me, I’d like to know what the algorithm is).</p>
<p>We could “stamp” the products of Big Data and AI to name the algorithms used, the provenance of the training data, and the governance conditions.</p>
<p>So there’s a vital recurring pattern in all these contemporary digital problems, which boils down to data and metadata.</p>
<p>We depend on data. We all live on data. Digital businesses thrive on the stuff. We all need to have better data.</p>
<p>We know how to measure data quality and gauge the properties that matter. We could imprint the quality measures like a hallmark on every piece of data that matters in a straightforward way using proven verifiable credentials technology.</p>

<p>The second of four reflections after <a href="https://katecarruthers.com">Kate Carruthers</a> and I spoke on her <a href="https://datarevolution.tech/2023/09/20/steve-wilson/">Data Revolution podcast</a>.</p>
<p>We started with data sharing and then ventured onto how verifiable credentials have a bigger purpose than identity.</p>
<p>Kate asked me to break down this very cool technology.</p>
 Driven by privacy 
<p>One of the drivers for verifiable credentials is privacy and data minimisation. While discussing data sharing, Kate questioned how can we trust the many parties to whom we give our data?</p>
<p>The first and foremost privacy protection is to give them as little data as possible. That is, disclosure minimisation. I don’t want to tell a liquor store anything more than my credit card number, my delivery address and the fact that I’m over 18.</p>
<p>And the liquor store should want to know much more than that. While there are widespread habits in business to collect as much data about customers as possible, as Kate said on the podcast, it is dawning on managers that “if you think about data as an asset, you’ve also got to think about it as a liability”.</p>
<p>So the question should be, what exactly does one party need to know about another? Can we arrange for just the right data to be disclosed — nothing less and nothing more? Verifiable credentials are a powerful technology and design pattern for doing just this.</p>
<p>The term verifiable credential integrates several layers of protection.</p>
 A. Machine readable 
<p>We all know what credentials are in real life. Think of a university credential, passport or licence to drive a car.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are firstly about digitizing those things in a reliable, high-quality way, so they can be used in automated digital processes. Instead of taking scans or copying down numbers, a verifiable credential captures metadata that make the credential valid and authoritative.</p>
<p>Who issued the credential? When was it issued? What were the issuance rules, and the terms and conditions for use? What is the context in which the credential is meaningful?</p>
<p>Take an accountant for instance: what is their scope of practice? Where were they qualified? Where are they licensed to work?</p>
<p>It’s fairly straightforward to wrap up all of that detail into a digital document, formatted to be machine readable. The metadata enables business logic to work out if a credential is fit for purpose in a given application.</p>
 B. Provenance 
<p>The next layer of protection proves where the credential came from — because the meaning and authority of most credentials come from the issuer.</p>
<p>A verifiable credential is digitally signed by the issuer, so you know exactly where it came from and also that is hasn’t been tampered with or counterfeited.</p>
 C. Proof of possession (control) 
<p>The final layer of protection for a full function verifiable credential comes from carrying it in a particular sort of end-user wallet.</p>
<p>It is generally important when accepting a credential (especially online, where the presenting party is remote from the accepting party) to be sure that the credential was in the right hands at the time. A verifiable credential wallet will digitally sign the presentation to provide what’s often called “proof of possession”.</p>
<p>Mobile credential wallets are typically locked by a biometric or PIN. If a credential is presented with a verifiable wallet signature, then we can be reasonably sure that the wallet was unlocked by the proper person — namely the holder of the credential.</p>
 Everyday digital credentials 
<p>This might all sound theoretical, but we’ve been using this technology for 10 or 15 years in chip cards, and we’ve been using it for the last three years in mobile phone wallets. The UX is completely seamless.</p>
<p>Under the covers, when you click-to-pay using your smart phone, the mobile payment app reaches inside the secure element (or “enclave” chip) of your phone, accesses cardholder data and an associated private key— which has been previously loaded on the phone with your consent and with the consent of the bank —digitally signs the payment on your behalf, and sends it off to the merchant.</p>
<p>The merchant receives a cryptographically secure parcel of transaction data and metadata. The parcel includes the credit card number signed by the bank, plus another signature to prove the transaction come from an approved smart phone.</p>
<p>Therefore, many consumers are already using the perfect technology for personal data protection: mobile wallets and digital credentials. These tools are ready to be scaled out to make consumers and businesses safe against identity fraud in the wake of data breaches. No new digital IDs are required; we could carry digitized versions of all those existing government IDs such that they are completely useless to data thieves. </p>
 Further reading: Proofs and evidence 
<p>Readers may have spotted that there are other assumptions at work in my account of verifiable credential issuance and presentation.</p>
<p>For one, it is assumed that a virtual credit card was provisioned to the correct phone and that the phone has remained in the proper person’s control. Provisioning a virtual cards — as anyone who has done it will know — is itself a multilayered process, controlled by the bank, usually through its banking app, with tight authentication. It’s critical that the bank gets this right.</p>
<p>And “proof” of possession is a relative concept.&nbsp; Strictly speaking, it’s a matter of evidence.</p>
<p>The assumption about who is really in control at the time of a mobile phone payment is the same sort of assumption made when anyone uses a regular PIN-controlled card at an ATM or POS terminal. Does a PIN really prove who was using the card? Well, no it doesn’t, but there are sufficient controls around this pattern of behaviours for the global banking industry to be satisfied that billions of dollars of card transactions every day are secure enough.</p>
 Further reading: The criticality of data signing 
<p>It is useful to describe the digital signature as a type of metadata.</p>
<p>A digital signature is a data value computed by applying a unique private key to a record, document or transaction. The digital signature is data pertaining to the signed data; it is about that signed data, so it is metadata.</p>
<p>The purpose of a digital signature is to convey important properties of the signed data, such as the involvement or consent of the signatory in making a transaction, the originality of the signed data, and/or the association of the data with the wallet device. A digital signature thus provides proof of certain facts.</p>
<p>So the pattern of facts and proofs — which is common in digital identity discourse — is a matter of data and metadata.</p>
<p>Recall that data signing is at the core of smart phone pay. To pay by credit card, all a cardholder need do is present a credit card number in a way that assures the payment system that it was really the legitimate customer in control of the presentation.</p>
<p>Swiping a magnetic stripe card in a terminal no longer provides much assurance that the true cardholder was in control, thanks to skimming and carding. And so the payment system upgraded to chip cards.</p>
<p>Now smart phone pay uses the chip card’s data signing trick to assure e-commerce merchants that it is not a dog using the card over the internet, but much more likely to be the true holder of the phone and the credit card.</p>
<p>This is exactly the same pattern that we need for presenting any important data, especially the official government issued data universally used in identification.</p>
<p>If we used mobile wallets to present verified data to registration forms and login screens, then we would not be vulnerable to impersonation after data breaches.</p>

<p>I was delighted to speak with&nbsp;the eclectic and thoughtful <a href="https://katecarruthers.com">Kate Carruthers</a> recently on her <a href="https://datarevolution.tech/2023/09/20/steve-wilson/">Data Revolution podcast</a>.</p>
<p>With Kate’s permission, I’ve extracted a few blog posts from her podcast transcript, to provide my take on data protection and data sharing, identity and identification, verifiable credentials, and a vision for making them mainstream to safeguard consumers and businesses online.</p>
<p>Our conversation started with data sharing and the future of data protection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve spent the past several years thinking a lot about how we should systemically safeguard data at nation-scale, commensurate with its value as an economic and community asset. See for example <a href="https://aips.net.au/aq-magazine/current-edition/93-3-wilson.">How to Create an Infostructure </a>July 2022 published by the Australian Institute of Policy and Science.</p>
<p>My highly esteemed long-term collaborator <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgepeabody/">George Peabody</a> joined Lockstep in 2022 so we could better focus our efforts together.</p>
<p>Operationalising data protection is now Lockstep’s major focus.</p>
<p>Data protection in the rest of the world is synonymous with data privacy. The GDPR of course has “data protection” in its name. Data privacy and data protection are synonymous in many places and in a lot of the literature. Australia’s Privacy Act 1986 is based on principles nearly identical to those of the GDPR (and 140+ data protection laws around the world).</p>
<p>Lockstep seems to be a rarity amongst technology firms, for we advocate for conventional data protection law. We have seen how powerful it is, and how technocrats underestimate its power https://lockstep.com.au/the-regulatory-superpower-of-technology-neutrality/. Yet in my mind, today’s law is still only a prototype of the data jurisprudence we will need to protect data as a critical economic and community asset.</p>
<p>As I discussed with Kate, Current data privacy protection is based on technology neutral principles which call for limiting the collection, use and disclosure of personal data. Not banning collection, use and disclosure, but restraining these activities to what we really need to know for the task at hand.</p>
<p>There’s a default attitude that because data is valuable, we should keep it close (metaphorically, legally and geographically). But that’s not a very artful way of managing the value of data.</p>
<p>We actually want to share data, not only as businesses, governments and researchers, but as individuals. We individuals absolutely need to share data. Simply, we need to tell people things about ourselves.</p>
<p>Sadly, data sharing has got a bad rap. Commercial data brokers have operated in a ‘grey market’, exploiting regulatory loopholes (and blackholes). When they operate poorly, they have been breached, exposing spectacular personal details. But even when operating ‘well’, data brokers have made data sharing synonymous with surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we cannot live under a rock online. We need new generation systems to enable data sharing in different contexts, with safety, restraint, and transparent regulations.</p>
<p>When data protection is taken to mean privacy, then it is all about restraint. Data protection can evolve from this precautionary position towards a more progressive treatment of the value of data.</p>
<p>If data is an asset or resource, then we should gauge the properties that makes that asset valuable, in different contexts, and safeguard those properties to maximise the value of data.</p>
<p>Kate and I then ventured onto how verifiable credentials have a bigger purpose than identity.</p>

<p>Today’s workforce has evolved dramatically over the past few years. Moving from corporate office spaces to being fully remote, and now adjusting to a hybrid model, users are highly distributed and require access to meet the flexibility of each day’s workspace. While this flexibility is undoubtedly a benefit to employee satisfaction, it places added pressure on enterprises to ensure ease of access to the resources and applications needed for daily work while continuing to provide a level of security required of modern identity and browser tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, with application access through a browser becoming the standard for most enterprises, it is imperative for identity and access management solutions to integrate easily with browsers to provide deeper security and ensure only the right users have the right access to the tools they need. With this new paradigm of working from anywhere, it is crucial for enterprises to ensure they trust the user, the browser, and the device.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce that Anonyome Labs continues to innovate at the forefront of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity</a> technology by releasing the Sudo Platform Decentralized Identity Mobile Edge Agent SDK. This SDK unites industry-standard decentralized identity protocols with&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>’s&nbsp;modularity, reliability, and security. This article gives the details, but in summary:</p>



 
 Sudo Platform<a> </a>Edge Agent SDK implements a variety of Hyperledger Aries RFCs to support end-to-end encrypted connections, receiving and storing credentials securely, and verifiably presenting credentials. 



 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK is interoperable with other Hyperledger Aries agents in the ecosystem, such as <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Aries Cloud Agent Python</a> (ACA-py) and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">Aries Framework JavaScript</a> (AFJ) agents. 



 An implementation of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md">Aries RFC 0050: Wallets</a> is used to ensure that all sensitive data, such as verifiable credentials and cryptographic keys, is securely stored on the device. 



 The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK is available natively for iOS and Android. 



 Anonyome’s Edge Agent SDK sits alongside our other&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">DI offerings</a>, such as the <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Sudo Platform Cloud Agent Service</a> and the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo Platform Decentralized Identity Relay</a>. 



 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK has a rich roadmap ahead, including support for W3C verifiable credentials and support for more Hyperledger Aries RFCs. 
 



<p>Let’s dive into the technical details of the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK.</p>



 It supports a suite of Hyperledger Aries RFCs 



<p>The primary purpose of the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK is to implement Aries RFCs that allow us to receive and present verifiable credentials in an interoperable fashion. To accomplish this, we’ve configured our Edge Agent to implement and use the following Aries RFCs (from <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md">Aries Interop Protocol (AIP)</a> 1.0):</p>



 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0160-connection-protocol">Connection Protocol (RFC 0160)</a> for establishing peer-to-peer encrypted connections with other agents 



 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0036-issue-credential">Issue Credential Protocol (RFC 0036)</a> for negotiating and receiving verifiable credentials (Anoncreds) from Aries issuers 



 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0037-present-proof">Present Proof Protocol (RFC 0037)</a> for presenting verifiable credentials to Aries verifiers 



 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0050-wallets">Wallets (RFC 0050)</a> for securely storing and managing sensitive data (keys, credentials, protocol metadata) 



 A range of many more supplementary Aries RFCs to enable the secure communication channel (DIDComm). 
 



<p>To implement most of these Aries RFCs, we have leveraged and contributed to the open-source Hyperledger community wherever possible; most significantly, this has involved <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">Aries-VCX</a>.</p>



<p>Aries-VCX, as self-described on GitHub, is “a Rust library for building web and mobile applications issuing, holding, presenting and verifying Verifiable Credentials in accordance to the standards set by Hyperledger Aries.” Aries-VCX is populated with “state machines” which our Edge Agent SDK leverages to step through protocols.</p>



<p>As a relatively early adopter of Aries-VCX, Anonyome has contributed work back to the project, most notably including a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/648">large refactor</a> to make the project compatible with technology other than the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk">Indy-SDK</a>. This change was important to Anonyome and the community as a whole because it enables compatibility with other actively maintained Hyperledger projects, such as <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-askar">Aries Askar</a> (wallet), <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr">Indy VDR</a> (ledger), and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-rs">Anoncreds-rs</a>. </p>



<p>With the improvements made to Aries-VCX, Anonyome has been able to leverage Aries-VCX with a range of other open-source projects. Our stack of technologies can be seen in Figure 1.</p>



Figure 1: Sudo Edge Agent Core interactions with open-source projects



<p>As you can see in Figure 1, we use Aries-VCX to drive the protocols themselves, while we manage all the data and processing around it. You can also see that Aries-VCX’s “modularity” is what allows us to plug in our own “profile” of components built from other open-source projects.</p>



 It is interoperable with other agents 



<p>One of the core concepts of decentralized identity is having an ecosystem of different but interoperable agents. As such, it’s vital that our Edge Agent can communicate and engage in protocols with other Aries Agents in the decentralized identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Interoperability is one reason we choose to leverage Aries-VCX, because the VCX team actively monitors and maintains their interop with our Aries projects. Notably, Aries-VCX participates in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH)</a> initiative. AATH is a project that frequently runs tests that report interop results between Aries implementation, including ACA-py, AFJ, and more. Edge Agent SDK is therefore as interoperable as Aries-VCX is in the protocols that we support.</p>



<p>Additionally, we maintain a strong test suite internally between our Edge Agent and our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Cloud Agent Service</a>, which ensures our agents maintain interoperability.</p>



 It is available for iOS and Android natively 



<p>Like our other Sudo Platform SDKs, the Edge Agent SDK is packaged together as native iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) packages. However, unlike most of our other offerings, the Edge Agent SDK implements its core functionality written in the Rust language, which we then compile and bundle into our traditional native Swift and Kotlin SDK interfaces.</p>



<p>We did this for a few major reasons:</p>



 
 Our stack of open-source technologies (Aries-VCX, Aries Askar, Indy VDR, Anoncreds-rs) are all implemented in Rust, so it naturally made sense that our consumption of all these technologies was also in Rust. 



 It allows us to ensure that stored data and functionality between our iOS and Android SDK variants are at parity since the core logic is all in one place and then cross-compiled. 



 It allows us to compile the core and package it as native SDKs (Kotlin and Swift) as opposed to other non-native mobile solutions such as JavaScript SDKs, all while having the great performance that comes with Rust implementations. 
 



<p>To accomplish native consumption of Rust code, we’ve created infrastructure to cross-compile the Edge Agent core for Android and iOS architectures, and then generate clean Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI) wrapper code in Kotlin and Swift using Mozilla’s <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/">UniFFI</a> tool.</p>



Figure 2: Creating native mobile SDKs around a Rust implementation



<p>We then abstract over the UniFFI-generated wrappers with our neatly packaged SDK and implement any extra functionality that could only be accomplished natively in Kotlin or Swift. This final layer allows us to package together an SDK that has a friendly and clean interface for applications that consume our SDK.</p>



 It is used alongside our other DI SDK offerings 



<p>An important piece of the Edge Agent SDK is receiving messages from other DI agents. The Edge Agent SDK supports the ability to plugin whatever Message Source the SDK consumer wishes to use: for instance, an Aries Mediator message source or an Aries Relay message source. However, out of the box, we provide a message source that integrates seamlessly with our <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo DI Relay SDK</a>. This means that your applications can get started immediately by using the Edge Agent SDK configured to use our Relay SDK to receive incoming messages.</p>



<p>Additionally, our Edge Agent SDK has been tested extensively with our Cloud Agent Service to ensure interoperability between the agents we provide.</p>



 There is a rich roadmap ahead 



<p>Although the SDK is now released in a stable state, the SDK is designed to allow Anonyome to continuously add support for more protocols and more features, allowing your application to stay up to date with the latest and greatest in the DI ecosystem with every new release of our SDK.</p>



<p>In the next phase of the SDK, we’ll add support for the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md">AIP 2.0</a> Issue and Presentation protocols:</p>



 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2">Issue Credential Protocol v2 (RFC 0453)</a> for negotiating and receiving verifiable credentials (Anoncreds) from Aries issuers 



 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0454-present-proof-v2">Present Proof Protocol v2 (RFC 0454)</a> for presenting verifiable credentials (Anoncreds) to Aries verifiers. 
 



<p>As part of this project, we’ll contribute any updates we make to the Aries-VCX code base.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, we’ll add <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C credential support</a> to the Edge Agent SDK (specifically, support for W3C JSON-LD credentials).</p>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, it’s crucial to stay up to date with the latest innovations and technologies designed to enhance online security. One such innovation that has gained significant traction in recent times is the concept of “passkeys.” In this blog post, we’ll explore what passkeys are, their significance in modern authentication, and how they are being utilized in various domains.</p>
<p>Defining Passkeys</p>
<p>Passkeys are a cutting-edge form of authentication that falls under the broader category of FIDO (Fast Identity Online) authentication methods. While the term “passkey” may sound new, it essentially refers to any FIDO passwordless credential. These credentials are designed to offer enhanced security and convenience when accessing online services and accounts.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
 
 Passkeys are a type of FIDO authentication method. 
 They are part of the broader movement towards passwordless authentication. 
 Passkeys aim to provide stronger security and a more convenient user experience. 
 
<p>The Evolution of Passkeys</p>
<p>The concept of passkeys has evolved over the years, transitioning from strong two-factor authentication (2FA) to a completely passwordless experience. Initially, FIDO keys were designed to provide non-copyable and phishing-resistant authentication. However, as technology advanced, the focus shifted towards eliminating the need for traditional usernames and passwords altogether.</p>
<p>Today, passkeys offer users a multi-factor authentication experience with the simplicity of a single touch. This transformation has made passkeys accessible to a wide range of users, from consumers using online shopping sites like Home Depot or Kayak to enterprise users looking to enhance security.</p>

<p>This challenge asked participants to gather their own data on their favorite DeFi protocol. From there, participants were asked to conduct exploratory data analysis, explore recommendations to the protocol, and dive into key metrics and user retention rates that correlate and precede the success of a given protocol.</p><p>In short, data scientists who competed in this challenge were asked&nbsp;to:</p>  1. Create a dataset to conduct analysis.  2. Explain the methodology for dataset creation.  3. Analyze key customer metrics for all cohorts over&nbsp;time.  4. Build a report containing recommendations to the protocol to drive improvement in key business&nbsp;metrics.  <p>The winners are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>1st Place — Rodolfo&nbsp;Lima</p><p>Rodolfo is the crown winner of this data challenge and chose to conduct his report on the popular <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap Protocol</a>.</p><p>The report and dataset can be retrieved for full analysis via the Ocean Market in the link below: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:e58a57f2dc33fcc361079fe12d463dfd2e6cf7bea1d07a3d80fc5c9aa43b5f8d">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:e58a57f2dc33fcc361079fe12d463dfd2e6cf7bea1d07a3d80fc5c9aa43b5f8d</a></p><p>The image above shows the retention trader of traders using Uniswap decentralized exchange. This chart follows the rise and decline of daily and monthly active traders on Ethereum Mainnet and correlates with the decline in market activity in the previous 12–18&nbsp;months.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Rodolfo was able to highlight that volume and revenue accrued in the protocol have stayed lean through bearish trends. The image above details correlations between volume and revenue in the last 2 years (2021–2023).</p><p>A winning highlight in this report showed that a drop in average transaction value around June 2021 coincides with a significant drop in gas prices in parallel timeline. This indicates that when gas prices are lower, more users engage in transactions, even if they’re of a smaller value. When gas prices are high, only transactions that are of sufficiently high value (to justify the gas cost) are seen executed. Adversely, when gas prices are lower, a broader range of transaction values is recognized, including smaller&nbsp;ones.</p><p>There were 4 clusters of users that this report broke down to understand the behavior and tendencies of different users. The group clusters discovered are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Cluster 0:    Swap Count: Low (around 26 swaps on&nbsp;average)  Volume in USD: Low (around $698,744 on&nbsp;average)  Revenue in USD: Low (around $106,664 on&nbsp;average)  Average Transaction Value: Low (around $15,980 on&nbsp;average)  Average Gas Price: Moderate (around 62 on&nbsp;average)  <p>2. Cluster&nbsp;1:</p>  Swap Count: Very Low (around 1 swap on&nbsp;average)  Volume in USD: Very Low (around $55,182 on&nbsp;average)  Revenue in USD: Very Low (around $12,656 on&nbsp;average)  Average Transaction Value: Moderate (around $27,547 on&nbsp;average)  Average Gas Price: Extremely High (around 5,378 on&nbsp;average)  <p>3. Cluster&nbsp;2:</p>  Swap Count: Extremely High (around 54,127 swaps on&nbsp;average)  Volume in USD: Extremely High (around $4.43 billion on&nbsp;average)  Revenue in USD: Extremely High (around $558 million on&nbsp;average)  Average Transaction Value: High (around $167,220 on&nbsp;average)  Average Gas Price: Moderate (around 106 on&nbsp;average)  <p>4. Cluster&nbsp;3:</p>  Swap Count: Low (around 10 swaps on&nbsp;average)  Volume in USD: Moderate (around $60.25 million on&nbsp;average)  Revenue in USD: High (around $2.74 million on&nbsp;average)  Average Transaction Value: Extremely High (around $7.69 million on&nbsp;average)  Average Gas Price: Moderate (around 55 on&nbsp;average)  <p>Recommendations Rodolfo gave to the protocol in the report we found to be efficient, thoughtful, and valuable. The report suggested a focus on the initial experience for new users and a simplified onboarding process. Optimized gas prices and offered alternatives like layer 2 integrations at the execution layer we thought would benefit any user of the protocol. Finally, a recommendation to not only understand where their users come from demographically, but to educate them on macroeconomic factors in markets, interest rates, reduced liquidity, slippage, and cycles was interpreted as a ripe suggestion to break down web3’s isolation from real-world economic dynamics.</p><p>2nd place — Saul&nbsp;Martin</p><p>Saul’s research and report can be found for reference inside the Ocean Market under these relevant&nbsp;links:</p><p>Flash loan statistics: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:3997ba8b074842a20d4813ab8c17f61562b4a243d3ced4f0b548beac27ea74a5">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:3997ba8b074842a20d4813ab8c17f61562b4a243d3ced4f0b548beac27ea74a5</a></p><p>User summary dataset: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:1a0c57514f0089206b920924e5000071dda3341e9162f54f189df9890aa7a163">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:1a0c57514f0089206b920924e5000071dda3341e9162f54f189df9890aa7a163</a></p><p>Full aggregated data: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:f26948338b24cb17f9b71b1f09fa0a1f1763716658a9c3625bf3dcd55d0f93c7">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:f26948338b24cb17f9b71b1f09fa0a1f1763716658a9c3625bf3dcd55d0f93c7</a></p><p>Saul struck gold in a deep dive report into <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, an Ethereum-based borrowing and lending protocol. Saul created a user data description cohort analysis that included a data frame of over 11,000 entries across 18 different user-specific tendencies and data points. The report later broke down 3 primary ways Aave has accrued revenue and stays afloat. 1) interest paid by borrowers 2) interest paid by flash loans and 3) liquidation fees.</p><p>The image above illustrates the comparative analysis of Total Value Locked (TVL) and borrowed amounts between AAVE v2 and the newly launched AAVE v3. AAVE v3 was introduced in March 2023 on&nbsp;Polygon.</p><p>Saul discovered an increase in the average size of flash loan amounts since the release of Aave v3 and determined that this is likely because of a decrease in premium fees per flash loan following the&nbsp;update.</p><p>The data, sourced by the Ethereum block explorer <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a>, showed a steady decrease in users of the protocol retained over time. The data showed a 13% retention rate in new users after 2 months, and a 2.98% retention rate after 6 months. Liquidation rates are a leading indicator of users not returning to the platform. The report detailed that of the users who experienced a liquidation event, 60.8% did not engage in borrowing again.</p><p>Saul pinpointed 4 different problems in the protocol and recommendations for each, the results are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>1. Strategically Review Flash Loan Fee Structures:</p><p>Problem: The introduction of AAVE v3 has indeed shifted user behavior towards its lower fees, but the discrepancy in fee structures between v2 and v3 is affecting revenue generation.</p><p>Recommendation: Considering a more unified and strategic fee model between versions may provide a balance between encouraging user engagement and maintaining revenue. Analyzing the specific needs and trends of 264 unique initiators and targets of flash loans could guide this adjustment.</p><p>2. Optimize Revenue Streams from Liquidations and Traditional Borrowing:</p><p>Problem: While flash loans contribute to revenue, the core remains traditional borrowing and liquidation fees. AAVE should consider fine-tuning its traditional borrowing rates to attract more users while maintaining profitability. Furthermore, since liquidations contribute to revenue but deter user engagement, an optimized liquidation process that minimizes user churn might be beneficial. This could involve implementing more user-friendly liquidation notifications, giving borrowers more time or options to rectify their positions before liquidation, or offering post-liquidation support and incentives to retain&nbsp;users.</p><p>Recommendation: Fine-tune borrowing rates and implement a user-friendly liquidation process to retain users. Increasing traditional borrowing and minimizing user churn from liquidations could lead to more stable revenue&nbsp;streams.</p><p>3. Strategize Borrowing and Lending Opportunities:</p><p>Problem: A significant portion of users (48%) are only engaging in depositing or withdrawing, with minimal borrowing activities, and there’s a notable difference in LTV ratios between stable and non-stable coins.</p><p>Recommendation: Develop tailored borrowing and lending products for various risk profiles, incentivizing both risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviors. For instance, provide different interest rate structures or rewards to promote borrowing of stable coins or create specialized products for high-risk traders. By encouraging more borrowing and lending activities, AAVE can increase its revenue from interest and transaction fees.</p><p>4. Enhance User Education and Risk Awareness:</p><p>Problem: Given that 60% of users facing liquidation do not engage in further borrowing, AAVE should invest in robust user education and risk awareness campaigns.</p><p>Recommendation: Tailored materials can guide users in understanding the potential risks associated with different assets and LTV ratios. Special attention should be given to educating the 12.2% of users trading in volatile assets at high LTVs, as they seem most vulnerable to liquidation.</p><p>3rd place — Narin&nbsp;Kunaseth</p><p>Narin’s full report and dataset can be retrieved for full analysis via the Ocean Market in the links&nbsp;below:</p><p>Uniswap User Dataset: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:1d6b257ff29ec592f2efc1b1d3f151179c087e4a6f00ff59fdf66d4a0f375463">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:1d6b257ff29ec592f2efc1b1d3f151179c087e4a6f00ff59fdf66d4a0f375463</a></p><p>Full research report: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:d61bb4a037da88d3239327d0a4df3c826f2a750c0242c0c5f148c4295fe2aaf5">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:d61bb4a037da88d3239327d0a4df3c826f2a750c0242c0c5f148c4295fe2aaf5</a></p><p>Narin chose the Unicorn of DeFi to compose the report, <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>. Narin was awarded 2nd place for comprehensive research and insights on the ERC-20 swapping protocol from May 2020 to August 2023. This report gathered raw data about the Uniswap protocol from <a href="https://www.flipsidecrypto.com">Flipside</a>, which gave Uniswap v2 and v3 transaction data using blockchain explorers and APIs to retrieve&nbsp;it.</p><p>The image above details revenue made by the protocol since its inception. Each cohort of users (separated by their first transaction month). The revenue has been calculated using 0.3% of the total volume of swaps. As can be seen, the August 2020 cohort of users has generated nearly $800 million in revenue for Uniswap, which is significantly higher than other&nbsp;cohorts.</p><p>The review committee of data challenges through Ocean Protocol found this interesting to compare against statistics of active Ethereum wallets, daily/weekly/monthly transactions and specifically looking for indicators of successful protocols.</p><p>The next graph seen above shows a heat map of user retention by Uniswap over a 40-month period (May 2020 — August 2023). The takeaway from this report shows that Generally, new users tend to engage actively with the protocol during their initial months of participation, followed by a gradual decline in activity as time progresses. An exception to this trend is seen within the first six months, during which users sustain their interaction for nearly a year before experiencing a decrease.</p><p>Narin’s report displayed great quantitative work and data transformation to diagnose where and when shortcomings of the protocol took place. Most dates and declines shown in the graphics above fall on mutual timelines of industry-wide catastrophe events causing mass fear, uncertainty, and doubt in 2022 (FTX collapse, Terra LUNA, proceeding drama).</p><p>Finally, the report gave 3 recommendations for the protocol for a more sustainable and data-driven future:</p>  Simplify the onboarding process for new&nbsp;users.  Create a campaign or community event tailored to the demands of older users of 2020–2021 to encourage continued use of the protocol.  Divide users based on their total transaction volume to encourage loyalty and recurring customers.   Conclusion <p>Amidst a crypto winter, this challenge received a great turnout of participants interested in the subject matter of user behavior in DeFi protocols. This gave our core team a data-driven understanding of identifying best practices and leading metrics to determine the most quality and sustainable protocol practices in&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>Are you a DeFi protocol that is looking to leverage a community of data scientists to offer intelligence and analytics to your protocol?

<p>In July, we kicked off our sponsorship in the Encode Future of Blockchain University Hackathon, a 4-week online hackathon dedicated to supporting innovative projects led by students.<br><br>This challenge invited students from all over the globe to build apps integrating decentralized identity, with the purpose of giving their app users greater control over their digital identities and personal data using SpruceKit. Students integrated SpruceKit into their apps to power applications to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information, and interact with user data vaults.</p> Teamwork &amp; Creativity <p>It has been inspiring to see all university student participants create incredible apps and lend a helping hand to one another in the Encode Discord channel. We are amazed by the collaboration among individuals and teams and the creativity of your app submissions.</p><p>We also loved having the opportunity to connect with participants in a virtual workshop where SpruceID Senior Software Engineer, Sam Gbafa got to walk students through how to use open-source software to power your app with decentralized identity. Here, he broke down important concepts in the decentralized identity and the components that make up SpruceKit.</p><p>Thank you to all who participated! Join us in congratulating all of the Encode Future of Blockchain University Hackathon participants for their hard work.</p> Drum Roll, Please! <p>The winners of Encode Future of Blockchain University Hackathon represent the best across multiple categories. Please join us in congratulating our winners for the following bounties:</p> 🏆 Bounty #1: Let users bring their own identity and data to your app <p>The first bounty was focused on letting users bring their own identity and data to their app. Hackathon participants tied together SpruceKit libraries and used the SpruceKit Credential Faucet to let app users prove who they are in their application. The following participants did a great job of pulling in credentials in a meaningful way, such as using them to enhance profile information or use them as part of a core workflow. Our first bounty winners are…</p><p>Most innovative app use case: EcoMatch</p><p>EcoMatch is an app that matches people with volunteer opportunities. It allows its users to find climate organizations that match their preferences while also giving them full control over their data and how it’s stored. The app has two panels, the questions panel which asks you a series of questions about your preferences for which climate organizations you'd like to volunteer at, and the recommendations panel which shows a list of climate organizations that match your preferences. The app uses SpruceKit’s Kepler to store your preferences and recommendations.</p><p>We loved how this team combined giving back to the community with SpruceKit capabilities. See a demo of their app below!</p>     0:00 / 1×   <p></p><p>Best technical implementation of the libraries: BuildIt</p><p>BuildIt is a Metaverse project that provides app users with the ability to own virtual land within a map, place items on the land they own, and sell the land to other users. The land is represented as ERC721 tokens, while the items are represented as ERC1155 tokens and all interactions within the metaverse are secured by smart contracts.</p><p>We thought this app showcased a great example use case of combining on and off-chain technologies to tie a game to a cryptographic identity.</p><p></p><p>Implementation with the best user experience: LoveChain</p><p>The LoveChain app redefines online dating leveraging decentralized technologies and SpruceKit. LoveChain offers its users a comprehensive dating journey that prioritizes privacy, security, and authenticity. The platform also hosts an NFT marketplace for creativity. With LoveChain, users enjoy enhanced control over their data and interactions, propelled by innovative blockchain solutions, and the app integrates ENS to ensure verified profiles, fostering trust.</p><p>LoveChain had an excellent, engaging user interface that would be easy to navigate for any potential new user!</p><p></p> 🏆 Bounty #2: Allow users to log in without a username/password by authenticating with their Ethereum accounts<br> <p>In our second bounty, we looked for hackathon participants to incorporate SpruceKit libraries to enable their app users to Sign in with Ethereum and use our SSX library to resolve ENS names. Sign-in with Ethereum is a decentralized authentication mechanism that lets you log into websites or applications using your Ethereum wallet address to store and access your data. It eliminates the need for usernames and passwords, using your Ethereum address as a unique identifier — adding security and transparency to the authentication process.</p><p>The following apps rose to the challenge and were awarded part of our pool prize!</p><p>EcoMatch: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19pbrH00Oj_bm8l5KJOkYiiw6D65a8mOo/view?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">video demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Ashwagandhae/ecomatch?ref=blog.spruceid.com">github repo</a></p><p>Recommend Me: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/6a8a73e0c1cb433a8809f50073d909a3?sid=21032b33-3dc3-4b76-bdad-b933735115df&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">video demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/itsjenm/University-Encode-Hackathon-2023?ref=blog.spruceid.com">github repo</a></p><p>DACA: <a href="https://youtu.be/XQkrH519ubc?ref=blog.spruceid.com">video demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/JaayTeeee/DACA?ref=blog.spruceid.com">github repo</a></p><p>LoveChain: <a href="https://youtu.be/UhWTS94_AkI?ref=blog.spruceid.com">video demo</a> | <a href="https://lovechain.vercel.app/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">hosted demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/sambitsargam/LoveChain?ref=blog.spruceid.com">github repo</a></p><p>BuildIt: <a href="https://youtu.be/vISeksf-FkQ?ref=blog.spruceid.com">video demo</a> | <a href="https://build-it-metaverse.vercel.app/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">hosted demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Ahmed-Aghadi/BuildIt?ref=blog.spruceid.com">github repo</a></p><p>Journify: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xvm3mMBY6pxwyQ394QkROPWMK2IYtNts/view?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">video demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/codyy6/Encode-Hackathon-Website?ref=blog.spruceid.com">github repo</a></p><p>Vent: <a href="https://youtu.be/IQdW3zeSDJE?si=CqKA1gy1cXX1iP8v&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">video demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/LokeshKumar-Dev/Vent?ref=blog.spruceid.com">github repo</a></p><p>Lexar: <a href="https://youtu.be/NxjGSv34ubM?si=toJYDAPTfCBFpqs2&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">video demo</a> | <a href="https://lexar-frontend-nine.vercel.app/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">hosted demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/0xTemplar/Lexar?ref=blog.spruceid.com">github repo</a></p> Join the SpruceID developer community! <p>Thank you to everyone who participated in the hackathon, and congratulations to the above participants for winning prizes! </p><p>Although the hackathon may have ended last week, there are still many ways that you can get involved in building apps.

<p>There’s a note thanking “the shampoo manufacturers” right at the top of the acknowledgements section of the RFC-to-be 9470 draft. Originally it was merely a placeholder and lighthearted joke that I fully expected would be removed before final publication. But as the document moved into the last editorial phase of the publication process, I was preparing myself for a fight with the editors to keep it in. It had become more than a joke to me - it was now an homage to my friend and co-author of the document. The fight never materialized. But anticipating it gave me a place to channel my sadness and anger.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The rename of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to Microsoft Entra ID is now rolling across content and product experiences from Microsoft, as per the implementation timeline outlined in the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/azure-ad-is-becoming-microsoft-entra-id/ba-p/2520436">Azure AD rename announcement on July 11th</a>. We expect the majority of text updates to be completed by mid-November of this year, and updates for on-premises software to be completed in 2024. Partners, analysts, and influencers have also started using the Microsoft Entra ID name in place of Azure AD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the new product name and the icon appearing in Microsoft Azure, Azure Marketplace, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Security admin centers, you’ll also see the service plan (SKU) display names update to Microsoft Entra ID Free, Microsoft Entra ID P1, and Microsoft Entra ID P2 on October 1, 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As previously announced, this is just a new name, with no impact on deployments or daily work, and no changes to capabilities, licensing, terms of service, or support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the feedback that we’ve received from many of you – our customers and partners throughout this transition. If you are considering an update to your own documentation or experiences to reflect the Microsoft Entra naming, we now have created resources to assist you. I’ll also clarify more details about the rename based on questions from this community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Resources for updating the Azure AD name in your content 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the name change is rolling out widely, your organization may be interested in updating the Azure AD name accurately in documentation or content. We’re now sharing our internal best practices, tools, and tips in the docs article <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-rename-azure-ad">“How to rename Azure AD” on Microsoft Learn</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This "how-to” playbook is designed to help you change the name as needed across your organization’s content. It includes best practices for finding and updating Azure AD text strings and graphic icons. Another important reference is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name">"New name for Azure Active Directory" on Microsoft Learn</a>, which includes a style guide, a comprehensive glossary of updated product and feature naming, the short list of exceptions to the rename, downloads of the new product icons, and a timeline for key milestones for Microsoft implementation of the name change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope it helps you scope and plan your updates in accordance with your own processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s address some questions from the community:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, admins can use the Azure portal to manage Microsoft Entra ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to support the ability to manage Microsoft Entra ID in the Azure portal for customers who prefer Azure portal or only need a subset of Microsoft Entra capabilities, similar to identity experiences available in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The navigation changes in the Azure portal are minimal, and we’ll continue the messages that Microsoft Entra ID is formerly known as Azure AD for an extended time to ensure discoverability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage all customers to explore the comprehensive <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Entra admin center</a> but will maintain the ability to manage relevant identity experiences within the existing portals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, on-premises identities are still supported with Microsoft Entra ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to support and enhance <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/identity-and-access">Windows Server Active Directory</a> for on-premises identity and access management and the connection to Azure and other clouds, as many organizations continue to rely on this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The name for Active Directory remains unchanged. Based on extensive feedback we've received about Microsoft Entra ID as the new name for Azure Active Directory, for many customers, the rename will help to better differentiate between the on-premises (Active Directory) and multicloud identity (Microsoft Entra ID) solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No, identity developer and devops experiences aren't being renamed 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make the transition seamless, all existing login URLs, APIs, PowerShell cmdlets, and Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) stay the same, as do developer experiences and tooling. See details at: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name#whats-changing-for-identity-developer-and-devops-experience">What's changing for identity developer and devops experience? - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many technical components either have low visibility to customers (for example, sign-in URLs), or usually aren't branded, like APIs. For example, here’s how the API for Microsoft Entra Conditional Access (formerly Azure AD Conditional Access) shows up in Microsoft Graph:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "conditions": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessConditionSet"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "createdDateTime": "String (timestamp)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "displayName": "String",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "grantControls": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessGrantControls"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "id": "String (identifier)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "modifiedDateTime": "String (timestamp)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "sessionControls": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessSessionControls"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "state": "string"&nbsp;</p>
<p>}&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccesspolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0">conditionalAccessPolicy resource type - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No, Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets are not being renamed. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we offer two PowerShell modules for administering identity tasks: the Azure AD PowerShell module, which is planned for deprecation in March 2024, and the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Azure AD PowerShell for Graph module, “AzureAD” is in the name of almost all <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azuread/?view=azureadps-2.0">Azure AD cmdlets</a>. These won’t be changing, and you can continue to use these same cmdlets now that the official product name is Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, my colleague Kristopher Bash from the Microsoft Graph team published an <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">update on the Azure AD Graph retirement and Azure AD PowerShell module deprecation</a>. Both are on multi-year retirement cycles to allow for customer migration to Microsoft Graph technologies, and Kristopher’s article clarifies the timing and customer resources, plus our commitment to work with you during the migration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deprecation date for Azure AD PowerShell is planned for March 30, 2024. It will continue to work after that date, but support will be limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to start trying Microsoft Graph PowerShell as the recommended module for interacting with Microsoft Entra ID in the future. Based on your feedback, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/migration-faq?view=azureadps-2.0#what-is-microsoft-doing-about-the-gaps-in-functionality-between-azure-ad-and-microsoft-graph-powershell-modules">we’re continuing to add functionality for managing Microsoft Entra ID with Microsoft Graph PowerShell</a> to ensure a seamless transition when you decide to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/migration-steps?view=graph-powershell-1.0">migrate</a> from Azure AD PowerShell to Microsoft Graph PowerShell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, Microsoft continues to support Azure AD B2C 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As announced previously, the name Azure AD B2C is not changing, nor is our commitment to the service and our customers. The service level agreement for Azure AD B2C remains unchanged, and we’ll continue investments to ensure security, availability, and reliability in both <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview">Azure AD B2C</a>, as well as our next-generation solution for external identities, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/overview-customers-ciam">Microsoft Entra External ID</a>, now in public preview. You can learn more about getting started with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/quickstart-trial-setup">External ID</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview">Azure AD B2C</a> in our documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Focusing on secure access for everyone, everywhere 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renaming of Azure AD represents a shift in how the identity and access management landscape has changed over time. You’ve gone from managing identities behind a firewall to fully enabling a complex fabric of trusted interactions so people can securely collaborate and be productive, while being increasingly under threat from attackers. Traditional identity and access management services aren’t enough anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe the Microsoft Entra ID name more accurately represents the multicloud and multiplatform functionality of the product, alleviates any confusion with the on-premises identity solution Active Directory, and creates a path to deliver a simpler way to protect every identity and secure every access point as we expand the Microsoft Entra identity and network access portfolio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of where the family name of Microsoft Entra helps clarify functionality is Microsoft Entra <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview">Conditional Access</a> (formerly Azure AD Conditional Access). Conditional Access policies can now be consistently enforced and shared across identity and new security service edge (SSE) products:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a>. With <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/concept-universal-conditional-access">controls expanding to network traffic</a> — not just cloud applications — and policies based on traffic profiles — not just applications or actions — this cross-product feature now uses the unified identity and network access name: Microsoft Entra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to innovate and expand our portfolio as digital environments expand, and access points become more diverse, so our customers can protect any access point with a holistic solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, all you need to remember is that the most comprehensive approach for securing access is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">Microsoft Entra</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Ongoing commitment to our Microsoft Entra ID customers 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We serve over 720,000 organizations of various sizes globally and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id">continue to be recognized as a Leader by industry analysts</a>. New functionality and feature improvements help our customers become more secure, more effective, and more resilient, and that hasn’t stopped with the rename. Each quarter we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-new-feature-and-change-announcements/ba-p/3796396">blog about new feature releases and updates</a>; here are some recent highlights:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/conditional-access-for-protected-actions-is-now-generally/ba-p/3888723">Conditional Access for protected actions</a> is in general availability.

<p>The 15 largest data breaches of the century&nbsp;exposed the records of <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html">3.5 billion</a>&nbsp;people and, while data breaches can come from human error, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/">Verizon</a> reveals <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/">87 per cent</a> of data breaches in 2022 were perpetrated by external actors, mostly for financial gain (e.g. credential theft).</p>



<p>The result is that while consumers generally get that they have to trade certain&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for services, they are now warier of sharing their personal information online.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>But criminal data breaches are just one risk to consumers’ online privacy and safety. Ad tech, data brokers and the relentless <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a> are another major one. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">Pew Research</a> says 72 per cent of Americans feel that all, almost all, or most of what they do online or while using their cellphone is being tracked by advertisers, technology firms or other companies. Eighty-one per cent say they have little or no control over the data companies collect, and 79 per cent are concerned with how that data is used. And they’re right to be concerned.</p>



<p>While we could say these risks are just the price of living in the modern age, <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-privacy-stats">9 out of 10</a>&nbsp;Americans consider their online privacy to be an important issue and <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-privacy-stats">85 per cent&nbsp;</a>of adults globally want to do more to protect their online privacy.</p>



<p>But while there are technologies and services available that grant consumers precisely the level of control they wish for online, wanting such a tool and actually acquiring and using it are two entirely different things. The more disparate services a consumer must engage with, the lower the chance they will actually use them. What consumers need is a one-stop-shop for online privacy and safety, preferably from someone they already trust for other aspects of their digital protection – that means they want it all, from you!</p>



 Pieces of the puzzle 



<p>Many reputable organizations make recommendations to improve online privacy and safety. For example:</p>



 
 The <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/">Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report</a> recommends using web browser protection. 



 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/09/922262686/your-technology-is-tracking-you-take-these-steps-for-better-online-privacy">NPR</a> recommends turning off ad personalization. 



 <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Social%2520Media%2520Guide_0.pdf">CISA</a> advises consumers to limit what information they post on social media, disclose only the bare minimum of information about themselves (and think seriously about not engaging if too much is being asked), and disable location services. 



 <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/antivirus/53058/12-simple-things-you-can-do-to-be-more-secure-online">PC Magazine</a> lists using a VPN, clearing your cache, and protecting your social media privacy as part of its “12 Simple Things You Can Do to be Secure Online”. 
 



<p>To implement just these recommendations (and there are many more), a consumer could acquire several technologies and services, from different sources, with different interfaces and experiences, and under a variety of financial obligations. Consequently, most people simply choose partial coverage or ignore the problem because it’s too difficult and inconvenient to fully solve.</p>



<p>But what if they could get an affordable, all-in-one solution from someone they already trust: You?</p>



 Here’s what you could offer: 



 
 Private internet browsing for mobile users – including private search engines, controlled browser history, and encrypted bookmarks 



 Safe internet browsing extension for desktops – including blocking and alerting before visiting an unsafe website and on-device encryption of browsing data, bookmarks, and more 



 Ad and tracker blocker – protecting end users from, and removing, unwanted ads and tracking to ensure complete privacy 



 Site reputation service – empowering users to make informed decisions about what they do online (including preventing access to sites that are determined to be too risky) based on the latest AI-driven risk and site reputation data 



 Virtual private network – alleviating tracking, data and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">PII</a> exposure, and other risks through a secure VPN connection with the flexibility for end users to choose their preferred IP address location (globally) …

				  New <a href="https://indicio.tech/government-permits-and-licenses/">Government Permits, Licence and Certifications</a> product makes it easier to issue and verify any government permit, license, or certification.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, September 18, 2023 — Indicio, the world’s leading software development company delivering verifiable data solutions to government agencies and Fortune 500 companies globally, today announced the release of its latest, open-source product, which is designed to support issuing and verifying multiple types of government-issued permits, licenses, and certifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value of using verifiable data for these kinds of documents is that their source and integrity can be verified without either direct integrations between databases or relying on third-party data management. This removes error and the risk of fraud, solves data-privacy compliance, and enables seamless data sharing for efficient interaction across agencies, businesses, and jurisdictions. Credentials can be biometrically-bound to a person’s mobile device and software, preventing their misuse, and they can be programmed to expire or revoked if required.</p>
<p>For example, instead of relying on a third-party service provider or paper-based system to prove compliance with legal regulations for food handling, businesses and the individuals required to hold this type of permit can hold and manage a verifiable digital copy of their certification. They can present this credential, whether to an inspector, business, or to meet another compliance need, with a simple scan of a QR code, generated in an instant. This information cannot be forged, is easily verified, and creates a more privacy-preserving way to present the required information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Government-specific use cases include:</p>
 
 Government-issued permits: Individuals and businesses can now easily prove the validity of their permits to inspectors, partners, their employer or potential employer using a simple mobile verification application.
 
 Food handler’s permit 
 Off Highway Vehicle (OHV) permit 
 Firearm permits 
 Building permits 
 Land use permits 
 State parks hiking permits 
 Burn permits 
 
 
 
 
 Professional licensing: Many businesses and professions require government- issued licenses to ensure proper training and help keep the public safe. Verification of the validity, dates applicable, and status are just a few of the many types of data that can easily be verified for:
 
 Medical professionals 
 Lawyers 
 Accountants 
 Building contractors and other construction-related occupations 
 Barbers and cosmetologists 
 Architects and engineers 
 Real estate brokers and salespersons 
 Private investigators and other security services 
 
 
 
 
 State-issued certifications: Several professions require individuals to prepare to enter the workforce by providing the required information as specified by state regulations. Requirements usually include completing training classes and taking a certification test. Certifications include:
 
 Teachers 
 School administrator or principals 
 Fire and Rescue Academy 
 On-site wastewater professionals 
 Food service 
 Body art 
 Home day care 
 Off-premise alcohol retailer 
 Pools 
 Septic install 
 Tanning 
 Temporary mass gathering 
 Tobacco &amp; e-cigarette 
 
 
 
<p>“The development of verifiable credentials used by governments around the world is the biggest innovation in public sector technology in at least a decade.” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “It will fundamentally simplify how governments engage with business and other organizations and their employees, allowing for the private and easy verification of a myriad of types of licenses and certifications. All that’s needed is a mobile app, and the technology takes care of the rest.”</p>
<p>Indicio is a leading provider of the decentralized identity with the largest collection of product offerings spanning multiple use cases. This technology creates&nbsp; a verification layer for people, organizations, and things on the internet. It facilitates the use of verifiable credentials, a new, global standard established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), decentralized identifiers (DIDs), a new global standard for creating digital identities, public key cryptography (PKI), and distributed ledger technology. Indicio’s products for government use combine the W3C verifiable credential specification with open-source technologies from Hyperledger, and open standards for Open ID for verifiable credentials (OID4VC), machine-readable governance, and DIDComm communication ensuring smooth delivery of the newest and most well-tested features in verifiable credentials and best-in-class interoperability and scalability.</p>

   by Paul Fisher  Type an email address into DeHashed or similar and there is a pretty good chance it will appear as one of millions scraped or exposed on the Internet every single day. That email is an identity. Guess the password attached to this identity (not hard given how weak most passwords are. &nbsp;Password1, anyone?) and a hacker has instant access to everything attached to that identity.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>Type an email address into <a href="https://dehashed.com">DeHashed</a> or similar and there is a pretty good chance it will appear as one of millions scraped or exposed on the Internet every single day. That email is an identity. Guess the password attached to this identity (not hard given how weak most passwords are. &nbsp;Password1, anyone?) and a hacker has instant access to everything attached to that identity. Sometimes they don’t need to guess, the password will be conveniently placed next to the email in a poorly configured database.</p>
<p>In the end that’s what most cybercrime activity is, industrial scale mining of credentials that may or may not be used to launch a full-scale attack on another organization. Just like the recent blitz on MGM’s Las Vegas resorts. The house always wins? Not today pal.</p>
<p>The ubiquity of credential theft is such that we are now blasé about credentials being stored on criminal databases. Look at my results on DeHashed in Figure 1 below; 11 breaches. Am I shocked? No. Am I worried? A bit. Have I stopped using that email and changed loads of passwords? Do you want me to tell you the truth…</p>
<p>What has this got to do with the supply chain?</p>
<p>Well, a lot. Does your company have a supply chain? Probably yes, even the smallest business will have suppliers, even if it is just an Amazon or Costco account. Attacks in the supply chain are now top priority for cybercriminals because they know that employees are as useless as I am at using passwords and protecting them properly. They also know that everything is connected to everything else. What employees do at work mirrors what they do at home (today often the same thing). Myriad accounts are set up with the same username and password over and over. The difference being that business accounts are connected to the business. Now consider this. Everyone is in a supply chain. The effectiveness of your access and identity management processes affects YOUR partners. We are all in this together!</p>
<p>Why should you be worried?</p>
<p>Modern supply chains often rely on a multitude of third-party vendors, each with their own very different cybersecurity practices and vulnerabilities. An attack on one vendor can cascade throughout the entire supply chain and into other supply chains – hence the attacks that hacked an ID provider so the attackers could access the ID provider’s customers. The sharing of sensitive data across the supply chain can lead to data breaches. This includes not only personal information but also intellectual property and trade secrets.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often exploit the human element in supply chains through phishing emails or social engineering attacks, tricking employees into revealing credentials or using them as mules to inject malware.<br><br>But you should mostly be worried because the supply chain is a Pandora’s Box and impossible to secure fully. We cannot univent the internet, digital supply chains make everything work, but remember: every time someone opens a business account on Amazon in your organization, another black hole appears, another set of credentials is waiting to be scraped. And that is happening all the time.</p>
<p>Figure 1 DeHashed. I have hidden my email here to protect my email - the irony!<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Reducing Supply Chain Cybersecurity Risks</p>
<p>While it may be impossible to eliminate all cybersecurity risks in supply chains, companies can take proactive steps to minimize these threats:</p>
 
 Vendor Assessment: Conduct thorough cybersecurity assessments of all third-party vendors and partners. Ensure they adhere to best practice and security standards. 
 Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Limit access to data on a need-to-know basis. 
 Employee Training: Educate employees about the risks of social engineering attacks and phishing emails. Establish a culture of cybersecurity awareness. 
 Patch and Update Systems: Keep all systems and software up to date with the latest security patches. This includes legacy systems that may still be in use. 
 Incident Response Plan: Develop a robust incident response plan that outlines steps to take in the event of a breach. Introduce regular practice drills to ensure readiness. 
 Monitoring and Detection: Implement continuous monitoring and threat detection systems to identify and respond to potential threats in real time. 
 Supply Chain Resilience: Diversify suppliers and have contingency plans in place to mitigate the impact of disruptions caused by cyberattacks 
 
<p>&nbsp;Figure 2 The UK National Cyber Security Centre is a good source of information on supply chain security.<br><br></p>
<p>We are the Supply Chain!</p>
<p>Finally, consider that you too are part of someone else’s supply chain even if it is not immediately obvious, but you sell stuff, right? You are connected?&nbsp; By beefing up your cybersecurity measures and identity management capabilities you can do your part in protecting the global supply chain!</p>

  <p>The internet of things (IoT) — the collective name for internet-connected devices and sensors — represents a new era in technology. This hardware leverages advancements in connectivity, hardware, miniaturization, cloud computing, data processing, integration, and more to offer benefits to consumers and businesses alike.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with consumers' acceptance of IoT technology, and part of that is due to convenient capabilities, such as learning and adapting without direct instruction. For example, smart devices, such as IoT-equipped vacuum cleaners, can map a room and avoid obstacles while cleaning. But convenience is just the beginning. A smart device can call the police if an intruder is detected or alert a doctor when a patient is exhibiting certain symptoms, such as heart arrhythmia.</p>

<p>On the business side, IoT technology can create a variety of tangible benefits, such as cost savings, revenue growth, and improved customer experiences. Companies can use smart fixtures like lights and air conditioning units to conserve energy and reduce costs. They can use IoT sensors to monitor inventory and address supply-chain issues before sales are impacted. And they can use IoT platforms that provide real-time support for customers with simple questions.</p>

 What is IoT security? 

<p>IoT's ability to share data over high-speed internet connections is what makes it so powerful. However, it also makes IoT devices vulnerable to a wide variety of threats. IoT security means protecting any IoT device and the information it contains from intrusion.</p>

<p>IoT security represents a combination of traditional cybersecurity and hardware protection to secure the devices themselves, the data they generate, and the networks and other systems and applications with which the IoT devices communicate.</p>

 IoT security issues 

<p>Businesses often use IoT technology to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and automate complicated workflows. In many organizations, there are more device identities than there are people, with network-connected security cameras, printers, televisions, sensors, lighting, HVAC equipment, appliances, and handheld scanners, to name a few, but many of these devices are invisible to IT admins and unmanaged by firewalls and other enterprise security technologies.</p>

<p>For this reason, and others, IoT technology creates security concerns, including identity theft and fraud.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons for concern. To start with, there isn't a clear set of security standards for developers and manufacturers to build security into their devices — and their security practices can vary widely, leading to inconsistencies in security standards. In addition, 98% of IoT device traffic is unencrypted, putting it at risk of interception through sniffing, spyware, and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>

<p>Any device on a network is a potential entry point, and criminals scan networks for devices with known vulnerabilities and for nonstandard ports to gain access. They can mine IoT devices that collect and store data, accessing this data remotely, or install malware on the device. And, once an attacker gains access to one IoT device, they can use its network to access other devices. This breach in security across multiple IoT devices is often the cause of digital identity theft.</p>

<p>Here are other security concerns associated with IoT devices.</p>

  Weak authentication and authorization: Many IoT devices ship with default usernames and passwords that are often easy to guess or not changed by users. This makes it simple for attackers to gain unauthorized access to these devices. While enterprise-grade IoT tends to have stronger built-in security than consumer devices, many employees bring personal devices into the workplace — smart watches, home monitors, smartphones, and more — and these devices can provide an entry point to the enterprise. 
	 Firmware and software vulnerabilities: IoT devices often run on outdated or unpatched software and firmware, making them susceptible to known vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the past. 
	 Lack of security by design: Security is sometimes an afterthought in IoT device development, with many manufacturers prioritizing functionality over security, leading to insecure configurations and inadequate protection mechanisms. 
	 Privacy concerns: IoT devices frequently collect and transmit sensitive personal data, raising concerns about user privacy. 
	 Botnet recruitment: Insecure IoT devices are a prime target for cybercriminals looking to recruit them into botnets for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or other malicious activities. 
	 Regulatory and compliance issues: Organizations deploying IoT devices may struggle to comply with data protection regulations, as the sheer volume of data generated by these devices can be difficult to manage securely. 
  Identifying and mitigating risk factors 

<p>It's important to mitigate risks that could leave your IoT devices vulnerable to unauthorized access and identity theft. That means implementing comprehensive security procedures and trusting automation for real-time analysis. You can also use <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identity management</a> to store and secure personal information.</p>

 Digital identity management 

<p>Everyone and everything that connects to the internet has a digital identity. Your digital identity includes information, such as login credentials, device attributes, browsing preferences, account information, and more. Your identity makes it possible for applications to identify you and serve the content you want to see. Many companies use digital identity management to protect this wealth of information. Proper digital identity management protects your devices, files, and digital reputation from external threats like identity theft.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance</a> and administration (IGA) is a technology that can help organizations appropriately restrict access to IoT devices. This process can automate access to individual IoT devices and entire networks. It gives the right people access to the right devices and information — and nothing more. Identity governance also keeps information out of the wrong hands and helps organizations of all sizes achieve the complex task of complying with data handling and privacy regulations that vary regionally.</p>

 Implementing robust security procedures 

<p>It's important to commit substantial resources toward protecting IoT devices. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">Protect and segment data</a> in ways that keep information out of the wrong hands. This approach often requires a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/why-security-fatigue-huge-cybersecurity-risk">robust series of security procedures</a>, including multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>

<p>Passwords are known as static shared secrets — the user knows the password and so does the server being accessed. But any time something is known, it can be exploited. Organizations that <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">eliminate passwords entirely</a> can help keep IoT devices and users safe from identity theft.</p>

<p>Your commitment to IoT security should also include a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">transition to cloud identity</a>, also known as identity as a service (IDaaS). Cloud identity comprises the full range of technologies related to identity, access management, and compliance, and it is applicable to every digital identity across the enterprise: human users, systems and servers, applications and workloads, and IoT devices.</p>

 Leveraging automated tools and solutions 

<p>Automation can significantly improve your IoT cybersecurity efforts. They help your organization proactively identify, categorize, and respond to threats before they infiltrate your network. Artificial intelligence (AI) can also help companies monitor for compliance, fortify firewalls, and establish flexible access permissions.</p>

<p>Many <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-powered threat protection</a> tools use real-time data analytics to make informed security decisions far faster than a human ever could. They can locate vulnerabilities, identify suspicious access attempts, and block malicious users and bots.

 Where Crypto Came From and Why RWA are the Next Logical&nbsp;Step <p>All of this stuff really began in the 1990s; In the 1990s, crypto was a very, very different world. It was pre-blockchain, it was very much a world that was dominated by email, even the Web didn’t have any cryptography; there was no<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS"> HTTPS</a>. All it really had was a program called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)</a> and the ability to encrypt emails. If one person wanted to send a message to another, you did a key exchange, you encrypted the email, often at a command line on a Unix box, and then you would send an email. That seems like prehistory, but that’s really only 25 years ago, and from that we’ve basically gone through probably three or four major stages of building out the crypto ecosystem that we have&nbsp;today.</p><blockquote>In the 1990s, crypto was a very, very different world</blockquote><p>Getting crypto built into the web browsers and into the infrastructure of the Internet was the first stage, and the thing that enabled ecommerce. It was probably the single largest transformation that we’ve ever seen in terms of mass consumer adoption of cryptography. Cryptography built into Web browsers is the thing that created multiple trillions of dollars of value in the form of the entire ecommerce ecosystem, and then the Web 2.0 ecosystem that survives on advertising largely driven by ecommerce. All of that was cryptography; prior to the building of the crypto into the Web browsers there was no ecommerce, there were no credit card transactions online, there was really nothing but documents. So, we’ve already gone through one almost industrial revolution in real-world asset trading driven by crypto. The second huge transformation was the creation of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card"> SIM cards.</a> SIM cards and bank cards that have chip and PIN and all the rest of these kinds of things were the first real large-scale adoption of hardware cryptography, that was when we started having cryptographic algorithms embedded in chips, which gave you a completely new kind of security.</p><blockquote>Getting crypto built into the web browsers enabled ecommerce</blockquote><p>Then, the next turning point, the third, is the<a href="https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/training/annual-national-training-seminar/2018/Emerging_Tech_Bitcoin_Crypto.pdf"> Bitcoin whitepaper.</a> As crypto has developed, there have also been waves of resistance. In the 1990s, with the advent of PGP, the US government freaked out and reclassified cryptography as munitions. They literally said that encryption was armaments, and it became illegal to export from America without a licence under what was called the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations"> ITAR</a> [International Traffic in Arms Regulations] regulations. ITAR drove a huge number of cryptographers out of America and a lot of those folks wound up in a place called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anguilla">Anguilla</a> and formed an early crypto island community there. That’s also where you began to see the hybridisation of offshore finance in cryptography, and some people would suggest that that was where you got the birth of some of the stuff that became crypto economics that we started in the late&nbsp;1990s.</p><blockquote>ITAR drove drove a huge number of cryptographers out of America to Anguilla where you got the birth of crypto economics</blockquote><p>One of these waves of resistance led to the fall of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold">E-gold</a> in 2005. E-gold was a perfectly reasonable gold-backed digital currency system: fully centralised, no real use of crypto, it was a very successful platform. You could transfer $100,000 from one cell phone to another cell phone in the late 1990s for 50 cents, instantaneously, and that was all gold-backed, it was essentially gold-backed stablecoins. That system was effectively shut down in 2005, when the FBI raided its offices over E-gold’s use in criminal activities and confiscated its equipment and files. I would say that almost everybody thinks that the fall of E-gold was the thing that triggered Bitcoin. It was a case of if there was going to be another E-gold and it was not going to get shut down by the government, then it was going to have to be decentralised. The response from the crypto community to E-gold, was Bitcoin and the blockchain, and that led to what we now know as the whole cryptocurrency space.</p><blockquote>The fall of E-gold was the thing that triggered Bitcoin</blockquote><p>Finally, in the fourth step, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a> made it possible to run decentralised applications on the blockchain, making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance">DeFi</a> possible. I was launch coordinator for Ethereum, but I’m really quite disappointed in the way that things have gone since then. There’s a video from the early days of Ethereum, mid-2015, called <a href="https://youtu.be/j23HnORQXvs?si=HtMmnMKA1JKse9QC">“Ethereum: The World Computer”</a> and it really lays down the vision where Ethereum is going to be used to do things like auction off the slots for air traffic control: you want to land a plane, you book a slot in two weeks, you decide you’re not going to charter that plane, you sell off the slot and it’s a token. They talk about real estate, electrical grids, satellite infrastructure. There is this whole notion of “We’re just going to tokenize the real-world assets,” and what’s going to happen is you’re going to get these new, efficient economies that will enable just a much better deployment of capital globally, to get better goods and better services available for people, with less waste and less inefficiency. That was the vision that I think everybody in the Ethereum team shared in 2013, 2014, 2015. There was no notion in the early days of Ethereum that there was a digital world and a physical world and they played by two completely different sets of rules and didn’t really touch; the idea was that we were going to roll out infrastructure directly into the physical world, and it was going to touch everything. And then it didn’t&nbsp;happen.</p><blockquote>The idea was that we were going to roll out Ethereum Infrastructure directly into the physical world. And then it didn’t&nbsp;happen.</blockquote><p>The way that I think about Ethereum is that Ethereum, the blockchain in general in fact, is like an enormous engine, and it’s an enormous engine in an enormous vehicle, and the problem is the engine is not connected to the wheels because there’s no gearbox. It doesn’t matter how hard you rev the ICOs in 2018, how hard you rev DeFi in the DeFi summer, how hard you rev the NFTs… The wheels don’t turn. I could see that problem happening; in 2016 it became clear that we were having a real problem getting traction, because the lawyers kept not approving the things that were going to be world-changing, and I realised that I had to go off and fix the legal problem. I had to go out there and figure out how we were going to get the lawyers on board, because until the lawyers started saying yes rather than no to the deals, we couldn’t get access to the real world. As a result, I started <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> to address these legal issues, and spent several years and a good few million pounds coming up with a system that can effectively connect the real world to the blockchain in a way that is legally binding. It was not easy, but we did it, but that’s also why, to date, we’re the only people to have done&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>The blockchain, is like an enormous engine in an enormous vehicle, and it’s not connected to the wheels because there’s no&nbsp;gearbox</blockquote><p>When I started Mattereum, what I said was, “Our customer is the General Counsel or Chief Legal Officer of a Fortune 500 company that controls a bunch of real-world assets. The people that actually have the yes-or-no legally, when you want to touch the real world, these are our customers, and we have to figure out how to get them to say yes to blockchain transactions in their asset classes.” I figured it was going to take us a couple of years of research then a couple of years of prototyping, but the pandemic got in the middle of that and really slowed us down quite a lot. It took us four years to get to the first live transactions, and six years to get to the point where we could do securitisation, but we’re now at a point where we have the adaptor, we have the connector, which makes it possible to legally control pretty much any asset in pretty much any country in the world in a way that lawyers will approve of. Now, there’s a bunch of work to be done in some jurisdictions, there are some countries that we’ll simply never work in, but the kind of core commercial structure of the entire world is now accessible to the blockchain. You have to bring lawyers, there is always detail to be done, but generally speaking, we’ve got the power-dyne in place, and we’ve got the worked examples,we’ve got the legal analysis, and we can do this now. I think of this as being kind of back to the future: we can go back to the 2013–2014–2015 vision and now we can implement it fully, and we’ve got the gearbox, so now when you run the Ethereum engine, the wheels turn and the vehicle move and the real world will come with&nbsp;us.</p><blockquote>Mattereum have got the gearbox, so when you run the engine, the wheels turn and the vehicle&nbsp;moves</blockquote><p>An important functionality that the Mattereum system opens up is fractional ownership of real world assets (RWAs). Fractional ownership is kind of how the real world works. Everything in the world that is big, and I’m thinking here big like electrical grids, airlines, large scale real estate developments in many cases, these things don’t just have a single owner, there isn’t just a single monopoly of like “This person owns the electrical grid,” that’s not how it works. What you have is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company"> publicly traded companies</a>, which in the UK they call publicly listed companies, that’s your Facebooks and your Apples and your Amazons and your IBMs: they have stock, and just about anybody in the world can go buy that stock, and they can buy it and they can sell it and they can trade it. Those companies are massive, they’re very, very heavily regulated, and that’s how things like electrical grids get built. It’s just normal for the big stuff. With the companies that make the cancer drugs, the companies that dig up the oil and the coal and the gasoline and all the rest of that stuff, the car companies, you just naturally assume that you can buy equity in them, you can buy stock. The world is built on fractional ownership, because really these things are too important and too powerful to be owned by a single individual who could change their mind about how they’re going to work overnight. You can see this a little bit with the politics around Twitter, where because it was something that could be bought and sold by a single individual, once it was bought by Elon Musk everything changed. Publicly listed companies, publicly traded companies don’t work like that: they have governance, change is much more slow, it’s much more moderated, and that’s why they tend to be trusted to do things like run electrical grids.</p><blockquote>The Mattereum system opens up fractional ownership of real world&nbsp;assets</blockquote><p>So we’re not inventing fractional ownership from scratch. What we’re doing is we’re using the efficiency of the blockchain to apply this kind of fractional ownership concept to much smaller things, in a much more inexpensive and lightweight way. That brings the benefits of the fractional ownership model and the associated governance right down to the point where you can begin to imagine doing it for individual cars, individual houses, individual works of art, rather than thinking more at the scale of an airline, or an electrical grid, or a utility that serves hundreds of millions of users a day on the Internet. This is relatively easy now with Mattereum, and good to&nbsp;go.</p><blockquote>Mattereum is using the efficiency of the blockchain to apply fractional ownership to much smaller&nbsp;things</blockquote><p>It involves the concept of granularity. Say that we’re going to have a situation where you’re sharing 10 homes in this kind of fractional way. One way that you could do that is you could put all of those homes into an enormous bag, called something like a real estate investment trust, and then everybody could take 10%, 2%, 5%, and they would equally own one part of each one of those 10 homes, and it could be 10,000 homes. <br>That’s one model, that’s the kind of trust model, everything is kind of in a single bucket and you own little pieces of the bucket, and that’s a perfectly practical, reasonable way of doing things and it has a lot of advantages. The other approach is that you could take these places individually and tokenize them, and at that point you could own more of the places you spend a lot of time in, and less of the places you don’t spend very much time in. Then, instead of every person having the same strategy and the same portfolio, they just own different percentages of it. You could actually decide you want to own more of the stuff in Bali and less of the stuff in Hong Kong, and somebody else decides they want more of the stuff in Hong Kong and less of the stuff in Bali, and so you get this ability for each person to shape their own investment strategy and their own deployment of resources, much more granular. Then maybe at some point you decide you’ve had enough of the fractional ownership lifestyle, you sell all of your equity in all of these assets to somebody else, and then you take that and you buy 70% of a house that you’re the majority owner in, and that’s your primary residence and you live there from then&nbsp;on.</p><blockquote>Each person can shape their own investment strategy and their own deployment of resources</blockquote><p>We’re moving away from Ethereum as a thing that largely exists in the ethereal realm, you make up a new kind of property, you document it in the form of a smart contract, you then exchange this new form of property with other people that believe in that new form of property holding value — all very airy, very esoteric, very ethereal — into gold bricks, which are about as dense as a thing can get; into real estate, it’s the stuff that you’re literally standing on. So for us, the Mattereum name has taken on more and more meaning, as from the ethereal to the material. It’s the bringing of the blockchain to earth, grounding it in the real&nbsp;world.</p> It’s “blockchain touches&nbsp;grass”.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-road-to-rwa-f99cac31361d">The Road to RWA</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>In our <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-expands-into-security-service-edge-sse-with-two/ba-p/3847829">previous blog</a>, we introduced Microsoft’s identity-centric security service edge (SSE) solution and two new services: <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-private-access-an-identity-centric-zero-trust/ba-p/3905451">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> and Microsoft Entra Internet Access. This blog continues the series around Microsoft’s new SSE solution, where we’ll take a deeper look into the Microsoft Entra Internet Access, currently in public preview for Microsoft 365 scenarios, and soon-to-be available in public preview for all internet traffic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As digital transformation and the rise of hybrid work drive broad adoption of modern software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, and work-from-anywhere arrangements, organizations increasingly need to protect their environments against the threats of open internet. Traditional network security tools just don't scale to the needs of modern work and lack the protections against the emerging sophisticated attack patterns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Internet Access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Internet Access is an identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG) for SaaS apps and internet traffic that protects against malicious internet traffic, unsafe or non-compliant content, and other threats from the open internet. Working alongside Microsoft Entra Private Access and the rest of Microsoft Entra identity stack it unifies your access policies across all internet resources and SaaS apps, including Microsoft 365 with Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/">Entra Conditional Access</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Secure access to all internet resources, SaaS, and M365 apps with an identity-centric secure web gateway solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Professionals can use Internet Access to extend adaptive, granular access controls for any remote user, device endpoint, or branch network as they connect to any internet destination and SaaS app without these destinations requiring native federation with identity providers. Internet Access&nbsp; simplifies and modernizes traditional network security to protect users, apps, and resources with advanced capabilities across web filtering, cross-tenant protection, data loss prevention, and deep packet inspection. Plus, it offers best-in-class security and optimized access for Microsoft 365 apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What makes Microsoft Entra Internet Access unique 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seamless integration with identity-centric access controls: Our deep integration with Microsoft Entra ID enables Conditional Access to be extended to any external destination, internet resource, and cloud application, even if they’re not integrated or federated with Microsoft Entra ID. Soon this will include continuous access evaluation that can instantaneously revoke access if conditions change, for example if an identity attack was detected. This integration with Conditional Access enables you to leverage granular device, user, location, and risk conditions while applying various SWG, CASB, and Firewall policies to model contextual security requirements of their enterprise. Last but certainly not least, we bring in new network conditions to extend Conditional Access policies for your SaaS apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best-in-class performance and resiliency: Our globally distributed proxy, powered by Microsoft's private wide-area network, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft global network</a>, with Points of Presence (PoPs) closest to the user eliminates extra hops to optimize traffic routing to apps and resources, giving them a fast, consistent hybrid work experience. You can now connect your remote workers and branch offices seamlessly through our global secure edge that’s only milliseconds away from the users’ location. This helps avoid traffic hairpins and single point of failures for egress/ingress to and from the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced security and visibility for Microsoft 365 applications: We offer a host of unique security and visibility provisions for Microsoft 365. Our data path security provisions for Microsoft 365 include - granular adaptive access controls as well as protection against token theft and data exfiltration. We also provide enhanced visibility of security sensitive activities through near-real time logs enriched with user, device, and location metadata for advanced threat correlation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Side-by-side support with 3rd party SSE solutions: Microsoft Entra Internet Access can be deployed as a main solution to protect access to all internet resources, SaaS, and Microsoft 365 destinations or side-by-side with other SSE solutions. So, you can choose to rely on Microsoft Entra Internet Access for the unique security and visibility capabilities for Microsoft 365, while keeping all your other internet traffic and SaaS apps protected by another SSE solution of your choice. Traffic can be acquired using either a client-based approach from end user devices or by running IPsec tunnels from remote networks. You can easily enable secure access to Microsoft 365 traffic throughout-of-box profiles in Microsoft Entra admin center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Unique differentiators of Microsoft Entra Internet Access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Internet Access key capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extend Conditional Access universally to all Internet endpoints: Control access to all Internet destinations leveraging Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies.&nbsp; The convergence between identity and network access policies helps eliminate the gaps in&nbsp; defenses and strengthen organizational security posture. By managing all access policies in one place, you can now then extend adaptive access controls universally to rely on Conditional Access and, soon also on continuous access evaluation to any network destination like an external website, or non-federated SaaS applications – without the need to change these applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Universal Conditional Access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protect against data exfiltration: <a href="http://onfigure%20tenant%20restrictions%20-%20azure%20ad%20-%20microsoft%20entra%20%7C%20microsoft%20learn/">Tenant Restriction v2</a> is a strong data exfiltration control enabling you to manage external access risks from your managed devices and networks by curating a granular allow or deny list of foreign identities and applications that can or cannot be accessed. Internet Access enables you to enforce tenant restriction signal universally across all OS and browser platforms, without the need for corporate proxy, reducing overhead and providing more flexible, granular controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Universal Tenant Restrictions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protect against token theft and prevent users from bypassing the secure network edge: Internet Access introduces Compliant Network as an integrated and easy-to-manage construct within Conditional Access. With this control, you can protect Microsoft Entra-integrated cloud applications against token theft and ensure users do not bypass network security policies specific to their tenant while accessing critical cloud services. It’s also enforced in data paths using continuous access evaluation to instantly deny access to Microsoft 365 apps and resources in case of detected token theft. In our SSE model, user productivity is improved compared to traditional network security approaches, since the Compliant Network check allows remote users to be verified without having to hairpin them from a handful of egress locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Compliant Network Control</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Restore original user source IP context for all traffic: Typical proxies obfuscate users' original source IP, breaking location policies in Conditional Access as well as impact the accuracy of risk detections and activity logs. Microsoft Entra Internet Access offers differentiated backward compatibility of your trusted location checks in Conditional Access and continuous access evaluation, Identity risk detection and logging, by ensuring the users' original source IP is maintained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Source IP Restoration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unify network access controls with Conditional Access to extend granular Conditional Access policies to your SWG policies. This means that you can now apply network security policies on any internet destination based on the rich conditions available in Conditional Access, including user, device, location, and risk constructs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Extend Conditional Access with any internet destination</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restrict end user access to unsafe and non-compliant content with web content filtering (URL, FQDN, web category) and make internet filtering policies more succinct, readable, and comprehensive, by leveraging the rich user, device, and location awareness of Conditional Access. Helping to reduce the attack surface and simplify the administrative experience for network security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 8: Web Content filtering</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attain deep insights and network analytics using in-product dashboards: Our insightful in-product reports and dashboards make it easy to digest and share a holistic view of your entire environment with your organization. You can look at deployment status, detect new risks, and quickly remediate issues. Our dashboard provides a snapshot of the users, devices, and destinations connected through Microsoft’s SSE solution. We show cross-tenant access undergoing in your enterprise, as well as top network destinations in use.​ Early next year, we’ll provide enhanced policy insights and recommendations and offer advanced app and network discovery capabilities.​ &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 9: Native dashboards &amp; insights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create custom views and dashboards based on rich insights into network logs: On our traffic logs page, you can visualize every request and response transaction happening through Microsoft’s SSE solution. In these logs, you can also view valuable information collected from the device, like device ID and operating system name and version.​ You can also see relevant packet information like source IP and port, destination IP and port, and FQDN. ​</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enriched real-time visibility for Microsoft 365 security events: Facilitate easy and fast threat detection for Microsoft 365 apps and resources through enriched logs. Internet Access solution extends the Microsoft 365 log schema with rich user, location, and device context while providing near real-time SLAs without the need to break and inspect the traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 11: Microsoft 365 enriched activity logs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upcoming capabilities are in advanced development and will be released early next year:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Restrict outgoing and incoming traffic based on IP addresses, port, and protocol using granular policy conditions leveraging context aware cloud firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Identify and block malicious network activity with Intrusion Detection and Protection System (IDPS) and threat intelligence to target known malicious IPs/FQDNs/URLs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Inspect encrypted traffic with granular TLS inspection across all TCP/UDP traffic.&nbsp;

 Getting started with Entra Internet Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">Global Secure Access</a> (preview) is the centralized location in the Microsoft Entra admin center where you can configure and manage Microsoft Entra Internet Access. Internet Access isolates the traffic for Microsoft 365 applications and resources, such as Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. Users can access these resources by connecting to the Global Secure Access Client or through a remote network, such as in a branch office location. The most current version of the client can be downloaded from the Microsoft Entra admin center. You can install the client interactively, silently with the /quiet switch, or use mobile device management platforms like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management">Microsoft Intune to deploy</a> it to their devices. </p>

<p>Based on Lockstep’s submission on the <a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/reports-and-publications/submissions-and-discussion-papers/2023-2030-australian-cyber-security-strategy-discussion-paper">2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy</a>.</p>
<p>The Australian government believes we could be the “most cyber secure nation in the world” by 2030.</p>
<p>I know many of my cyber security peers think this is loose talk, but I think it can be done.&nbsp; At Lockstep we believe that national data protection infostructure is well within reach.</p>
<p>Australia could deploy public-private networks within just a year or two for presenting and verifying known-good personal data, to make citizens and business alike immune to the prevalent forms of cyber-crime.&nbsp; Infostructure leveraging mature mobile wallet technology and two-sided business networks would have greater reach and socio-economic potential than any other cybersecurity uplift currently on the agenda, and yet it is amongst the more achievable objectives within the 2030 timeframe.</p>
<p>This blog condenses Lockstep’s submission to the Department of Home Affairs’ public consultation on the Cyber Security Strategy 2023-2030 which was <a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/reports-and-pubs/PDFs/2023-2030-aus-cyber-security-strategy-discussion-paper/Lockstep-Consulting-submission.PDF">recently published by the government</a>.</p>
 The importance of data 
<p>The central role of data in future economies is obvious.</p>
<p>David Tudehope (CEO, Macquarie Telecom) writing for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) in July 2021 stated that “data is effectively the economy’s critical infrastructure”.</p>
<p>Data is itself now a utility as important as energy, food supply chains or transportation. And yet it remains precarious. Data is manipulated by bad actors at a scale unimaginable only 10 years ago, resulting in harms ranging from theft and fraud at unprecedented levels, through infrastructure disruption, to distortion of national elections.</p>
<p>All identity fraud—and perhaps all cybercrime—is actually about bad data.</p>
<p>Data is so critical now, it merits infostructural security so that the economic users of data can be confident where it has come from and what it is intended to be used for.&nbsp; By infostructure we mean organised systems of standards, rules, technologies and governance processes that together protect data as a utility.</p>
<p>To protect data systemically, we must start at the source(s).&nbsp; Government is trusted for so much of our core data, through critical resources such as birth and name change registers, citizenship and immigration records, driver licensing and electoral rolls.</p>
<p>If the mission of government is to both protect and serve the citizenry, then when it comes to data, the most basic role for government could be to make official data available to those who need it, in the most reliable possible way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 A solved problem 
<p>Data resilience is a solved problem in payments.</p>
<p>Citizens should have the means to present verifiable facts about themselves as easily and as safely they present their payment details when shopping online.</p>
<p>That transformation alone would do more to undercut organised identity crime than any other proposal we’ve seen.&nbsp; And it’s already underway.</p>
 Mobile wallets literally don’t make sense on their own 
<p>Mobile wallets are a reality in payments and are being extended to hold all manner of digital credentials.&nbsp; The industry standard technology is known as “verifiable credentials”; multiple Australian public service agencies are well advanced in implementing verifiable credentials solutions.</p>
<p>State and federal Ministers have recently highlighted the potential for a range of government credentials to be digitised and held in a choice of wallets.&nbsp; This is great progress and sets the stage for national infostructure.</p>
<p>And yet a subtle point about interoperability goes unnoticed in the enthusiasm for mobile wallets. Digital credentials only work when the intended receivers know what to do with them and have arrangements in place for their software to recognise and accept approved credentials.&nbsp; </p>
 What makes credit cards acceptable? 
<p>The criticality of acceptance networks is readily appreciated if you think about using your credit card. You can only use your branded card at merchants who have made arrangements with the particular card brand to accept it.</p>
<p>When a merchant decides to accept credit card payments, they sign on with a chosen card scheme and install terminals and/or e-commerce gateway software to process customer account details.&nbsp; Customers’ cards are useless without these arrangements on the merchant side. It doesn’t matter what sort of digital wallet you might use: it is the merchant’s set-up that determines which cards you can use to go shopping.</p>
<p>Therefore, Australian governments need to consider more than legislation when rolling out digital credentials. Online retailers (actually, their software providers) have a major challenge ahead working out which proofs of age are officially endorsed (or perhaps mandated).</p>
<p>They are a powerful tool, but verifiable credentials do not verify themselves. Wallet technology is necessary but not sufficient for interoperable verifiable credentials. To be legible, wallets they must go hand-in-hand with infostructure for (a) approving issuers before loading credentials to a wallet, and (b) processing credentials when presented to parties depending upon them.</p>
 What would a cyber secure country look like? 
<p>A cyber secure nation will treat data as an asset, as important as clean drinking water or stable electricity supply.</p>
<p>Lockstep suggests that a cyber secure nation would feature widespread uniform digitally secure data handling.</p>
<p>State governments wish for digitised qualifications and licences to be interoperable nation-wide, but employers and training organisations (and software vendors too) cannot be left on their own to make separate arrangements for digital credentials to be processed online. We risk losing the economic dividends of digital transformation in a rat’s nest of bilateral administrative decisions.</p>
<p>A cyber secure nation will no longer tolerate ad hoc point-to-point data connections and unverified data flows—just as it is illegal to make unlicensed electricity and gas connections. Instead, a cyber secure nation would build public platforms that bring data issuers and data users together under transparent rules and regulations.</p>
 An action plan 
<p>Lockstep’s Cyber Security Strategy submission goes into more detail about short-to-medium term actions, including:</p>
 
 Continue the transformation to digital wallets in citizen service delivery. 
 Appreciate that wallets and verifiable credentials do not work at scale without underpinning infostructure that makes the meaning of all data machine-readable, clear, and dependable. 
 Infostructure in general is core business to government and a safe place to act. Examples include telecommunications networks, Medicare and PBS payments, e-passports, electronic conveyancing, and the NBN. 
 Private-public partnerships can build and operate the new data protection infostructure, incrementally. 
 Nearly immediate options to “Click to Prove” official data, beginning perhaps with Medicare numbers. 
 Services Australia could develop an API and web service for any other organisation to ingest and verify Medicare numbers from mobile wallets. Healthcare providers could invite their patients to “Click to prove” their details digitally. Verifiable patient Medicare numbers is one way to curb common and costly forms of provider fraud. 
 Such APIs and web services could then be expanded (while driver licences and the like are rolled out to verifiable credential wallets) and made available to any AML-governed entity for digital identification in account opening. 
 
<p>Lockstep has gone further to model a two-sided network architecture for verified data distribution.&nbsp; You can follow our work here on the <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/dvp/">Data Verification Platform</a>.</p>

The latter is about solutions that manage access to LoB (Line of Business Applications) such as SAP, Oracle eBusiness Suite, JD Edwards, Salesforce, SuccessFactors, and many others in depth. They help in enforcing the least privilege principle, managing correct implementation and execution of SoD (Segregation of Duties) controls, managing critical entitlements, and overall application risk.
Will this help solving the IGA challenges? Will generative AI and automation fill the skills gap? Will RBAC (Risk Based Access Control) help reducing recertification workloads? Will all this help us lowering the cost of compliance?

<p>The latest additions to the tech stack make it easy to integrate KILT without blockchain experience.</p><p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/opendid">OpenDID</a>, a no-code solution for incorporating a KILT login into a website, and the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/ctype-hub">CType Hub</a>, a hub for existing and new credential types, are now available for&nbsp;use.</p><p>Combined with the Code Examples for Attesters (Issuers) and Verifiers, they comprise the KILT Suite of tools and tech developed to make integrating KILT easier for teams with no experience of working with blockchain. This enables teams to develop and use cutting-edge decentralized identity solutions in line with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards.</p> OpenDID <p><a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/opendid">OpenDID</a> is an off-the shelf software component for websites that can be used to implement a login with a KILT credential.</p><p>The service authenticates users by generating JWT (JSON Web) tokens — an open standard used to securely share information between two parties — using the user’s decentralized identifier (DID) and verifiable credentials. These tokens can be used with any service that supports JWT tokens, acting as a bridge between the decentralized identity world and the centralized authentication world.</p><p>Like Web2 login providers such as Facebook and Google, OpenDID uses the OpenID-Connect flow: the user is directed to the login page and then redirected back to the website application. The redirect will contain a JWT token in the URL, which can be used to authenticate the user. This token contains the DID of the user and the claims from their verifiable credential. In this way, the Verifier (website owner) can check if the user is allowed to access the&nbsp;website.</p><p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/opendid">OpenDID</a> makes integrating a KILT login easier, as the website owner can choose a credential they wish to accept and incorporate it into the OpenDID flow. This means that instead of starting from scratch and collecting or storing the information needed from their customers, a business could accept pre-existing credentials provided by issuers (Attesters) they trust that contain that information. For example, currently a website could decide to integrate a login using email credentials provided by <a href="https://www.kilt.io/services/socialkyc">SocialKYC</a>.</p><p>This is an exciting development, making logging in with your decentralized identity as easy as logging with mainstream Web2 identity providers!</p><p>OpenDID is open source and has no license fees. It was built by <a href="https://botlabs.org/">BOTLabs GmbH</a>, the initial developer of KILT Protocol.</p> CType Hub <p>The <a href="https://ctypehub.galaniprojects.de/">CType Hub</a> works both as a registry of existing CTypes and as a place to create new&nbsp;CTypes.</p><p>A CType is the schema of a verifiable credential on KILT that outlines its properties and types, ensuring all the required information is requested. For example, a passport CType would specify that attributes such as name, date of birth, nationality etc. are required for issuing a passport credential.</p><p>The Hub will display the properties of each existing CType, the DID of its creator (or web3name, if available), its total number of attestations, and (optionally available for CTypes created on the CType Hub) the associated description and&nbsp;tags.</p><p>Both Attesters (Issuers) and Verifiers can use the Hub to see if a credential CType format containing the information they require already exists on the KILT blockchain. If not already available, Attesters (Issuers) can create their own credential in the Hub. The Hub will be continually updated.</p><p>The CType Hub was built by <a href="https://galaniprojects.de/">galaniprojects GmbH</a> and funded by a KILT Treasury&nbsp;grant.</p> Code Examples <p>OpenDID and the CType Hub complement the <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/new-code-examples-making-integrating-kilt-technology-easier-67cdcc2a46b9">TypeScript Code Examples</a> for Attesters (Issuers of verifiable credentials) and Verifiers released recently.</p><p>Each code example works like boilerplate code and includes only the necessities to make the application run. Each can be optimized and secured to meet individual requirements.</p><p>See the documentation for Attesters (Issuers) <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/CertifiedProof">here</a> and for Verifiers <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/ProofCheck">here</a>.</p> SDK <p>In addition to the Code Examples, the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/kilt-sdk">KILT TypeScript SDK</a> (software development kit) is available to enable developers with no blockchain experience to build decentralized applications (dapps) and create new business use cases around identity. It provides a collection of classes and methods to interact with the KILT blockchain.</p><p>The team is continually working on improving and upgrading the SDK — keep an eye out for Version 1.0, coming&nbsp;soon.</p> Start Building <p>All of the above tech is open source and requires no license fee to use or to build&nbsp;on.</p><p>For testing, builders can create their solutions for free on the Peregrine testnet. Peregrine tokens (which have no monetary value) can be obtained from the <a href="https://faucet.peregrine.kilt.io/">faucet</a>, and test versions of the wallet and applications built on KILT are available <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/develop/chain/deployments/">here.</a></p><p>Once built and tested on Peregrine, applications can then be configured to work on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>A video on integrating OpenDID into a website is coming soon, covering integrating OpenDID and finding your CType.

<p>Financial cards have been a cornerstone of our monetary transactions for decades, providing us with convenience and security. Yet as technology advances at an unprecedented pace, financial cards are undergoing a significant transformation to meet the demands and preferences of the present generation. In this blog post, we’ll examine the evolution of financial cards, highlight the importance of the flat card trend, and explore the possibilities that emerge with flat card adoption.</p>
<p>Financial cards then and now</p>
<p>Financial cards have come a long way since their inception. The concept of using plastic cards for payments emerged in the late 1950s, coinciding with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.dinersclub.com/about-us/history/">Diners Club Card</a>. This breakthrough led to the development of various card types, such as credit cards, debit cards, and prepaid cards, which revolutionized the way we transact.</p>
<p>In recent years, financial cards have undergone significant modernization to keep pace with evolving consumer needs. One noteworthy example is the integration of contactless technology, allowing for quick and effortless payments with just a tap at point of sale. According to a <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/press-releases/2020/april/mastercard-study-shows-consumers-globally-make-the-move-to-contactless-payments-for-everyday-purchases-seeking-touch-free-payment-experiences/">Mastercard</a> survey, 82% of consumers express a preference for contactless payments over conventional methods. This underscores the increasing significance of modernized financial cards in aligning with evolving consumer preferences and technological advancements.</p>
<p>More recently, the rise of flat cards, also referred to as unembossed cards, has emerged as a game changer. Unlike traditional embossed cards that bear raised characters on the surface, flat cards offer a sleek, minimalist design. For a number of reasons, this trend has gained significant traction with the present generation.</p>
<p>Enhancing cardholder experience by design</p>
<p>First and foremost, flat cards are more durable and less prone to wear and tear. The absence of embossed characters eliminates the risk of them fading or getting damaged over time. And with the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/07/1153724823/need-a-new-credit-card-it-can-take-almost-two-months-to-get-a-replacement">card replacement process extending to nearly two months</a>, this presents an opportune time for card issuers to adapt their operational strategies and offer flat card alternatives to their cardholders and members.</p>
<p>Secondly, flat cards align with the aesthetic preferences of the present generation. As minimalism and sleek design gain momentum across multiple industries, financial cards have followed suit. As highlighted in a <a href="https://slate.com/business/2018/04/why-are-credit-card-numbers-on-the-back-of-the-card-now.html">Slate</a> article, card issuers should leverage any available advantage in the highly competitive card market.</p>
<p>Flat cards: Possibilities abound</p>
<p>The widespread adoption of flat cards in the financial industry brings exciting possibilities for both consumers and businesses. In Online Payment Fraud: Market Forecasts, Emerging Threats &amp; Segment Analysis 2023-2028, Juniper Research estimates that <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/online-payment-fraud-research-report">merchant losses from online payment fraud will reach $362 billion globally</a> between 2023 and 2028. The absence of embossed characters allows for enhanced security features to be integrated seamlessly – from advanced encryption methods, modern authentication options, and dynamic CVV codes – reducing the risk of fraud and identity theft.</p>
<p>Moreover, flat cards provide ample space for customization and personalization. Financial institutions can leverage this opportunity to offer personalized designs, enabling individuals to showcase their unique preferences or affiliations. With front, back, vertical, and horizontal layouts plus vibrant ribbon colors, cardholders and members will be able to enjoy high-quality, unique card designs made possible by next-generation flat card innovation.</p>
<p>Driven by the needs and preferences of the present generation, the evolution of financial cards continues to unfold. Within the industry, flat cards have emerged as a necessary trend, providing increased durability and a sleek, minimalist design that captures consumers’ attention. This transition has not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal of financial cards, but has also brought new possibilities for advanced security features and personalized customization. As we move forward, it’s evident that modernized financial cards will continue to shape the future of monetary transactions, providing consumers with convenient, secure, and personalized payment experiences.</p>

<p><br>You've used the <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a> planning tool or maybe this is the first you are learning about it. Now we're going to explore what's going on underneath the surface that makes it radically different from most collaborative apps.</p><p>What makes Acorn unique, beyond the innovations in the UX around new ways of thinking about dependency planning, is that it's a Holochain hApp. This means it's a completely decentralized, peer-to-peer application, that doesn't require any centralized infrastructure or third party hosting.</p><p>What does that mean? For comparison, let's start by looking at a traditional collaborative project management tool (think Asana or Trello). This tool presents the user with a web hosted UI that communicates with a central server, with software and databases controlled by the owners/operators of the software (e.g. Asana the company).</p><p>While the user can in principle have control over the UI code that they use to connect to the central server (depending whether the owner allows this), they have no control over the software running on the server and only as much control over their data stored on the server as the owner allows.</p><p>With centralized data, the owner of the system can decide at a whim to:</p>  change how the server software works (eg, changing what the algorithm decides to show you)  share or sell your data to anyone  use it for their own AI purposes  delete or restrict access to your data shut down the software entirely, for any reason  <p>Contrast this with a Holochain hApp like Acorn.</p><p>When you install the Acorn hApp on your computer, a unique cryptographic keypair is created, allowing you to identify yourself as a particular agent.</p><p>Whenever you create a new project, a new shared database using a DHT (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table?ref=blog.holochain.org">distributed hash table</a>) is created which stores that specific project's data. Initially, as you are only the person in the new project you have created, you are the only one storing the data.</p><p>However, as other users join your project (using a 5 word secret phrase you share with them), they become nodes of the same project and DHT, meaning they share in the work of storing the data and also become able to collaborate on the project with you.</p><p>Any user that has access to a project is able to access any data in that project, regardless of whether it is stored locally on their device. And no user has access to the project and data without the secret phrase. </p><p>The computational work that Acorn does with the data is done by code running on the users computers, operating on data stored on the users computer. This is the thing that makes Acorn unique among planning and productivity tools (and which it shares with all Holochain hApps). </p> Collaboration tools on Holochain come with:   Direct control over your data: There is no centralized server so no one other than you can control your data or even knows it exists. Only people you choose to share it with have access to it, and you have complete control over the software you're running that operates on that data. And you can evolve your software around the data instead of being tied to a platform.  Offline collaboration out of the box: Most platform collaboration tools require you to be online. Even Google Docs requires that I set each file to a special status, using their browser to work offline. Holochain based collaboration tools have this out of the box.  No cloud costs, scales with demand: Nobody is paying for cloud services so there is no cost to host. Not for you, not for the other participants of the application. This means that the overall cost of the application will always be lower than for centralized tools. And scaling an app happens naturally with the growth of more users.   <p>There's a lot more complexity on the Holochain side that allows this to work in a secure, tamper proof way, but for an end user of <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a>, this is all completely invisible. You just get a planning and coordination tool that works out of the box with no configuration, and no need for any centralized computation or database infrastructure.</p>

          <p>It’s important to also note that none of this is legal advice, but rather our objective observations on the regulatory frameworks that these nations uphold.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Across seven continents, 195 countries, and more than 10,000 cities, jurisdictions worldwide are formulating or refining their stance on the regulation of tokenized securities and Real World Asset tokens (RWA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>While some jurisdictions claim that the ‘law is clear’ and believe additional clarity isn’t necessary, others are establishing comprehensive frameworks to bolster confidence and foster innovation in tokenization.</p>
<p>Specifically, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong are proving to be at the forefront of regulatory clarity in Asia</p>
<p>While reading, keep in mind that we use the terminology: security tokens, digital securities, and tokenized securities interchangeably. Also, Tokeny is a technology provider, we are not lawyers.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 🇰🇷 South Korea Security Tokens Regulatory Status: 
<p>As a national task for digital financial innovation, South Korea is promoting the reorganization of the token securities issuance and distribution disciplinary system to allow STOs within the rules of the Capital Markets Act.</p>
<p>The FSC, South Korea’s securities regulatory body, earlier this year,<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/06/south-korea-issues-guidelines-for-regulating-security-tokens-as-legislation-looms/"> clearly stated</a>, “Digital assets corresponding to securities must be issued and distributed in compliance with all securities regulations under the Capital Markets Act.”</p>
<p>This is part of their 17 separate crypto-related legislative frameworks they are putting together to establish the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA), an all-encompassing legal framework for regulating Korea’s dynamic crypto industry.</p>
<p>The regulator used a unique analogy: The ‘food’ is the same regardless of the container in which it is served. Likewise, a security could be paper-based, electronic (centralized) or based on distributed ledger technology (DLT).</p>
<p>In essence, South Korea acknowledges that security tokens are simply digital versions of traditional securities, but presented differently and are still subject to the same stringent legislation as non-digital securities.</p>
<p>The FSC has outlined specific principles and illustrative examples to help discern which digital assets can be classified as securities:</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			<p>Three Pillars for Effective Token Securities Management:</p>
 
 Under the Electronic Securities Act: Security tokens are now accepted as a legitimate form of securities issuance 
 Issuer Account Management: Issuers that meet certain requirements are permitted to record information on the rights and rights holders of securities directly issued on the blockchain 
 OTC Trading Brokerage: A framework is in place to promote over-the-counter (OTC) trading for both investment contract securities and beneficiary securities. 
 

		 
	 
 <a href="https://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/index">Read more at the FSC Website</a>        
	 
		 
			<p>I have to say, this is pretty impressive and we applaud the FSC’s efforts in their work to actively bring clarity and transparency to instill confidence in innovators who simply want to follow the rules, but do it in a more efficient manner.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 🇸🇬 Singapore Regulatory Status: 
<p>Singapore has long been at the forefront, making significant progress in fostering innovation while maintaining rigorous oversight just as traditional securities do.</p>
<p>Similar to South Korea’s regulatory body, the regulatory body of Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), regulates based on the characteristics of each digital token, rather than the labels.</p>
<p>Focusing specifically on securities and real-world assets (RWAs), the most relevant categories are capital markets products (CMPs) and asset-backed tokens (ABTs).</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			<p>CMPs: These are digital tokens regulated under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA), which is the main legislation for offerings and dealings in Singapore</p>
<p>For example, digital tokens may be regarded as the following types of CMPs:</p>
 
 Shares in a company 
 Debentures 
 Units in a business trust 
 Securities-based derivative contracts 
 Securities that the right or interest to something or an option to acquire a right or interest in a business 
 
<p>Asset-backed tokens: Asset-backed tokens refer to digital tokens that represent some or all of an underlying asset and have two categories: Commodities and Real Estate</p>
 
 Commodities: For the trading of commodity ABTs, they are regulated under the Commodity Trading Act, which is mainly for traditional commodities such as precious metals 
 In the case of real estate ABTs, depending on its structure it would be regulated the same as CMPs for trading and other relevant activities 
 

		 
	 
 <a href="https://thelawreviews.co.uk/title/the-virtual-currency-regulation-review/singapore">Learn more about Singaporean legislation</a>        
	 
		 
			<p>In addition, the MAS has introduced the Regulatory Sandbox. This initiative allows fintech companies to test their solutions in a controlled environment with regulators, ensuring compliance with all regulatory standards.</p>
<p>iSTOX, now known as ADDX, is an example of a company who <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/istox-graduates-from-mas-regulatory-sandbox-now-a-fully-regulated-dlt-based-capital-markets-platform-300997523.html">successfully graduated from the sandbox</a> and is now operating a fully-functional end-to-end platform all within the regulatory guidelines set forth by the MAS.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 🇭🇰 Hong Kong Regulatory Status: 
<p>Hong Kong was one of the first major jurisdictions to provide regulatory clarity on security tokens.</p>
<p>Specifically, back in 2019, The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong released a statement on security token offerings (STOs) essentially stating that as long as all existing securities laws are being complied with then the digital representation or use of a security token is legal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
          Elizabeth Wong from the SFC's fintech unit emphasized that the evaluation of security tokens should focus on their underlying assets, not their tokenized form. This reflects Hong Kong's perspective that the format shouldn't determine the nature of the security; it's the underlying asset and its adherence to guidelines that matter.  Elizabeth WongHead of Fintech of Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK)          
	 
		 
			<p>Back in 2019, the crypto and blockchain ecosystem was vastly different with nefarious and fraudulent activity happening everywhere you looked. That’s not to say this isn’t happening today, but for good reason, regulators took a more conservative stance and restricted trading platforms were limited to accredited or professional investors to ultimately project retail.</p>
<p>This past summer, in 2023, the SFC has since relinquished this restriction for retail and will now enable the trading of security tokens assuming the platform receives the proper licensing.</p>

		 
	 
 <a href="https://www.decential.io/articles/hong-kong-relaxes-security-token-rules-to-attract-crypto-business">Read more about Hong Kong's security token rules</a>  
	 
		 
			<p>It’s clear to us that the tide is shifting and regulators across the globe are realizing that securities and security tokens are the same instrument, they are just presented in a different manner that we believe is a better one.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more regulatory updates. Thanks for reading!</p>

   The ForgeRock Identity Platform has been awarded for excellence by three industry publications 
	
<p>This has been a big year for ForgeRock! We're excited and honored to announce that we've been named the best identity and access management (IAM) solution by three industry publications: <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/sc-award-winners-2023-forgerock-best-identity-management-solution">SC Media</a>, <a href="https://www.scawardseurope.com/winners-2023">SC Media Europe</a>, and <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/event/4112986/winners-announced-security-excellence-awards-2023">Computing Security Excellence Awards</a>.</p>

<p>These award programs recognize the companies and solutions that are advancing the cause of safe and secure commerce and communications. Receiving recognition by several of cybersecurity's most prestigious awards is a testament to ForgeRock's commitment to scaling new heights as a digital identity leader.</p>
	
	<blockquote><p>"With more than 1,300 customers and more than 4 billion identities managed in some 50 countries, the judges took note of the way ForgeRock's Identity Platform features end-to-end, AI-driven capabilities and seamless implementation across all identities, environments, and devices."</p>
	<p>– SC Media</p>
	</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> has been recognized for its ability to manage, secure, and govern identities at scale. We were noted for streamlining up to 90% of access privileges and automating over 50% of user access requests, while reducing both risk and administrative costs. Our AI-driven capabilities and passwordless model were also highlighted as key benefits of the platform.</p>

 Every identity matters 

<p>We're proud of our achievements because of the value they bring to our customers.</p>
	
<p>Large enterprises have incredibly complex needs in terms of scale, as some of them support many millions of identities. They must comply with regulatory and privacy requirements that differ around the world. They're modernizing through digital transformation to accelerate their ability to serve customers and provide them with excellent digital experiences — yet most of them also have legacy applications that cannot be moved to the cloud. And they face an endless barrage of attacks from well-funded actors seeking to disrupt their operations, steal their intellectual property, and extort great sums of cash.</p>

<p>Every identity in these enterprises matters, because any identity can be the foothold attackers need to infiltrate a network and carry out their malicious activities. Each of us at ForgeRock is proud of the role that our solutions play in protecting our customers and providing their users with a safe and simple way to access the connected world.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Traditional password-based authentication techniques are vulnerable to online attacks. Fortunately, a ground-breaking remedy called an identity-based passwordless authentication system is on the horizon. Let’s explore how passwordless authentication works. We’ll discuss passwordless implementations, their ideas, advantages, adoption barriers, best practices, and how they can enhance digital identity protection.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Adopt Long-Term Safety Measures: It is a progressive step toward improving internet security to move toward identity-based passwordless authentication. This approach offers superior security for online identities by doing away with the flaws in conventional passwords and replacing them with those in biometrics, one-time passwords (OTPs), and hardware tokens. 
 Passwordless authentication requires a major cultural shift; therefore, prioritizing user experience and education is essential. To promote adoption, businesses should allocate resources to inform customers of its advantages and simplicity. The intuitive design of this system, coupled with a well-managed migration, can boost user participation, safety, and productivity. 
 Passwordless authentication implementations must align with current data protection requirements like GDPR and CCPA. In this way, businesses can ensure compliance with rules and use them to promote a more secure, password-free future. Using biometrics and other data cautiously may pave the way to solid security while protecting users’ right to privacy. 
 
 Understanding Identity-Based Passwordless Authentication 
<p>Identity-based passwordless authentication offers a safe and convenient way to authenticate identification without conventional passwords. It uses technologies and processes, such as one-time passwords (OTPs), hardware tokens, facial recognition, voice recognition, and other biometric devices for authentication. Examples of biometrics for passwordless authentication include fingerprint, face, and contextual authentication. Passwords are no longer necessary thanks to passwordless authentication, which offers a more secure and dependable substitute.</p>
 The History and Evolution of Authentication Methods: 
<p>Authentication methods have significantly evolved, introducing a more secure and user-friendly model with each progression. Initially, passwords served as the primary method of authentication. This system can be traced back to ancient times when sentries would challenge anyone seeking entry into a city or castle with a password. With the advent of computers, this concept of password authentication was digitized, with users having to remember an alphanumeric password to access their computer systems and accounts.</p>
<p>The need for more robust security measures became evident as the internet era blossomed. This led to the birth of two-factor authentication (2FA), a system requiring users to provide two types of identification. Typically, this included something they knew (like a password) and something they had (like a mobile phone to receive a one-time password).</p>
<p>Eventually, the cybersecurity landscape advanced towards multi-factor authentication (MFA), an even more robust authentication system. MFA authentication factor could include something a user knows, has, and is something they are (biometrics, like fingerprint or facial recognition). Today, the world is witnessing a shift towards identity-based passwordless authentication methods, eliminating the need for the easily-compromised traditional password and relying on more secure and convenient authentication methods.</p>
 Benefits of Identity-Based Passwordless Authentication: 
<p>Beyond the primary advantages of security and user experience, passwordless authentication also impacts a company’s operational efficiency. By redefining access methods, significant cost benefits can be achieved, which we will explore in the next section.</p>
 Cost Efficiency: 
<p>Implementing passwordless authentication can lead to substantial cost savings for businesses. Reducing help desk calls for password resets alone can save significant time and money. According to a study by Forrester Research, a single password reset costs $70. Thus, businesses can allocate these resources to more critical areas by eliminating the need for password-related support.</p>
 Scalability: 
<p>Traditional password-based systems can become increasingly complex and challenging to manage as a company grows and adds more users. In contrast, passwordless systems are easier to work at scale, which is especially beneficial for large businesses or rapidly expanding companies.</p>
 Increased User Engagement: 
<p>Identity-based passwordless authentication refers to factors. Passwordless authentication’s convenience and user-friendly nature can increase user engagement. By reducing the friction associated with logging in, users will likely interact with a platform more frequently and with less hesitation, leading to improved business metrics.</p>
 Improved Data Privacy: 
<p>Identity-based passwordless authentication methods that use biometric data or tokens don’t require the storage of sensitive personal data. This can lead to improved data privacy, as there’s less personal information at risk in a data breach.</p>
 Greater Inclusion: 
<p>Identity-based passwordless authentication can also be a more inclusive option. For example, for individuals with difficulty remembering multiple complex passwords due to cognitive impairments or age-related memory issues, options such as biometric authentication or even hardware token tokens can be far more accessible and easy to use.</p>
 Future-proofing: 
<p>As the shift towards identity-based passwordless authentication continues to grow, early adoption of these systems allows organizations to be on the edge of security technology. This offers practical benefits now and positions these organizations as forward-thinking and responsive to the changing digital landscape, which can also have reputational benefits.</p>
 Strengthening Security with Identity-Based Passwordless Authentication: 
<p>Traditional password-based methods have been a common weak point in system security, often being the initial target for cybercriminals. Stolen or hacked passwords can lead to a cascade of security breaches, culminating in the loss of sensitive data and even identity theft. The modern landscape requires a robust, reliable solution to these pervasive issues. This is where passwordless authentication steps in, offering a more secure alternative to stolen passwords through advanced verification techniques.</p>
 Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): 
<p>Multi-factor authentication is a security system that verifies a user’s identity by requiring multiple credentials. Instead of just asking for a username and password, MFA demands other evidence or factors. These could range from something you have (a smart card or a mobile device), something you are (biometrics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition), or something you know (a PIN or a secret question).</p>
<p>Identity-based passwordless authentication further enhances this process. It uses different means like email, SMS, physical tokens, or biometric components to transmit one-time passwords. Incorporating a private key in MFA forms an extra layer of security against compromised credentials, making it significantly more challenging for malicious actors to steal credentials and gain unauthorized access.</p>
 Dynamic Risk Assessment: 
<p>An additional layer of security is introduced through dynamic risk assessment. This feature assesses the risk level of a login attempt based on various factors such as location, device, and behavior patterns. If a login attempt is deemed risky, additional authentication factors can be prompted, adding another hurdle for potential attackers.</p>
 Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities: 
<p>Passwordless authentication also tackles common security threats head-on. Eliminating the need for a traditional password directly counters threats associated with weak or reused passwords, such as credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, and phishing attempts.</p>
<p>These traditional attack vectors lose effectiveness when passwords are removed from the equation. In turn, this creates a more robust barrier against unauthorized access and unwanted breaches, fortifying the digital identity security of users. Moreover, passwordless authentication can reduce the attack surface, as no password databases could potentially be breached.</p>
<p>Identity-based passwordless authentication strengthens security by offering a more reliable, multifaceted approach beyond traditional password-based systems. Integrating MFA, dynamic risk assessment, and immunity to common password vulnerabilities fortifies digital security.</p>
 Overcoming Adoption Challenges 
<p>While implementing and adopting passwordless authentication can pose challenges for organizations, it is vital to consider the following points:</p>
 Implementation complexities: 
<p>Identity-based Passwordless authentication can be challenging to implement. It must be compatible with multiple platforms and technologies. Organizations must thoroughly evaluate existing infrastructure and devote resources and skills for seamless rollout.</p>
 User acceptance and familiarity: 
<p>Users used to using conventional passwords may be reluctant to adopt new, passwordless system authentication and techniques. Educating and teaching users about identity-based passwordless authentication and emphasizing its advantages to obtain user approval and confidence is essential.</p>
 Balancing security and convenience 
<p>Even when identity-based passwordless authentication improves security, a balance between security measures and user comfort is required. When developing the user experience, organizations should take great care to ensure the authentication process is quick and easy. </p>
 Successful Use Cases of Identity-Based Passwordless Authentication 
<p>Identity-based security token passwordless authentication is becoming more popular and works well for many enterprises in various sectors. Let’s look at a few prominent use cases:</p>
 Major organizations and platforms: 
<p>Leading IT firms, including Microsoft, Google, and Apple, have embraced identity-based passwordless biometric authentication methods as a more secure and convenient choice. Consumers have a smooth and safe experience thanks to biometric authentication techniques. These include fingerprint scanning and face recognition, which have been integrated into phone numbers, products, and services.</p>
 Banking and financial services: 
<p>The banking sector has acknowledged the advantages of identity-based passwordless authentication, which deals with sensitive consumer data and transactions. Banks have improved security and the user experience during financial transactions. They have done this through passwordless solutions using hardware token tokens and mobile app-based authentication. These solutions have dramatically reduced the risk of unwanted access.</p>
 Healthcare and government services:  
<p>Identity-based passwordless login authentication is becoming increasingly common in industries where security and privacy are crucial. Healthcare and government organizations have adopted identity-based passwordless login and private keys and systems. This is to safeguard sensitive patient data and provide secure access to a user’s account, private key, and information.</p>
<p>Success stories demonstrate the effectiveness of identity-based passwordless authentication in phone numbers and real-world situations. This type of authentication method offers improved security and a better user experience.</p>
 Best Practices for Implementing Identity-Based Passwordless Authentication 
<p>To enable users to get security keys and login credentials and ensure a successful implementation of user adoption of identity-based passwordless authentication, organizations should follow these best practices:</p>
 Assess organizational readiness: 
<p>Evaluate the existing infrastructure, systems, and security protocols to identify gaps or requirements for identity-based passwordless authentication implementation. Conduct a thorough assessment to determine your organization’s most suitable to implement passwordless authentication and credential-based authentication methods and technologies.</p>
 Select appropriate authentication methods: 
<p>Consider your user base’s requirements and preferences when selecting other authentication methods and techniques. Other priorities or accessibility needs may apply to different users. Users may choose the most effective access and password management strategy by providing various alternatives, including biometrics, hardware tokens, and OTPs.</p>
 Educate users and address concerns: 
<p>Explain the benefits of identity-based, passwordless authentication work to users. Address any concerns or questions they may have. Provide clear instructions on how to use the various passwordless authentication safe techniques. Provide training opportunities, frequently asked questions, and support resources to help users accept and comprehend the new passwordless authentication work strategy.</p>
 Implement robust security measures: 
<p>Identity-based passwordless authentication increases security, but extra security measures are still required. These measures should protect the user’s identity information and prevent illegal access. Encryption, cryptographic keys, secure network protocols, and ongoing monitoring of threats or vulnerabilities in mobile devices may all be part of this security posture.</p>
<p>Organizations can use identity-based authentication to challenge security token passwordless authentication for a secure and convenient experience. To do this, they should follow best practices.</p>
 The Impact of Legislation and Regulation on Passwordless Authentication: 
<p>Legislation and regulation have a substantial impact on how passwordless technology for authentication and its implementation. In an age where privacy and data protection are paramount, rules like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) profoundly influence how businesses handle user authentication. These laws mandate that organizations follow stringent data protection standards, affecting how passwordless authentication technologies are implemented.</p>
<p>For instance, any authentication method involving biometric data, like fingerprints or facial recognition, would require explicit user consent under GDPR. Similarly, the CCPA ensures that California residents have the right to know what personal data is being collected about them and to say no to the sale of that information. As such, these regulations can pose challenges and promote the adoption of passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>Conversely, passwordless authentication can help businesses adhere to such regulations more seamlessly. By eliminating the need for password storage and transmission, enterprises reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure higher compliance levels. Furthermore, with biometric data stored on the user’s registered device in many passwordless systems, companies can avoid handling sensitive personal data directly from registered devices, further ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. Thus, legislation and regulations significantly shape the adoption and implementation of passwordless authentication, but with careful planning, they can also be a catalyst for its increased use.</p>
 The Future of Authentication: Identity-Based Passwordless as the New Standard 
<p>According to market trends and forecasts, identity-based passwordless authentication is the future of digital identity security. Results have improved the simplicity and security of identity-based, passwordless authentication solutions. They use cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and decentralized identity frameworks.</p>
<p>As we gradually move toward a world without passwords, we will create a safer digital environment for individuals and companies. Identity-based passwordless authentication prioritizes the user’s private and public key, comfort, and experience over security and establishes a new benchmark for digital identity protection.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Identity-based passwordless authentication represents a significant leap forward in protecting our digital identities. By addressing the vulnerabilities associated with traditional passwords, we can bolster security, enhance the user experience, and streamline convenience. </p>

<p></p>



<p>The supply chain sits at the core of every trade. Smooth and efficient supply chain management is a must for any enterprise. Orders, shipments, and payments have to be in sync for each transaction for smooth supply chain management. Although supply chain activities appear to be straightforward, they are significantly complex. Such complexity has further increased with the world becoming a marketplace. Many corporations have to handle their supply chain on a global scale on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasingly, technology is being leveraged to solve multiple problems in the supply chain space. Labelling of inventory with RFID tags or digital product identifiers, and connecting the inventory movement with the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) to remove execution problems including inaccuracies in inventory data, missing shipments, and duplicate payments among others are prevalent now in the supply chain space. Despite such interventions, the scope for improvement exists and blockchain technology can be impactful. It can create complete, transparent, tamper-resistant records of all the information flow, inventory flow, and financial flows of every single transaction through its decentralised ledger system. Other distinct features like tamper-proof ledgers with complete traceability make blockchain-powered solutions ideal for streamlining supply chain management. Many specialised players like Dhiway Networks are enabling several organisations to improve their supply chain by leveraging blockchain.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Blockchain in Supply Chain:&nbsp; 



<p>Blockchain technology is bringing rapid transformation in the supply chain space. Through providing increased transparency, security, and efficiency, this technology holds the potential of revolutionising the supply chain process in multiple ways.<br><br></p>



 Smart contracts: 



<p>Supply chain management involves the process of planning, coordinating, and executing the flow of goods and services from the enterprise to the end user. This process involves multiple stakeholders including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. At the time of execution, multiple parties enter into several agreements. Blockchain technology transforms these contracts into smart contracts through automation. With smart contracts, every transaction and movement of goods can be recorded and tracked on a shared ledger, which is visible and verifiable by all participants. Therefore, trust, accountability, and traceability are established. Using automation, manual processes are eliminated. This reduces cost and the chances of fraud and error. Moreover, much of the paperwork can be eliminated, saving both time and resources. Smart contracts can execute predefined actions based on defined conditions. For instance, payments to vendors, transferring ownership, or triggering alerts can be accomplished through these smart contracts. Thus, manual interventions are mitigated, which reduces manual errors, delays, and fraud.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Ease in trade financing:&nbsp; 



<p>Smooth supply chain management can’t be achieved without an efficient trade finance process. And for trade finance to be efficient, document processing has to be seamless. Blockchain plays an important role in making document processing and administration visible across the supply chain through its decentralised ledger system. For instance, each stakeholder exactly knows where the goods are in transit in case of a shipping or air transport mode. Moreover, blockchain-based solution does away with any paper-based documentation and needs for its transportation to relevant parties. Such ease of documentation boosts the trust in the entire system and provides financial institutions the comfort of granting several trade financing facilities such as LCs (letters of credit), overdraft, and bank guarantees among others. Improved trade financing eventually leads to business growth across the spectrum.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Quality control &amp; Product authentication:&nbsp; 



<p>For a manufacturing concern like an automobile company or a pharmaceutical firm or a retailer, ensuring the quality of the product is of prime concern. In many instances, it has been seen that counterfeit products swamp the market, making a dent in the reputation of the original manufacturer. In this perspective, blockchain can be leveraged to verify the authenticity of products and prevent counterfeiting by enabling secure and tamper-proof records of a product’s origin and movement throughout the supply chain. As the movement through the whole supply chain is traced, quality is ensured by faster identification and subsequent removal of defective products.&nbsp;</p>



 Food safety: 



<p>For any food manufacturer, the safety of the food material is of prime importance. Because, any compromise on food quality not only brings reputational risks for a company but also puts the firm into many legal obligations. Therefore, tracing the food manufacturing process becomes important. Blockchain can be leveraged to track and monitor food safety, ensuring that food products are safe for consumption by providing a transparent and traceable record of the product’s journey through the supply chain.<br><br></p>



 Inventory management: 



<p>Inventory is the single most important thing that determines the outcome of any production process. A high level of inventory depresses profit, while a low level of inventory has the potential to disrupt the production process. Therefore, maintaining an optimum level of inventory of raw materials, finished products, and intermediary goods is critical. Enterprises have started adopting many innovative methods in inventory space of late. For instance, many enterprises have started adopting ‘Just-In-Time’ inventory method. Under this approach, corporations maintain only that much inventory as required. So, visibility over the complete inventory becomes essential for smooth production and sales. Blockchain can be used to track inventory levels and optimise inventory management processes. This reduces inventory costs and improves supply chain efficiency.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Sound financial management coupled with compliance: 



<p>Supply chain finance is a complex process and runs through several parties. Recording, tracking, and reporting financial transactions across the supply chain are important aspects that an enterprise has to take care of. Blockchain technology enables enterprises to achieve all the desired outcomes in supply chain finance. It provides secure and transparent records of transactions between suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors. Similarly, an enterprise dealing with a global supply chain has to deal with the compliance norms of various nations. Blockchain technology can be used to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements by providing a transparent and auditable record of supply chain processes. It reduces the risk of non-compliance and costs associated with it.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Unlocking efficiency in India’s supply chain with Blockchain: 



<p>India’s foreign trade is likely to exceed $1.6 trillion in FY24. While the country’s share of merchandise exports is around 2 per cent of the total exports, services exports are more than 4 per cent. The country is also one of the fastest-growing markets for ecommerce, which is likely to reach $163 billion by 2026. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector is witnessing rising investment- domestic and global- as China plus one theme picks up momentum. Many manufacturing concerns including Apple are increasing their production footprint in India. Against this backdrop, the scope for improving supply chain management through leveraging blockchain technology is enormous. Technology partners like Dhiway Networks with the right amount of experience and expertise can enable enterprises to devise a robust supply chain management framework and execute it with maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>App adoption is witnessing an exponential rise across the globe. India is no exception. Rising penetration of the internet, mobile-first culture, and a high young population are the driving factors behind this trend. From buying of grocery to purchasing apparel; from booking an air ticket to fixing appointments with doctors; apps have penetrated our lives in a big way. According to digital intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Asia will see the highest growth in mobile app adoption with a CAGR of 6.2 per cent to reach 88.3 billion first-time downloads by 2026. Within the Asian region, India is expected to lead with 40.2 billion new downloads by 2026. As the access to the internet rises, usage of apps in our daily lives is set to rise further. Apps can be centralised or decentralised in nature. While centralised apps are very popular in the current context, more and more apps are getting built in decentralised format.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 What are Decentralized Applications (dApps): 



<p>Decentralized applications, or dApps, are those software programmes that run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of on a single computer. Unlike centralised apps, which are controlled by a single authority, dApps stay outside the purview and control of any single authority. dApps are often built on the Ethereum platform. Currently, dApps are in use for a variety of purposes including gaming, finance, and social media among others.<br><br></p>



 Advantages of dApps: 



<p>As users flock to apps, the safety and privacy of users’ data face increasing threats from cyber attackers. In several instances, users’ personal data have been breached, creating huge personal and financial liabilities. Similarly, the world is increasingly worried about the power of centralised apps (like Facebook and Twitter) over various world events by controlling the narrative. In this context, dApps due to their decenralised nature come with distinct advantages over centralised apps.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;</p>



 Safety &amp; privacy of users’ data: 



<p>Unlike centralised apps, decentralized apps do not require personal data to access their features and functions. Therefore, there is no fear of data breach as no personal data is shared. Users can use these apps quite confidently without experiencing any privacy issues. This is significant as the world has seen many instances of data breach in centralised apps. For instance, Facebook (now Meta) faced a major data breach in which the personal data of 533 million users got leaked. In a similar attack on hospitality major Marriott International, close to 400 million guests’ personal data including phone numbers, passport details, email addresses, and other sensitive information got leaked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 No central authority: 



<p>dApps ensure smooth transactions between two parties securely without involving a centralized authority. This feature allows dApps to grow in popularity as users don’t face any censorship from a central authority. Moreover, decentralised nature of dApps ensures transparency and accountability. In the last decade, many social media apps, which are centralised apps, have become very powerful in moulding and influencing public opinion. The world is now replete with stories where active censorship by centralised authorities of these apps has changed political discourse in many countries. Apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Whatsapp, and many others have been alleged abetted many controversial events across the world by posting or sharing contentious material. Against this backdrop, dApps get rid of such centralised authorities. Therefore, the scope of censorship doesn’t exist with more accountability.in case of dApps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Scaling up with multiple use cases:&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralized apps are known for their flexibility. Such flexibility allows us to build apps for different sectors like gaming, banking, ecommerce, retail, and many others at ease. Moreover, scaling up is rather easy in the case of dApps. So, huge numbers of users can transact through the interface which are dApps. Such inherent ability to scale up makes it fit for consumer-facing businesses, which usually see millions of customers transacting over a period of time.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Low cost of maintenance:&nbsp; &nbsp; 



<p>As decentralised apps use a shared network, a vast amount of data can be maintained without much cost. In centralised apps, data storage and retrieval require demand for both spaces for storage and specialised staffers. Therefore, the maintenance cost of centralised apps is usually higher than the dApps. Such affordability makes dApps fit for multiple use cases across sectors.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Less disruption, more stability: 



<p>Compared to centralised apps, dApps are more stable in their flexibility. The robustness of dApps also comes from the fact that it relied on a centralised server to function. As these apps operate on a blockchain network, such apps hardly see any interruptions. For any consumer-facing business, such stability and robustness make a compelling case for using dApps.&nbsp;For instance, India has seen many instances where consumer data has been leaked from ecommerce apps that are centralised in nature. If such apps become decentralised in nature, such risks can be mitigated to a large extent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Challenges: 



<p>Despite these positive features, the process of developing dApps also faces some challenges. Firstly, dApps are relatively new. While the traditional apps market runs into a multi-billion dollar market, dApps is a multi-million market. After a surge in the use of dApps, the design, and development of such apps have been on a decline since 2018. This is because it being a relatively new concept, which will go through its own evolution cycle. Secondly, design, development, and maintenance of dApps are more expensive than the traditional apps. Research shows a functional dApp cost in the range of $50,000-$200,000 for an enterprise, which is way higher than a traditional app. Therefore, small and medium enterprises are staying away from the design and development of such apps despite their several advantages over centralised apps. Moreover, user experience is not up to expectations in dApps. With sound user experience being the key to better adoption of any app, dApps have to go a long way in this aspect. Hence, it has to match the centralised apps in terms of network demand, and user-friendliness. Though this can be overcome by working with the right technology partner, many enterprises shy away from developing dApps because of their initial perception. In the case of dApps, the network is evenly distributed among millions of nodes and computers. This makes maintenance, debugging, and updates a difficult task. Moreover, the ability to modify the code and data published on the blockchain network comes as another challenge. However, the limitations seen in dApps can be overcome through many means, and partnering with a blockchain-focused firm is one of them. &nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Partnering with the right blockchain developer: 



<p>Designing and developing dApps comes with complexity. It requires the right set of experience with deep expertise in the blockchain domain. Therefore, collaborating with a blockchain-focused technology company that has already executed such projects for various sectors is a must. It not only improves the efficiency of the development process but also alleviates stress and uncertainty. As dApp is a new technology area, emerging blockchain firms with prior experience ease the process to a great extent. Enterprises should also look at blockchain development firms that can deliver superior customer experience in the dApps like centralised apps. Specialised players like Dhiway Networks have prior experience and deep domain expertise in the design, development, and maintenance of dApps across multiple sectors. Collaboration with Dhiway Networks, therefore, will provide a definitive competitive advantage to enterprises in the dApps space.<br><br></p>

 Introduction 



<p>Reputation and trust are the key drivers of transactions in digital commerce. With the fast-paced growth of online markets, it is vital to establish credibility to secure customers’ confidence. Ratings are an essential aspect of trust-building elements buyers use when undertaking transactions.<br><br></p>



 Why it matters? 



<p>Consider an online marketplace where buyers broadcast their interest in a specific product or service, and a collection of sellers respond with suitable offers. In the absence of in-real-life interactions and in-person communication, the buyers rely on available evidence to evaluate the reliability of the seller and the quality of products and services offered. Ratings serve as this form of social proof, often providing the deciding factor of insights that aggregates the outcome of previous transactions. Higher ratings, positive feedback ease the doubts and reinforces the transaction decision.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Social Proof 



<p>Higher ratings act as a signal of approval from a group of similar buyers, and this drives potential buyers to feel more confident about their upcoming purchases – this is social validation, and the proof is a powerful psychological phenomenon.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Credibility 



<p>Ratings are a quantifiable representation of the seller’s credibility and the quality of their offerings. Positive ratings elevate the seller’s authority in that specific product range or niche – they are recognised as a reputable supplier with a solid customer base. This has a direct impact on sales numbers as well as the ability to launch new products on their shelves.<br><br></p>



 Impact on search results&nbsp; 



<p>Sellers with higher ratings are often present near the top rankings of a search engine query. This increases buyer traffic for these storefronts by establishing customer trust and loyalty. The visibility provides a significant advantage to sellers, as increased exposure leads to more traffic, conversions, and, ultimately, higher sales.<br><br></p>



 Some Concerns with Ratings 



<p>In online commerce, ratings act as a great leveller of information asymmetry – it bridges the gap between buyers and sellers by providing easily understandable methods that address the risks in an online transaction. However, since ratings are such a powerful marketing tool, there is an incentive to game the system, so ratings’ authenticity and trustworthiness have often come under scrutiny. The online commerce platforms weathered some challenges from deceptive practices around ratings.<br><br></p>



 Manipulation of ratings 



<p>A well-known concern around the credibility of the rating system is the prevalence of rating manipulations through fake reviews and other means. Unscrupulous sellers game the system by submitting highly positive or negative ratings to boost or tarnish the sales potential of products.</p>



<p>Given the volume of submissions detecting the fake ones is an arduous task, and often online platforms need more tools to detect and prevent such manipulation.<br><br></p>



 Unverified ratings submissions 



<p>The absence of solid verification mechanisms for ratings creates a situation where platforms cannot determine the authenticity of the submissions. This causes a significant negative impact on sellers, who are left scrambling to mitigate the losses originating from fake ratings and feedback.<br><br></p>



 Review and rating bombing 



<p>Coordinated efforts to boost or deflate the ratings for a product are common on online platforms. The absence of verification incentivises such methods where the ratings can originate from entities who might not even be actual product purchasers.<br><br></p>



 Reimagining rating systems with CORD Network 



<p>While ratings and reviews in e-commerce are designed to assist consumers in making informed decisions, deceptive practices often undermine trustworthiness. Ratings are an essential asset for a seller. It is necessary to address the trust deficit between sellers and buyers simply because online platforms cannot do so using traditional approaches.</p>



<p>The CORD Network from Dhiway is a tokenless distributed ledger built to handle data transactions at scale. The blockchain comes with the modularity of pallets – or microsystems which can be designed to address specific use cases. CORD enables persistent and unique identifiers that can address the unique challenges online platforms face around transaction ratings.</p>



<p>As a data infrastructure for an online commerce platform, CORD enables the sellers to receive a journal of ratings only for the transactions with the possibility of coordinated action on ratings being removed. At any point when the seller initiates a rating request, the ratings received are anchored on the blockchain. Over some time, the seller can obtain a ratings score as individual scores or aggregated values. This creates a significant change in experience for the participants on the online platform. Now, the ratings can be reviewed and audited for authenticity and correctness as the immutable data stream of the CORD blockchain brings this capability.<br><br></p>



 Secure, portable ratings 



<p>A well-known problem with online platforms is that the seller’s credibility is pinned to the platform. As credibility is built around the transaction feedback cycle – more transactions can lead to better ratings. However, this also raises the bar for any seller to seek out newer platforms to position themselves. The high cost of rebuilding credibility from the ground up is an economic and operational barrier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A rating system using the CORD blockchain addresses this by disintermediation – it unshackles a seller’s ratings from the platform. It transforms it into a secure, portable and verifiable score that can cite the transaction records which led to the score. At the same time, enable the seller entity to treat this as a documented portfolio of trustworthiness. Today, as we see open networks around commerce being established, it is necessary to apply the design thinking of decentralization to these network parts. From the perspective of a platform where the value is in the locked-down data silos – to the concepts of a network with the value in the data exchange – CORD brings about the attributes of data provenance, allowing secure sharing.</p>



<p>Such unbundling of data allows a seller to use the data payload of authenticable ratings to seek new opportunities, lines of credit and financing, and other available opportunities in digital ecosystems.<br><br></p>



 The Future 



<p>Ratings started as an easily understood measure of evaluating sellers in online transactions. But today, with innovative approaches – the rating data can be viewed in terms of a powerful asset which empowers the seller organizations to design the opportunities available to them. The way ahead is to deliver on this promise by using secure digital identifiers, which refer to provenance-embedded data streams with privacy-by-design approaches and selective disclosure. The idea of “data ownership” can be transformed into “data exchange” by reimagining the points of control and flow. And the CORD blockchain is just there to make this possible.</p>

  <p>Businesses have a certain responsibility to disclose how consumer data is being used, and if they don't, they face hefty fines and hits to their reputation. In fact, many consumers find personal data sharing to be a particular point of contention. So what can organizations do to respect consumer data privacy and avoid negative outcomes? The answer lies in a consent management plan.</p>
	
 What is consent management? 
<p>Consent management is a process that allows consumers to decide how much of their information will be accessible to the companies with which they interact. Many people are aware of the importance of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identity management</a> and want to protect their sensitive information online. Consent management gives them the autonomy to do so.</p>

<p>Companies practicing proper consent management will put a <a href="https://getsitecontrol.com/blog/how-to-add-cookie-banner-to-your-website/">cookie banner</a> on their website. You've likely seen this pop up countless times, with a choice of "consenting to" or "rejecting" the use of cookies. Whether you're banking, shopping, or scrolling on social media, companies are duty-bound to inform you if they are tracking your online behavior.</p>

<p>Through consent management platforms, businesses keep tabs on users accepting or rejecting cookie tracking. They also keep track of marketing communication preferences, such as whether or not people are interested in receiving emails from the company.</p>
	
 Why does consent management matter? 
	
<p>Public concerns about data privacy are nothing new and will continue to expand along with online services. Consent management is there to dispel some of these concerns for consumers. Corporations have a responsibility to adhere to consent management best practices — and there are regulations all over the world that make it a legal requirement as well, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>), the California Consumer Privacy Act (<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>), and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (<a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda_brief/">PIPEDA</a>), to name a few.</p>
	
 Changing public concerns and corporate best practices 
	
<p>Internet users have grown savvy regarding consent management and there is a growing public concern over data privacy. There are proposed adjustments related to consent management from <a href="https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/press-release/coalition-privacy-self-reg-orgs-launch-uniform-approach-cmp-specific-controls-and">privacy self-regulatory organizations</a> such as the Digital Advertising Alliances (DAAs). In February 2023, the DAAs launched a uniform approach for brands and publishers to offer privacy controls on sites through Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) and the AdChoices program. Collectively called the CMP Complement, the specifications:</p>

  Allow corporations to work with participating CMPs to direct consumers to a dedicated module that provides them with only relevant marketing advertisements 
   Allow consumers to use the <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2695279?hl=en">AdChoices Icon</a> through participating CMPs 
   Provide more information, disclosures, and choices to consumers regarding their personal information sharing 
   Allow consumers to use the AdChoices Icon to access a CMP dashboard along with the current DAAs' information and choices regarding personalized ads 
 <p>Further corporate best practices related to consent management include:</p>

  <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance</a>: Allowing only specific users access to specific platforms and information online 
   Consent preferences: Giving consumers the option to customize their level of consent to share their personal data 
   Subscription options: Giving consumers the option to opt-out fully or partially from marketing communications 
   Timeliness of data: Keeping personal data for only an allotted period of time and then deleting it or asking for continued consent 
 <p>Corporations typically keep consumer information on an <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">identity cloud</a> platform, allowing them to manage consent preferences in accordance with laws and proper business ethics. Giving consumers access to these platforms and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">control over data privacy</a> is becoming increasingly important — and easier to do with new and improved tools available.</p>
	
 Tracking user consent and preferences 
	
<p>Keeping track of user consent and preferences is integral to success in today's digital landscape. Users are more keen to have control over their data privacy and access to consent preference platforms.This is a great way to build trust and customer loyalty, but can create additional work. Organizations can utilize CMPs to keep up with this increased demand.</p>

<p>CMPs are important in the present <a href="https://www.playwire.com/blog/adtech-landscape">AdTech landscape</a> — an ever-changing and expanding encyclopedia of tools for business advertising. CMPs allow businesses to consolidate all of their consent management information from all of this AdTech into one place, making it easier to track user consent and preferences.</p>
	
 The need for digital identity management 
	
<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">Digital identity management</a> is important for today's users due to the increasingly sophisticated nature of cyberattacks. All users should be given the option to consent for their private information to be shared with third parties. The level of consent should be as transparent as possible. That way, if there is a data breach, a company has already done everything in its power to let consumers know how their data was being used.</p>

<p>Consumers are concerned with data privacy and will research a company's safety record before deciding to consent to sharing personal information or receiving marketing communications. For example, if a company just underwent a business split-up, there's a greater chance that <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/how-protect-your-digital-assets-following-business-split">digital assets may be compromised</a>.</p>

<p>Consumers are also tuned in to prior data breaches. They are able to research a company's previous data privacy failures and incident responses to see if they feel comfortable sharing their sensitive information with them presently. In addition, internet users typically don't want to be inundated with personalized ads. <a href="https://amlegals.com/targeted-advertisements-an-invasion-of-privacy">Targeted advertisements</a> can feel like an invasion of privacy, especially if the user didn't consent to their data being monitored to inform those ads.</p>
	
 New regulations and best practices 
	
<p>All businesses, regardless of industry, should stay aware of the new regulations, best practices, and advanced tech specifications for digital privacy management. If companies fail to protect their consumers' digital privacy, it can result in a ruined reputation and significant financial loss, as the average <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">cost of a data breach</a> in the U.S. in 2023 is $9.44 million.</p>

<p>CMPs manage user consent well, but they are best managed in conjunction with other digital privacy tools. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-ciam">Customer identity and access management</a> (CIAM) platforms typically incorporate everything businesses need to keep up with data privacy best practices. They keep everything in one place — from facilitating online registration, login, and account management tools to managing customer identities at scale.</p>

<p>Users want autonomy over their digital assets. To meet this demand for digital autonomy, consent management best practices and modern CIAM tools can be the key for businesses to stay in compliance and in their customers' good standing.</p>

<p>This month, we are joined by special guests Ramsey Nasser and Jon Corbett to discuss their work creating Arabic and Cree programming languages, respectively. </p><p>Ramsey is a computer scientist, media artist, game designer, and educator. His work sits at the intersection of art and technology. <a href="http://nas.sr/---/">قلب</a> (Alb) explores the role of culture in coding and highlights the cultural biases and assumptions baked into the tools we use today.</p><p>Jon Corbett is a nehiyaw-Métis computational media artist, professional computer programmer, and professor. He is approaching the end of his Ph.D. dissertation, which focuses on building an Indigenous Computing Framework. <a href="https://pinnguaq.com/stories/cree-coding/">Cree#</a> is a graphical and generative programming language based on C# that uses nehiyawewin syllabics and Cree metaphors. &nbsp; </p><p>In this episode, you'll hear:</p>  How Ramsey and Jon each approached creating non-Latin alphabet-based programming languages  The challenges they experienced in trying to find the right words to express their desired inputs and outputs when their respective languages didn't have words for those concepts  The delightful surprises they encountered when putting their programming languages into practice        EP03: Alternatives to Modern Programming Languages with Ramsey Nasser and Jon Corbett  0:00 /78:41 1×   <p>Here's a glance at the episode...</p>  [4:50] Ramsey Nasser studied computer science at the American University in Beirut and earned his MFA in Design &amp; Technology at Parsons. His work sits at the intersection of art + tech. &nbsp;   [6:50] Ramsey taught Processing at Parsons to non-programmers. Unity and Open Frameworks were also being taught, and these tools were touted as a way to democratize programming for everyone. However, Ramsey, whose native language is Arabic, realized that this couldn't be the case because these languages are all based on English, and most of the world doesn't speak English.  [12:50] Ramsey shares how different Arab cultures have different words for the names of the months, so even beginning to standardize an Arabic programming language falls apart pretty quickly. This is different from many Western cultures.  [15:05] Approaching Alb as an art practice widens the scope of exploration and questions that can be asked, whereas approaching it from an engineering perspective would involve building all the tools we use to program from the bottom up.   [16:50] Culture cannot be separated from names. Therefore, we are forced into a linguistic collaboration with programmers who came before us. If you want to consume any software written in the last 50 years, you need to be able to engage with English language names.   [20:20] Zeeshan asks Ramsey if there was a point in the history of computing that we could point to where, if we'd thought about language earlier, we could have changed our current predicament. &nbsp;  [24:20] Jon Corbett joins us and talks about reclaiming his ancestral language, Cree. When he learned that there is no word for "computer" in Cree, it sent him down a challenging path where he had to find new ways of articulating computing experiences.  [27:40] Jon explains how there aren't if...then statements in Cree, which made it difficult to work with conditional statements.   [28:20] His breakthrough came when studying the work native Hawaiians are doing as they create a Hawaiian programming language.   [32:00] Jon and Ramsey share their takeaways from working with their languages in programming.  [37:20] Ramsey explains how Arabic is a cursive language, meaning you can stretch the words. Alb takes advantage of this.  [40:20] Brooklyn points out that language changes how we think. She asks Ramsey and Jon if it has changed how they approach engineering problems.  [44:20] Jon discusses incorporating "digital smudging" into his coding practice.  [47:40] Ramsey and Jon explain the trouble they had translating "true" and "false."  [55:20] An audience member asks about directionality and how Ramsey and Jon would approach Ancient Egyptian, which can be written left to right, right to left, and top to bottom.  [1:08:20] An audience member asks Ramsey about the phrase "inshaAllah" and how that can be expressed in code.  [1:13:40] Jon and Ramsey share what they are working on now. &nbsp;  <p>Listen to the podcast embedded above, or head to our <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">podcast landing page</a> to subscribe to the podcast on your preferred platform.</p> Episode Links and Shoutouts: <p><br>Co-Host: Zeeshan Lakhani - Staff Research Engineer at <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Member of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> Programming Committee</p><p>Co-Host: Brooklyn Zelenka - CTO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Member of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> Programming Committee</p><p>Causal Islands Theme Song by <a href="http://depatchedmode.xyz/">depatchedmode</a></p><p>Editor and Producer: Becky Vazquez</p><p>Guest: Ramsey Nasser is a game designer, media artist, computer scientist, and educator.

			<p>ABN AMRO, in collaboration with Tokeny, has made history as the first Dutch bank to tokenize a green bond on a public blockchain. Employing the market-standard ERC3643 through Tokeny’s sophisticated tokenization platform, ABN AMRO has established robust control over its digital bonds. A control that ensures all regulatory requirements are enforced on-chain at the smart contract level, even when these green bonds are represented on the Polygon permissionless network.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking initiative culminated in an outstanding achievement as Vesteda secured a substantial EUR 5 million in funding from DekaBank, marking a decisive leap forward in the domain of sustainable financing. The fusion of blockchain technology, environmental responsibility, and financial innovation has resulted in a landmark achievement that is set to shape the landscape of financial markets and redefine banking in the Netherlands and beyond.</p>
<p>Through this project, ABN AMRO has demonstrated that securities can be effectively represented on a public blockchain without compromising compliance when equipped with the appropriate tools. For example, ABN AMRO is able to track the ownership of tokens and even recover digital securities in external wallets if needed. Therefore, investors’ rights are easily protected. Moreover, its authorized agents have rigorous oversight over the transfer of digital bonds on the network. The ERC3643 smart contract ensures that transfers are exclusively permitted to authorized investors for this investment offering. </p>

		 
	 
    With the implementation of the ERC3643 standard, we have successfully embedded compliance rules into our digital bonds. They can even seamlessly and compliantly interact with other applications on the public network thanks to native interoperability. This marks the beginning of a transformative journey, where the possibilities for innovation in the financial sector are boundless.  Martijn SiebrandDigital Assets at ABN AMRO       ABN AMRO's management team demonstrates a visionary commitment to ushering in a new era of transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in the financial world. As we witness an increasing number of institutions recognizing the true potential of public blockchains to deliver tangible benefits to their clients and the recognition of the market standard ERC3643, we are thrilled and honored to work with institutional pioneers like ABN AMRO to accelerate tokenization adoption.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny       With institutions like ABN AMRO adopting Polygon's public blockchains for digital bonds, it is clear that the technology built by Polygon Labs is poised for greater web3 adoption. This creates an open, interoperable environment for on-chain compliance, unlocking endless future possibilities.  Colin ButlerGlobal Head of Institutional Capital at Polygon Labs

<p>As we commemorate International Identity Day in 2023, we reflect on the evolving landscape of digital identity and its profound impact on our lives. Last year, we discussed the need for inclusive identity solutions in “<a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/international-identity-day-the-need-for-inclusion-by-design/">International Identity Day: The Need for Inclusion by Design</a>.” This year, we continue this crucial conversation with a focus on enabling access.</p>
<p>With increasing conflicts, such as the crisis in Ukraine, and the devastating effects of climate change leading to famine, fires, and floods, more people find themselves displaced and in need of secure identities that grant them access to essential services and opportunities. The need for identity solutions that transcend borders and cultures has never been more evident − identity must serve as a bridge rather than a barrier.</p>
<p>However, as we strive for identity done right, we must also confront the escalating challenges brought about by the digital age. Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep fake technologies have blurred the lines between reality and deception. <a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/synthetic-identity-fraud-what-is-it-and-how-to-combat-it/">Synthetic identity fraud</a> is on the rise, posing a significant threat to individuals and organizations alike.</p>
<p>In this ever-evolving landscape, the importance of identity protection and verification cannot be overstated. Encryption with high assurance identity verification can help ensure identities are robustly secured against fraudulent activities. However, there’s another looming threat on the horizon: <a href="https://partners.wsj.com/entrust/the-post-quantum-cybersecurity-threat/prepare-your-organization-and-your-data-for-quantum-computers/?utm_source=LinkedIn&amp;utm_medium=social-post&amp;utm_campaign=2309-COR-Brand-WSJ-PQByline-LI-1&amp;edc_sfid=7015Y0000044WeIQAU">quantum computing, which will break conventional cryptography</a>. Bad actors are already on the prowl with “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks.</p>
<p>Interoperability emerges as another key theme in the quest for equal access to identity. We must strive to create identities that are not confined by geographical boundaries or fragmented by siloed systems. Imagine a world where your identity is as universal as your fingerprint is unique – a world where your digital identity seamlessly carries across local and international borders.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230302STO76818/european-digital-identity-easy-online-access-to-key-services#:~:text=It%20allows%20EU%20citizens%20to,their%20national%20electronic%20identity%20card.">European Union’s Digital Identity</a> initiative stands as a testament to the potential of governments stepping up to facilitate secure and interoperable identity solutions. By championing such initiatives, governments play a key role in shaping the identity landscape for the betterment of society.</p>
<p>Yet in a landscape where governments may lag in their response, the role of big tech corporations like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/business-will-be-able-to-accept-ids-in-apple-wallet-with-ios-17-among-other-changes/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJh6CuGrjFwkFGIetqc6gHFbfdrURvpAebSeN8u6A7YPJ0rXuiKyr5LTdAOBP8ADU0fPCJcDZGbwPsVAYrC6yGUth6LmxUl2PERToxiI7X4Ec3UPRk9uIbIqLiEZfrc0QxbDLnTJmse_a_wo-63x_fOtL8f3KJVl_uMT9ixm2hEJ">Apple</a> becomes increasingly significant. They possess the technological prowess and global reach to foster transformation in identity ecosystems. We must consider the responsibilities and opportunities that lie with these industry leaders…and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>So, on this International Identity Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to inclusive and accessible identity. In a world where access to services, opportunities, and safety is vitally important, we must ensure that identities are a force for inclusion and empowerment. To achieve this, we must address the challenges of identity protection, embrace interoperability, and engage in constructive dialogue with both governments and technology leaders. By working together, we can harness the potential of identity to create a more inclusive and secure world.</p>
<p>At Entrust, we remain committed to driving these conversations and innovating secure, interoperable, and inclusive identity solutions that truly enable access for all.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with the Zero Trust framework, its principles may seem simple enough in the context of network security. Nobody — not even your most senior leaders — can be granted user access without first being checked at the gate.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: Traditional perimeters are a thing of the past. Today, with remote access and hybrid work a mainstay of the modern enterprise, cyber threats are challenging your organization like never before. That’s why the most forward-thinking businesses are implementing Zero Trust.</p>
<p>However, two questions remain. How do Zero Trust principles work in a cloud environment? And, more importantly, how can they help you safeguard your sensitive data?</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the convergence of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> and cloud security. From why it’s important to how it works, we’ll help you identify all the tools and technologies you need to create a Zero Trust cloud for safe and secure access.</p>
 What is Zero Trust for the cloud? 
<p>IT professionals are well-versed in the art of Zero Trust security. Since its inception in 2010, this innovative approach has quickly ushered in a wave of support for modern network access.</p>
<p>However, what’s not so crystal clear is how this security policy will translate to an increasingly cloud-first landscape. What does “Zero Trust for the cloud” even mean and how does it work? Let’s connect the dots.</p>
<p>According to Forrester, a Zero Trust architecture is built upon <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-definition-of-modern-zero-trust/">three fundamental concepts</a>:</p>
 
 Explicit authentication: The security team must leverage all available data points—context, device, user identity, location, data classification, and so on — to continuously verify, authenticate, and authorize a user or entity. 
 Least privileged access: User access is limited based on a just-enough and just-in-time security policy. In other words, least privileged access ensures only the right people are authorized to use the specific resources they need to do their job — no more, no less. 
 Assume breach: All entities are potential threats and must be treated as such. It’s no longer a matter of “if” an organization will be breached, but a question of “when.” So, businesses must put controls and safeguards in place to minimize the impact of a data breach when one inevitably occurs. 
 
<p>These tenets form the core of the Zero Trust framework and can be applied to any cloud environment — whether it’s a public, private, hybrid, or <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/multi-cloud-security">multi-cloud</a> infrastructure.</p>
 Advantages of Zero Trust for cloud security 
<p>Contrary to a traditional security posture, which assumes a condition of implicit trust, the Zero Trust model believes all endpoints, users, and applications are potential cyber threats. Organizations that embrace the Zero Trust approach — especially in the cloud — can unlock a host of significant benefits:</p>
 
 Better visibility into data, assets, and risks: Zero Trust requires you to implement tools that continuously monitor your cloud environment. This affords your security team an early line of sight into emerging threats, allowing them to thwart any in their path. 
 Enterprise-wide secure access: Empower internal and external users and devices to leverage critical applications with confidence — whenever and wherever they need them. Enabling a safer approach to remote access allows you to maximize productivity without sacrificing security or interrupting the user experience. 
 Reduced financial and reputational damage: The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">average cost</a> of a data breach is over $4.4 million per incident — and that’s not counting the damage done to your brand name and industry reputation. Mitigating threats with a Zero Trust security model will help your organization avoid these costly repercussions. 
 Simplified compliance and risk management: Lower your liabilities and keep sensitive data under lock and key through phishing-resistant authentication, strong encryption, cryptographic asset management, and continuous monitoring. 
 
<p>The further you more effectively implement Zero Trust principles, the sooner you’ll realize these key advantages. Not sure where to start? Check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/zero-trust-maturity-model/">Zero Trust Trust Maturity Model</a>.</p>
 Why you need Zero Trust in a cloud environment 
<p>Traditionally, Zero Trust security is predicated on an enterprise’s ability to manage the network itself. In turn, the security team can establish access control policies and other mechanisms — and more importantly, it can enforce them.</p>
<p>But now, with more organizations hosting information in cloud environments, there is concern over whether or not enterprises lack this level of control. Cloud domains are owned/operated by cloud providers and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) vendors, meaning a company’s network security policy doesn’t automatically carry over to the cloud environment. Consequently, sensitive data that is stored or transmitted is at risk of being spread out across an unprotected attack surface. And, because these safeguards don’t automatically carry over, many businesses might have little to no insight into:</p>
 
 Who or what is accessing their data 
 What device they’re accessing it from 
 How the information is being used/shared 
 When their corporate assets are involved in a data breach 
 
<p>In simple terms, they’re sitting ducks. Worse yet, threat actors have taken notice. IBM reports that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">82% of all breaches</a> in 2022 involved data stored in the cloud, suggesting cybercriminals are targeting cloud-hosted assets and virtual infrastructure.</p>
 Use cases for implementing Zero Trust in a cloud environment 
<p>More than a buzzword, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/zero-trust-for-virtual-infrastructure/">Zero Trust architecture</a> has its fair share of enterprise applications. Strengthening a Zero Trust security posture can help you manage:</p>
 
 Remote workers: Even as employees return to office, hybrid setups are here to stay. Zero Trust provides distributed workforces the means to stay connected despite their distance and increase efficiency without cost to the user experience. 
 Machine identities: Machine identities are digital keys, secrets, and certificates that establish the validity of digital transactions. They’re important for secure communication between machines, such as servers, workstations, bots, applications, and more. According to Gartner research, devices and workloads are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erik-wahlstr%C3%B6m-98bba117_the-number-of-machines-workloads-and-devices-activity-6910611797771235328-Gast">outnumbering human users</a> by an “order of magnitude,” rendering it exceptionally difficult to manage these transactions. Implementing a Zero Trust model can help mitigate their associated risks through enhanced visibility and control across an increasingly vast array of machine identities. 
 Third-party vendors: Cloud providers are another entry point into your extended perimeter. They have access to data processed through their applications, which means a security breach on their end could cascade into a bigger problem on yours. Eliminating implicit trust ensures that even third-party vendors are vetted properly through strong authentication. 
 Shadow IT and BYOD: Employees may be accessing corporate resources from an unprotected personal device. Likewise, individual users or departments may install tools and apps without proper authorization. Zero Trust enhances visibility, allowing you to spot and mitigate these potential threats in real-time. 
 
 Applying Zero Trust principles to the cloud 
<p>It’s clear there’s much to gain by adopting a Zero Trust model. But how do you actually do it?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no such thing as a silver-bullet Zero Trust solution. However, there are several technologies and techniques that help you navigate the Zero Trust journey:</p>
 1. Certificate lifecycle management (CLM) 
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/05/the-critical-role-of-clm-for-zero-trust-today-and-pq-tomorrow/">Certificate lifecycle management</a> is essential to implementing Zero Trust at scale. Digital certificates are issued to people and devices so that organizations can verify their identities and authorize requests, whether it be to access the network or a specific corporate resource. Digital certificates are also used for strong encryption and access control. With so many certificates in use for so many purposes, CLM allows you to ensure no certificates go unmanaged, and enables you to enforce the principle of least privileged access.</p>
<p>There are three important steps in the certificate lifecycle:</p>
 
 Issuance, renewal, and revocation: Certificates can’t be forgotten about, or else you risk opening up a backdoor into your cloud environment. So, security teams must seamlessly manage their lifecycle from start to finish, renewing any that have been authenticated and revoking all that have not. 
 
 2. Key and Secrets Lifecycle Management 
<p>Keys and secrets underpin the security of cryptographic processes. Managing their complete lifecycle is critical for comprehensive security.</p>
 
 Key Lifecycle Management: Generate, deliver, and distribute cryptographic keys to a range of supported applications through multiple standard interfaces, including KMIP. Provide access control to keys and enable automated capabilities including key rotation, key expiration, and key revocation. 
 Secure Root of Trust: As a foundational element of Zero Trust’s data protection pillar, this enables FIPS-certified cryptographic key generation and lifecycle management with dual controls and separation of duties. 
 Decentralized Vault-Based Architecture: Distributed key storage ensures that keys and data are kept within the geographical areas where they are supposed to be maintained to facilitate compliance with geo-fencing and data sovereign regulations. 
 Centralized Compliance Management Dashboard: This process enables the documentation of keys and secrets based on templates for continuous compliance assessment using built-in or custom policies. 
 
 3. Identity and access management (IAM) 
<p>User identity is the heart of post-perimeter cybersecurity. A robust, feature-rich IAM portfolio is key to securing identities and keeping your most valuable assets protected from compromised credentials, phishing attacks, and other threat vectors. Essential capabilities include:</p>
 
 Strong authentication: Checking all requests against all possible data points ensures the user identity is verified without any risk signals falling through the cracks. An effective Zero Trust architecture will leverage both risk-based and adaptive authentication methods to provide high assurance and phishing-resistant verification.  
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA): MFA leverages numerous authenticators — tokens, facial recognition, mobile push notifications, and more — to ensure users are who they claim to be. However, not all MFA is the same, as some are vulnerable to bypass attacks. For high-assurance identities, organizations should use certificate-based passwordless authentication for both users and devices. 
 Passwordless security: Traditional usernames and passwords are prone to repetition and are much easier to crack when tied to personal information. Zero Trust advocates for passwordless security, which uses cryptographic keys to enable temporary access without burdening users or your IT department. 
 Single-sign-on (SSO): <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-single-sign-on">SSO</a> is an access management function that allows a user to login with a single set of credentials for multiple resources. With the right combination of cloud security tools, organizations can build a strong authentication foundation beneath this process, ensuring SSO can’t be taken advantage of for nefarious purposes. 
 
 Best practices for implementing Zero Trust 
<p>Now that you know why creating a Zero Trust cloud is important and the tools it takes to get there, let’s talk about the actual implementation process.</p>
<p>Be warned: It’s not happening overnight. The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/how-to-implement-zero-trust-a-comprehensive-guide/">Zero Trust journey</a> could turn out to be a multi-year endeavor, so it’s best to take a phased approach. You can implement the foundations early, but as an ongoing process, reaching Zero Trust maturity will require continuous effort.</p>
<p>Here is one approach to how you can start your journey to Zero Trust maturity:</p>
 
 Application and asset discovery: Before you can adequately secure your environments — in the cloud or otherwise — you need to identify everything within its reach. This step involves taking inventory of your most sensitive data, where it resides, and where it goes. Then, inventory your cryptographic assets, including all hardware, software, and credentials. 
 Map transaction flows: Understanding the relationship between cloud applications, systems, servers, networks, devices, users, and third-party cloud providers is important. This step helps you chart how data moves between these elements, how they interact with each other, and determine areas that need the most attention. 
 Architect boundaries: Once you’ve figured out where your most crucial assets are, you can isolate them with additional controls to prevent lateral movement. 
 Establish access control policies: Define context-based rules for how assets can be used, shared, manipulated, etc. A solid access management plan will explicitly outline permissions based on the principle of least privilege. 
 Monitoring and maintenance: You can’t set and forget cloud security. Even after you’ve built a robust Zero Trust framework, your security team must regularly monitor user activity for anomalous behavior. More importantly, it should search high and low for vulnerabilities before hackers have a chance to exploit them.

 Introduction 
<p>Have you ever considered how identity verification is handled? Do not look other than eKYC. The complexity of eKYC will be unlocked with this article. Join us as we dive deep into this cutting-edge area where security meets technology to learn how eKYC is changing the face of identity verification.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Adopt eKYC for Greater Efficiency: Implement eKYC to speed up customer onboarding, reduce fraud risk, and enhance user experience. Evaluate your current KYC processes and select an eKYC solution that suits your business needs. 
 Prioritize Data Privacy: Ensure your eKYC solution is robust regarding data privacy, incorporating secure data storage and encryption while adhering to relevant privacy regulations. 
 Invest in Training: Facilitate the transition from traditional KYC to eKYC with adequate staff training and clear, user-friendly guidance for customers to maximize the benefits of this digital transition. 
 
 What is eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer)? 
<p>Electronic Know Your Customer, or eKYC is a remote and digital technique used by companies to confirm the identity of their clients. This approach is a digital rendition of the conventional KYC process, which entails time-consuming paperwork and verification processes. With cutting-edge digital technology, like biometrics, facial recognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, eKYC offers a quick, effective, and user-friendly method for client verification procedures.</p>
<p>The fundamental essence of eKYC lies in its ability to mitigate risks associated with identity theft, fraudulent transactions, and other malicious activities. EKYC plays a pivotal role in financial crime and safeguarding businesses and their customers by swiftly authenticating customer identities.</p>
 Why are e-KYC important? 
<p>With the proliferation of online transactions, cybercrime has become more common; eKYC is a potent security precaution against this. It lets companies quickly confirm a customer’s identification, lessening the likelihood of identity fraud, theft, and illegal activities.</p>
<p>eKYC’s benefits to the customer experience extend well beyond its security benefits. It’s an efficient digital replacement for the cumbersome, time-consuming, paper-based KYC procedure. Customers like the simplicity of remote verification, while companies benefit from having fewer barriers to onboarding new customers.</p>
<p>The compliance function that eKYC provides is also essential. Companies must follow international laws designed to prevent and punish money laundering and the funding of terrorism. By providing a transparent audit trail of transactions, eKYC makes it easier for businesses to comply with regulations and lessens the likelihood of legal disputes.</p>
 What is the difference between eKYC and traditional KYC? 
<p>Traditional KYC procedures, although practical, have always been criticized for their time-consuming and tedious nature. The process usually involves the physical presence of customers, the manual submission of documents, and a long waiting period for verification. The advent of eKYC revolutionized this process.</p>
<p>eKYC introduces a digital, remote, and speedy alternative to traditional KYC. Leveraging digital channels, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, eKYC can validate a customer’s identity quickly and accurately without needing their physical presence. This digital approach eliminates geographical limitations, reduces operational costs, and significantly enhances the customer experience.</p>
 The Benefits of eKYC for Businesses and Customers 
<p>eKYC is a win-win for both businesses and customers. It translates into a faster, more efficient customer verification and process for businesses, leading to quicker customer onboarding and increased customer acquisition. It reduces the risk of human errors, ensures real-time compliance, and substantially reduces operational costs. The seamless verification process also instills trust and builds customer loyalty.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for customers, eKYC simplifies the otherwise lengthy verification and identification process further. It eliminates the need for physical paperwork and allows for remote verification, which is particularly beneficial in the current global scenario where digital interactions are preferred. eKYC also ensures enhanced security and data protection regulations, thereby less fraud risk and instilling greater trust in the business.</p>
 Types of eKYC 
 Biometric Verification 
<p>The biometric verification component of eKYC is important as it employs a person’s distinctive biological traits, such as fingerprints, iris or retinal patterns, and face features, to confirm their identification. This high degree of security is made feasible by the biometric data and characteristics’ near-impossible duplication.</p>
 Digital Identity Verification 
<p>Verifying a person’s digital electronic identification entails authenticating the digital information related to them. Email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and digital signatures are examples of id verification of electronic identity. Businesses may demonstrate the legitimacy of their clients in a non-intrusive way by authenticating their digital IDs.</p>
 Video-based Verification 
<p>In eKYC, video-based verification video identification is a developing trend. It uses recorded or live video calls to verify the customer’s identification. The client may be required to show their ID documents to the camera or respond to specific questions. Some companies use AI-based tools to examine video conversations for more precise identification document verification.</p>
 Document Verification 
<p>Verifying identity using physical documents is a critical component of eKYC. However, eKYC employs technology to scan and validate digital versions of official papers like passports, driver’s licenses, and national ID cards rather than physically reviewing paper counterparts. This speedier digital verification procedure eliminates the danger of losing or damaging physical documents.</p>
 The eKYC Process Explained 
<p>Understanding the process of eKYC is essential to appreciate its benefits and effectiveness fully. Here’s a simplified version of how the process generally works:</p>
 
 Customer Enrollment: The eKYC process begins when a customer initiates a relationship with a company, usually by filling out an online application form. This application includes basic information such as their full name, address, and contact information. 
 Document Submission: The customer must submit digital copies of their identification and proof of address. This could be a passport, driver’s license, or government-issued ID for identification, utility bills, or lease agreements for address proof. 
 Data Validation: Next, the eKYC system uses AI and machine learning algorithms to verify the authenticity of the submitted documents. It checks for inconsistencies, tampering, or false information. 
 Biometric Verification: In some cases, the system may require biometric verification, especially for high-risk transactions. This might involve facial recognition, iris scans, or fingerprint scanning, leveraging the individual’s unique physical characteristics for secure identification. 
 Customer Database: Once all the information is verified, the customer’s data is stored securely in the company’s database. This database can be accessed for future transactions, making the process quicker and more efficient for returning customers. 
 Continuous Monitoring: The eKYC process doesn’t end after the initial verification. Companies continue monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, leveraging AI and machine learning to identify potential red flags and fraudulent activities. 
 
<p>By making the process digital, eKYC reduces the time and resources required for customer verification, enhancing the customer experience while ensuring a secure transaction environment.</p>
 What are the documents required for e-KYC verification? 
<p>According to the specific rules and criteria of each nation, sector, or service provider, different papers are needed for e-KYC verification. They often include a certificate of identification and proof of residence. A government-issued ID card, passport, or driver’s license might be used as identification, while a utility bill, a bank account statement, or a lease agreement could be proof of speech.</p>
<p>It’s vital to remember that customers often must produce digital versions of these documents as part of the eKYC procedure. Some organizations could demand that the documents be verified electronically, notarized, or attested.</p>
 What Are the Limitations of Electronic Know Your Customer? 
<p>Although eKYC has many benefits, it also has certain drawbacks. The difficulty of protecting data privacy and security is one of the significant issues. Businesses must implement strong security measures to protect sensitive client data and stop data breaches.</p>
<p>Additionally, only some consumers are tech-savvy; other customers could find the digital procedure intimidating. Businesses must provide clear instructions and user-friendly interfaces for eKYC to be successful.</p>
 Challenges with eKYC 
<p>There are even more difficulties with eKYC in addition to the restrictions above. These concerns include the possibility of system mistakes, the high initial cost of eKYC technologies, and the need for ongoing updates to keep up with the development of technology and the danger from cyberspace.</p>
<p>Additionally, companies have to traverse intricate regulatory frameworks in several nations. Multinational corporations that do business across several countries may need help finding this.</p>
 How can eKYC Help Prevent Fraud and Identity Theft? 
<p>By a digital process for swiftly and precisely validating consumers’ identities, eKYC aids in the prevention of fraud and identity theft. It prevents identity theft by using hard-to-fool technology like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and biometrics, making it difficult for fraudsters to pass themselves off as others.</p>
<p>eKYC creates a digital trail that enables firms to track and look into shady activity. Additionally, real-time verification allows businesses to identify and stop fraudulent activities swiftly.</p>
 What are the Data Protection and Privacy Measures in Place for eKYC? 
<p>To prevent identity theft and safeguard client data, businesses use a variety of data protection laws, including <a>encryption</a>, secure data storage, electronic identity, and stringent access restrictions.</p>
<p>Most nations also have strict laws governing data privacy, requiring companies to get their clients’ permission before collecting and using their data and to alert them in case of a data breach. Data retention regulations, which specify how long businesses may keep consumer data on file and when to delete it, must also be followed by firms.</p>
 How Can Companies Implement eKYC? 
<p>Companies can implement eKYC by understanding the specific KYC regulations applicable to their industry and jurisdiction. Next, they can choose an eKYC solution that best fits their needs. This could be an in-house solution built from scratch or a third-party solution.</p>
<p>Implementing eKYC requires changes to existing processes, staff training, risk assessment, due diligence, and customer education. Companies also need to regularly review and update their eKYC processes to ensure they comply with evolving regulations and new services and are effective against new types of fraud.</p>
 Is eKYC Mandatory? 
<p>Whether eKYC is mandatory depends on each country’s regulations, regulatory requirements, and the specific industry. In some cases, businesses are required by law to conduct KYC procedures, and eKYC can be a more efficient way of fulfilling this requirement. However, companies can implement eKYC or stick with traditional KYC procedures in some countries or industries.</p>
 Who Can Use eKYC? 
<p>eKYC can be used by any business that is required to verify the identity of its customers. This includes banks, financial institutions, trust services, insurance companies, telecom companies, and online marketplaces. eKYC can also be used by government bodies for citizen services.</p>
 Future of eKYC 
<p>As technology advances and digital transactions become more commonplace, the role of eKYC in identity verification is set to grow. With AI, machine learning, and biometrics advancements, the eKYC customer identity verification processes will likely become even more secure and efficient.</p>
<p>At the same time, as data privacy becomes an increasing concern, businesses must ensure their eKYC verification processes are transparent and comply with data privacy regulations. We can also expect more standardization in eKYC regulations across different countries, making it easier for multinational businesses to implement eKYC.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>eKYC is reinventing identity verification by integrating innovative technology such as biometrics and artificial intelligence to provide companies and consumers with a safe and fast solution to validate identities. With speedier onboarding, lower fraud risks, and a more seamless experience, eKYC is positioned to play an important role in establishing trust and protecting identities in the future.</p>

<p>In this vlog, 1Kosmos VP of Product Marketing, Robert MacDonald, is joined by the VP of Solutions, Vikram Subramanian to discuss inserting identity into your SSO implementation.</p>
  
<p></p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Hi, everybody. Welcome to our vlog today. My name’s Robert MacDonald. I’m vice president of Product Marketing here at 1Kosmos, and I’m joined by Vikram today. Vikram, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Hey. Great. I’m doing great, Rob. Hello, everyone. Vikram Subramanian, vice president of Solutions at 1Kosmos, and really excited to be talking to you today.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
All right. Listen, it’s a pleasure having you. Today we’re going to talk about single sign-on implementations and inserting identity into an SSO implementation, like an Okta as an example. So Vik, let’s jump right into it. How do you view the balance between risk and convenience when it comes to single sign-on?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
This is a question that has been plaguing our industry for so long, right? I mean, obviously we all know, everyone’s talking about passwords are bad. And so what did we do? We just came up with another way of authenticating the user, which is put MFA in its place and you’re going to ask them to put a code in or have another device on the person or try and get something else out of them just to make sure, because the assurance that is there within the username and password is not there.</p>
<p>So what do we do? We also add on other risk factors. We evaluate 50 other things and 100 other things and all those signals, put them in together and then say, “Okay. With a reasonable amount of confidence, the user is who they say they are. Let them in the door.” Right? So that’s the state of SSO today, and this is where it actually brings up the conversation, really, what is the question that we are trying to answer with SSO, with authentication, with MFA? Are you really who you say you are? That is the question that needs answering. So we, I think, can help answer that question and add on to that experience with SSO.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Okay. Well, let’s talk a little bit more about that. So when you look at Okta or ForgeRock, Ping, whatever, how can organizations do more to protect themselves from cyber attacks? We talked about getting rid of passwords and MFA, right? Should they get rid of single sign-on platforms completely or is there something that they can do to try to augment, obviously keep the investment that they have but still become more secure as a net result? What is it that organizations could do?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Absolutely. I mean, think about it. The organizations have invested so much money in really integrating applications or migrating from their legacy solutions to solutions like Okta, Microsoft, ForgeRock, Ping, I mean, all of our partners in the industry. And there are tons of applications that are out there. For us to go in and then say, “You’re going to have to migrate to another solution,” is going to be extremely irresponsible, which is where we want to enhance that experience and really give the users the ability to prove their identity as part of that authentication channel.</p>
<p>So when the users want to go in, we have a multitude of ways where organizations can enhance the user experience. We’ve been talking about risk. We’ve been talking about passwords. We’ve been talking about anything that just from a pure security standpoint, something that is troubling a particular seesaw. But more and more users and more and more users have begun to expect the user experience out of even enterprise IAM solutions. They want the experience. They want the consumer-like experience. They want to get in, they want to do their work, they want to get out, and that’s it. Don’t bother me with all the 10 other factors that I have to list down. That is where I think we should be able to come in and really help our organizations there.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Okay. Well, listen, on that note, let’s be a little bit more poignant in terms of what we’re talking about here. What is it that 1Kosmos can do to help augment a platform like Okta? So you said that replacement’s not an option, and you’re right. I mean, there’s too much money already invested in all that stuff. What can we do to come in and stand alongside an Okta or another single sign-on provider and provide value? What is it that we can do?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
See, this is where the true meaning of identity would come into play and that’s where the 1Kosmos architecture of really saying an identity is a person comes into play for the authentication and the SSO experience or the authentication experience. So 1Kosmos, what we are able to insert into the equation of really answering the question, “Are you really who you say you are?” is biometric-based authentication and identity-based authentication.</p>
<p>So what is identity-based authentication? Let’s talk about that. So if I really need to go prove myself in the digital world, I am bringing out my government IDs, like my driver’s license, passport, any of those national IDs, and I’m able to execute a transaction in the physical world.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
That’s right.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Now, what if we just translated that to the digital world? That is exciting. So this is where the concept of the digital identity comes into play, and we are able to create a digital identity for a user by really taking a look at their government issued documents and then verifying them with the issuing authorities and creating a digital identity for the user.</p>
<p>Now, with this digital identity, now there are a lot of solutions that stop with just proofing, now this is where 1Kosmos makes it special, we are able to take this proofed identity or proofed document, create an identity for the user, and help them store that identity within the wallet. With this identity in the wallet, they’re able to execute transactions. This could be authentication transactions, this could be other transactions like approving a particular transfer or money transfer or anything like that. And really, our wallet is made to enable identity-based transactions, which include authentication.</p>
<p>So when a user comes in to a website and they want to prove who they say they are, they’re able to take their wallet and inject their identity into that authentication scenario and truly prove who they say they are by use of, number one, the government issued documents, and number two, by using biometrics. It’s not mandatory to use government issued documents, but biometrics makes it very easy for the user to go ahead and prove who they say they are. All of us are used to doing face ID with the iPhones today. Everyone wants to just look at something and, “Hey, you know who I am. I mean, you just see me. Then authenticate me.” So that’s what we are inserting into the equation. This is how we can compliment the experience that organizations have with Okta and other SSO solutions today.</p>
<p>Right. Now, Rob, you may want to ask, “Okay, what else can we do, right? There’s got to be more, Hey, does the user have to go through identity proofing every time?” Well, not really. They don’t have to go through identity proofing every time, which is why we have the concept of the wallet. And what also that we have is the ability to issue verifiable credentials. This is something that a bunch of companies are already investing in and we are already compliant with the W3C standards to issue verifiable credentials, to create a presentation, and also to go ahead and use that in a particular transaction. So now we’ll talk about verifiable credentials as a part of the roadmap for something that companies can consider, but very simplistically in today’s world, like I mentioned, we can insert identity into an authentication and we can do this at every layer that the user is interacting with a particular organization.</p>
<p>So let’s start, anything that is logical, which is their laptop. So if they want to go in and really log into that Windows system on the operating system, they’re able to do that. It doesn’t matter which version of Windows they’re on, we’re able to support a bunch of versions, which is true for many organizations that not all of them are upgraded and not all laptops are made the same, which is where we are able to digitize that authentication, include biometrics, and the users don’t need to remember their username and password. Then we are able to translate that onto the web and interact with the systems like Okta and ForgeRock and go ahead and insert identity into the equation. You can go ahead and take these signals that we can send or even take a look at what is the identity assurance level of the user then make a decision, do you really want to let them into your applications or not?</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Okay, that’s fair. So listen, that was a great explanation in terms of what users or what organizations can do to try… Or what we provide organizations to augment or improve the security of their single sign-on. Give me an example of what the experience looks like. So you did a very good job at explaining in terms of what happens, but talk about, well, how does it work, right? So you talked about logging into Windows. I’m assuming you can do it with Mac too. Obviously, there’s the single sign-on providers. And then I’m assuming, Vik, we work outside of just the single sign-on stuff. There are other areas that we can cover too. Just quickly talk about what that experience looks like from an authentication standpoint for the user when they come in the morning. What does that look like?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Oh, wow. Yes. We were talking about the user experience. Yes. So let’s remove ourselves from technology and really look at the experience. From an experience standpoint, what we bring to the table is something that all of us are used to when we go to restaurants today, which is to scan a QR code. So, user comes in and they’re opening up their laptops. They can be presented with a QR code, scan the QR code, authenticate using biometrics, show their face or… you know what? … with our LiveID. We’re the only solution in the market that brings a smile to people’s faces, right? The only security solution that does that, right? So smile, get in, get to work, right?</p>
<p>And that same experience is carried over onto the web. They can go scan a QR code and they are logged in. Or… you know what? … depending on the system they’re logged into, many other solutions can calculate the risk. Are you coming in from the same device? All of those things can come into play. And they’re not forced to log in when they log into web applications, right? So that is the experience that we can give to the user. The other thing that we can also do is we can also interface with the webcam, and all that you need to do is take a look and then you’re logged in. So those are all things that we bring to the table and enforce situations where your mobile phone is not allowed, you don’t have a webcam. What do you do? This is where our support for passkeys comes into play, right? People can utilize their passkeys, their synced passkeys, and go ahead and authenticate across the entire stack and move forward.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
So we do more than just the biometric, I guess. Well, I guess we do more than just a facial biometric is what you’re saying there. So we have other ways that users can authenticate, whether that be via an app, appless, FIDO, passkeys, all of those things are all built into the app is what you’re saying, and users can authenticate in any of those ways? Yes?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Yes, absolutely. Right. Like I mentioned already, you go to a restaurant, you scan a QR code, you get the menu. You go to your enterprise, you scan a QR code, you get a menu of options that you can choose from. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Very good. All right, Vik, thanks very much for coming in today and telling us a little bit about how organizations can inject identity into securing their single sign-on implementation. I look forward to talking to you again soon. And everybody that’s watching, please make sure to take a look at our data sheet. We’ve got a Single Sign-On Better Together With 1Kosmos data sheet that’s available on our website that you can get a little bit more information in terms of what we’re talking about today. Thanks again, Vik.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Thanks, Rob. Great being here.</p>

  <p>In a previous <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/apply-zero-trust-principles-to-authentication-session-management/ba-p/3615343">blog</a>, we introduced <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation">Continuous Access Evaluation</a> (CAE) - a product that brings Zero Trust principles to session management. Today we would like to discuss securing cross-tenant access with a focus on preventing data exfiltration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s impossible to imagine a successful modern organization that doesn’t collaborate with partners across organizational boundaries. While cross-company collaboration empowers employees and enables partnerships, it also lowers barriers for both accidental and malicious data exfiltration. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-overview">Microsoft Cross-Tenant Access Settings</a> is designed to address security of cross-company exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outbound and Inbound Cross-Tenant Access Settings offer fine grain security controls for cross-company collaboration using user’s home identity, while Tenant Restriction v2 (TRv2) can be used to prevent data exfiltration using foreign identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the hardest-to-prevent data leaks happen when users inside your organization use foreign identities to connect to external tenants. Let’s consider one such attack. A malicious insider creates a Microsoft Entra tenant. Then they authenticate to their malicious tenant from your organization’s device. Now the attacker can leak your files via email using the Exchange Online account of the malicious tenant. These types of attacks can be described as creating a “USB dongle in a cloud.” Regular security methods do not work against such attacks. Your tenant’s policies do not apply to external identities that attackers use. Blocking Microsoft Entra ID or Exchange Online URIs in the firewall would block your legitimate users along with the attacker. These types of attack need special defenses that TRv2 provides.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TRv2 works by sending special signals to Entra ID, Microsoft Account and other Microsoft resources. These signals point to Cross-Tenant Access Settings’ TRv2 policy that you created. Microsoft resources evaluate the policy and block unsanctioned access.&nbsp; We have two major flavors of TRv2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auth Plane TRv2 can block logins with external identities based on policy. To configure it you need to deploy a network proxy in your organization and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/tenant-restrictions-v2#step-4-set-up-tenant-restrictions-v2-on-your-corporate-proxy">configure that proxy to set TRv2 signals</a> on all traffic to Entra ID and Microsoft Account. In the above example of a malicious insider leaking data over external email, the attacker will not be able to login to their malicious tenant and therefore will not be able to send email. Auth Plane TRv2 is now generally available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Universal TRv2 as part of Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access">Entra Global Secure Access</a> goes one step further to protect against more sophisticated attacks where an attacker bypasses authentication by allowing anonymous access to the malicious tenant’s apps, such as anonymous meeting join in Teams. Or the attacker can import to your organizational device an access token lifted from a device in the malicious tenant. All these attack vectors bypass login to Entra ID. Since Universal TRv2 sends TRv2 signals on authentication plane (Entra ID and Microsoft Account) and data plane (Microsoft cloud applications), these attacks will be prevented. Universal TRv2 is currently in public preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have another flavor of TRv2 in public preview – TRv2 on Windows. It’s a partial solution that protects the authentication and data planes but only for some scenarios. It only works on managed Windows devices and does not protect .NET stack, Chrome, or Firefox. We have heard from customers that it is difficult to deploy and does not provide adequate security. The Windows solution was meant to provide temporary protection until Universal TRv2 is released and we’re planning to retire it after Universal TRv2 is generally available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts across our libraries.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p>SpruceKit is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit/SSI  TreeLDR  Provides access to Kepler and Rebase   <br>SSX <p><br></p><p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything) is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in Web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  Work is currently in progress to add support for signing in to services using <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">WebAuthn</a>. This will allow users to sign in and manage their SSX-based tools using their devices' Passkeys, as an alternative option to Ethereum wallets.   Sign-In with Ethereum <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  SIWE-py: We recently upgraded to pydantic 2.0 (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py/releases/tag/v2.3.0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">siwe-py@v2.3.0</a>) and improved typing, linting, and CI (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py/releases/tag/v2.4.0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">siwe-py@v2.4.0</a>)  We've updated the Discourse plugin to add support for ENS names (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth/pull/24?ref=blog.spruceid.com">discourse-siwe-auth#24</a>)   Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  Work is underway to add support for authorization tokens signed with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">WebAuthn</a>. This will allow users to access and manage Kepler orbits on any modern device using their Passkeys, as an alternative to an Ethereum account.   <br>DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  Major refactor: We are working on a major refactor to integrate with TreeLDR and improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized ID specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#508</a>). We are currently in the testing stage in order to improve the user experience prior to release.  New Library: We’ve created a new library for (de)serialization of Linked-Data types (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/linked-data-rs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">linked-data-rs</a>) that will help to define credentials.   Rebase   We are working to add session key-based issuance for all attestation-based credentials. This enables users who sign a SIWE message with an embedded ReCap delegation to not have to sign for the creation of these credentials, greatly improving UX for social media-style apps (<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-the-sprouts/">like the Sprouts</a>). The final credential includes the delegate key’s DID so that the creator can track what credentials were issued by a particular session, but includes no identifying information about what site was used to create the credential.   <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

 In 2022, the revenue generated from UK’s gambling industry reached an <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-kingdom/market-size/gambling-betting-activities/">eye-watering £14.7 billion</a>; an 18.1% increase on 2021. But what was the real&nbsp;cost? We explore how financial risk checks can help protect players, and prevent problem gambling. 



 



<p>Almost half (44%) of UK adults have gambled at least once this year, and there are approximately <a href="https://www.finder.com/uk/gambling-statistics">14 million active players gambling online</a>. This is a 78.4% increase on the number of active online gamblers (10 million) in April 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the vast majority of those who gamble do so recreationally, spending an average of just £2.70 per week, there are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-stakes-gambling-reform-for-the-digital-age/high-stakes-gambling-reform-for-the-digital-age">300,000 people</a> estimated to be engaged in problem gambling.&nbsp;In the recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK gambling white paper</a>, the UK government defined ‘problem gambling’ as “gambling to a degree which compromises, disrupts, or damages family, personal or recreational pursuits.” A further 1.8 million were considered gamblers at “elevated levels of risk.”</p>



 What is problem gambling? 



<p>When does gambling become a problem? What may be too much for one person may not be for the other. In this sense, isn’t problem gambling subjective? &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the UKGC, here are <a href="https://consult.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/author/remote-customer-interaction-consultation-and-call/supporting_documents/CI%20consultation%20call%20for%20evidence.pdf#page=18">some examples of “clearly unaffordable gambling”</a> from 2020.</p>



<p>“A customer lost £54,000 within a month of signup despite the operator not having established affordability for the customer. Shortly after joining, the customer’s account was suspended due to Safer Gambling concerns. When a successful call was made, the customer said they had “had a shocker over the weekend’ but were happy to lose £20K a month. The customer said they would be happy for the operator to set a deposit limit for them, but this was not done.”</p>



<p>UKGC case study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A customer lost £24,800 within three days. The operator had not carried out any affordability assessment for the customer.”</p>



<p>UKGC case study.</p>



 New approach to a growing problem. 



<p>Considering the dramatic increase in active online gamblers, and the startling numbers of problem gamblers, the UK government will, for the first time, mandate operators to conduct financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks) on customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, operators who fail to protect their customers run the risk of not only being complicit in the devastation to customers’ lives, but also liable to fines and irreparable brand damage. In fact, there was a total of <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gambling-companies-hit-with-105m-in-fines-after-crackdowns-by-global-regulators-9lfspx7b2">£44.6 million of fines issued by the UKGC in 2022</a>, which was a 76% rise from 2021. For example, in March 2022, <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/gbp9-4m-fine-for-online-operator-888">online operator 888 was fined £9.4 million</a> following social responsibility (also known as responsible gambling) and money laundering failings.</p>



<p>Failings included:</p>



  Not effectively identifying players at risk of harm because their policies determined financial checks should only be carried out after a customer had deposited £40,000.<br>  Not carrying out a customer interaction with a customer who had lost £37,000 in a six-week period during the pandemic.<br>  Giving an NHS worker earning £1,400 a month a monthly deposit cap of £1,300.<br>  And much more…&nbsp;  



 Responsibility vs risk. Is it worth it?&nbsp; 



<p>The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), which is largely responsible for organizing consultations and then implementing regulatory changes in the UK’s gambling market, is <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">currently investigating four areas</a>:</p>



  Remote game design;&nbsp;  



  Strengthening age verification;&nbsp;  



  Improving customer control over advertising;&nbsp;  



  Financial risk and financial vulnerability.  



<p>For more information on the UKGC’s plans, read <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">‘From policy to paper: What’s next for the UK’s gambling sector.’</a></p>



 What is an affordability check in gambling? 



<p>With the UKGC’s proposed changes, operators are now required to conduct financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks) to assess whether a customer’s gambling activity may be harmful to their financial circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the benefit of mandating financial risk checks is certainly plain to see, what constitutes risk; what the check involves; and who would be subjected to checks was not immediately clear from the UK government’s early materials and messaging. Similar criticisms of lack of clarity were levelled against its stats on problem gambling, which resulted in many media think pieces and articles with somewhat colourful interpretations of numbers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2023, the <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/featurednews/2023/08/14/ukgc-problem-gambling-stats/">UKGC condemned</a> what it saw as the misuse of statistics to push agendas and further arguments. Just one month later, in September 2023, Andrew Rhodes, Chief Executive of the UKGC felt compelled to release a video and in-depth blog to clear up <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/blog/post/your-questions-answered-on-the-financial-risk-checks-consultation">confusion and provide further clarity on the topic of financial risk checks.</a></p>

 What is a financial risk check? 



<p>The UKGC’s consultation is seeking feedback on two proposed forms of financial risk checks. The first is described as “light touch financial vulnerability checks using publicly available data.” The UKGC considers these unintrusive checks.&nbsp;The government and UKGC are proposing these checks be conducted at £125 net loss within a 30-day period, or £500 within a rolling-year period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that some larger gambling operators already perform this check, either at onboarding or during the customer journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second financial risk check is referred to as a financial risk assessment, which is considered a more detailed financial risk check. According to the aforementioned blog, these will be trigged “at unusually high loss levels where it seems proportionate to understand more about the potential risk of harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>These assessments will be from credit reference agency data and will&nbsp;kick in at losses of more than £1,000 within 24 hours, or £2,000 within 90 days. The consultation is also gathering feedback on the potential for lower triggers for those aged 18-24.</p>



 How will financial risk checks impact the player experience? 



<p>One of the major concerns for operators and players alike was how these checks would impact upon the player experience, and who exactly would be subjected to checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As clarified above, the checks would be proportionate and therefore only the high spending [and losing] customers would ever be impacted. According to the UK government and UKGC:</p>



  Light touch financial vulnerability checks to be carried out on 20% of accounts.<br>  Only 3% of accounts would undergo the more in-depth financial risk assessments. <br>  Just a tenth of that 3% (0.3% of account holders) would ever be asked to provide additional financial information. <br>  The rest (99.7%) would therefore be frictionless data checks.  



<p>Well, that clears that up, doesn’t it…&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the blog, the UKGC reassured operators that they would not mandate operators to implement checks at the above levels until they could be sure that they were being delivered frictionlessly.&nbsp;What constitutes an acceptable level of friction will, I imagine, be a topic for consultation…</p>



<p>The UKGC is proposing that a customer be subjected to a financial vulnerability check every 12 months. For the more in-depth financial risk assessment, it is proposing a period of every 6 months.</p>



 Why must gambling operators conduct a financial risk check? 



<p>Arguments against mandatory financial risk checks include the fact that customers aren’t subjected to similar checks when buying cars or clothes, so why should there be one for gambling. Addressing these comments, Andrew said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>While most people enjoy gambling and don’t experience harm, the Government has determined that gambling should be a regulated industry partly because of the harm that gambling products can cause.</p>Andrew Rhodes, Chief Executive at the UKGC.</blockquote>



 Will financial risk checks force players to black market gambling platforms? 



<p>As mentioned by our Roger Redfearn-Tyrzrk, our Director of Global Gambling and Sales at IDnow in a r<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-trends-2023/">ecent interview</a>, the dangers of using an unregulated, black-market platform far outweigh the positives.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>If you’re using a black-market operator, your winnings are totally in their hands. For example, if you hit a jackpot of €1 million, they don’t have to pay you out, because there is no consumer protection.</p> Roger Redfearn-Tyrzrk, Director of Global Gambling and Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Other concerns regarding black-market gambling platforms revolve around a higher propensity for fraud and other illegal activity. In addressing concerns that customers would simply just gamble elsewhere, thereby circumnavigating any checks or regulation, the UKGC said: “We will never accept the argument that because an illegal online option exists, this should mean that the regulated gambling sector should have lower, less fair or less safe standards. Britain is, and must continue to be, a world leader in providing consumers with a fair and safe gambling market.”</p>







 Why 6 financial risk check indicators are better than 2. 



<p>IDnow offers the most <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/affordability-financial-risk-checks/">comprehensive financial risk check in the industry</a>. Historically, identity verification providers have relied on just two indicators for affordability checks: geo-affordability and postcode data, but we utilize six distinct data checks to offer the most accurate and holistic assessment of a player’s affordability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how IDnow’s financial risk check solution works:</p>



 1. Geo-affordability. 



<p>The most commonly-used data set to conduct affordability checks, geo-affordability data enables you to understand regional spending patterns and potential financial risks associated with specific areas and players.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Application data. 



<p>According to the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/data/financial-lives-2022-early-survey-insights-vulnerability-financial-resilience">Financial Lives 2022 Survey</a>, 24% of UK adults have low ‘financial resilience,’ potentially making them unable to absorb financial shocks, such as losing their main source of household income for a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Application data aggregates information from 2.5 million of the most financially vulnerable consumers in the UK, approximately 750,000 financially stressed individuals reapplying for short-term high-cost loans every month, and 90,000 new loan enquires made each month. This data will help you identify financially stressed individuals by, for example, leveraging data from high-cost, short-term loan enquiries (payday loans).</p>



 3. Vulnerability data. 



<p>The FCA’s survey also found that 47% of adults display one or more characteristics of vulnerability. These data checks allow you to protect your players and understand their ability to gamble responsibly by leveraging the <a href="https://www.vulnerabilityregistrationservice.co.uk/">Vulnerability Registration Service</a>.</p>



 4. Mortality data. 



<p>In modern-day parlance, ‘ghosting’ refers to the disappearance of a suitor, who may not return texts, phone calls, or dating app messages. Rather less known is the ghosting that refers to stealing a person’s identity after they have passed away, and then using the data for financial gain, or, for example, signing up for a gambling platform. By plugging into mortality data, you can leverage data from 12 million deceased individuals (85% of all UK deaths), with 40,000 new records added each month to ensure your players are not using details from a deceased person.</p>



 5. Property data. 



<p>Although property data tends to be used predominantly by real estate agencies and real estate investors to predict trends, and monitor the market, it can also be used to gain insights into a player’s residential circumstances, from council tax band and housing type to property values, to better assess the affordability risk associated with a player.</p>



 6. Derogatory financial score. 



<p>With access to the derogatory financial score data, you can identify which players are likely to enter arrears and default credit agreements with a dynamic score that assesses the financial quality of a player.</p>



 



 

 



 Reduce risk. Prevent problem gambling. Play on. 



<p>Reduce friction and strengthen customer relationships by offering a fully automated financial risk check that promptly demonstrates concern and offers help to potentially vulnerable players – increasing customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow combines a powerful, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/affordability-financial-risk-checks/">holistic affordability check</a> with multi-dimensional identity verification and fraud prevention, enabling seamless gambling experiences anytime, anywhere. All from one platform, all in real time.&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Welcome back to Season 5 of the Let’s Talk about Digital Identity podcast. In this series opener I am joined by Drummond Reed and Andy Tobin, from Gen Digital, joining us to delve into vLEIs and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Oscar: Today, we are very happy to have two expert guests, Drummond and Andy. And today, we are going to discuss vLEIs and what is the connection with self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>First of all, we have Drummond Reed. He is Director of Trust Services at Gen, previously Avast after their acquisition of Evernym, where he was the Chief Trust Officer. He is co-author of the book Self-Sovereign Identity, published by Manning Publication in 2021. And he’s co-editor of the W3C Decentralised Identifiers, DID 1.0 Specification. At the Trust Over IP Foundation, Drummond is a member of the steering committee and co-chair of the Governance Stack Working Group and the Concepts and Terminology Working Group. At the Sovrin Foundation, he serves as a co- chair of the Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group for five years. Hello, Drummond.</p>
<p>Drummond Reed: Hello, Oscar. It’s very good to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome Drummond. Our second guest is Andy Tobin. Andy Tobin leads European and eIDAS strategy for Gen Digital’s Trust Services Business. He is one of the pioneers of self-sovereign identity and helped to establish Evernym, as a world leader in this field. He is a well-known public speaker and writer on the topic of digital identity and has delivered some of the largest SSI projects to date. His career has spanned the three rapidly converging sectors of identity, mobile, and payments. He has written code to control cash machines, built the world’s first mCommerce server, run a £1.2 billion mobile messaging network, and been the CTO for Europe’s first fully mobile bank. Hello, Andy.</p>
<p>Andy Tobin: Hi, Oscar. Nice to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome as well. I’m very happy to have both of you, Drummond and Andy.</p>
<p>So, let’s talk about digital identity, and as usual in this show we want to hear a bit more about our guests. So please, both of you tell us a bit about yourself and your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Drummond: Oh, the journey. I don’t think we have long enough in this podcast to cover the whole journey. Yes, I’ll just say, originally, I was very interested and focused on solving problems of what we’d now call decentralised data exchange, and how people can share data, sort of directly peer to peer over wide area networks, like the internet, when it was first getting going. And I had no idea that to do that you actually had to solve the problem of digital identity and trust. And so, working on that led me over into this area.</p>
<p>We didn’t even call it identity when first working on it, we just said, “Hey, there’s this challenge that you have to be able to establish a trust network.” And turned out that the problem there was identity. And doing that on a decentralised basis. And at that time, I was working on it was really centralised identity. Where you have an account with every different system you were interacting with. That was the norm, and it was – the pain was such that we had to have some solution to that. And so we thought it was federated identity, where you could take one account and reuse it in a whole bunch of other places. And in the end that’s what most people, encounter with social login. The login with Facebook, or Google or Twitter now X, whatever.</p>
<p>And so, we spent 15 years and three generations of standards developing a federated identity. And it seemed like we could get there and then it just – we hit the ceiling. It just – federated identity by putting an intermediary in there made it – you could solve certain problems, but you couldn’t solve others. And then blockchain came along and sort of taught us, “Oh, there’s a way to make this fully decentralised that actually simplifies things tremendously.” And so that era, I really, market starting in 2015, 2016 that’s when Evernym came together, which is where Andy and I met. And we’ve been working on decentralised ever since. Over to Andy to talk about his journey.</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah. Thanks, Drummond. I think the thing I like to look at most frequently, and that gets me most engaged is – seeing how megatrends that emerge affect existing businesses and capabilities. So, I’ve seen, for example, the digitisation of payments happening. And then digitisation of telephony happening and the emergence of mobile phones. And then the digitisation of commerce through the internet.</p>
<p>And with the digitalisation of identity, we’re seeing really something a little bit different, which is – we need to have the ability as people to identify ourselves or prove things about ourselves – it doesn’t need to be identity, it could be anything – without having to rely on anyone else to help us really to do that. So really, we’re looking at a return, if you like, to the world we used to inhabit where you could go along with a piece of paper and show it to someone, like a passport, for example, and say, “Hey, look, this is me.” We don’t have a digital way of doing that.</p>
<p>And so, there’s lots of, what I call, work around solutions in place and Drummond’s just talked about a bunch of them that fudge the problem. The problem is solved properly by giving people digital versions of the paper documents they’ve got and giving them to those people in a way that enhances their privacy and security online. And when you have that capability, you can apply equally to companies who find it very difficult to prove who they are online, and also to things as well.</p>
<p>And as we move into the next megatrend of artificial intelligence. Underpinning artificial intelligence is – how do you know who or what is at the other end. And as it gets much easier to fake everything, there’s going to be an explosion of trust issues. And if we can solve that with some of the techniques that we’re working on, which we can, artificial intelligence gets a lot less scary.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, through your life, I could see the reasons why this topic of self-sovereign entity had to happen. But just a few years ago it is getting, mainstream finally in these very recent years. And now we talk also about the future, there’s a lot, a lot of problems to solve still.</p>
<p>In this conversation, let’s go into much more specific topic related to self-sovereign identity. This is going to be about vLEIs. But to give a bit of concept, if one of you could throw a simple definition. What is an LEI?</p>
<p>Drummond: The LEI, that’s pretty straightforward. In fact, what’s ironic, is an LEI is really a classic, what we would call federated identifier, it fits into that second category. And that’s because – so it’s, to be very, very concrete, it’s a 20-digit identifier of a legal entity. And it’s important to clarify that term legal entity, because it can – in some legal jurisdictions, a legal entity is either a person or a corporation. They call it a legal person.</p>
<p>But what LEI means are – the legal entity in LEI means – a legal entity that’s not a person. So, anything that’s legal entity that’s not a person – a corporation, a partnership, government agencies, whatever it is, it’s to identify what we would generally call an organisation.</p>
<p>And so, the LEI is 20-digit identifier, and then it is issued. GLEIF, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, is a public-private partnership that operates the GLEIF LEI system. And they’re based in – it’s a Swiss nonprofit, it’s headquartered in Frankfurt. And they oversee I think it’s roughly in the mid-30s, the number of, they’re called Local Operating Units or LEI issuers around the world.</p>
<p>They have to be qualified, and when a business or organisation wants an LEI, they have to apply for it. They have to basically go through what we call identity proofing for individuals, but this for an organisation. You have to prove yes, you whoever supplying is a legal representative of that organisation. They have to provide their local business identifiers, like identifiers that they’ve registered like a corporation ID or a tax ID in one or more jurisdictions, and some other what they call reference data. And that entry, the reference data entry is then associated with the LEI. It’s all verified and then the LEI is issued. It’s good for a year. You have to renew it every year and it goes into a global database, a public database, anyone can check to verify the LEI for an organisation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very, very good explanation. And so, something that caught my attention, you mentioned that it’s still the federated model, right? So, which it is –</p>
<p>Drummond: Yes.</p>
<p>Andy: There’s a central body that is in charge of the governance of the whole LEI capability. And there are, as Drummond said, regional bodies that do the actual certification. But they’re all approved by the central body as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly.</p>
<p>Drummond: Right. So that makes it a federated identifier system, which is going to setup this wonderful conversation we have about how that fits into the SSI model.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So now let’s move to – what is vLEI?</p>
<p>Andy: So vLEI is a digital equivalent of an LEI, so Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier. Now, when I was contacted by Stephan Wolf, the Chief Exec of GLEIF years back now, six years ago probably. Who had been following this emergence of SSI very, very closely and thought there’s something in this. Because underpinning self-sovereign identity is a technology called verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>And verifiable credentials are packets of data, they can contain anything that can be passed from an issuer to a holder. So, an issuer, like an LEI issuance body, to a holder, like your company. And that holder can then present that data and it can be verified by a verifier, which could be a tax authority, a government and other company, instantly as being authentic and the integrity of the data is preserved. So that’s the technology underneath it.</p>
<p>And what Stephan wanted to know was – how these verifiable credentials could be used for LEIs. Because he could see the direction of travel, of the digitisation of identity documents and paper identity information. And he saw that if LEIs were digitised in a way that could be instantly verifiable, it could transform company onboarding for bank accounts, for example, supply chain management, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, we sat down and included also Karla and Stephan from GLEIF, I think it was in an office in Canary Wharf, and we designed the way the vLEIs would work.</p>
<p>We designed a cascading chain of authority that allowed a local LEI issuance body to be certified by GLEIF and have a credential themselves that says they are a certified LEI issuer. And they were then able to issue these vLEIs to companies. It’s essentially a very similar set of information, but a bit more detail in there, than in the LEI. But issue that as a verifiable credential to a company, and the company would keep that in a digital wallet that the company runs.</p>
<p>But enhanced on top of that is that then employees of that company could prove that they work for that company. And those employees could themselves have verifiable credentials saying, “I’m an employee of Gen, and Gen is this business with this vLEI. And you can check the vLEI is authentic, because it came from this vLEI issuer. And you can check the vLEI issue is authentic because it came from GLEIF.” So, you can run all the way back up the chain.</p>
<p>And then you can also add the ability to provide employees with – for example, confirmation they’re allowed to submit accounts to the tax authorities. So, it could be – “Andy Tobin, who’s a member of Gen is allowed to do X”. So, you end up with a cascading hierarchy, which is driven by the vLEI as the identifier for the company and then that being chained into lots of other relationships relating to that company and to the employees of that company.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how do the vLEI use the self-sovereign identity principles?</p>
<p>Drummond: OK so, as I mentioned earlier, the definition of a federated identity system is it has one or a relatively small group of organisations that almost – in fact, I’ve never heard of federated identity system with an individual that run it, they are always organisations or governments that run it at the centre. And then there, it’s federated around them. So, for instance, when we we’re using social login, it’s Google, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, they’re the – called the identity providers. You have an account there, and then you go use it in other places.</p>
<p>And so, the GLEIF LEI system, as we said earlier, it’s a federated identifier system. GLEIF is at the centre, they authorise a set of the LEI issuers around the world, and they issue the LEIs. And that’s how you can sort of trust the whole thing. So, some folks look at that and say, “Ah, well, that’s a federated identifier system, how is this self-sovereign?”</p>
<p>So, with self-sovereign identity, as Andy said, it’s all about the entity that is being identified that needs to prove their identity to anyone else. Having a digital wallet, and a set of credentials they can use to prove their identity.</p>
<p>What GLEIF did with the vLEI was say – Hey, we are a federated identifier system. But we can provide verifiable credentials as one issuer, one hierarchy of issuers to organisations around the world, any place that can in turn, as Andy explained, then issue the next credential in the chain to their employees, or their contractors or their alumni or anything to prove their relationship with the legal entity that then can prove its relationship to the issuer and all the way up to GLEIF.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, what Stephan Wolf and Karla McKenna and the GLEIF team saw was, we can take a federated identifier system, and actually bring it into the world of self-sovereign identity credentials, digital credentials, from hundreds, thousands, to maybe eventually, millions of different issuers, that all serve as what we call Root of Trust, right? And, yes, GLEIF is one Root of Trust, and the whole GLEIF, what we call digital trust ecosystem, it may end up being one of the largest in the world. And it’s very important, I think, to note that it is adjacent to – it doesn’t replace government issued identifiers to organisations, but it’s adjacent to it, and it’s worldwide.</p>
<p>It is – the G is global. So, you can get an LEI and any entity in the world, any legal government or other entity can recognise it, and then translate it to the local identifiers that it might need. But that credential, once it’s issued into a digital wallet, is just like any other credential in that digital wallet. It can be used for that entity, in this case, an organisation, to prove its legal identity any place that’s needed. That is exactly what self-sovereign identity is about.</p>
<p>Andy: And I think it’s really worthwhile here describing the incentive. So why is this interesting, right? Why is a vLEI interesting? And at the moment, it’s very, very difficult for a company to prove that it’s a legitimate company and it has a bunch of certifications, it’s got the right ecological credentials, it’s got the right qualifications in place to operate as a company in the business it does. And that causes huge problems for supply chains.</p>
<p>As an example, I was talking to some very large pharmaceutical companies, we call them big pharma in Switzerland about this very problem. And they spend millions and millions and millions and millions of Swiss Francs trying to work out who is in their supply chain. And they kicked off something called Pharma Ledger, which was an initiative to use this concept of digital identity for companies and the qualifications and certifications they have, to allow an onboarding of a new supplier in a few seconds rather than weeks and weeks and months.</p>
<p>And the same thing with banking, it’s very, very difficult for a company to get a bank account. You’ve got to supply lots of pieces of paper, you got to send them in, they’re going to be notarised and signed by somebody. It’s horrendously complex, and very, very slow and very costly. So, the dream here is instantaneous, you know, a few seconds verification that a company is legitimate, and the person acting for that company is legitimate. And the potential savings are in the billions and billions and billions of dollars worldwide. So that’s why people are interested in it. And I think people get a bit hung up on the tech under the skin. And this term, self-sovereign identity, which I kind of wish we’d never promoted in a way because it’s about…</p>
<p>Oscar: Scary.</p>
<p>Andy: … the credentials under the skin, rather than yeah.</p>
<p>So, this ability for an organisation to have verifiable data about itself digitally, which anyone can check is authentic. Without that company having to go back to GLEIF and say, “Hey, please give me a new version of this that I can use today.” That’s the sort of self-sovereign, the company has this information, they can use it wherever and whenever they want, for whatever reason they want. And the verifier can, or the recipient can check it’s authentic, instantaneously. Even if GLEIF cease to exist, you could still do that.</p>
<p>So that’s the big picture here. And the vLEIs are one aspect, but a very important aspect of this new digital ecosystem for organisations. There’s an anchoring credential that says this company is this company. In some jurisdictions, you legally have to have an LEI – vLEI makes things a lot easier. So, it’s the anchoring credential that says this company is this company, and then you can hang lots of other verifiable credentials on the back of it as well.</p>
<p>Drummond: I want to make that point that Andy just did. So, the LEI, because of its cross jurisdictional characteristics is legally required in certain jurisdictions for certain kinds of transactions. For instance, in Canada, if you’re involved in the financial services industry, you have to have an LEI. The regulators, and GLEIF has a board of I think it’s roughly 72-75 regulators from around the world. It’s called the ROC, the Regulatory Oversight Committee. Those regulators are now – the next step is to start to mandate the vLEI. Because the regulator is saying, “Hey, it’s really expensive for us to have to, verify, audit companies and the records and everything when we have to manually process papers.” So, they’re basically saying you must do these things digitally. The Securities and Exchange Commission here in the United States requires electronic submission of reports.</p>
<p>So, the emergence of the vLEI as a credential, for example, digitally signing those submissions to regulatory authorities is starting to be mandated by regulators. And I expect it’s just going to grow and grow and grow. And so, in certain places, organisations, as part of their formation and maintenance they’re going to get maintained vLEIs in order to be – handle their regulatory documents. At a minimum of this many other uses.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, you explained very interesting cases, problems that are being solved by this concept. And also, when you put it in numbers, it also sounds very convincing. Indeed, to understand a bit more what is – how does it work in practice, I think you have explained pretty well.</p>
<p>But let’s say, if I want to visualise, ‘so what is the vLEI?’ So vLEI is – will be registered in an app? So where can I see if my company has registered a vLEI, where can I see it? </p>
<p>Andy: Yeah. So, vLEI, we need to introduce here the concept of an organisational wallet. So, you’ll be familiar with digital wallets that you might have on your phone at the moment as a person, so an Apple wallet and a Google Wallet. Gen has launched its own digital wallet called MyD and there are others that are being launched as well.</p>
<p>So digital wallets are going to be huge. And there’s going to be a big fight about who’s going to have the best digital wallet. And a digital wallet is a container that you put these verifiable credentials in. And in the case of you, as a person, that might be a digital version of your passport. In Europe, it might be the new personal identity data credential from eIDAS. They could be a driving license, a boarding pass, et cetera.</p>
<p>Imagine the same thing for a company, rather than sitting on a phone, it’s going to reside probably in a server somewhere. I guess it could sit on a phone. But it’s the same concept. It’s a secure container that will hold a company’s credentials, including a vLEI. And that’s just like your own wallet, you control that wallet yourself, and you have a fingerprint or something else.</p>
<p>Access to the organisational wallet will be most likely controlled by a number of people who have credentials that they can use, that will prove that they work for that company, and they have the right to access and execute transactions from that wallet. So, you can see the way the personal credentials and organisational credentials come together. And a vLEI will sit in an organisational wallet, it could manifest in many different ways. It could be embedded in the enterprise planning software that that company has. It could be in a cloud-based software facility that company is using, well, names like SAP workspace, that kind of thing might do something like that. I don’t know if they have or not, but it would be logical for them to do so.</p>
<p>So that’s how the vLEI would manifest. And it would be used when a business transaction requires the company to prove something, prove who they are, prove their legitimate organisation. And a lot of those interactions at the moment are handled fairly manually, something will pop up into somebody’s queue. And then they will have to go off and do something and then they’ll go in and fax some document that they’ve had signed by some notary or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>In this new world, all that gets digitised and happens in milliseconds. So, requests will come in digitally saying, “Hey company, please prove who you are.” The organisational wallet will respond back immediately saying, “Here’s my vLEI. You can go verify it.” And that will be verified instantly. So, the business process improvement you get from this, this is what this all comes down to is optimising and digitising business processes that so far had been too expensive or complex to optimise. There’s been no good way of doing it. vLEIs are the key enabler that helps you to get those digitised business processes working.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. The concept of organisational wallets I think it’s something that yeah, it’s – well, it’s new in this equation of the LEIs as compared to how we see it today.</p>
<p>You have already explained some examples of some industries in which vLEI will help tremendously. But if I ask you what are the top industries or sectors that will benefit the most, which one would be?</p>
<p>Drummond: I’ll start out with one of – what has become one of my very favourite examples. And I’m going to do that by reading you some texts that I have recently received. The first one is, “Hello, are you the dentist that Candy introduced me to? When do you have time?” The next one is, “Your Amazon – spelled with a little accent in it – your Amazon has been locked. Click here to fix all your bills”. My Netflix subscription is on hold. I have to renew that one. And then “Hi, it’s Hillary, can you join me for lunch as you promised?” OK? I get – I don’t know about anyone else. I’m getting several of these a day now.</p>
<p>It’s called smishing. Right? It’s SMS phishing. They’re just trying to get me to respond, to click a link, to do whatever. So, once you know spam and phishing attempts have moved into our phones. And of course, they’re also, they’re hitting me now on iMessage, on WhatsApp. We’re getting to a level where yeah, we’ve learned to live with spam in email. But when it starts hitting our phones and our most intimate ways of communicating, it’s not just a pain. All right, a lot of money is lost that way, and it erodes confidence in our most important communications infrastructure.</p>
<p>So, my personal favourite use of LEIs, vLEIs – well both actually. Because if we’ve never said it, we want to make it clear, the vLEI credential contains the LEI as one of the pieces of the data in it. So that’s how it all ties together. It is going to be used for signed, digitally signed text messages. Initially it will be used by the telcos themselves that deliver that message. They will do the filtering out of the spam because they will be able to basically differentiate and say, “Oh, this is a digitally signed message from a legitimate company, and we can deliver that.” Give it the green light to the consumer and anything else is going to be suspect.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that suddenly you’re going to stop getting any smishing attempts. But it’s going to introduce a fundamental solution that over time will, I think, essentially stamp out that industry. And this is not theoretical, there are several companies working on putting this in place. I think it’s going to start going operational in 2024. So that’s one example.</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah, I think I’d add in any regulated industry, banking, particularly, especially corporate banking, where you need to know who the corporation is, and there’s so many rules, they are coming in about identifying which corporate you’re dealing with. This was one of the main use cases when we were designing vLEIs in the first place with GLEIF, which was if you’ve got a corporation, you need to find the ultimate beneficial owner of that corporation in order to give that corporation a bank account.</p>
<p>If that corporation has a bunch of shareholders and those shareholders of other corporations and those, some of those corporations have shareholders at the other corporations. You get an exponentially worsening problem of trying to work out who everybody is, because they all have to provide information about who they are and who their shareholders are.</p>
<p>And this is the case with Evernym when we set little Evernym in the UK in 2017, I needed to get a bank account. And to get that bank and I had to prove who Evernym UK was and the ultimate beneficial owner of Evernym UK was Evernym, Inc. in the US. And Evernym, Inc. had a bunch of shareholders. And I then had to prove who all those shareholders were. And this involved getting the largest shareholders over 10% to provide documentation about who they were and notarised certificates and so on and so on. And the ones that were corporates then had to give me their shareholders. And I think, eight months to get their bank account setup, which is insane. So, you can imagine the potential benefits there.</p>
<p>I’d also point as well to the European eIDAS program. Which is the eIDAS 2.0 it’s the next evolution of the European digital identity scheme. There’s a consortia and there are four consortia working on large scale pilots now. One of them that Gen is in called EWC has two use cases for people, which is travel and payments, and a use case for organisational identity as well. And that’s been championed by the governments of Sweden and Finland. And has got a lot of traction now, because the same technology that is being used for credentials, for people and personal wallets can be used for organisations as well.</p>
<p>So, I see a lot of potential for vLEIs and other organisational credentials, like VAT number and tax identity and Companies House type information. To be provided digitally in that way to transform business processes with corporate to corporate. But also in our human use cases with people. If I’m using my eIDAS wallet to book travel, the vLEI or organisational credential will allow me to check the travel agency I’m booking it with is legitimate. And if they’re ABTA based and certified and are they the right company, all of the problems that Drummond outlined, these scammers pretending to be companies, those will go away because I’ll be able to instantly verify if a company is authentic or not.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, you have listed at least three very important sectors, industries, in which it’s very clear the benefit that will come. We know that vLEIs are available now, you have explained pretty well the cases, how they can help to solve these problems. When do you estimate that the full benefits will be realised? So, we are still in 2023, what we say it’s a time in which, OK, it is a massive impact the vLEI have done.</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah, it’s good question actually. I think in Europe with the eIDAS program running, I think that’s going to be a big catalyst. And we’ll see how that evolves, these large-scale pilots are going to run for two years. And the actual eIDAS regulation when it comes into place, the governments of the EU will have two years to implement it and get wallets issued.</p>
<p>I think we need to look back at the incentives and companies move quickly when the incentives are big enough. So, there’ll be a number of market proving pilots that happen and the output that comes from those will say, “Hey, this is actually real. It really works. And here’s how much you can save.” When the suppliers of software, that businesses used to run their operations start embedding vLEIs into their businesses just like email, or just like, you know, web pages. It’s going to be completely transformational at that point.</p>
<p>Drummond: Exactly. It really depends on the industry and the use case. I compare the adoption of SSI digital wallets and credentials, there’s a precedent, the adoption of the web, right? It won’t happen everywhere all at once. OK, that’s not how these things ever happen. Right? It’ll be particular, just like you had certain websites, it started out with physics websites, right? And then authors got involved and said, “Hey, this is a great way to publish.” And eventually we had blogs and things like that. And then pretty soon the web is pervasive.</p>
<p>We’re working the same way. There are pockets, as we said that, you know, like the smishing problem.&nbsp; I think one of the important things to keep an eye on is governments are, you know, they’ve inherently been in the identity industry. They always are, because they’re foundational issuers of identity. And some governments, forward leaning governments that have gone straight, or are seeing the benefits have already moved into. One of the ones I’m closest to here in Seattle, is the province of British Columbia in Canada, which already has a digital wallet that’s all based on open-source code that’s in market and they’re starting to issue credentials to British Columbia citizens. And they’re already using vLEIs for organisations.</p>
<p>Another of my most favourite example is the small but very influential country of Bhutan, which has basically said they just adopted a National Digital Identity Act, implementing or mandating a self-sovereign identity infrastructure for the whole country. And that will require LEIs for every legal entity that is signed up and going to be part of that SSI ecosystem. Every organisation, every bank, travel agency, grocery store, it doesn’t matter, if you’re in the Bhutan SSI ecosystem, as an organisation, you sign up and have to get an LEI and a vLEI to participate in that. So that’s the kind of thing that can really generate large adoption.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, yes, super interesting discussion about vLEIs and the state of the self-sovereign entity. I’ll ask you a final question for both of you. For all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Andy: I think that one would be to get up to speed on vLEIs and verifiable credentials, generally. Not to worry too much about the technology under the skin and keys and encryption and DIDs and so on. But to understand the business implications of digitising processes that they haven’t been able to digitise so far, and the benefits to them of doing that.</p>
<p>There’s a significant competitive advantage to a business, to digitise processes that a vLEI will enable you to do. And the companies that do that soonest, or a bank, for example, if a bank can onboard a corporate customer in 10 seconds, instead of 10 months, they’re going to have a massive, massive advantage competitively against the other banks in the market. So that’s where the prize is. So, they need to understand the implications.</p>
<p>And generally, I think, what would be the word, get into the program. That’s probably not the right way of saying it, but it’s about understanding what is coming down the line. And if they don’t move fast, then somebody else will out compete them very, very quickly. It’s a bit like the early days of the web, get online, get digitised and if you’re not, you’re not in the game.</p>
<p>Drummond: Yeah, I think we clearly saw with the web, those companies that got a website early and started to have a digital presence, they significantly expanded. In some cases, they completely dominated new industries, because they went fast.</p>
<p>I’m going to provide a very, very concrete step. If your organisation doesn’t have an LEI today, just a regular LEI, just go check out the GLEIF website. You’re going to find very easily how you can get one and go through that process. It doesn’t necessarily take very long, but it will educate you about that. And then ask your LEI issuer, whoever you choose, “Are you issuing vLEIs? When will you be issuing it? Educate me about that.” And you know, just start to climb the path.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, very actionable. Thank you very much, both Drummond and Andrew. It was a fascinating conversation with such experts in this topic. So finally, tell us if someone would like to follow you or continue this conversation with you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Drummond: For me, yeah, @drummondreed on X. It’s the first time I’ve ever had to say that on a podcast, and it just doesn’t sound like the same.</p>
<p>Andy: Does that still exist?</p>
<p>Drummond: Yeah, I’m really seriously worried about it. I, you know, I’m finding it degrading and I’m not sure how much longer I’m going to use it. Or Drummond.Reed@GenDigital.com. You can contact me via email too.</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah. And I’m Andrew.Tobin@GenDigital.com.</p>
<p>Oscar: And are you at X, formerly known as Twitter?</p>
<p>Andy: I am but I’m broadcast only because it’s just too much hard work. LinkedIn is kind of interesting. You can find me on LinkedIn as well. I write on the topic of digital identity and verifiable credentials and eIDAS quite frequently and I know Drummond does as well.</p>
<p>Drummond: Yeah, yeah, we do. And I’m more and more paying attention to LinkedIn that way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Again, thank you very much for this conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Andy: Thanks, Oscar.</p>
<p>Drummond: Thank you, Oscar. You bet.</p>

 Metadium Version 0.10.0.testnet Upgrade <p>Dear Metadium Community,</p><p>The Bokbunja hard fork and Metadium Version m0.10.0.testnet upgrade will be implemented in the testnet. We are pleased to unveil the intricate details and enhancements they will bring to the Metadium network this&nbsp;time.</p> Testnet Hard&nbsp;Fork   Expected date of implementation: 2023–09–26 12pm KST (2023–09–26 03:00:00&nbsp;+UTC)  Block number: #44671396   Details   m0.10.0.testnet: to apply Bokbunja hardfork to METADIUM&nbsp;TESTNET  Please note that this update is ONLY MANDATORY for Gmet TESTNET&nbsp;nodes.  This release enables the Bokbunja hardfork in fixed block #44671396 on the METADIUM&nbsp;TESTNET.  The expected date for this transition is 2023–09–26 03:00:00&nbsp;+UTC.  Gmet m.0.10.0.testnet is a scheduled feature release containing several significant improvements and new features to METADIUM&nbsp;TESTNET:   1. The Bokbunja hard fork will be implemented at block #44671396 on the Metadium&nbsp;testnet.   Introduction of a fee delegation function and related RPC API, allowing users to delegate transaction fees to another&nbsp;account.  To verify the block miner’s signature, the verification nodes use the miner’s public key registered in the governance contract.  To decentralize mining, the miner selection strategy has been changed to use etcd lockable&nbsp;tokens.   2. New features added to&nbsp;Gmet.   Implementation of Verifiable Random Function (VRF) verification functionalities through pre-compiled contracts, offering a more secure and transparent method of generating random numbers on the blockchain.  Added ‘eth_getReceiptsByHash’ JSON-RPC API. Returns all the transaction receipts for the given block&nbsp;hash.  Added to Gmet CLI flags to allow changing the value of ‘triesInMemory’  Changed to create blocks by sorting transactions in descending order of gas&nbsp;price  Increased the default value of ‘TxLookupLimit’ flag from 2350000 to&nbsp;31536000  Ethereum Ploitari release(v1.10.17) was&nbsp;applied  Ethereum Sharblu release(v1.10.18) was&nbsp;applied  Block interval is fixed to 2&nbsp;seconds.  Network members can make more types of decisions through improved governance contracts.   3. Other bugfix and&nbsp;upgrades   Improved gmet.sh&nbsp;script  Improved performance using go&nbsp;routines  Upgraded etcd library version&nbsp;(v3.5.2)  Changed websocket default&nbsp;port  Changed the OS version used for ‘docker-build’ to Ubuntu&nbsp;20.04  Upgraded golangci-lint library version&nbsp;(v1.49)  Changed the ‘Fee’ data type of `ExecutionResult,` which receives EVM execution results, to BigInt to prevent overflow.  To prevent integer overflow, some variables have been changed to&nbsp;BigInt.  Fixed issue related to ‘make&nbsp;test’  Fixed issue with coinbase&nbsp;setup  <p>Metadium looks forward to ushering in a new era of efficiency, security, and growth within the ecosystem, solidifying its position as a pioneer in the blockchain industry.</p><p>- Metadium&nbsp;Team</p><p>안녕하세요, 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>복분자 하드포크(Bokbunja Hard Fork) 및 Metadium Version m0.10.0.testnet 업그레이드가 Testnet에 적용될 예정입니다. 메타디움 네트워크에 반영될 업그레이드 세부사항을&nbsp;공개합니다.</p> Testnet Hard&nbsp;Fork   일정: 2023년 9월 26일 오후 12시 KST 예정 (2023–09–26 03:00:00&nbsp;+UTC)  블록 넘버: #44671396   세부사항   m0.10.0.testnet: METADIUM TESTNET에 복분자 하드포크를&nbsp;적용합니다.  해당 업데이트는 Gmet TESTNET 노드에만 필수적으로&nbsp;적용됩니다.  이 릴리즈는 METADIUM TESTNET의 고정된 블록 #44671396에서 복분자 하드포크를&nbsp;활성화합니다.  예상 일자는 2023년 09월 26일 03:00:00 +UTC&nbsp;입니다.

<p>In her CoD Summit 2023 presentation, Fission co-founder and CTO Brooklyn Zelenka discusses the need for location-independent compute, and how content addressing and open protocols are making it possible.</p> We're Living in a Server-Centric World <p>Since the invention of the LAMP stack in the '90s, we've been working with a server-centric model. It has led to developers specializing in front-end, back-end, DevOps, Kubernetes, Docker, and more. &nbsp;Over the years, it has become more difficult to train and maintain this complex system.</p><p>Amazon, Microsoft, and Google control the majority of data centers, which has led to further centralization. In places like South America, Central America, and Africa, the lack of compute infrastructure means that users in these areas have less access to resources.</p><p>IoT, compute over data, and LLMs cannot work long-term if we keep sending data to a small number of data centers. It's an overwhelming, massive amount of data. &nbsp;</p><p>We have to bring compute to where the data is produced, closer to the user.</p> Building a New Compute Stack <p>We know we need location-independent compute and data, but to do this in production, you first need location-independent auth.</p><p>A capability-based model like <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-ucan-decentralize-auth/">UCAN</a> removes the authorization server, simplifying permissions handling. We no longer need pristine APIs for everything and can pass around auth as necessary.</p><p>The direction and the layout of the requests become the flow of authority.</p><p>Not only is it more efficient and energy-saving, but it's also more resilient because there is no central server that can bring the rest of the network down if it goes offline.</p><p>Now that auth is handled, we can solve for location-independent compute.</p><p>We started with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> because you can write in any language you want, and it runs anywhere and deterministically. </p><p>When running a computation, we take arguments and apply them to a Wasm function. This outputs a <a href="https://proto.school/content-addressing/04">CID</a> or content identifier. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. </p><p>This means we can compute over that content-addressed data without needing a centralized server! &nbsp;</p><p>We can roll all of this and a scheduler up into a task and run it, and when it executes, it returns a receipt. The receipt includes pure values (EX: 1 + 1 = 2), effects (something you want to happen next that needs to take resources off the network, like sending an email), and metadata.</p> Input Addressing <p>With content addressing, we take data, hash it, and use that data as the key value. </p><p>Here, we're introducing input addressing, where we get a receipt as the value, and the input is the hash of the instruction (the description of what you want to have run).</p><p>Instead of validating with a hash, we validate with a receipt, making it fully deterministic!</p><p>Finally, we use an invocation (a signature) and build a workflow (by authorizing multiple computation requests at once). </p> Benefits of Wasm Compute   The distributed runtime can decide the most efficient way to run tasks in the network by handling the matchmaking for the user.  The more returned receipts, the fewer computations we'll need to run. We can skip steps and reuse receipts because they've been deterministically run already. &nbsp;  If the system crashes, you can always pick up where you left off by following the CID trail.  Reverse lookup allows the user to check if a certain input ID has been entered. If it has, they can retrieve the computed result without running the task again. This is especially helpful when running AI language models over the same data or cryptographic operations.

 What is Open-World Compute? <p>Serverless computing has been promised as the next big thing™ in computing. There are many advantages: not needing to build and manage complex backend code, and granular billing per invocation means that you only pay for what you use. Many of these systems have adopted workflow systems (e.g., AWS Step Functions, GitHub Actions) on top of batch requests. Unfortunately, the systems to date have serious limitations: they’re locked into cumbersome proprietary APIs, have a finite number of integrations, and often don’t handle partial failure elegantly (e.g., can leave a database in an inconsistent state if something goes wrong in another step). Furthermore, many of the compute offerings today lock developers into an ecosystem, making it difficult to switch to other solutions in the future.</p><p>A more principled generation of workflow systems has developed to address some of these problems. They typically depend on the developer writing their code “correctly” and not doing things that make their code repeat work on multiple calls. This doesn’t play well with many common functionalities: what about when developers want to access time or random numbers? They also often don’t handle rollback out of the box. In short: they’re closed systems that depend on the programmer working hard to ensure that abstract properties are respected. This is a real problem: networks can (and do!) fail. Developers write buggy code (we all do it). It’s an extremely high bar.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, brings content-addressed computation to IPFS using Wasm, PKI, and capabilities. IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability. </p><p>IPVM (and Homestar) takes a different approach. Instead of depending on the developer to be careful, it restricts their programming environment. For example, WebAssembly (Wasm) can be limited to deterministic computation: any code that you compile to Wasm has to have these properties that we want by definition. IPVM also acknowledges that failure happens and pulls from recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-m-b-r-o-s-i-a-providing-performant-virtual-resiliency-for-distributed-applications/">research</a> about hiding that as much as possible by leveraging content addressing and Wasm.</p><p>Fission's vision for open-world compute is highly usable and collaborative. We want an open, multitier system that runs everywhere, connects all the world's users and services, and is substantially better than Web 2.0. Anyone will be able to broadcast a task type on the network, and it will be automatically usable without having to fork the project or ask permission.</p> Key Characteristics <p>There are several key characteristics we're considering as we build IPVM. As mentioned earlier, idempotence and determinism are key to reliable computing, but they can be challenging to understand and implement. </p><p>Wasm allows developers to bring their own language, run computations on a server, in their browser, or even on their phone, and run them in a deterministic environment so that the same inputs always produce the same outputs. </p><p>Furthermore, when we run computations with CIDs, the results output more CIDs. The CIDs do not get recomputed and reproduced each time we run them - they are essentially cached in IPFS. When someone applies that same input, it simply calls back that cached result. No new records are being created, making it idempotent. This comes for free on Merklized data, but we can also Merklize data that's read from anywhere and cache it for later use. </p><p>While pure computation is useful for many applications, you still need mutability in many cases. There are queries (reads) and pure computations, and these can go back and forth as long as we end with mutation. Because we are not giving users the ability to define the order of execution, we can reorder computation so that the mutations happen at the end.</p><p>If we bring these three properties together - determinism, idempotency, and purity, we can achieve virtual resiliency. This gives the developer peace of mind, knowing that, eventually, the computations will work no matter what crashes or curveballs are thrown at the system.</p><p>We also want replayability. The cached computations, or receipts, never have to be re-run. And when we need to make non-deterministic requests or work with time of day or random, instead of losing out on the guarantees of deterministic compute and having to use client libraries, the node can call itself, store the information, and run the RPC call. Then if we run it again, we can have replayability because those previous computations were already saved. This creates a "run once, never run again" system, making it more efficient and scalable. Using capabilities based on UCAN, we can determine who can run different computations. Perhaps one job is better for Bacalhau, another for Fastly, etc. Maybe you only want computation to happen on a cluster of machines that you and your friends run and no others. We let IPVM handle the matchmaking and authorization checking so that different systems can work together to complete the job.</p><p>And the best part is this is all happening behind the scenes! The developer doesn't need to set any of this up. 👍</p> Compute over Data Summit 2023 Presentation <p>Fission Staff Research Engineer <a href="https://github.com/zeeshanlakhani">Zeeshan Lakhani</a> gave a presentation on IPVM and his work on the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">Homestar</a> implementation at the Compute Over Data Summit.

  <p>Passwords have gotten a lot of attention lately. Why? Because they pose a double threat with hackers and users. According to the <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">Verizon 2023 DBIR</a>, 86% of breaches involve stolen, weak, or default passwords. Of those breaches, 74% involve the human element, which includes social engineering attacks, errors, or misuse.</p>

<p>Passwords were never the ideal security solution for the modern, interconnected world. Much of what we do today is online — work, school, citizen services, shopping, and more. And what's the first thing users are hit with every time? The dreaded username and password prompt before the journey can continue.</p>

<p>Furthering the problem is the fact that the average internet user has <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/blog/global-password-health-score-report-2022">240 online accounts</a> that require a password. Are we really expected to have a unique password to remember for each account? Hackers know all too well the answer is no, making passwords a ripe opportunity for hackers but a significant threat to everyone else.</p>

<p>Some of the challenges passwords create for users are directly responsible for their security shortcomings, and include:</p>

<p>Complexity: Many systems require complex passwords, which make them more difficult to crack — and more difficult to remember. As a result, users rarely change their passwords — if credentials are scraped in a data breach, they may be exploited again and again.</p>

<p>Reuse: Consumers have numerous online accounts, and many people use the same passwords again and again. This means that if one account has been compromised, attackers may have access to multiple accounts.</p>

<p>Password resets: When users forget their passwords, they must endure a time-consuming reset process, resulting in lost productivity, account lockout, and high rates of abandonment. The fact that most password reset requests send a link to a user's email address makes them vulnerable to interception.</p>

 How passwords are stolen 

<p>Attackers have a range of tools at their disposal, some of which have been around for years and some that are emerging. In particular, the use of generative AI has the potential to crack passwords and develop new methods of attack far faster than humans ever could.</p>

  Social engineering and phishing 
 <p>Social engineering techniques or phishing attacks often trick users into revealing their passwords through fake emails, websites, text messages, and phone calls, and it is becoming difficult to distinguish fake messages from legitimate ones. Business email compromise, for example, involves impersonating executives within an organization to convince employees that the email is legitimate and to follow its instructions, which may include exposing intellectual property and other sensitive data.</p>

  Brute-force attacks 
 <p>In a brute-force attack, attackers systematically try all possible combinations of passwords until they find the correct one. With the tools and software programs available today, including generative AI, sophisticated attackers can rapidly attempt billions of password combinations, making weak passwords especially vulnerable.</p>

  Credential stuffing attacks 
 <p>Attackers take advantage of people who reuse passwords across multiple accounts by using stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to other accounts. This type of attack relies on the fact that many users — half, according to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/exclusive-most-people-still-make-up-their-own-passwords-and-reuse-them">TechRadar</a> — use the same password for multiple accounts.</p>

  MFA prompt bombing 
 <p>Not even multi-factor authentication (MFA) is immune to attacks. One of the most sophisticated authentication attacks over the last couple of years is known as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a>. This social engineering attack relies on inattentive users absentmindedly approving mobile push notifications set off by bad actors, allowing the attackers to essentially defeat MFA.</p>

  Malware 
 <p>There are several types of malware created specifically to steal usernames and passwords along with other sensitive information. Keyloggers, for example, record a victim's keystrokes so the attacker can steal login credentials. If clipboard hijacking malware is installed on a user's device, it can monitor the clipboard for sensitive information, which it sends to the attacker. And a credential harvester is a malicious extension to a website or application — once installed it records any information users enter during the login process.</p>

  Generative AI 
 <p>Attackers have begun training AI engines to crack passwords, perform<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover"> account takeover</a> (ATO), and develop and automate new malware. They can use generative AI to create more sophisticated and targeted phishing attacks that appear far more convincing than those of the past.</p>

<p>Because generative AI makes it much easier to impersonate others, malicious actors are using it to deliver attacks known as “deepfakes” and create synthetic identities. Synthetic identities combine a real identifier, such as a Social Security number or date of birth, with falsified personal information (name, contact information) to create a new, fictitious identity. These fake identities can be used to apply for and obtain loans and credit cards, open accounts, or submit false claims for unemployment or medical care.</p>

 It's time to go passwordless 

<p>There are multiple ways to make it harder to steal passwords, but the only way to eliminate the threat completely is to eliminate passwords. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> removes the need for a password and minimizes the threats related to credential-based attacks, including <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover</a> (ATO), fraud, and data breaches. Not only are data breaches costly in the short term, but they can have long-term consequences. A recent survey, for example, showed that <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/11/26/how-consumers-feel-about-retail-data-breaches/">78% of Americans</a> are wary about doing business with a retailer that has experienced a breach.</p>

<p>By going passwordless you not only get better security but you can also increase workforce productivity and customer satisfaction by removing access barriers to systems and online services. The result? A secure business with happy users and less time and money spent on helpdesk support.</p>

 How to go passwordless 

<p>When it comes to passwordless, one size does not fit all. That's true for the enterprises that implement passwordless and it's true for users — people want choices. No matter where you are on your passwordless journey, there are steps you can take today to eliminate passwords.</p>

  Offer a passwordless factor: Various methods can be used as a multi-factor authentication (MFA) factor, such as push notification, one time passcode (OTP), or emailed magic links. A passwordless factor reduces friction and improves on the security of a standard login, but cannot be characterized as passwordless because it relies on usernames and passwords. A passwordless factor is a great choice for applications where passwords cannot be eliminated completely. Consumer-facing sites and applications may offer several approaches, depending on their customers' devices and preferences. 
	 Provide a passwordless experience: The password is still present for those legacy apps that require it, but it's handled securely in the background, so users don't have to enter or even see it. This experience further reduces friction in MFA and improves security. Since the user doesn't interact with a password, you eliminate many of the risks associated with social engineering and generative artificial intelligence (AI) that can compromise something that users know — their passwords. 
	 Deliver complete passwordless: In this scenario, authentication occurs without the use of passwords. Instead, users can employ biometrics and private-key cryptography. Passkeys give users a simple and secure way to sign in without passwords by relying on Face ID or Touch ID. Since the user doesn't have a password — no password even exists — you eliminate all of its security risks and usability issues. Apple, Google, and Microsoft — the makers of so many popular devices, browsers, and operating systems — have rolled out support for the FIDO2 Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard and passkeys, making it even easier to adopt passwordless authentication. 
 <p>From better security to reduced costs and increased revenues, the elimination of passwords should be a board-level priority for every organization.</p>

				  Passwords have been our main key to gain access to products and services for years. But as other options come onto the market, it is worth exploring what they can offer and why you might want to switch.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Passwords have been around for a long time, so long that many of us have just accepted them as part of everyday life. This wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing — if not for a history of password misuse leading to disaster for both end users and organizations alike. While people are aware of the issue, with <a href="https://www.security.org/resources/online-password-strategies/">less than half of Americans</a> having confidence that their passwords are secure, familiarity has led to indifference: breaches just happen, they’ll be&nbsp; headline news for a few days, and then they’ll disappear. The solution is not to keep reminding people to follow good password practices and maintain cybersecurity vigilance; it doesn’t work. The solution is to get rid of passwords and go passwordless.</p>
<p><a href="https://download.pingidentity.com/public/assets/misc/en/3637-workforce-survey-passwordless-future.pdf">65% of IT leaders</a> reported that their organizations were likely if not certain to adopt passwordless security in the near future. There are a multitude of reasons to do so, not the least of which being reducing security costs, the need for support, and the time employees spend logging in to each different system everyday. It is estimated that the average employee has over <a href="https://lp-cdn.lastpass.com/lporcamedia/document-library/lastpass/pdf/en/LastPass-Enterprise-The-Password-Expose-Ebook-v2.pdf">190 different logins</a> and can spend <a href="https://download.pingidentity.com/public/assets/misc/en/3637-workforce-survey-passwordless-future.pdf">28 minutes per day</a> just getting into their accounts. So, once you’ve decided to switch your organization to passwordless login how do you go about implementing it?</p>
<p>There are a variety of options for creating passwordless login for your organization, including badges, fobs, USB devices, and tokens. A common and inexpensive option offering a pseudo-passwordless experience is password managers. While “passwords” or digital keys are still created for services like these, they are often hidden from the end user, and instead tied to the badge, fob, or other object the user possesses or their password manager account. This is, typically, more secure, as the object or password manager tends to create very complex passwords, which being unknown to the user protects them from phishing.</p>
<p>While these options work very well for some organizations, there are some limiting factors. For example, anything physical like badges or fobs can be misplaced or stolen, and password managers still rely on an account with a master password.</p>
<p>At Indicio, we believe the better option is verifiable credentials. These credentials can be thought of as similar to the physical-object approach in that they are stored with the end user in an app on a mobile device; but unlike badges or fobs, these app-based credentials can be biometrically bound to the user through the app and the phone.</p>
<p>The credential completely removes the need for any kind of password, instead relying on secure connections created through verifying credentials. When credentials are presented for verification, they provide mutual cryptographic authentication: The user proves they are the credential holder when contacting their employer, and their employer, in their response, proves that they are in fact the user’s employer. See <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">A Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Identity</a> for a deeper explanation of how this works.</p>
<p>The net result is a powerful way to enable passwordless login, one that has multiple defenses against fraud, while also providing the capacity for much richer interaction. And verifiable credentials can be for more than just employees and employers, any organization could implement them for customers, citizens, or anyone that wants to interact with their systems. No more passwords, no more multi- factor authentication, no more captchas (which AI can now defeat), no more recovery questions, or helpline calls; instead, you have quick, frictionless authentication, which in a business context can be easily configured to orchestrate identity and access management to hundreds of cloud-based applications, and save a lot of time and money. To see how this works in practice, watch our demonstration of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMZlop-TvnQ">Proven Finance</a> to see how a verifiable credential can change the way you access your bank account or financial institution.</p>
<p>With over <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/privacy/password-statistics">24 billion passwords</a> exposed by hackers in 2022, your organization can’t afford to put implementing a better solution on the back burner.

<p>Holochain’s 0.1.x series has a new release which fixes some breaking changes in a well-known dependency called <code>serde</code>. The Launcher has a new release for the unstable Holochain 0.2.1 release as well. After those release notes, I’ll give an update on the state of Holochain 0.2.x.</p><p>But first! A reminder about the upcoming dev training.</p> Holochain Developer Training Oct 2023 <p>In case you missed it, we’re co-hosting another app dev training course with our education partner Mythosthesia, online, from 2 to 7 October. This is a very hands-on, very cooperative, and fairly intensive crash course on hApp development, led by Marcus Philips, a veteran of world-class dev school Hack Reactor, and Guillem Cordoba, a knowledgeable and friendly hApp developer. Registrations are closing very soon, so <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-oct-2023/?ref=blog.holochain.org">apply now</a> so we can guide you through the intake process and get you prepared to take the course! If the registration cost is a challenge for you, please reach out to us on Discord — there are scholarships available.</p> Holochain 0.1.6: Fix <code>serde</code> issue <p>Release date: 28 August 2023<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.x</p><p>Recently the maintainers of <code>serde</code>, a crate that provides support for serialising and deserialising Rust types, accidentally introduced a breaking change to the way enums are serialised. Our core dev team has decided to pin <code>serde</code> at an earlier version to avoid that change from breaking our APIs as well. (We’ll be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2675?ref=blog.holochain.org">introducing</a> that breaking change in the 0.3.x series.)</p><p>This issue isn’t likely to affect you unless you had run <code>cargo update</code> on your hApp in the time window between the change in <code>serde</code> and the release of HDI 0.1.4 and HDK 0.2.4 (both from the Holochain 0.1.6 release). If this is the case, you can run <code>nix flake update</code> on your project and then run <code>cargo update</code> again.</p><p>We discovered and patched the issue in the scaffolding templates pretty quickly after discovering the issue, so if you’ve used the scaffolding tool to generate a zome you’re probably safe.</p><p>Here are the full release notes:</p>  Maintenance: Pin <code>serde</code> to 1.0.166 to roll back a breaking change to enum serialisation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2674?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2674</a>)  Maintenance: Update <code>lair</code> to 0.3.0, which introduced no substantial changes but pinned <code>serde_derive</code> to 1.0.166. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2668?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2668</a>)  Removed: A compile-time feature to include support for <code>tx5</code>, Holochain’s new WebRTC-based networking protocol, has been removed.   Launcher 0.11.0: Holochain 0.2.1 support, new DevHub <p>Note: This Launcher is bundled with an unstable Holochain version. For those of you who are testing and deploying hApps at small scale, this is an opportunity to try your hApp with Holochain 0.2 and use the newest App Store and DevHub.</p><p>What’s new about these two features? Let’s back up a bit and talk about what DevHub is first. It’s a package manager hApp that lets devs distribute zomes, DNAs, hApps, and UIs. It comes preinstalled in the Launcher and powers both the App Store feature and the DevHub UI. And in the future it will be integrated into the Holo suite to allow ‘hApp managers’ — either developers or people forking a hApp for their group’s personal use — to get their hApps onto HoloPorts.</p><p>The original DevHub had a few DNAs that worked together as one to provide all package data — both blobs and metadata such as manifests. Everyone who installed the Launcher ran this DNA, which meant everyone had to store app packages — and in a small DHT where everyone stored everything, that meant that you had to wait until someone had gossiped a package or its metadata to you before you could install an app. This caused long load times and failures, making it seem like there were no hApps in the store and then making it seem hApps couldn’t be downloaded.</p><p>The new DevHub is broken into two hApps with multiple DNAs:</p>  The original DevHub DNA(s) live in one hApp, which is only activated if you turn on the ‘developer mode’ switch in the Launcher settings.  An App Store DNA which only contains manifest files for hApps deemed ready for public use (sort of like a release tag on GitHub) is in another hApp, which is activated for all users.  A portal DNA is bundled with both of the above hApps, and it handles communication between the two of them.  <p>If a peer belongs to the DevHub DHT, they’ll advertise that fact on the portal DHT. You could call them a package host, because they’re participating in the storage of package blobs. Anyone who wants to download a package can look up that list of hosts, choose a random one, and ask it for the package data.</p><p>This is a great example of a multi-DNA architecture that breaks up responsibility according to needs, abilities, and roles in the community. The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/portal-dna?ref=blog.holochain.org">portal DNA</a> is a generic DNA that you can drop into your hApp to provide the bridging between a DHT of hosts and a DHT of clients. In the future, Holochain will support ‘deferred DNA provisioning’ which will eliminate the need to split this sort of functionality into two separate hApps, allowing you to bundle the host DNA and only activate it for those who want to be hosts.</p><p>There are a few things to keep in mind:</p>  This release is bundled with Holochain 0.2.1, which is unstable.  Because of an upgrade to the Lair keystore, installing this Launcher will be similar to a factory reset. You’ll need to reinstall hApps. (This is a breaking change, not a bug.)  hApps may be visible in the App Store, but installation will fail if there are no available DevHub peers that are storing the requested package. This isn’t a bug but a side effect of small DHTs. We’re testing the deployment of persistent DevHub and App Store nodes on the Holo network, and that will help with this issue in the near future.  There are a few known issues, which you can read about in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.11.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">release notes</a>.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.11.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">Download Launcher 0.11.0 (unstable) from GitHub.</a></p> Holochain 0.2 progress: building comprehensive diagnostic capacities <p>tl;dr: While Holochain 0.2 is working just fine for hApps used by small groups of people, we’re seeing bottlenecks when networks and their data loads grow. We’re nearing a stable 0.2.2 release which tackles some of the biggest performance issues, but further improvements will still come after that point.</p><p>As a developer, you’ve probably had the experience of polishing up your application, running it through CI tests one more time (all green!), cutting a release, and… getting a bug report from someone who hit some obscure corner of your code or tried to use it in OS or networking conditions you’d never dreamed of. Even the most well-tested code is vulnerable to the kind of creative challenges the real world likes to throw at it.</p><p>Holochain’s CI test suite has checks for performance regressions — it generally has to pass a certain level of responsiveness before a release can be cut. These tests exercise the conductor fairly aggressively. Even still, when we released it to the world, it struggled to keep up with real-world usage scenarios, as my colleague <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/emergence-lessons-in-contextual-complexity/">Eric wrote about recently</a>.</p><p>Why did this happen? Simple: the real world is messy. It’s hard to write tests that anticipate the issues you’ll see out there. Many of them will be ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory?ref=blog.holochain.org">black swans</a>’ — situations that are inherently impossible to predict. For example, our automated tests didn’t anticipate the performance issues that could happen when network communication is thin and unreliable.</p><p>And that, of course, is exactly the kind of situation you encounter in the real world. It turned out that, in large networks with lots of data, network latency and bandwidth caused gossip bottlenecks at unexpected moments. Aborted and restarted gossip sessions were creating race conditions, causing network connection pool saturations that took a while to clear out.</p><p>So of course the core devs are tackling these specific bottlenecks. But they’re also building their capacity to respond to future issues of this kind. You can’t predict the next black swan, but you can work on your ability to respond to the unexpected. This is happening in two ways:</p>  Application architecture is getting streamlined so that it’s easier to reason about the flow of control and data through a node. This will make it possible to find out exactly what’s happening during a bottleneck, capture the inputs, outputs, and system state, and replay the scenario.  As real-world applications encounter issues, the applications and the scenarios that cause the issues will be integrated into our CI suite to catch similar issues in the future.  <p>This is just boring engineering stuff — stages two and three in Agile pioneer Kent Beck’s advice to “make it work, make it right, make it fast”. We’ve already made it work, from proof of concept to first stable beta. Holochain now correctly implements a very large portion of its roadmap. The task now is to make it right — which is not about fixing fundamental defects but instead refactoring the code to make it easier to test.</p><p>And that in turn will allow us to make it fast. Holochain is a framework for building everyday apps that serve real human needs through good times and bad. In order to do this, it needs to feel good to use. In ideal situations Holochain already feels fast enough — we’ve already been using hApps like <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/kando?ref=blog.holochain.org">KanDo</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">TalkingStickies</a> for months in our daily work. Now it’s time to make it work well in all those non-ideal situations.</p><p>The core devs have already made a lot of progress. We’re anticipating a release of 0.2.2 soon, which we’ll declare the next stable release after 0.1.6. It will include fixes for a zome call timeout issue, along with various improvements they’ve already made to the networking layer. The first release candidate is <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.2-beta-rc.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">already cut</a>, and our next step is to stress-test it with a few flagship apps before deciding if it’s ready. 0.2.2 won’t fix all possible performance issues, but it will be an incremental-yet-noticeable improvement.</p><p>You can hear Eric and the core devs talk more about our findings and plans in the recording of our first Developer AMA:</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/LTrGLoaQBWI?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

Relation to prediction markets, Numerai  Summary <p>We dream of a world of 10,000 truly accurate prediction feeds, for everything from rain forecasts to sea level rise, or traffic congestion to ETH price. <a href="https://predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a> is an on-chain, privacy-enabled, AI-powered application and stack that is bringing this dream to reality. Its testnet is live now, mainnet soon, and incentives program soon&nbsp;after.</p><p>Slides: Ocean meetup [<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yj14l-FRaMOgxXflHV0-sdHEdAFaAuB2MJNovQEtRFE/edit?usp=sharing">GSlides</a>][<a href="https://github.com/trentmc/slides/blob/main/20230913-ocean-meetup-predictoor.pdf">pdf</a>], Dappcon [<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/118tBnWNbzuq6vL1TITGq69RKPvHWbxVUZULp8KnfPyQ/edit?usp=sharing">GSlides</a>][<a href="https://github.com/trentmc/slides/blob/main/20230912-dappcon-berlin-predictoor.pdf">pdf</a>]</p> 1. Motivation <blockquote>Tomorrow belongs to those who can hear it coming. — David&nbsp;Bowie</blockquote><p>Accurate predictions are valuable. With them, one can take action and create value. Conversely, inaccurate predictions can be problematic. Predictions have value because they’re the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">final step in a data supply chain</a>, right before action is taken by the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Prediction feeds are a stream of predictions for a given time series. This could be predicting the price of ETH every 5 minutes, or the sea temperature daily. A feed may be binary, i.e. whether a time series changes up or down: ↑↓↓↓↑↓↑↑. Accurate prediction feeds are valuable.</p><p>Alas, accurate predictions are *hard*. Worse, typical prediction feeds have no accountability on accuracy. If the weatherman says “no rain for today” and then it rains, a farmer could get stuck in the mud, wrecking a portion of his crops. The weatherman doesn’t feel the impact of wrong predictions, but the farmers sure&nbsp;care!</p><p>Imagine if there was accountability. Accuracy would go up; the farmer would be stuck less. Imagine accountable prediction feeds for not only for rain, but also wind, sea temperature, road congestion, train delays, ETH prices, NVID prices, housing prices, and more. Imagine tens of thousands of prediction feeds with accountable accuracy. Imagine them globally distributed, and censorship resistant. Imagine accuracy improving with&nbsp;time.</p><p>This is the dream, that became a goal, that got built. This is Ocean Predictoor.</p> 2. Introduction to Predictoor <blockquote>Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin. — A&nbsp;mother</blockquote> 2.1 What is Predictoor? <p>Ocean Predictoor is a dapp and a stack for prediction feeds. It has accountability for accuracy, via staking. It’s globally distributed and censorship-resistant, by being on-chain. We expect its accuracy to improve over time, due to its incentive structure. Its first use case is DeFi token prediction because users can close the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">data value-creation loop</a> quickly to make tangible&nbsp;$.</p>Conceptual overview of Predictoor<p>Prediction feeds are crowd-sourced. “Predictoor” agents submit individual predictions and stake on them. They make money when they’re correct and lose money when not. This drives accurate prediction feeds, because only accurate predictoors will be making $ and sticking&nbsp;around.</p><p>“Trader” agents buy aggregate predictions, then use them to take action like buying or selling. The more accurate the predictions, the more easily they make $, the longer they stick around to keep buying prediction feeds from trading&nbsp;profits.</p><p>Predictoor is built on the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/architecture">Ocean Protocol stack</a>, including contracts for <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/contracts/datatokens">tokenized data</a> and middleware to <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/metadata">cache metadata</a>. To keep predictions private unless paid for, Predictoor uses <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/sapphire">Oasis Sapphire</a> privacy-preserving EVM&nbsp;chain.</p><p>The initial dapp is live at <a href="https://predictoor.ai/">predictoor.ai</a>. It’s for up/down predictions of BTC, ETH, and other tokens’ prices. The dapp helps users build a mental model of Predictoor behavior. Predictoors and traders’ main workflow is to do run predicting / trading bots with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">Py SDK</a>. We have seeded Predictoor with bots that have AI/ML models of accuracy comfortably above 50% — a precondition to make $ trading&nbsp;[0].</p>Screenshot from <a href="https://predictoor.ai/">predictoor.ai</a> 2.2 Predictoor Structure <p>The image below gives an overview of Predictoor structure.</p><p>In the image top left, predictoors, traders, or anyone play with predictoor.ai to build an understanding how predictoor works. One feed is free; the rest are available for purchase. At first, only the free feed is visible. Users can connect their web3 wallet and buy another&nbsp;feed.</p><p>In the image top middle, predictoors graduate to building &amp; deploying Python “Template Predictoor bots” (agents), which submit predictions every 5 minutes. Now, predictoors can see how to make $ from making predictions, with plenty of room to improve AI/ML modeling accuracy and make more&nbsp;$.</p>Overview of Predictoor structure<p>In the image top right, traders graduate from predictoor.ai to building &amp; deploying Python “Template Trader bots” (agents), which grab the latest prediction every 5 minutes, as soon as it’s available, then trade using that prediction (and other info). Now, Traders can see how to make $ from buying predictions, with plenty of room to improve trading strategy and make more&nbsp;$.</p><p>In the image bottom is the Oasis Sapphire chain, with Predictoor feed contracts deployed to it. There’s one contract deployed for each {pair, exchange, timescale} such as {ETH/USDT, Binance,&nbsp;5m}.</p> 2.3 Predictoor Behavior <p>We just covered Predictoor structure. Let’s now layer on some Predictoor behavior, with the help of the image below. We’ll walk through actions by Predictoors and Traders related to predictions for time slot “epoch t+1”, and show how they make&nbsp;$.</p><p>We assume predictions on BTC, and where epoch t ends at 5:00pm, t+1 ends 5:05pm, and t+2 ends 5:10pm. We assume that Traders already purchased a subscription via predictoor.ai, Python, or otherwise. When we discuss an action by a Predictoor or Trader, we recognize that it’s typically executed by their agent&nbsp;(bot).</p><p>Epoch t. This is left 1/3 of the image. It starts at 4:55pm and ends at 5:00pm. Predictoor 1 (pink) predicts that BTC close price for epoch t+1 will be higher (“↑”) than close price for epoch t. He submits a tx to that chain with that prediction, and some OCEAN stake of his choice (higher stake = more confident). Predictoor 2 (dark green) does the same. Predictoor 3 (light green) predicts “↓” and stakes. The chain stores these prediction values, privately.</p>Predictoor Behavior<p>Epoch t+1. The middle 1/3 of the image covers epoch t+1. It starts at 5:00pm and ends at 5:05pm. The BTC Predictoor contract computes the aggregated predicted value (agg_predval) as stake-weighted sum across individual predictions.</p><blockquote>agg_predval = (stake1*predval1 + stake2*predval2 +&nbsp;…) / (stake1 + stake2 +&nbsp;…)</blockquote><p>The contract then makes agg_predval visible to its subscribers. The predicted value is the stake-weighted sum across predictions. Smart traders may take the information and act immediately. A baseline strategy is “if it predicts ↑ then buy; if it predicts ↓ then sell or&nbsp;short”.</p><p>Epoch t+2. This is the right 1/3 of the image. It starts at 5:05pm and ends at 5:10pm. Both traders and trueval agent take action (and, predictoors get&nbsp;paid).</p>  Actions by Traders. Typically, traders exit their position immediately, exactly 5 minutes since they got the 5-minute-ahead prediction and acted [1]. If the prediction feed was accurate enough and trading fees &amp; slippage weren’t too high, then the trader makes money on&nbsp;average.  Actions by Trueval agent; predictoors get paid. The trueval agent is a process that grabs price feeds from e.g. Binance and submits it to chain, inside the smart contract [2]. The “submit” transaction also takes the opportunity to calculate each Predictoor’s reward or slashing, and update their OCEAN holdings in the contract accordingly. (Funds aren’t sent per se, they’re made available via ERC20 “approve”, for the predictoor to transfer at some later point). Predictoor 3 got his OCEAN slashed because he was wrong; predictoors 1 and 2 receive that as income, in addition to receiving income from prediction feed sales to traders. Predictoors can claim their balance&nbsp;anytime.   3. Predictoor Parameters  3.1 Roadmap <p>Predictoor will roll out in three phases: Testnet → Mainnet → Data&nbsp;Farming.</p>  Tue Sep 12, 2023: Predictoor Testnet is ready for community. This means Ocean Predictoor smart contracts, middleware, and frontend running on Oasis Sapphire testnet. 5min&nbsp;feeds.  Tue Oct 10 [4w later]: Predictoor Mainnet is ready for community. This is like testnet but tokens have real value. There will be bridges as appropriate. 5min + 60min&nbsp;feeds.  Thu Nov 9 [4w 2d later]: Predictoor Data Farming starts counting. There will be 37,000 OCEAN (about $10K) and several $K worth of ROSE, as weekly rewards to incentivize predictoors. The appendix has&nbsp;details.   3.2 Feeds Published <p>For testnet, there are 10 feeds: X/USDT pair for each of the top-10 coins by market cap (ignoring stablecoins), 5m timescales, on Binance, &gt;0% fees on Binance. Paid feeds. The coins are: X = BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, SOL, LTC, TRX,&nbsp;DOT</p><p>For mainnet, tentatively, there will be 20 feeds: 10 at 5m timescales like above, plus 10 at 60m timescales.</p> 3.3 Pricing <p>The price to subscribe to one feed for 24 hours is 3.00 OCEAN. This includes all&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Fee details:</p>  0.1% community swap&nbsp;fee  20% fee to Ocean Protocol Foundation. (Will be used to further drive Predictoor, and to burn&nbsp;OCEAN.)  For reference, price without fees is 2.49791840133 OCEAN. To calculate this: Let x = price without fees. Then x * (1 + 0.20 + 0.001) = 3.0 → x = 3.0 / (1 + 0.20 + 0.001) = 2.49791840133  <p>Pricing is subject to change based on learnings, and feedback from community.</p> 4. How to&nbsp;Earn  4.1 How to Earn as a Predictoor <p>If you have background in AI, ML, data science or statistics (and these overlap!) then you’re well suited to become a predictoor to make&nbsp;$.</p><p>Typical steps as a predictoor:</p>  Play with predictoor.ai. Go to <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai">predictoor.ai</a> to build intuition: observe the free feed, perhaps buy a few feeds, and watch them change over&nbsp;time.  Do Challenge DF: one-off predictions. Then, practice making accurate AI/ML based predictions via <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/user-guides/data-farming/how-to-challengedf">Challenge Data Farming</a>. Submissions are due Wednesdays at midnight, for ETH price predictions 5 min, 10 min,&nbsp;…, 60 min ahead. Every week, 5000 OCEAN prize money is distributed to the three lowest-error submissions.  Run a predictoor bot: continuous predictions. Follow the steps in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">Predictoor README</a>. You’ll start by deploying a bot locally that submits a random prediction every 5 minutes. Then you’ll add AI/ML model predictions. Then you’ll do it on a remote testnet staking fake OCEAN. Finally, you’ll do it on mainnet staking real&nbsp;OCEAN.  Optimize the bot. Improve model prediction accuracy via more data and better algorithms. Extend to predict &gt;1 prediction feeds (Predictoor has many). Wash, rinse,&nbsp;repeat.  <p>The actions as a predictoor give the following ways to&nbsp;earn:</p>  Feed sales. At an epoch, sales revenue (minus fees) for that epoch goes to predictoors. It’s distributed pro-rata by stake among the predictoors who predicted the true value correctly. The revenue for an epoch is the fraction of sales, spread uniformly across subscription length. A price of 3 OCEAN, 5m epochs, and 24h (1440m) subscriptions gives a revenue of (# subscribers) * (3 OCEAN) * / (1440m /&nbsp;5m).  Stake reshuffling. At an epoch, incorrect predictoors have their stake slashed. This slashed stake is distributed to the correct predictoors pro-rata on their&nbsp;stake.  Predictoor DF. The third phase of Predictoor rollout will have an incentives program that amounts to additional earning for predictoors. 37,000 OCEAN/week rewards.  <p>Don’t expect to be 100% accurate in your up/down predictions. Marginally better than 50% might be enough, and be skeptical if you’re greatly above 50%, you probably have a bug in your&nbsp;testing.</p><p>Predictoors can earn even more, via complementary actions:</p>  Challenge DF. Predict accurately for weekly prizes, as discussed earlier.  Passive DF &amp; Volume DF. Lock veOCEAN for OCEAN, then point the veOCEAN to data assets with high data consume volume (DCV). Predictoor feeds are great candidates for high-DCV&nbsp;assets.  <p>Every week there’s 150,000 total OCEAN rewards for Ocean Data Farming. This will increase in early 2024, and more yet later. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#:~:text=Data%20Farming%20(DF)%20incentivizes%20for,2023%20in%20DF%20Round%2029.">Here are&nbsp;details</a>.</p><p>⚠️ You will lose money as a predictoor if your $ out exceeds your $ in. If you have low accuracy you’ll have your stake slashed a lot. Do account for gas fees, compute costs, and more. Everything you do is your responsibility, at your discretion. None of this blog is financial advice.</p> 4.2 How to Earn as a&nbsp;Trader <p>You can make $ by buying prediction feeds, and using it as an input — as “alpha” — to your trading approach.</p><p>Typical steps:</p>  Play with dapp, and trade. First, go to <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai">predictoor.ai</a> to build intuition: observe the free feed, perhaps buy a few feeds, and watch them change over time. In a second window, have Binance open. Employ a baseline trading strategy: when a new Predictoor prediction pops in, buy if “↑”, and sell or short if “↓”; exit the position 5 min&nbsp;later.  Run a trader bot. Follow the steps in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/trader.md">Trader README</a>. You’ll start by deploying a bot locally that follows the baseline trading strategy: when a new Predictoor prediction pops in, it buys if “↑”, and sells if “↓”. Then you’ll do it on a remote testnet with fake tokens. Finally, you’ll do it on mainnet with real tokens on a real exchange.  Improve &amp; extend. Improve trading performance via more sophisticated trading strategies. This is a universe all of its own! Extend to &gt;1 prediction feeds (Predictoor has many). Wash, rinse,&nbsp;repeat.  <p>The actions as a trader offer a single yet powerful way to earn: trading revenue. Buy low and sell high! (And the opposite with shorting.)</p><p>Traders can earn even more via a complementary action: Volume DF. Lock veOCEAN for OCEAN, then point the veOCEAN to data assets with high DCV. Predictoor feeds are great candidates for high-DCV&nbsp;assets.</p><p>⚠️ You will lose money trading if your $ out exceeds your $ in. Do account for trading fees, order book slippage, cost of prediction feeds, and more. Everything you do is your responsibility, at your discretion. None of this blog is financial advice.</p> 4.3 How to Earn as a Data&nbsp;Farmer <p>Even if you’re not active as a predictoor or a trader, you can earn nonetheless. By simply locking your OCEAN for veOCEAN, you can earn passive rewards. Moreover, if you point your veOCEAN to data assets that have high data consume volume (Predictoor assets are a good choice), then you can earn “Volume DF” active&nbsp;rewards.</p> 4.4 From Earning, to Thriving (Why Predictoor) <p>Why did we, at Ocean Protocol, build Predictoor? Why did we structure it around predictions, for predictoors and traders to earn? Can earning grow into thriving? We explain&nbsp;here.</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to level the playing field for data and AI, by kickstarting an open data economy. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">We’ve asked</a>: How do people sustain and thrive in the emerging open data economy? Our answer is simple: ensure that they can make&nbsp;money!</p><p>However, this isn’t enough. We need to dive deeper. The next question is: How do people make money in the open data economy? Our answer is: create value from data, make money from that value, and loop back and reinvest this value creation into further growth. We call this the Data Value-Creation Loop.</p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">The data value-creation loop</a><p>If we unroll the loop, we get a data value supply chain. In most supply chains, the most value creation is at the last step, right before the action is taken. Would you rather a farmer in Costa Rica selling a sack of coffee beans for $5, or Starbucks selling 5 beans’ worth of coffee for $5? It’s the same for data. For data value supply chains, the most value creation in the prediction step.</p><p>Predictoor is a direct manifestation to make this happen. Predictoor aims to make it easy for people to make $ doing predictions (as predictoors), and taking actions against those predictions (as traders). If traders make $ with sufficiently accurate feeds, then they’ll keep buying the feeds, and then the predictoors will make $. As the predictoors pursue higher accuracy, they’ll buy their own data feeds, ie working backwards in the data supply chain. Over time, the whole data supply chain will flesh out with $ at each&nbsp;step.</p><p>And the starting point is predictions.</p> 4.5. Early Earnings Benchmarks <p>As discussed, Predictoor aims to make it easy for people to make $ doing predictions (as predictoors), and taking actions against those predictions (as traders).</p><p>Before we started building Predictoor, we first asked: can we predict ETH (etc) up/down with accuracy? Then we conducted intensive AI/ML research towards this question. The results of this investigation were positive 😎. TBH, we were surprised at the degree of market inefficiency.</p><p>Our next question was: with these predictions, can we make $ trading? Again, we conducted intensive AI/ML research, and again found positive results&nbsp;😎😎.</p><p>Here we share some results of that research — a glimpse of how deep the <a href="https://makeameme.org/meme/take-the-red-5c8af2">rabbit hole</a> goes — to inspire would-be predictoors and traders in their own work. The model was trained on data from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2023, with simulated results the first 24 days of July 2023. A “baseline” trading strategy was&nbsp;used:</p><p>The image below shows simulated returns as a function of order size, for BTC/TUSD on Binance. Duration = 7000 ticks x 5m/tick = 24.3 days of trading. It simulates spread effects. It assumes 0% fees. Note how the size of the order affects the return. This is because BTC/TUSD is not very liquid; therefore larger amounts cause slippage.</p>Simulated returns vs time of BTC/TUSD trading on Binance. Trade size has an&nbsp;impact.<p>The image below has the same experimental setup, but for BTC/USDT pair. The size of the order does not affect the return, because BTC/USDT is more liquid than BTC/TUSD.</p>Simulated returns vs time of BTC/USDT trading on Binance. Trade size has little&nbsp;impact. 5. Predictoor Architecture  5.1 Privacy and Oasis&nbsp;Sapphire <p>Predictoor needs privacy&nbsp;for:</p>  Submitted predictions  Compute aggregate predictions; and  Aggregated predictions — only subscribers can&nbsp;see  <p>This could all be done on fully-centralized infrastructure. But doing so would fail on our other goals: being globally distributed, censorship resistant, and non-custodial.</p><p>Targeting these needs, we researched &amp; prototyped many privacy technologies. <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/sapphire">Oasis Sapphire</a> emerged as the best choice because, as the only privacy-preserving EVM chain in production, it could handle these needs cleanly end-to-end.</p> 5.2 Software Implementation <p>Most of <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai">predictoor.ai</a> dapp is implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-web">pdr-web repo</a>, with help from <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-websocket">pdr-websocket</a> to fetch feed data and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius">Ocean Aquarius</a> for metadata&nbsp;caching.</p><p>The template Predictoor bots, trader bots, trueval bot, and prediction feed publishing are all in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> repo. Contracts are in the Ocean <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">contracts</a> repo.</p><p>Events emitted by contracts are indexed as Ocean subgraphs, to be consumed by predictoor.ai and the bots. The backend <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/subgraph.md">subgraph README</a> has more&nbsp;info.</p> 5.3 Backend &amp; Contract&nbsp;Details <p>The image “Overview of Predictoor structure” presented earlier showed much of the Predictoor architecture. The image below adds detail around the backend (bottom 1/3 of diagram). Let’s&nbsp;discuss.</p>Details of Predictoor structure (Architecture)<p>Smart Contracts. There’s one Predictoor contract for each prediction feed, at each exchange/timescale: BTC/USDT at Binance/5m, ETH/USDT at Binance/5m, and so on. Each contract is an <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/contracts/datatokens">Ocean datatoken</a> contract, with a new template for prediction feeds [3]. It implements ERC20, Ocean, and Predictoor-specific behavior as&nbsp;follows.</p>  ERC20 behavior. It implements the ERC20 interface and therefore plays well with ERC20-friendly crypto wallets, DEXes,&nbsp;etc.  Ocean behavior. Being part of Ocean, having 1.0 datatokens means you can access the underlying data asset for the duration of the subscription (once you’ve initiated the order). For Predictoor contracts this is 24h. Each datatoken contract has a parent <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/contracts/data-nfts">Ocean data NFT</a> with metadata, means to specify &amp; collect fees, and&nbsp;more.  Predictoor behavior. Each datatoken contract has additional methods specific to Predictoor: submitting predictions, submitting truevals, computing aggregated predictions, etc.   5.4 Testnet&nbsp;Details <p>As of Sep 12, 2023, Predictoor / Ocean contracts are deployed to <a href="https://docs.oasis.io/dapp/sapphire/#testnet">Oasis Sapphire&nbsp;testnet</a>.</p><p>Users need fake OCEAN &amp; ROSE&nbsp;tokens:</p>  Fake OCEAN. Staking &amp; payment is in fake OCEAN. Users acquire it <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/testnet-faucet.md">via a&nbsp;faucet</a>.  Fake ROSE. Gas fees are in fake ROSE. Users acquire it <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/testnet-faucet.md">via a&nbsp;faucet</a>.   5.5 Mainnet&nbsp;Details <p>As of Oct 10, 2023, Predictoor / Ocean contracts are deployed to <a href="https://docs.oasis.io/dapp/sapphire/#mainnet">Oasis Sapphire&nbsp;mainnet</a>.</p><p>Users need (real) OCEAN &amp; ROSE&nbsp;tokens:</p>  OCEAN. Staking &amp; payment is in OCEAN. Users <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/about-us/ocean-token#get">acquire OCEAN via exchanges</a>. Users bridge OCEAN tokens from ETH mainnet to Oasis Sapphire mainnet via&nbsp;<a href="https://celer.network/">Celer</a>.  ROSE. Gas fees are in ROSE. Users bridge tokens bridge from Oasis Emerald mainnet to Oasis Sapphire mainnet via <a href="https://celer.network/">Celer</a>. [<a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/celer-messaging-bridge-integration">Details</a>]   6. Possible&nbsp;Futures <p>This first release of Predictoor is just the beginning. We anticipate adding many more crypto feeds: more coins, more exchanges (CEX and DEX), more timescales; and predictions beyond just coin&nbsp;prices.</p><p>We envision the Predictoor stack being used in other verticals like real estate, weather, climate, transportation, and agriculture. We envision refinements of the core Predictoor technology.</p><p>Predictoor’s predictions are the final step of the web3 data value creation pipeline, right before action is taken and $ is made. We anticipate that the $ made by Predictoors will filter upstream, into work to create feeds used by Predictoors, such as sentiment analysis, volatility, and information ticks.</p><p>Most interestingly, the agents of the Predictoor ecosystem may evolve. Starting as relatively simple agents running on the centralized cloud, Predictoor’s incentives can drive them to becoming decentralized and autonomous, while performing AI. Yes, <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/ai-daos-and-three-paths-to-get-there-cfa0a4cc37b8">AI DAOs</a>. Swarms of sovereign agents: some predicting, some trading, and some providing support services along the data supply chain. It will feel a bit like <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nature-2-0-27bdf8238071">nature</a>, a bit <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Kevin-Kelly/dp/0201483408">out of control</a>, and wholly exciting!</p>Left: a swarm/agent-based <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/ai-daos-and-three-paths-to-get-there-cfa0a4cc37b8">AI DAO</a> architecture. Right: book cover for <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Kevin-Kelly/dp/0201483408">Out of Control</a> by Kevin&nbsp;Kelly 7. Conclusion <blockquote>We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be&nbsp;done.</blockquote><blockquote>— Alan&nbsp;Turing</blockquote><p>We dream of a world of 10,000 truly accurate prediction feeds, for everything from rain forecasts to sea level rise, or traffic congestion to ETH price. <a href="https://predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a> is an on-chain, privacy-enabled, AI-powered application and stack that is bringing this dream to&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Predictoor’s testnet is live now, mainnet soon, and incentives program soon after. We anticipate Predictoor to extend beyond DeFi to other verticals like climate and agriculture. Predictoor agents may evolve into AI DAOs with emergent swarm-like behavior. This is the&nbsp;future.</p> Appendix: Predictoor Data&nbsp;Farming <p>There will be 37,000 OCEAN weekly rewards to incentivize predictoors.</p><p>Here are details. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">Ocean Data Farming</a> (DF) is an incentives program currently with <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">150K OCEAN</a> rewards per&nbsp;week.</p><p>DF streams &amp; sub-streams are:</p>  Passive DF. 75K OCEAN per week. Lock OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>; rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.  Active DF. 75K OCEAN per week. It has these substreams:<br>i. Volume DF. Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.<br>ii. Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price, one-time weekly. Rewards are a function of accuracy. Details <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">here</a>.<br>iii. Predictoor DF [new]. Predict future price movement, continuously (as a predictoor).<br>– Current weekly rewards are 70K / 5K OCEAN for Volume / Challenge DF respectively. When Predictoor DF starts (Nov 9), weekly rewards will be 37K /1K / 37K OCEAN for Volume / Challenge / Predictoor DF respectively. BONUS: every week there will be several additional $K worth of ROSE tokens allocated to Predictoor DF, thanks to a generous contribution from the Oasis&nbsp;team.   Appendix: Q&amp;A  Relation to Prediction Markets <p>Q: How Predictoor compare to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">prediction markets</a>? Like Predictoor, they use $ for accountability.</p><p>A: They’re different:</p>  Prediction markets are for one-off predictions like “will Biden win in&nbsp;2024?”  Whereas Predictoor-style prediction feeds are for a continuous stream of predictions.   Relation to Chainlink <p>Q: How Predictoor compare to Chainlink? Like Predictoor, it has price feeds on-chain.</p><p>A: They’re different. Chainlink provides current prices on-chain, and Predictoor makes predictions for prices in the&nbsp;future.</p> Relation to&nbsp;Numerai <p>Q: How does Predictoor compare to <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a>? Like Predictoor, it crowd-sources predictions, related to&nbsp;trading.</p><p>A: They’re different:</p>  Numerai takes predictions, then aggregates them and uses them to trade directly. It operates as a hedge&nbsp;fund.  Whereas Predictoor takes predictions, then aggregates them and sells the aggregate. It operates as data&nbsp;feeds.  <p>Secondary differences:</p>  Numerai focus is tradfi trading, as a hedge&nbsp;fund.  Whereas Predictoor is pure datafeeds, and applies to any vertical. Its first use case is defi&nbsp;trading.  Currently Numerai is mostly centralized.  Whereas Predictoor is decentralized. Predictoor tech may be useful to Numerai to help decentralize:)   Relation to Numerai&nbsp;Signals <p>Q: How does Predictoor compare to <a href="https://signals.numer.ai/">Numerai Signals</a>? People supplying to Numerai Signals don’t get paid out from trading (like the main Numerai product).</p><p>A: They’re different:</p>  In Numerai Signals, payout is a function of the submitter’s “originality” compared to other signals. These signals are used as inputs for prediction models in Numerai main&nbsp;product.  Whereas in Predictoor, payout is a function of the the accuracy of the submitter’s prediction, compared to the true value. These signals are predictions, directly.   Updates <p>[Sep 20, 2023] Updated the dates for Predictoor Mainnet release and Predictoor DF, because the original dates were wrong. Mainnet is exactly 4 weeks after testnet, ie Oct 10 (not Oct 3). DF is 4 weeks + 2 days after Mainnet, ie Nov 9 (not Nov&nbsp;2).</p><p>[Sep 20, 2023] Added more information about testnet &amp; mainnet chains, bridges, and&nbsp;tokens.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable people to privately &amp; securely publish, exchange, and consume&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Ocean Protocol core team builds the Ocean Predictoor product.</p> About Oasis&nbsp;Network <p>The Oasis Network is a privacy-focused, scalable, Proof-of-Stake Layer-1 smart contract platform that is Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible. Oasis boasts a multi-layer modular architecture that enables the scalability and flexibility to deploy low-cost privacy-focused smart contracts toward Web3&nbsp;ideals.</p><p>Oasis Network includes Oasis Emerald chain, and Oasis Sapphire chain. The latter is privacy-preserving via Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).</p> Notes <p>[0] On testnet, the Predictoor bots run by Ocean core team make random predictions. When mainnet goes live, Predictoor bots run by core team are AI/ML-powered.</p><p>[1] They might have also exited earlier if price spiked (“take profits” action) or price was crashing (“stop loss”&nbsp;action).</p><p>[2] Submitting a “true” price value like this could also have been performed using a Chainlink setup (or otherwise). However we wanted to retain flexibility for feeds not currently on Chainlink, for&nbsp;now.</p><p>[3] The implementation is in templates/ERC20Template3.sol at at Ocean’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">contracts</a> repo.</p> Final Note <p>None of the content in this post should be taken as financial advice.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>Reshaping the future</p>
<p>The relationship between law and technology is a complex one. While law plays a crucial role in safeguarding public interests and ensuring checks and balances, it is also perceived by some as a potential impediment and a deterrent to innovation in the tech industry. Proponents of this idea argue that the tech industry has thrived in part because of its ability to respond to market demands. However, discussions around law and technology tend to yield valuable insights, often involving multiple stakeholders and featuring concerted efforts.</p>
<p>During my graduate studies in Estonia, I encountered a prevailing academic view that sees law as a constraint in the context of technological progress. Although it is widely believed that law struggles to keep pace with the rapid technological advancements and innovations of our time, this characteristic should not necessarily be viewed a drawback. Law, as a restraint in the midst of rapid technological change, provides a fertile ground for nurturing new technological solutions and ideas and allowing stakeholders to engage in meaningful debate and explore a wide range of possibilities.</p>
<p>In other words, its ability to slow down or restrain technological development can actually have positive outcomes by creating opportunities for resistance, reconstruction, and resilience. By imposing limits and requirements, it encourages stakeholders to explore more thoughtful and adaptive solutions. This generates a dialectical process wherein the tech industry, responding to legal constraints, presents its antithesis by seeking new solutions, ultimately leading to a synthesis that reconciles legal requirements and fosters greater technological resilience, adaptability, and human agency.</p>
<p>Reinstating human agency </p>
<p>For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has set a global standard for data privacy and security. It has compelled tech companies operating in the EU to prioritize user data protection. In practice, this means that organizations constantly need to keep up to date on privacy and data protection regulations to ensure that their business operations remain in compliance. As a result, legal frameworks like GDPR can play a role in restoring human agency, or at least non-technical agency, in times of <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence?&amp;at_campaign=20226-Digital&amp;at_medium=Google_Ads&amp;at_platform=Search&amp;at_creation=RSA&amp;at_goal=TR_G&amp;at_advertiser=Webcomm&amp;at_audience=ai%20legislation&amp;at_topic=Artificial_intelligence_Act&amp;at_location=DE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxs-2-MSkgQMVxZDVCh2TgwIKEAAYASAAEgIFOfD_BwE">rapid technological change</a>.</p>
<p>Human agency allows individuals to make ethical decisions regarding the development and application of certain technologies. It provides the capacity to consider the moral implications of technological choices, ensuring that technology aligns with our values and interests. Therefore, discussions about regulation and technology allow us to adapt to these changes and exert some control over the direction of our technological progress. These discussions are not meant to stifle progress but rather to ensure that technological advancements serve the greater good, safeguarding individual rights and societal values.</p>
<p>Regulations not only restore human agency, but also serve as valuable benchmarks and sources of guidance for other countries. By examining advanced and recently published regulations in forward-looking nations, individuals and organizations can proactively adopt practices and recommendations even before they are mandated as national standards in their own country. This approach promotes international collaboration and the harmonization of standards, culminating in improved cybersecurity and safety measures on a global scale.</p>
<p>While technology and law can be a tricky companions, it's up to us to make the most of this complex relationship. Here’s a brief overview of the latest EU regulations:</p>
 
 Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) 
 
<p>DORA came into effect in January 2023. It requires organizations in the European Union financial services sector to ensure that they can withstand, respond to, and recover from all types of ICT-related cyber disruptions and threats. The overall goal of the regulation is to strengthen the resilience and cybersecurity of EU financial entities by streamlining and improving previously existing rules and adding new requirements to improve cybersecurity and harmonize cybersecurity regulatory requirements. Check out my colleague Warwick Ashford's excellent report on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80843/eu-digital-operational-resilience-act-dora">Dora</a> for more info.</p>
 
 EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) 
 
<p>The CRA is a proposed cybersecurity regulation for the EU, introduced on September 15, 2022, by the European Commission. Its primary aim is to enhance cybersecurity and cyber resilience within the EU by establishing common cybersecurity standards for products containing digital components. By imposing cybersecurity standards, the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act">CRA</a> helps protect consumers from new and emerging cyber threats. For example, it would guarantee “a framework of cybersecurity requirements governing the planning, design, development and maintenance of such products, with obligations to be met at every stage of the value chain”.</p>
 
 NIS2 Directive 
 
<p>The NIS2 Directive is the EU-wide cybersecurity legislation that came into force in 2023. It updates and modernizes the Directive on the security of Network and Information Systems (NIS), which was introduced in 2016, to address the challenges posed by increasing digitization and evolving cybersecurity threats. The directive aims to enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure operators and digital service providers. Key digital service providers, such as search engines, cloud computing services and online marketplaces,&nbsp;will have to comply with the security and notification requirements under the Directive. Check out this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-nis2-directive-who-what-and-how">blog</a> post for more information.</p>
<p>Cyberevolution</p>
<p>The EU's approach to regulation in cyberspace is driven by the need to protect the rights and security of its citizens in the digital age and create a level playing field in the digital market. It emphasizes the importance of cooperation, transparency, and accountability while addressing the challenges posed by emerging technologies. Furthermore, the relationship between law and technology is one of the focal points of KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> event in Frankfurt from 14-16 November.</p>
<p>As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, organizations must proactively adapt their strategies and practices to meet these new standards. Stay up to date as we delve into the future of regulation and examine the far-reaching implications of recent regulatory developments, including NIS2, DORA, and CRA. Compliance with these regulations is essential for organizations operating in the EU to ensure the protection of critical infrastructure, safeguard against cyber threats, and maintain trust in digital services.</p>

<p>Today, we reached over 1,000,000 users on Bluesky!</p>
<p>We’re grateful to the early users and developers who have helped us reach this point. Thank you for joining us early on this journey and helping test all aspects of the network before the open public launch. We’re excited for many more people to join soon.</p>
<p>Our current focus is on preparing to open up and getting the network to a state that can support many more users. This means improving moderation and curation on the network through increased staffing and tooling, scaling our infrastructure and federating the network to support this growth, and iterating on the user experience of the app. As always, if you have feedback you’d like to share with the team, you can find a submission form in the app under “Send feedback.”</p>
 Milestones 
<p>Here’s a look back at some of our milestones over the last few months:</p>
 
 Releasing a beta app for our protocol (January). We started inviting a handful of people to test out the Bluesky app. By February, we still only had a few hundred people.

<p>We know consumers are becoming <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">increasingly</a><a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/"> concerned</a> about privacy. The International Association of Privacy Professionals’ recent <a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf">research</a> shows 68 per cent of consumers globally are either somewhat or very concerned about their privacy. In the US, at least <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/majority-americans-are-concerned-about-safety-and-privacy-their-personal-data">84 per cent</a> of consumers express some level of concern about the privacy and safety of their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a> and, according to <a href="https://civicscience.com/concerns-grow-over-consumer-privacy-and-facial-recognition-tech/">Civic Science</a>, the majority of Americans (51 per cent) are now very concerned about consumer privacy.</p>



<p>But we also know that despite understanding the risks to their privacy and safety from using their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a> online, most consumers fail to do anything about it—which is the crux of the famous <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404818303031">privacy paradox</a>, that disconnect between&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer concerns</a>&nbsp;about privacy and their actions to protect it.<br></p>



<p>So many recommendations, so little time…</p>



<p>One reason consumers might fail to proactively protect their privacy is a lack of time, money or skill for implementing the advice offered to them. PC Magazine recently posted a list of <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/antivirus/53058/12-simple-things-you-can-do-to-be-more-secure-online">12 simple things</a> that consumers can do to be more secure online. But many of the recommendations are about using existing services on mobiles and desktops, modifying behaviors, or adding an extra technology or service to their online experiences. Typically, for these recommendations, “doing what’s right” would require:<br></p>



 
 Researching available technologies and services (spending time) 



 Buying the technology or services (spending money) 



 Implementing and configuring the acquired technology or services (spending time and skill) 



 Using the technology or services to its fullest extent to achieve maximum benefit (spending time and skill). 
 



<p>Every step in that process is a barrier to regular folks making the move. They may not know where to start researching the solution or even what questions to ask. They may doubt that the thing they are paying for will actually solve their problem. Or they may lack confidence that they can make it work or even use the thing they bought. The result is often a partial solution at best and inaction at worst.</p>



<p>But what if you could provide an easy to understand, acquire, implement, and use package that covers all the privacy and security bases for your customers?</p>



<p>What if you could make it easy for your customers – who already trust you for some pieces of the puzzle – to complete the picture?<br><br>It’s a no-brainer: You would offer additional value that increases stickiness, differentiation, and customer acquisition. And your customers would get what they suspect they’ve needed but haven’t had the motivation or courage to get.</p>



<p>In fact, enterprises are rapidly opening their eyes to the massive levels of customer trust and brand loyalty they can generate by better protecting their customers’ privacy. <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">Harvey Jung</a>, Cisco’s Chief Privacy Officer and Counsel, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">says</a>, ‘Privacy is a business imperative and ethical responsibility – not just a compliance requirement.’&nbsp;And&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">PwC</a> argues that brands that get consumer trust and safety right will disrupt the market. In fact, nine out of 10 business leaders told PwC researchers that building and maintaining customer trust will be&nbsp;the&nbsp;competitive advantage of this decade.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, do it but make it as easy as pie …</p>



<p>If we go back to <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/antivirus/53058/12-simple-things-you-can-do-to-be-more-secure-online">PC Magazine’s 12 simple things</a> list, here are five that you could easily offer to your customers as pre-packed services:</p>







<p>1. Use unique passwords for every login – While consumers can do this without help, it is rare that they actually do. A password manager (your password manager) removes the barriers to following this advice. A password manager will generate and securely store strong and unique passwords for every login, keeping your customers safer.</p>







<p>2. Get a VPN and use it – A virtual private network (VPN) gives your customers a private and secure online experience that insulates them from prying eyes and those who seek to sell or steal their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a> and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>. Your VPN would empower your customers to only reveal what they want to reveal.</p>







<p>3. Use different email addresses for different kinds of accounts – This is another recommendation that a consumer can do on their own but probably won’t. You can make it easy. Offering your customers a convenient way to <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalize</a> their email communications across their various online activities will dramatically increase their levels of privacy and security. Imagine making it easy for your customers to have entirely separate email within entirely <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">separate digital identities</a> for things like shopping, dating, social interactions, medical needs, and so on.</p>







<p>4. Turn off the save password feature in browsers – The same password manager that allows for unique and strong passwords for every login also removes the need for the user to remember their passwords or have to worry about turning off the save password feature in their browsers. The password manager automatically and securely enters passwords. Simple.</p>







<p>5. Don’t fall prey to click bait or phishing scams – Giving your customers a safe and private browsing capability will go a long way towards protecting them from themselves. The product you can offer includes mobile and desktop browsing experiences that block ads and trackers, evaluates the safety and reputation of visited sites, and even compartmentalizes browsing for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">separate online personas</a>.</p>

			<p>11th September, Luxembourg – &nbsp;Tokeny, the global leading tokenization platform, is thrilled to announce that they have achieved SOC2 Type I compliance, making them the first tokenization platform in the world to earn this esteemed certification. This certification underscores Tokeny’s dedication to top-tier security. While many companies tout their security measures, third-party validators truly reveal a tech stack’s integrity.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Tokeny has sought out third-party validators to back up their claims. Notably, the Tokeny-developed, now open-source, ERC3643 standard was audited by renowned Web3 code auditor Hacken, earning a perfect 10/10 score.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with SOC2, this report recognizes Tokeny’s commitment to creating the secured enterprise-grade solution that the market deserves. After a careful review conducted by a third-party independent auditor, Tokeny can now undoubtedly prove that all of their departments have the procedures and controls in place to meet the security requirements of the financial markets including:</p>
 
 HR (from hiring to management) 
 Production (covering code changes, security, and releases) 
 IT (handling data privacy and assets) 
 Customer Success Management (overseeing business continuity and incident communication) 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Securing this report marks the initial step in Tokeny’s “Security and Compliance” strategy. Tokeny plans to pursue further certifications, reinforcing its stance as the industry’s premier secure tokenization platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a massive leap forward for Tokeny’s platform and their organization for market credibility and to certifiably be recognized as an elite enterprise-grade solution.</p>
<p>CTO, Tony Malghem, who has been leading these efforts, voiced his excitement: </p>

		 
	 
    Being the first is always special, but what truly excites me is the assurance and trust this brings to our users and clients. At Tokeny, we’ve always aimed for excellence, and this certification is a testament to our dedication to deliver the most secure platform, in order to foster confidence and innovation to all who use our platform. Our journey is only just beginning.  Tony MalghemCTO of Tokeny

<p>The recent, numerous high-profile attacks targeting identity processes, like those by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/csrb-report-lessons-from-the-lapsus-threat-group">the Lapsus$ group</a>, underscore the need for strong identity security. New research by the Identity Defined Security Alliance found that 90% of organizations had an identity-related incident in the past year with two-thirds of those suffering direct business impact as a result. Identity verification and identity authentication are both essential elements of a comprehensive identity security strategy. While they sound similar, they serve very different, but interconnected, purposes. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the increased attacks on identity systems, it’s critical to understand identity verification vs. authentication to determine where your organization may be vulnerable and put in effective measures to address these weaknesses. In the most basic terms:</p> 
  
  Identity verification, also referred to as identity proofing, is the process of confirming if someone is who they say they are.  
  Authentication is the process of making sure that the person trying to log in is the same person whose identity was confirmed before.  
  
<p>Here, we take a closer look at identity verification vs. authentication, what each of the terms means, how they work, and what role they play in a broader identity security strategy.</p> 
 What is Identity Verification?  
<p>Verification connects an individual with an identity, validating that someone is who they claim to be. It proves that the personal information being used to establish identity is legitimate and isn’t forged or stolen. While this may involve manual checks, technological advances in secure data capture and processing have enabled fully digital identity verification methods. For example, digitally verifying government-issued IDs, matching PII against official databases or even taking a selfie.</p> 
<p>Identity verification is frequently used to validate customer identity, especially relating to financial processes, such as opening a bank account. It’s an important part of Know Your Customer (KYC) standards and other guidance and regulations aimed at stopping fraud, corruption, money laundering and other criminal activities. Increasingly, identity verification is being used for Know Your Employee (KYE) purposes, particularly for managing employee onboarding and access control.&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Methods of Identity Verification  
<p>There are various ways to verify identity. The methods an organization uses will depend on the level of identity assurance they require and what works with their business processes. Typically you will use multiple methods together. Methods include:</p> 
  
  Document verification — This is typically a government-issued ID such as a driver’s license or passport. This could be a photo or scan of a physical ID or a digital ID such as a mobile driver’s license.&nbsp;  
  Biometric verification — This usually involves using a mobile phone to take a selfie, with the selfie then compared against an official ID to ensure a match.  
  Database verification — User-supplied information is compared against official databases, such as those managed by the DMV and IRS.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Some identity verification solutions include options for additional levels of assurance such as video verification through a live video feed or attestation from a manager.</p> 
 What is Authentication?  
<p>Authentication is the process by which a user proves that they are the holder of the verified identity. For example, to access an online bank account you may be asked to enter a username and password, plus answer security questions or click on a link sent by email or SMS.</p> 
 Common Methods of Authentication  
<p>Online authentication relies on the user presenting one or more factors from the following three categories:</p> 
  
  Knowledge — This is something you know such as a password, PIN or security question. It’s the least secure authentication factor, as it can be guessed, cracked or obtained by malicious actors through <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-phishing-prevention">phishing</a>, social engineering and other attack methods.  
  Possession — This relates to something you have, such as a device or security key. It offers a stronger level of authentication since an attacker would need to steal or intercept the item in question. Some possession factors, such as an SMS OTP, have proven very easy to bypass.  
  Inherence: This is something you are such as your fingerprint or facial characteristics. Typically this is the most secure factor but that highly depends on how authentication is implemented.  
  
<p>Multi-factor authentication requires two or more factors from different categories. While most multi-factor authentication solutions use a multi-step process, there are some that combine factors into a single action. FIDO-based <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">passwordless authentication</a> uses biometrics (inherence) to unlock a device-stored cryptographic key (possession) for login.</p> 
<p>Providing the necessary authentication factors is just the user-facing part of authentication. The factors must still be verified. The backend methods used for verification affect the level of security in authentication as much as the factors used. For instance, if biometric factors are verified by comparing them to ones stored in a central database, then they can be intercepted or stolen just like a password. Look for solutions that perform authentication verification through robust public-key cryptographic exchange protocols.</p> 
 Identity Verification vs. Authentication: Similarities  
<p>Identity verification and authentication both concern the confirmation of identity. They are frequently used in tandem to ensure that only a valid user can access systems and resources. Identity verification and authentication come in at different points in the identity lifecycle. Verification is used to establish an identity and, when necessary, re-confirm identity. Authentication is what verified individuals use for daily access. Both are necessary to identity security.&nbsp;</p> 
 Identity Verification vs. Authentication: Differences  
<p>Although they sound similar and are often used in conjunction, major differences exist between identity verification and authentication. Verification involves establishing a legitimate, proven user identity. Authentication deals with preventing illegitimate users from entering a system on an ongoing basis. Below we compare them in key areas.</p> 
 Purpose  
<p>Verification confirms an individual is who they claim to be by verifying the authenticity of their proof of identity.&nbsp; Authentication determines if someone attempting to access an account is authorized to do so.</p> 
 Data Type Used  
<p>Identity verification usually involves some official form of documentation, such as government IDs, and/or a live photo that proves a person’s physical identity. Authentication may not be tied at all to the person’s physical identity; it can use information such as passwords or possession of a code or key.</p> 
 Identity Timeline  
<p>Verification is performed at a specific point in time, when first onboarding an individual to establish their identity. There may be reverification triggers at times of increased risk or other key events. Authentication is performed on an ongoing basis to continuously validate a person’s identity to grant access to systems and resources.</p> 
 Building a Comprehensive Identity Security Strategy  
<p>Stringent identity verification policies cannot protect your data and systems if that identity can be easily spoofed through insecure authentication methods. Similarly, strong authentication won’t help you if a bad actor has possession of legitimate authentication credentials.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s passwordless MFA eliminates breachable credentials from your authentication processes. Based on <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/passkeys">FIDO passkey</a> standards, it provides the strongest authentication to form the basis of a comprehensive identity security strategy.&nbsp; To find out how HYPR passwordless authentication can protect your organization, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/contact">speak to one of our identity security experts</a>.</p>

<p>The Local-First Software Movement is a philosophy and approach to software development that strongly emphasizes prioritizing user control and ownership of their data. Unlike traditional cloud-based or centralized applications, which store data on remote servers, local-first software primarily operates on users' devices and ensures that data remains under their direct control. This movement seeks to empower users by providing them with the benefits of collaboration and connectivity while preserving privacy, security, and data autonomy. It challenges the dominant paradigm of centralization in the digital world and aims to redefine how software applications interact with and safeguard user data.</p><p>Personal data ownership is more important now than ever. Companies train their AI models on user data without compensating users or offering clear ways to opt-out. Platforms change leadership and direction, leaving users scrambling for ways to liberate their content from walled gardens. Centralized services are a target for bad actors.</p><p>Today, we'll dive into the history of the LoFi movement, notable local-first projects, and how to get started.</p><p>The Early Days of Computing and Data Localization</p><p>In the early days of computing, data was all stored locally. It was always physically stored on a floppy disc, a flash drive, the computer's disk drive, or even punch cards and magnetic tapes. Computers relied mainly on physical connections. There was a risk of data loss if the hard drive failed, limited accessibility due to the data being tied to a physical location, and version control issues, as users couldn't edit files simultaneously and had to rely on naming conventions to keep track of changes.</p><p>Then, with the emergence of the Internet and advancements in networking technologies, users could connect with other users across geographical distances and exchange information securely and reliably. The rise of personal computers and the introduction of the World Wide Web in the '90s allowed users to access and share data globally via servers and browsers.</p><p>Then, in the '00s, we saw a major shift to cloud computing. The big three were (and remain) Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. These service providers offer on-demand computing and storage resources at scale. Major companies embraced the cloud to reduce costs. It eliminated the need to build and maintain large on-premises data centers. There were also competitive advantages, such as speedier deployment of new applications. </p><p>The Rise of Cloud Computing and Centralized Services</p><p>The shift to cloud computing has a profound impact on software development. One of the big benefits is optimal resource utilization. Developers can scale up or down their resource needs depending on demand. This is also reflected in the pay-as-you-go model, which allows developers to pay for a tier or plan that best fits their needs.</p><p>Cloud providers offer various managed services, including databases, analytics tools, machine learning, and AI, allowing companies to build innovative features and applications without starting from scratch. </p><p>They also offer APIs for effortless integration and redundancies that ensure high data availability.</p><p>But with these benefits also come drawbacks. For example, data privacy is one of the biggest concerns users express. When storing data with a centralized provider, users have limited control over how it is handled, accessed, and even shared. As the saying goes, "There is no cloud. It's just someone else's computer." </p><p>This can be easy to forget until a data breach or security vulnerability exists. </p><p>Centralized storage creates a single point of failure, which is attractive to bad actors. If it is compromised, the results could be widespread and disastrous. &nbsp; </p><p>Vendor lock-in is another drawback. Once a company is so intertwined with a cloud platform's services, it can be time-consuming and challenging to make a change.</p><p>Cloud services are dependent on Internet connectivity. If there is an Internet outage, and the company is almost entirely cloud-based, business essentially ceases. This can lead to a loss of revenue and unhappy customers. </p><p>There are also additional costs that developers and companies need to be mindful of. For example, while pricing tiers can be a straightforward way to select a plan that suits the budget, going over the allotted storage can be pricy. The same goes for data transfer costs. </p><p>There are also legal considerations. Businesses must take additional security precautions to stay compliant when dealing with sensitive data, like healthcare and financial data. For example, access must be carefully monitored and data encrypted. </p><p>The Local-First Software Movement Takes Root</p><p>As a result of these growing concerns, some developers and users have shifted to a local-first approach. Local-first combines the convenience of cloud apps, including real-time collaboration and the ability to work on multiple devices, with the prioritization of local data storage and networks. </p><p>Local-first also shifts a key paradigm of version authority. With the cloud the file stored in the cloud is the primary copy. Any edits made offline don't matter until they are synced. With local-first, the local copy is the primary copy. </p><p>In the seminal paper, <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf">Local-First Software: You Own Your Data, In Spite of the Cloud</a>, by Martin Kleppmann, Peter van Hardenberg, Adam Wiggins, and Mark McGranaghan, the authors lay out seven ideals for local-first software.</p>  No Spinners: Your Work at Your Fingertips - Instantaneous modifications to files, not burdened by the speed of light!  Your Work Is Not Trapped On One Device - Users should be able to work on their computer, phone, and tablet.  The Network is Optional - Even without Internet connectivity, users should be able to do work and sync their changes later when connectivity is restored.   Seamless Collaboration with Your Colleagues - Cloud apps allow users to edit the same document, so should local-first apps.  The Long Now - Users should be able to access their data long after the company that created the app is gone  Security and Privacy by Default - End-to-end encryption protects sensitive data, whereas cloud services may not meet confidentiality requirements and offer an attractive target for bad actors.  You Retain Ultimate Ownership and Control - A centralized service can lock users out of their data, but users always retain ownership with local-first apps.  <p>Notable Local-First Software Projects and Initiatives</p><p>Several exciting projects have popped up recently in the local-first software space. <a href="https://skiff.com/">Skiff</a>, for example, is a privacy-first end-to-end encrypted workspace. Offering apps such as Skiff Drive, Skiff Docs, Skiff Calendar, and Skiff Mail, they provide a decentralized alternative to cloud-based collaboration tools. <a href="https://dxos.org/">DXOS</a> is an application framework, development platform, and toolchain that enables developers to build local-first, multiplayer applications. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg">WNFS</a> is a distributed file system that stores public and private data on IPFS while keeping it encrypted and controlling access via <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>. More examples of local-first applications exist and are on their way, and there has never been more <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/">interest in the movement</a>. </p><p>How Users Can Embrace Local-First Software</p><p>Users, developers, and businesses should all consider whether adopting local-first software solutions is the right fit for them. First, evaluate your data needs and sharing requirements. Do you need to store confidential information? How does the local-first tool handle encryption and access? </p><p>Local-first software builders should provide offline functionality and design with user control in mind. It should always be clear to users how to manage their data. There should also be data export and import features, with data in an interoperable format, so users can have a credible exit. </p><p>If you're interested in learning more about local-first software and you'll be in St. Louis on September 23rd, 2023, we invite you to join us for a LoFi Unconference! Sponsored by Fission, Ink &amp; Switch, and DXOS, the LoFi Unconference will bring attendees in small discussion groups to: </p>  Share best practices, help each other with the challenges we’re facing, and to figure out where we’re going in the future;  ​Get to know the people behind the core technologies for local-first software, such as CRDTs, client-side databases, and cryptographic security for local-first protocols;  ​Give you a chance to demo the software you’re working on or to give a lightning talk on a topic you want to share with the community.  <p> The event is sold out, but we have a waitlist.

<p>With the rise of two-factor authentication and age verification, we’re arming businesses with advanced tools to shield privacy and build confidence. This article will explore the evolution of customer and verification solutions, exploring their ins and outs and eyeing future trends.<br>
Key Takeaways:</p>
 
 Adopting New Verification Methods: Traditional ways of verifying customers are becoming less effective. Updated techniques such as identity verification, two-factor authentication, biometrics, and AI can help protect businesses from fraud. 
 Regulations and Compliance are Crucial: Keeping up with necessary legal and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, KYC, and AML, is not just good practice—it’s a requirement. It helps maintain trust with customers and avoid costly penalties. 
 Balancing Security and User Experience: A sound verification system isn’t just secure; it’s user-friendly. Businesses need to provide a verification process that safeguards information without creating a cumbersome experience for the customer. 
 
 Definition and Importance of Customer Verification 
<p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/fighting-identity-theft-red-flags-rule-how-guide-business">Customer verification</a> is a critical step online businesses take to confirm the identity of their clients or customers. It’s a necessary process to reduce fraud, improve security, and comply with various legal and regulatory requirements. Customer identity verification also goes beyond just knowing who most customer verification services and applications of your customers are; it’s about ensuring that the person you’re interacting with is who they claim to be.<br>
Businesses can avoid costly penalties associated with fraudulent transactions and non-compliance with regulatory demands, protect themselves, and verify customers from potential identity fraud. It also aids in building customer trust, as they feel secure knowing their data is protected.</p>
 
Why Businesses Need Customer Verification 
<p>The need for customer verification varies across different sectors, but the primary goal remains to ensure the person you’re dealing with is genuinely who they say they are. Customer verification is part of financial institutions’ essential ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) protocols. Retailers must verify customers’ age and home addresses for certain restricted products and online services. For many online shopping services, businesses must ensure that the person signing up or making a transaction isn’t a bot or a fraudster.</p>
 
Exploring the Different Types of Customer Verification 
 
Passive Verification vs. Active Verification 
<p>There are two types of customer verification: passive and active. Passive verification is typically done behind the scenes without the customer’s knowledge. This could involve comparing the customer’s information against data from third-party databases. Active verification requires customer participation.</p>
 
Passive Verification 
<p>The passive verification method is less intrusive and doesn’t require customers to disrupt the customer experience, making it user-friendly. However, it may not be as secure as active verification because it often relies on public data, which can be outdated or inaccurate.</p>
 
Active Verification 
<p>Active name verification solutions can provide a higher level of security because it requires customers to provide personal information or evidence critical information that only the genuine customer would know or have. But, it can be seen as intrusive and may interrupt the customer journey, leading to potential customer drop-off.</p>
 
Detailed Look at Specific Customer Verification Methods 
 
Two-Factor Authentication (Multi-Factor or 2FA Authentication) 
<p>Two-factor authentication requires customers to provide two types of identifying information. This could be something they know (like a password), something they have (like a mobile phone or device to receive a one-time code), or something they are (like a fingerprint or facial recognition). It offers a higher level of security than single-factor authentication.</p>
 
One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication 
<p>OTP authentication involves sending a unique, temporary password to a customer’s registered device. The customer enters this OTP to either verify the customer’s identity and their identity. The password is usually valid for a short period, making it difficult for fraudsters to use.</p>
 
Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) 
<p>KBA involves asking personal questions to verify customer identity, to which only the customer will likely know the answer. These questions could be static (based on stored personal information) or dynamic (generated in real time from third-party databases).</p>
 
Online Document Verification 
<p>Online document verification involves customers submitting a scanned copy of a personal document (like a passport or driver’s license). Advanced algorithms or human verifiers then check the document’s authenticity.</p>
 
Credit Bureau-based Authentication 
<p>This method involves matching the customer’s information and bank account with data held by credit bureaus. It can help verify an individual’s financial history, making it useful for other financial institutions.</p>
 
Age Verification 
<p>Age verification is necessary when selling age-restricted products or services. It typically involves checking the customer’s age and date of birth against a trusted source, such as a credit card company or public records.</p>
 
Photo Verification 
<p>Photo verification usually involves customers taking a live photo or video of themselves, matched with a photo ID or identity documents of other users they provide.</p>
 
The Legal and Regulatory Landscape of Customer Verification 
 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Customer Verification 
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) plays a significant role in customer verification applications for online and retail services. It dictates how businesses should handle, store, and protect the personal data of EU residents. Verification processes operate online and must be secure and transparent and respect the privacy rights of individuals, including the right to access their data and request data deletion.</p>
 
Know Your Customer (KYC) Regulations 
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer#:~:text=Know%20Your%20Customer%20(KYC)%20are,business%20relationship%20with%20a%20customer.">KYC regulations</a> are critical to financial institutions’ due diligence to prevent identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. They require businesses to verify the identity of their customers, understand their financial dealings, and assess the risk of illegal intentions.</p>
 
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance 
<p>AML rules globally require banks, organizations, and online merchants, especially those in the financial sector online retail, to verify the identity of their customers. The aim is to prevent criminals from using businesses for money laundering activities. It usually involves verifying the customer’s identity and address.</p>
 
Balancing Security and User-Friendliness 
<p>A secure business environment and a delightful user experience need not be mutually exclusive; they should be two sides of the same coin. The trick lies in finding that sweet spot where security measures are in full swing, yet the user experience remains smooth and pleasant. Let’s delve into this a bit deeper.<br>
Customer verification acts like an invisible security guard, protecting your business and customers, yet it’s unobtrusive. It doesn’t stop the flow; it doesn’t create unnecessary obstacles; it simply merges into the overall user experience. This integration is crucial to avoid frustrating your customers and ensure they’re not jumping through hoops to access your services.<br>
In this context, friction refers to any possible stumbling blocks that disrupt the customer’s journey. These could be lengthy forms, complicated verification methods, or requests for redundant information. Any such friction could deter your customers, causing them to abandon the process altogether. This could ultimately lead to declining customer satisfaction and conversion rates and even impact your business’s bottom line.<br>
While focusing on user-friendliness, we must pay attention to the elephant in the room of most customer verification applications – security. Cyber threats are a harsh reality today, making a robust and foolproof customer verification process more critical than ever. While maintaining a user-friendly approach, we must be prepared to combat these threats with advanced measures, such as multi-factor authentication, biometrics, or AI-driven verification methods.<br>
Our goal is to craft a customer verification experience that doesn’t compromise on either end of the onboarding process – ensuring a top-notch security level while keeping the user experience enjoyable and straightforward. A well-balanced, efficient process builds trust and fosters long-term customer relationships, driving your business’s success and growth.</p>
 
Ensuring Customer Trust through A Secure Verification Processes 
<p>Living in a world where personal information is shared with a simple click, fostering a strong bond of trust between businesses and customers becomes important. When customers share sensitive data, they’re handing over a piece of their trust to the business, fully expecting their information to be safeguarded and used appropriately. Solidifying this trust revolves around a reliable and stringent customer verification process.<br>
Think about it this way: when customers share their details, they say, ‘I trust you.’ Businesses are responsible for repaying that trust by ensuring their information is verified accurately and kept secure. All information- as simple as contact details and mailing addresses or as sensitive as financial data – should be protected with top-notch security measures.<br>
But there’s more to this than just security. Transparency about the customer identity verification process is key to further building that trust. Customers deserve to know what’s happening with their data. So, businesses should be crystal clear about why they collect data, what they’re doing with it, and how they’re keeping it safe. This straightforward communication can ease any potential customer concerns and foster a relationship based on trust and respect.<br>
For example, if a business needs to collect a date of birth for age verification, it should tell the customer exactly why they need this information, how they’ll use it, and how to keep it safe. Will it be encrypted? Stored securely? Compliant with any government laws and global data protection rules? These are all things that should be communicated to the customer.<br>
Additionally, businesses can embrace technology like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/customer-onboarding-kyc/">BlockID</a> to boost security and transparency. Implementing advanced encryption for data storage or creating a customer portal where customers can manage their data are great ways to build that trust.</p>
 
Challenges and Limitations in Customer Verification 
<p>Data Quality: The verification process is only as good as the data used. If the data is of good quality or accurate, it could positively affect the verification results. For instance, even the most advanced verification process might flag the user as unverified if a user inputs their name incorrectly.<br>
Privacy Concerns: Striking a balance between security and privacy is a significant challenge. While businesses need certain information to verify the identity of their customers, they must also respect their privacy rights. Data collection and usage must be compliant with laws like GDPR, which might limit the data companies can use for verification.<br>
Technological Barriers: Not all customers are tech-savvy. Complex verification methods that require sophisticated technical understanding might alienate some users, leading to poor customer experience and possible churn.<br>
Cost of Implementation: Advanced verification methods, such as biometric verification and AI-based systems, could be expensive, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. Balancing the need for robust verification with budgetary constraints is a significant challenge.</p>
 
Best Practices for Implementing a Robust Customer Verification System 
<p>Implementing Multiple Verification Methods: Incorporating multiple verification methods, such as two-factor authentication, biometrics, and knowledge-based authentication, can enhance the robustness of your customer verification process. This not only ensures high-security standards but also caters to the varied technical proficiency of customers.</p>
<p>User Education: Regularly educate your customers about the importance of accurate data input and security practices. Make them aware of how to handle verification processes like OTP and two-factor authentication safely. This can reduce errors and increase the effectiveness of your verification process.<br>
Continuous Evaluation and Updates: Technology and cyber threats and your verification methods evolve quickly. Regularly review your verification processes, stay updated with the latest trends, threats, and best practices in verification, and adapt accordingly.<br>
Collaboration with Third Parties: Collaborating with third-party services specializing in customer verification can be beneficial. They have the expertise and resources to conduct the verification process more efficiently and effectively.<br>
Prioritize User Experience: While having a stringent verification process is crucial, it’s equally important not to alienate your customers. Ensure your verification process is user-friendly and keeps the customer journey intact. Feedback from customers can help in optimizing this aspect.<br>
Data Security Measures: Implementing advanced data security measures like end-to-end encryption, secure access controls, and firewalls can ensure customer data safety during and after verification. Regular audits and updates to security measures are also recommended.<br>
Remember, an effective customer verification system combines security measures, user-friendliness, and legal compliance.</p>
<p>Getting customer verification isn’t nice; it’s mandatory for businesses. It’s not just about ticking legal boxes and dodging fraudsters. It’s about forging an ironclad, trust-filled space where customers feel protected and appreciated. And achieving this sweet spot is about something other than drowning in high-tech jargon or rigid rules. It’s about blending security with user-friendliness, creating a frictionless, safe experience.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>This conversation revolves around two key elements that my esteemed guests consider pivotal for the adoption of self-sovereign identity: robust communication strategies and interoperable user experience elements.</p>
<p>In the decentralized identity space, numerous communities are filled with individuals collaborating to establish and enhance unified sets of standards to underpin the principles of self-sovereign identity. These communities are also actively engaged in developing technical specifications and open-sourcing implementations. Their collective efforts are instrumental in promoting the adoption of decentralized identity technologies. A fundamental pillar in this journey is interoperability. It’s the key to preventing vendor lock-in and decoupling protocols from end applications. Just as we seamlessly exchange emails across various clients using standardized email protocols, we aspire to achieve a similar level of interoperability in the digital trust space. However, while we’re making significant strides in achieving interoperability, there’s one critical area that warrants more attention and collaboration: user experience (UX).</p>
<p>In this podcast conversation with Irene and Esther from <a href="https://gataca.io/">Gataca</a>, we focus around the challenges surrounding user experience and the need for greater standardization in this domain. Standardizing user experience elements is crucial for implementing solutions that are truly interoperable, preventing the emergence of proprietary obstacles.</p>
  
<p>For anyone interested in collaborating on designing interoperable user experience elements, Gataca is kicking off a new <a href="https://hs.gataca.io/ux4ssi">UX4SSI Working Group</a> on September 12, 2023. Feel free to register using the link I provided.</p>
<p>And for those interested, here is the link to <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23488/w23488.pdf">‘The Digital Privacy Paradox: Small Money, Small Costs, Small Talk’</a> paper that Irene refers to in the conversation.</p>
<p>I trust that you’ll enjoy this conversation as much as I did. Enjoy!</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Irene, Esther and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 [00:25] Defining Adoption: How do we define adoption in the context of Self-Sovereign Identity, and what lens should we use when examining its various aspects and dimensions? 
 [02:21] Measuring Adoption: When measuring adoption, should we start within specific geographical contexts or industries? What key performance indicators (KPIs) and signals should we consider? 
 [12:07] Communication Challenges: Communication plays a vital role in SSI adoption. We explore why it’s challenging to communicate and market SSI compared to other technologies, like generative AI products. What are the unique hurdles in conveying the value of SSI? 
 [18:24] Simplifying Terminology: The conversation continues with a focus on the use of technical jargon and terminology that can bewilder potential adopters. How can we transition from technical discussions to emphasizing business solutions? 
 [23:17] Targeting Adopters: Is it more effective to target entities that serve as both issuers and verifiers or to focus on specific roles within the SSI ecosystem? What are the trade-offs? 
 [27:56] Building Brand Recognition: Given the open nature of the SSI ecosystem, how can organizations build strong brand recognition, and what role do trust marks and certifications play? 
 [31:47] Navigating Political Terminology: How do you address concerns surrounding the term “digital identity” being weaponized in political discourse when communicating about your SSI products? 
 [37:44] Learning from European Adoption: What lessons can be learned from early adoption of digital identity programs in Europe, and how does it compare to the North American market? 
 [47:29] UX Challenges: What are some of the key user experience (UX) challenges in the SSI space, and how can they be addressed to enhance usability and security? 
 [50:59] Interoperability Impact: How does user experience impact interoperability in the SSI ecosystem, and vice versa? What collaborative efforts are needed? 
 [53:22] Balancing Usability and Security: Balancing usability with security is a common challenge. How can the SSI community find the right equilibrium and enhance user adoption?

It concludes on Sep 14. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF54   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF54 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>In today’s modern era of hybrid digital and physical banking experiences, financial institutions are seeking new ways to improve their new customer acquisition strategies while ensuring they are compliant with relevant regulations. Following a dramatic increase in the use of remote onboarding and expansion of digital banking in recent years, the sector is only set to develop further – the market size is projected to grow from USD $8.4 billion in 2021 to USD $19.2 billion by 2028, <a href="https://marketsnresearch.com/report/1592/global-digital-banking-market">forecasting a healthy compound annual growth rate of 14.80%. </a></p>
<p>Therefore, it’s become increasingly important for banks and credit unions to ensure their customers’ identities are genuine, and that they can lawfully use the services offered by the financial institution. The use of biometric identity verification and eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer) checks have become essential, as they enhance security while simplifying the end-user’s journey.</p>
<p>To meet this growing need, Entrust and iProov – two industry leaders in digital identity verification and authentication – have partnered to deliver biometric identity verification and eKYC checks in one powerful, end-to-end solution. This solution revolutionizes how banks and credit unions onboard new users, ensuring a fast, secure, and user-friendly experience for customers and financial organizations alike.</p>
 What are eKYC Checks and How Do They Work?  
<p>eKYC checks are a digital alternative to the traditional KYC process, which is required by regulatory bodies to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities. eKYC allows customers to open accounts remotely without the need for physical paperwork or in-person interactions. It’s the most effective way to speed up the onboarding process and improve customer and member satisfaction right out of the gate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/">Entrust’s </a>identity solutions portfolio combined with iProov offers identity verification and eKYC services to financial institutions for account opening. It integrates iProov’s biometric solutions suite to provide a seamless and secure onboarding experience. Customers can use their smartphones to capture their biometric data, take a selfie, scan a government-issued ID, and submit the information for verification. The technology can process thousands of identity verifications in minutes, reducing the time and costs associated with manual identity checks.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Combining Biometric Identity Verification With eKYC? 
<p>By incorporating biometric verification into eKYC processes, banks and credit unions can reduce the risk of onboarding illegitimate users with stolen or synthetic identities. Additionally, eKYC checks enhanced with biometric technology have proven to be more efficient – McKinsey says that the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Innovation/The%20value%20of%20digital%20ID%20for%20the%20global%20economy%20and%20society/Digital-ID-a-key-to-inclusive-growth-January%202019.ashx">potential cost reduction</a> in onboarding costs by using digitally-enabled processes is 90%. Also, if a digital onboarding process takes longer than 20 minutes, <a href="https://www.visa.co.uk/dam/VCOM/regional/ve/unitedkingdom/PDF/vca-digital-onboarding-whitepaper-s8.pdf">70% of customers completely abandon</a> their attempt to open an account.</p>
<p>Ultimately the benefits of using biometric identity verification and eKYC checks include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Faster, more convenient, and more secure onboarding experience for customers and members 
 Support for compliance and regulatory requirements 
 Reduced risk of both synthetic and stolen identity fraud, as well as data breaches, which can be costly for financial institutions and damaging to their reputation 
 
 The Next Step in Customer Experience: Digital Payment Card Issuance 
<p>A critical objective of this joint solution is creating an effortless experience for users, from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Following on from this, it’s important to prioritize delivering value to customers and members as soon as their account is created. One of the most meaningful milestones is debit card issuance, which provides customers with purchasing power and access to their newly deposited funds. Streamlining the issuance of digital payment cards as a part of the account opening process creates a seamless and valuable experience. By linking the onboarding process with the instant issuance of digital payment cards, banks and credit unions can provide a seamless and convenient experience for their customers and members.</p>
<p>This innovation in digital payment card issuance is part of the joint solution and is particularly valuable because it eliminates the urgency for physical card issuance. Customers can begin using their new accounts immediately, contributing to a more satisfying onboarding experience and increased time-to-value for the financial institution.</p>
<p>The partnership between Entrust and iProov is a game changer for the banking industry. It offers a cutting-edge solution that combines biometric identity verification and eKYC checks to provide a secure and user-friendly onboarding experience for both customers and financial institutions. As digital banking continues to grow, this technology will become increasingly important for financial institutions to stay ahead of the curve and provide their end-users with the best possible service.</p>

 Thrive in the open data economy by closing the loop towards speed and&nbsp;value The Data Value-Creation Loop Motivation <p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">core infrastructure </a>is in place for an open data economy. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">Dozens of teams</a> are building on it. But it’s not 100% obvious for teams how to make&nbsp;$.</p><p>We ask:</p><blockquote>How do people sustain and thrive in the emerging open data&nbsp;economy?</blockquote><p>Our answer is simple: ensure that they can make&nbsp;money!</p><p>However, this isn’t enough. We need to dive&nbsp;deeper.</p> The Data Value-Creation Loop <p>The next question&nbsp;is:</p><blockquote>How do people make money in the open data&nbsp;economy?</blockquote><p>Our answer is: create value from data, make money from that value, and loop back and reinvest this value creation into further&nbsp;growth.</p><p>We call this the Data Value-Creation Loop. The figure above illustrates.</p><p>Let’s go through the steps of the&nbsp;loop.</p>  At the top, the user gets data by buying it or spending $ to create&nbsp;it.  Then, they build an AI model from the&nbsp;data.  Then they make predictions. E.g. “ETH will rise in next 5&nbsp;minutes”  Then, they choose actions. E.g. “buy&nbsp;ETH”).  In executing these actions, they data scientist (or org) will make $ on&nbsp;average.  The $ earned is put back into buying more data, and other activities. And the loop&nbsp;repeats.  <p>In this loop, dapp builders can help their users make money; data scientists can earn directly; and crypto enthusiasts can catalyze the first two if incentivized properly (e.g. to curate valuable&nbsp;data).</p><p>If we unroll the loop, we get a data value supply chain. In most supply chains, the most value creation is at the last step, right before the action is taken. Would you rather a farmer in Costa Rica selling a sack of coffee beans for $5, or Starbucks selling 5 beans’ worth of coffee for $5? Therefore, for data value supply chains, the most value creation in the prediction step.</p><p>To the question “How do people make money in the open data economy?”, the “create value from data!” almost seem like a truism. Don’t fool yourself. It’s highly useful in practice: focus only on activities that fully go through the data value-creation loop.</p><p>However, this is still too open-ended. We need to dive&nbsp;deeper.</p> Which Vertical? How To Compare Opportunities <p>There are perhaps dozens of verticals or hundreds of possible opportunities of creating and closing data value-creation loops. How to select which? We’ve found that two measuring sticks help the&nbsp;most.</p><p>Key criteria:</p>  How quickly one can go through the data value-creation loop?  What’s the $ size of the opportunity  <p>For (2), it’s not just “what’s the size of the market”, it’s also “can the product make an impact in the market and capture enough value to be meaningful”.</p><p>We analyzed dozens of possible verticals with according to these criteria. For any given data application, the loop should be fast with serious $ opportunity.</p><p>Here are some examples.</p>  Small $, slow. Traditional music is small $ and slow, because incumbents like Universal dominate by controlling the the back catalogue.  Large $, slow. Medicine is large $ but slow, due to the approval&nbsp;process.  Small $, fast. Decentralized music is fast but small $ (for now! Fingers crossed).  <p>We want: large $, fast. Here are the standouts.</p>  Decentralized Finance (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/defi/">DeFi</a>) is a great fit. One can loop at the speed of blocks (or faster), and trade volumes have serious&nbsp;$.  LLMs and modern AI is close: one can loop quickly, and with the right application make $. The challenge is: what’s the right application?   On Ocean Protocol&nbsp;Strategy <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">At Ocean</a>, we encourage our ecosystem collaborators to close the data value-creation loops, with maximum $ and speed. We follow our advice for internal projects too. Accordingly, a lot of our focus is on the DeFi and LLMs / modern AI. These are natural for us because Ocean is natively a Web3 and an AI&nbsp;project.</p><p>Loops, then scale. Once one or two fast &amp; high $ data value-creation loops have been established on Ocean, where people are sustainably making money, we’ll likely adjust our activities to scale those loops&nbsp;up.</p><p>Ubiquity. Our aim is to grow over the long-term, until Ocean is ubiquitous as a tool to level the playing field on data and&nbsp;AI.</p> Summary <p>To sustain and thrive in the open data economy: make&nbsp;money!</p><p>Do this by closing the data value-creation loop, in a vertical / opportunity where you can loop quickly and the $ opportunity is&nbsp;large.</p> Notes <p>This content was originally published in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">Ocean Protocol Update || 2023</a>”, Mar 10, 2023.

  FATF Travel Rule compliance is now mandatory for UK-based Virtual Asset Service Providers.  The fragmented adoption of the Travel Rule globally poses significant compliance challenges.  Technological solutions like Shyft Veriscope are essential for seamless, cross-jurisdictional compliance.  <p>As of September 1st, the FATF Crypto Travel Rule has been implemented in the United Kingdom. Hence, for all Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that are active in the UK, comprehending the nuances of the Travel Rule is no longer optional — it’s a business imperative.</p> The Implications of the FATF Travel Rule for&nbsp;VASPs <p>At the heart of the matter, the primary obligation for UK-based VASPs is to meticulously collect, verify, and share information about crypto-asset transfers. But what does this mean in practice?</p> Dealing with International Transactions <p>Suppose a VASP receives an inbound payment from a jurisdiction where the Travel Rule isn’t enforced. In such a case, it’s not just business as usual — the VASP is required to conduct a risk-based assessment before making the assets available to the recipient. By extension, similar protocols would apply to UK citizens initiating payments to foreign territories.</p> Regulatory Expectations <p>While planning to implement the FATF Travel Rule, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was clear in its expectations — VASPs are not merely encouraged but expected to exercise due diligence, even when they use third-party services to assist with compliance.</p> Keeping an Eye on Global Developments <p>VASPs must also make it a point to monitor how the Travel Rule is being implemented in other jurisdictions. This vigilance is particularly crucial when dealing with transfers to or from regions that have yet to adopt the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Transferring Crypto Assets to Jurisdictions Without the Travel Rule in&nbsp;Place <p>The VASPs are required to make sure they can receive the necessary information for each transaction. However, even if receiving this information isn’t possible, they are still obligated to collect and verify it in line with Money Laundering Regulations. This must be done before any crypto asset transfer&nbsp;occurs.</p> Receiving Crypto Assets from a Jurisdiction Without the Travel Rule in&nbsp;Place <p>UK VASPs must scrutinize the countries involved if a transfer comes in with incomplete or missing information. It’s essential to be aware of each country’s status with regard to the Travel Rule, especially given that only a limited number — like the United States, Germany, and Japan — have fully implemented it. Statistically speaking, as of March 2022, only 29 out of 98 jurisdictions had met the necessary requirements.</p><p>Given this fragmented FATF Travel Rule compliance landscape, VASPs are entering uncharted territory. Moreover, the crypto economy itself is still evolving, and compliance requirements like these are inevitably going to pose challenges, and the UK-based VASPs are no exception to these growing&nbsp;pains.</p> Challenges and&nbsp;Concerns <p>Cross-border transfer of funds deals with the regulations of two different legal jurisdictions. The compliance mechanism in such transfers always has to be well-structured and well-laid-out, ensuring that the regulatory realities of two different political geographies are taken into account. This is why many crypto service providers believe that they need further guidance from the FATF while they work on compliance.</p> Heterogeneous Implementation of the Regulation <p>In June 2023, the FATF released an update stating that a whopping <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2023.html">75% of 98 jurisdictions</a> were either partially compliant or not compliant with their requirements for virtual assets and&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>This discrepancy in compliance levels creates a challenge as transactions between compliant and non-compliant jurisdictions become fraught with legal complexities. The industry calls this the “Sunrise” issue, a problem Shyft Veriscope has found an innovative solution&nbsp;for.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope uses a “historic lookback” approach, allowing VASPs to pull information on any transaction, regardless of when it occurred or whether the receiving VASP was compliant at the time. This feature allows for seamless, compliant transactions across borders and regulatory landscapes.</p><p>In essence, Veriscope helps VASPs navigate the fragmented regulatory environment by retroactively generating the necessary compliance information, ensuring that every player can meet their obligations under the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>More on Veriscope here: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/addressing-the-new-fatf-report-shyft-veriscope-solving-the-travel-rule-challenges-like-no-other">Addressing the new FATF Report — Shyft Veriscope Solving the Travel Rule Challenges Like No&nbsp;Other</a></p> Unequal Compliance Levels <p>Fraudulent actors are always active in exploiting cracks in the system, and one such vulnerability could arise from a transaction involving both compliant and non-compliant jurisdictions.</p><p>But it doesn’t end there — even within two compliant geographies, unequal levels of compliance could similarly present exploitable gaps.</p><p>For example, both Canada and the UK are travel rule-compliant. However, Canada requires VASPs to record the beneficiary’s postal address, while the UK does not. Such irregularities have to be streamlined to achieve an efficient implementation of the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Cryptocurrency’s Unique&nbsp;Features <p>The crypto-economy has facilities like self-custodial or unhosted wallets, where no service provider knows the wallet details. Only the holder possesses and controls the private key to that wallet. In such setups, it becomes difficult for VASPs to comply with the norms, including a requirement for firms to identify the names of people behind transactions.</p> The Road&nbsp;Ahead <p>The implementation of the FATF Travel Rule in the UK signals a pivotal moment in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation. While the UK has taken proactive steps to embrace this global standard, the challenges for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are far from over. With a fragmented global adoption rate, issues like the “Sunrise” problem loom large, and even within compliant jurisdictions, nuances in the regulatory frameworks create additional layers of complexity.</p><p>As the regulatory landscape continues to mature, VASPs will need to keep several key considerations in&nbsp;mind:</p><p>Regulatory Harmonization: Given the patchy adoption of the Travel Rule, efforts to standardize compliance requirements across jurisdictions will become increasingly important. The crypto industry will benefit from greater cooperation among regulators globally.</p><p>Technological Solutions: Leveraging technological solutions like Shyft Veriscope can serve as a lifeline for VASPs struggling with cross-jurisdictional compliance. Such tools offer a real-time, scalable way to meet regulatory requirements without sacrificing operational efficiency.</p><p>Ongoing Monitoring: Regulatory compliance is a moving target. Keeping abreast of updates, whether from FATF or local regulatory bodies like the FCA, will be vital for continuous compliance. To stay updated on the latest developments and insights, <a href="https://shyft-network.beehiiv.com/subscribe">consider subscribing to our Veriscope recap newsletter</a>.</p><p>Fraud Prevention: As the sector evolves, so will the techniques used by fraudulent actors. VASPs must continually refine their risk assessment methodologies to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, whether they arise from inconsistent compliance levels or inherent features of the crypto&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Customer Education: As compliance requirements become more complex, so does the user experience. VASPs will need to educate their customer base on what these new rules mean for them and how they are being implemented to protect everyone involved.</p><p>Dialogue with Regulators: Open communication channels with regulatory bodies can help VASPs gain clearer insights into upcoming changes and possibly influence future&nbsp;policy.</p><p>The journey towards full compliance with the FATF Travel Rule is more akin to a marathon than a sprint. With an evolving crypto landscape, shifting regulatory paradigms, and emerging technological solutions, VASPs operating in the UK — and indeed globally — need to stay agile, vigilant, and proactive in their approach to meeting these new challenges.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

				 <p>One initiative in the rapidly growing field of blockchain and decentralized systems provides an excellent case study on how <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/what-is-a-minimum-viable-ecosystem/">Minimum Viable Ecosystems</a> (MVEs) and <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/ecosystem-governance-framework/">Ecosystem Governance Frameworks</a> (EGFs) can drive innovation and community participation: Project Catalyst. This Cardano-based community project organizes funding rounds to support ideas that answer set challenges, with proposals selected through a transparent and democratic voting process.</p>
 What is a Minimum Viable Ecosystem and its Role in Ecosystem Governance? 
<p>An MVE is the foundational layer of an ecosystem designed to be as simple as possible while still functional and able to grow. Much like Project Catalyst, which starts each funding round with specific objectives and involves its community in evaluating and selecting proposals, an MVE establishes the essential stakeholders and governance structures to create a sustainable, growing ecosystem.</p>
<p>The goal of an MVE is to attract and align the stakeholders that are needed to drive the entire value proposition. This isn’t the same goal as an MVP.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Understand that a Minimum Viable Ecosystem is not about doing the least amount of work possible. It’s about identifying and focusing on the most critical elements for success.”</p>
</blockquote>
 Key Components of Ecosystem Governance in a Minimum Viable Ecosystem 
<p>Drawing from the best practices of Project Catalyst, building an MVE involves several core elements:</p>
<p>Stakeholder Engagement: Every individual or entity involved—from users to developers—shapes the ecosystem. In Project Catalyst, community members are incentivized to review and evaluate proposals, making them passengers and co-pilots.</p>
<p>Data-Driven Decision-Making: Community sentiment and performance metrics guide Project Catalyst, and the same should be true for any MVE.</p>
<p>Value Proposition: In Project Catalyst, the value lies in community-driven innovation. Your ecosystem should similarly offer something compelling to its participants.</p>
<p>Ecosystem Governance Framework: Project Catalyst has a transparent voting and accountability system. Effective governance keeps an ecosystem fair, functional and aligned with its overarching vision.</p>
<p>Organizations can cultivate robust, adaptable ecosystems that innovate and drive sustainable growth by understanding and applying these principles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Conditional Access overview&nbsp;is a built-in dashboard that offers a comprehensive view of your Conditional Access posture. As an administrator, it provides a concise summary of your policies,&nbsp;identifies any gaps in your policy coverage, and provides valuable insights based on sign-in activity within your tenant. This feature enables you to swiftly pinpoint areas where you can enhance the enforcement of Zero Trust principles, ultimately bolstering your defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 1 Conditional Access overview
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dashboard is now the default landing page of Conditional Access. As the first entry point into Conditional Access, the overview page lets you quickly create new policies using one of the Conditional Access templates which capture commonly used policies and best practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dashboard also offers the following insights and reporting capabilities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 &nbsp;The “See all unprotected sign-ins” link under the Users tile helps you rapidly identify users that are signing in without the protections of a Conditional Access policy. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 2 Sign-ins without CA coverage during the last 7 days
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The ‘See all non-compliant devices’ and ‘See all unmanaged devices’ links under the Devices tile help you identify device compliance gaps. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 3 Non-compliant devices
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 You can discover the top 10 most accessed apps without Conditional Access coverage using the coverage tab and go one step further and identify the users without coverage for that app by clicking on the numbers in the ‘Users without coverage’ column. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 4: Top accessed applications without CA coverage
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can discover security alerts generated based on sign-in activity in your tenant and take quick action on the alerts by deploying recommended zero trust conditional access policies using the Conditional Access templates. Speaking of which, let’s take a brief&nbsp;walkthrough of Conditional Access templates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional Access templates&nbsp;are a pre-defined set of conditions and controls that provide a convenient method to deploy new policies aligned with Microsoft recommendations. Customers are assured that their policies reflect modern best practices for securing corporate assets, promoting secure, optimal access for their hybrid workforce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional Access templates are organized across five scenarios:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure foundation 
 Zero Trust 
 Remote work 
 Protect administrators 
 Emerging threats 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can choose from 16 predefined Conditional Access templates based on their specific needs. Here is an example!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the&nbsp;“Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for admins”&nbsp;Conditional Access template, customers can reduce the risk of compromise and phishing attacks on privileged users. This powerful template uses&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/conditional-access-authentication-strength-is-now-generally/ba-p/3773134">Conditional Access authentication strengths</a>&nbsp;to help you choose the right authentication method requirements for specific scenarios, making it easier than ever for organizations to move their most critical users towards more secure, modern, and strong authentication.</p>

 How identified signing can make a difference. 
<p>In this 2-part blog series we provide an overview of the problematics around digitization, specifically on the challenges with remote signatures and some of the options available to limit risks of fraud and increase confidence in your signing process.</p>
<p>We previously explained the challenges around remote signatures for business-critical process, and which options are available to ensure secure and identity-verified signing workflows. Two of these options are digital signatures and eID schemes.</p>
<p>Digital signing: high-assurance signatures from trusted authorities</p>
<p>A digital signature is a specific type of electronic signature; it is not just a visual mark on a PDF document, but a cryptographic operation that binds the signatory’s credentials – in the form of a digital certificate – with the document they are signing. Because a copy of the digital certificate is embedded into the electronic document that is being signed, anyone can verify the signature and identity data in the document, without the need for a separate audit trail.</p>
<p>Digital certificates are issued to individuals and organizations by publicly trusted certification authorities (CAs) – or qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) in the European Union – after these authorities have proceeded with a standardized identity verification process. These digital certificates embed the identity details that were verified. They are only considered “trusted” if they are issued by an authority that is trusted itself. Public CAs and QTSPs such as Entrust follow strict guidelines and go through audits and certifications to earn and maintain the relevant accreditations and remain trusted.</p>
<p>The beauty of digital signatures on documents is that they not only embed verified identity details of the signatory but also provide tamper evidence. A digital signature does indeed bind a digital certificate to the exact content that is signed. A single change in the signed document, even on its metadata, will break the signature. Finally, most CAs and QTSPs also provide a timestamping service, to affix the exact date and time of a signature. This helps to ensure that the existence of a document and the signature cannot be denied.</p>
<p>eIDs and the role of eIDAS in streamlining identity verification processes</p>
<p>eIDs are a growing alternative to identification services, whether from a software or a Certification Authority. An eID schemes consist in a database of verified identities of a specific population that enrolled for the scheme and went through an identity verification process. The most significant benefit of an eID scheme is that, once an eID is created, it can be re-used for a multiple of use-cases, which removes the need for further identity verifications.</p>
<p>To be recognized and accepted everywhere, eID schemes require strong standards and protocols to define, for example, how the identity is verified, how it is stored, how one requests access to some of this data, how a person consents to sharing their data, etc. This is why some regulations are emerging, and perhaps the most notable one is eIDAS.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with eIDAS, it is the European Union’s regulation on the use of eID and electronic signatures across EU member countries, and it’s a global reference when it comes to eIDs and electronic signatures. eIDAS aims to encourage cross-border transactions by ensuring that all EU member countries have the same definition of electronic signatures – note the plural for signatures, because eIDAS doesn’t define one but three types of signatures based on the level of assurance they provide.</p>
<p>eIDAS was published in 2016, and since then all EU member countries have been relying on it for electronic signature standards, and because signatures are inherently linked to identity proving, eIDAS is also driving the deployment of eID schemes across industries and countries in the EU.</p>
<p>It’s worth knowing that there are “private” eID schemes, which are typically industry specific. For example, BankID is an eID scheme managed by a consortium of Scandinavian banks and recognized by governments. But more and more EU governments are also preparing or deploying their own national eID scheme, which allows citizens to enroll for a national eID that can be used to prove their identity online, and notably as part of a signing process.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>The digital transformation sweeping across the business landscape has made efficiency and security two sides of the same coin. User provisioning stands at this crossroads, orchestrating both aspects seamlessly. But what is it, and why should organizations care? In this article, we navigate the intricacies of user provisioning and underscore its pivotal role in today’s enterprise ecosystem.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 User Provisioning as a Business Enabler: Efficient user provisioning boosts operational efficiency, security, and employee morale. It accelerates the onboarding process, safeguards sensitive data, and sets a positive tone for new hires, increasing productivity. 
 The Importance of Continuous Oversight: Regular audits of access rights and systematic de-provisioning for departing employees are essential. This ensures maintained security, compliance, and seamless business continuity. 
 
 Understanding the Basics of User Provisioning 
<p>User provisioning can be seen as the backbone of user access management. It involves creating, updating, managing, and even terminating user accounts in systems and applications. This intricate process plays a vital role in Identity and Access Management (IAM) – a broader perspective that ensures people access only what they’re permitted to at the proper intervals.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, user provisioning isn’t just about granting access. De-provisioning, or stripping users of specific rights and access when no longer necessary, is equally crucial. This ensures that former employees or those changing roles do not retain undue access, guarding against potential vulnerabilities.</p>
 Benefits of Effective User Provisioning 
<p></p>
<p>Delving into user provisioning reveals more than just managing access; it’s a gateway to reshaping organizational dynamics. Here are the ways effective provisioning impacts an organization:</p>
 
 Streamlined Onboarding: An efficient provisioning system means quicker integration for new employees. Instead of waiting for days or even weeks, new team members can get started almost immediately. This enhances productivity and improves the overall employee experience, setting a positive tone from day one. 
 Enhanced Security: Security remains a top concern for enterprises, and rightly so. User provisioning mitigates risks by ensuring that only the right people can access the right resources. This proactive approach can deter internal breaches and ensure that sensitive data remains well-guarded. 
 Improved Compliance: Compliance standards, often seen as cumbersome, become more manageable with systematic user provisioning. Whether GDPR, HIPAA, or any other regulation, streamlined access management ensures that audits are smooth and violations are rare. 
 Reduced Human Errors: Automating user provisioning drastically reduces manual errors. These errors, often overlooked, can be costly in terms of both time and potential security breaches. 
 Optimal Resource Utilization: When IT teams aren’t swamped with access requests or troubleshooting access issues, they can divert their energy to more strategic tasks. This optimization can drive innovation and keep organizations ahead in the competitive curve. 
 
<p>With these benefits in mind, it’s worthwhile to delve deeper into the mechanisms and components that make such provisioning possible.</p>
 Components of User Provisioning 
<p><br>
User provisioning is an intricate system of interconnected parts. To grasp its full breadth, let’s explore these essential components:</p>
 
 Provisioning Policies and Rules: These aren’t mere guidelines but the foundational principles of user provisioning. They determine the criteria for granting or revoking access, ensuring a standardized approach. 
 User Roles and Entitlements: The focus shifts to organizational hierarchy and job functions. By categorizing access based on roles (like manager or analyst), it ensures that users only access what’s relevant to their job function, nothing more, nothing less. 
 Connectors: These technical integrations allow user provisioning systems to communicate with other applications and platforms. Whether cloud services, internal databases, or third-party apps, connectors ensure seamless data flow and user management. 
 Approval Workflows: Not all access requests are granted automatically. Some require managerial or departmental approval. An integrated workflow ensures these requests don’t get stuck in limbo and are either approved or denied promptly. 
 Notification Systems: Keeping users and IT teams in the loop is essential. Whether it’s an approved request, a revoked access, or a pending verification, timely notifications ensure transparency and prompt action. 
 
 The Role of Automation in User Provisioning 
<p>Automation isn’t just a tool; it’s a game-changer in the world of user provisioning. Delving into its role, we can uncover the transformative effects of automation:</p>
 
 Simplifying Tasks: Routine tasks, when automated, free up valuable time. It ensures that provisioning happens in real-time, reducing latency and enhancing productivity. 
 Benefits of Automated Provisioning: Beyond mere time-saving, automation brings consistency, efficiency, and scalability. It ensures uniformity in how access is managed across the organization, regardless of size or complexity. 
 Popular Tools: With the rise of digital transformation, numerous tools have sprung up, offering robust provisioning capabilities. These tools, tailored for diverse organizational needs, provide comprehensive solutions that make user provisioning more efficient and less error-prone. 
 
 Role-based Access Control in User Provisioning: 
<p>The nexus between roles and access rights defines a paradigm where security and functionality converge. To understand its transformative nature, let’s explore Role-Based Access Control in the landscape of user provisioning:</p>
 Defining Role-based Access Control (RBAC): 
<p>RBAC is a method where permissions are associated with specific roles rather than individual users. When a user is assigned to a role, they inherit the permissions that come with it. This methodology streamlines administrative tasks and reinforces the principle of least privilege.</p>
 The Alignment with User Provisioning: 
<p>RBAC is invaluable within the context of user provisioning. As organizations scale, manually assigning permissions to every new hire becomes untenable. With RBAC, predefined roles assigned during the provisioning process automatically dictate access levels, ensuring security without compromising efficiency.</p>
<p>Beyond general automation benefits, there’s a specific area worth exploring: the automated assignment of permissions and its profound advantages.</p>
 The Advantages of Automated Permission Assignment: 
 Eliminating Human Error: 
<p>Manual processes, by their very nature, are prone to errors. Oversights can lead to security vulnerabilities or operational inefficiencies. Automated permission assignment addresses these risks by consistently applying access rights according to predefined criteria.</p>
 Staying Current with Dynamic Roles: 
<p>In agile business environments, roles can be fluid. An employee might start in marketing and transition to sales within months. Automated permission assignment ensures that access rights remain relevant, secure, and efficient as these roles evolve.</p>
 Challenges in User Provisioning 
<p>Even the best systems face obstacles, and user provisioning is no stranger to challenges. As we dive deeper, here are some hurdles that need attention:</p>
 
 Complex IT Environments: Larger organizations or those undergoing mergers face a labyrinth of systems and applications. This complexity can make provisioning a daunting task, demanding more sophisticated solutions. 
 Changing Business Needs: Business dynamics shift. Whether it’s a new department, a change in hierarchy, or the adoption of new technology, user provisioning systems must be agile enough to adapt without hiccups. 
 Continuous Compliance: As governments and industries tighten regulations, staying compliant is an ongoing challenge. User provisioning systems must be updated regularly to accommodate these evolving standards. 
 Balancing Usability and Security: The tug-of-war between security and ease of use is accurate. Too tight a system can impede operations, while a lax one can open up vulnerabilities. Striking the right balance is crucial. 
 
<p>While these challenges are significant, adopting a set of best practices can act as a shield, guiding organizations toward success in user provisioning.</p>
 Addressing Employee Departures: The Imperative of Deprovisioning: 
<p>Employee transitions, while natural, bring to light crucial concerns in the realm of access management. Diving into this topic, we uncover the imperatives and nuances of deprovisioning:</p>
 Potential Risks of Neglect: 
<p>Unchecked access post-departure can have severe consequences. Beyond obvious security concerns, there’s a risk of non-compliance with regulations that mandate timely revocation of access. Furthermore, lingering access can lead to data breaches, either maliciously by disgruntled former employees or inadvertently.</p>
 The Process of Systematic Deprovisioning: 
<p>Deprovisioning is a multi-step process that involves more than just turning off access. It starts with an exit checklist, followed by the actual revocation of access across all systems. Then, a review ensures that no residual permissions linger. Additionally, critical roles and responsibilities held by the departing employee must be reassigned to ensure business continuity.</p>
 Best Practices for Implementing User Provisioning 
<p>The journey of user provisioning is one of continual refinement. And anchoring this journey are the best practices that illuminate the path to both security and efficiency:</p>
 
 Regular Audits and Reviews: Periodically reviewing access rights can unearth anomalies. Whether it’s a user with excessive rights or outdated access, regular checks ensure a clean slate. 
 Clear Policies and Procedures: Ambiguity can be a system’s downfall. Clear, documented procedures ensure everyone knows the drill, from IT teams to end-users. 
 User Education: While systems do the heavy lifting, users are the first line of defense. Educating them about the importance of security and best practices can prevent inadvertent breaches. 
 Integration with Current IT Infrastructure: The best provisioning system fits seamlessly with existing setups, enhancing capabilities rather than adding friction. 
 Documentation: Documentation isn’t just bureaucratic red tape. It’s a vital record that tracks changes and reasons for access and provides a reference point during audits or reviews. 
 
<p>With these guidelines, organizations stand poised to make the most of user provisioning, ensuring a harmonious blend of security and operational ease.</p>
 Constructing a Business Case for User Provisioning: 
<p>Beyond its technical dimensions, user provisioning speaks a language that resonates with business outcomes. To discern its broader implications, let’s dissect the business case for this pivotal process:</p>
 Beyond Just Security: 
<p>User provisioning isn’t just a security protocol; it’s a business enabler. Beyond safeguarding assets, it streamlines IT operations, reduces overheads, and accelerates onboarding. Each of these factors translates to tangible cost savings and operational efficiencies.</p>
 Enhancing Productivity and Morale: 
<p>An indirect yet pronounced benefit of efficient user provisioning on employee morale exists. Their productivity soars when staff can access the necessary tools and data without bureaucratic delays. Furthermore, a smooth onboarding experience, free from access-related hiccups, sets a positive tone for their tenure.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Throughout our discussion, we’ve highlighted how user provisioning reshapes how organizations approach efficiency and security. The next step in this evolution is embracing tools that further enhance these strategies.

 While the global gambling industry holds its collective breath for the formal approval of Brazil’s regulatory framework, we investigate what operators can expect from Brazil’s upcoming gambling license structure… 



 



<p>Online gambling is already big business in Brazil, despite the absence of a fully regulated environment or licensing structure.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, while the industry <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2023/08/31/68571-deputy-arthur-lira-says-brazil-sports-betting-bill-set-to-be-approved-next-week">awaits final regulatory approval </a>on an online regulatory framework, Brazil still manages to generate over<a href="https://denmark.net/top-countries-online-gambling-traffic/?expand_article=1"> 20% of all global online gambling</a> traffic.</p>



<p>Brazil’s lack of online gaming and gambling regulations means Brazilian gamblers are either using foreign gambling platforms, or Brazilian-owned platforms headquartered abroad. It is for this reason that the Brazilian authorities have introduced new regulations to help the Brazilian gambling market capture what is viewed as lost revenue (<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">a projected $1.5 billion in 2023</a>) and bring it back into the Brazilian economy.</p>



 History of Brazilian gambling regulation. 



<p>Gambling has enjoyed a long-standing place in the heart of Brazilian culture. Until the early 1940s, games of chance, like rolling dice, was a popular activity in Brazil until the then President introduced a blanket ban. The belief is that this was driven by his and his wife’s devout catholic views.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This remained in place until the 1970s, when state-owned lotteries were permitted to run. In the mid-1980s, betting on horseracing was allowed, and in 1993, the Zico Act legalized commercial bingo and slot machines. However, the 1998 Pele Act (no relation to the football star) revoked commercialized bingo, leaving only non-commercial games permissible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only game that has remained legal in the Brazilian gambling market is poker, which has always been regarded as a game of skill rather than chance. Even now, poker remains completely unregulated, however this is likely to change with upcoming regulations.<br>In 2015, alongside the passing of <a href="https://thelawreviews.co.uk/title/the-gambling-law-review/brazil">Law No. 13,155</a>, virtual and land-based instant lotteries (sweepstakes) were created.</p>



<p>Discussions regarding the regulation of Brazilian sports betting regulations have been ongoing since 2018, when Congress authorized the federal government to regulate online sports betting. A four-year timeframe was set for the government to implement a licensing regime, which expired in 2022. It was then&nbsp; decided that the regulatory regime should go through Parliament as a legislative bill, not as an emergency measure by the Ministry of Finance.</p>



<p>Further steps toward legalizing and maintaining a safe regulation of gambling in Brazil began in March 2023, with the formation of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/abradie/">Associação Brasileira de Defesa da Integridade do Esporte (ABRADIE)</a>. ABRADIE is a not-for-profit company founded and run by a wide range of sports and gambling legislation experts to provide a safe and secure environment for those partaking in online gambling in Brazil. The organization’s mission is to ensure the new Brazilian gambling licensing structure protects all relevant parties from fraud and other nefarious practices that can run rampant through this particular industry.</p>



 



 

 



 The current legal framework. 



<p>The current legal framework regarding gambling laws in Brazil remains largely uncontrolled. The only legalized forms of gambling are through state-owned means such as lotteries, horse racing, or non-commercial bingo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under current Brazilian gaming jurisdiction, poker, fantasy sports betting, and games of skill are legal but have no governing regulatory bodies and therefore offer no protection from fraud or other activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, the increasing popularity of online gambling in Brazil has called into question the effectiveness and logic of the ban, as the existing laws did not cover the concept of online gambling. </p>



<p>In 2018, the first steps toward change were made when fixed-odds sports betting was legalized through state-controlled means, and in 2020, non-commercial bingo was legalized. Unlike games of chance, games of skill like Fantasy Sports betting are legal but completely&nbsp; unregulated. Games of chance remain entirely illegal. However, the Brazilian gambling licensing structure will undergo a significant overhaul, alongside proposed gambling laws, overseen by ABRADIE.</p>



 The road to regulation: Brazilian gambling licensing. 



<p>Brazilian gambling regulations will add security and governance, and also, of course, permit the formation&nbsp; of new domestic-based companies. In fact, one of the core factors driving the need for licensing is monetary. It is worth noting that Brazil’s surge in online gambling has coincided with the decline of the Brazilian economy, which has dropped from being the <a href="https://brazilian.report/liveblog/2022/03/04/world-biggest-economies/">world’s 7th largest economy to the 13th&nbsp; in just over a decade</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By introducing gambling permits and online betting licenses in Brazil, the authorities aim to cash in on the immense tax revenue potential.</p>



<p>Online gambling in Brazil is expected to grow by<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil"> around 20% by 2027</a>. These optimistic projections reinforce the importance and need for online gambling regulations and licensing practices in Brazil.</p>



 Categories of gambling licenses in the Brazilian licensing structure. 



<p>There is not one specific&nbsp; government agency that is responsible for issuing gambling licenses in Brazil. For example, the Secretariat for Competition Advocacy regulates lotteries and bingo events, while the Ministry of Agriculture regulates horse racing events. The formation of ABRADIE is the first step toward a comprehensive regulatory system that includes a comprehensive Brazilian gambling licensing structure.</p>



<p>The Ministry of Finance and ABRADIE will develop and regulate a licensing structure pending the finalization of the gambling regulations. This new structure will enforce<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/"> gambling compliance</a> and protect the industry from fraud and other illegal activities.</p>



 Eligibility and application process for Brazilian gambling licenses. 



<p>As there are currently no gambling licenses available in Brazil , there is no established eligibility criteria or application process. While the much-anticipated changes to the current laws will undoubtedly usher in new standards and application processes, nothing has been disclosed to hint at how this will work.</p>



 Compliance and regulatory standards. 



<p>A major challenge in opening up the Brazilian market to legalized gambling is to ensure the correct levels of compliance and protection are in place to keep everybody involved safe. While there are no such regulatory standards, the proposed Brazilian gambling licensing structure will be spearheaded by ABRADIE.</p>



<p>The key to establishing satisfactory regulatory compliance for Brazilian gambling will be to ensure that stringent fraud and anti-money laundering measures are in place. A vital part of this will be establishing strict and well-monitored checks for<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/"> fraud protection and identity proofing</a>.</p>



 Fees, taxation and revenue allocation. 



<p>While the Brazilian authorities currently enforce no taxation or revenue allocation requirements, the increasing likelihood of legislation changes has given rise to discussions on&nbsp; taxation rates. These discussions are <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2023/05/25/ibjr-calls-for-a-rethink-on-brazils-betting-tax-and-licensing-demands/">being led </a>by the IBJR <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/instituto-brasileiro-jogo-responsavel-ibjr/">(Brazil Institute for Responsible Gaming)</a> who are calling for negotiations over the proposed high tax and license rates.</p>



<p>Below is the current proposed structure for licensed gambling operators by the Brazilian authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rumored cost to obtain a gambling license will be <a href="https://igamingbrazil.com/en/legislation-en/2023/03/22/licenses-for-betting-sites-in-brazil-will-cost-brl-30-million/">BR$30 million</a> (US$6.1 million) per operator for three years, and then it will need to be renewed. Operators that wish to qualify for a Brazilian gambling license must be headquartered in Brazil and have a minimum capital of <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2023/08/31/68571-deputy-arthur-lira-says-brazil-sports-betting-bill-set-to-be-approved-next-week">BR$100,000 (US$20,000) </a>At this time, there is no further information on whether there will be different tiers of license, depending on the different online gambling offerings.</p>



<p>Operators within the online gambling sector will be taxed at 18% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR), of which 10% will go directly into Brazil’s social security budget. A sub-fund will be set up as part of the National Fund for Public Security, which will receive 2.55% of the total tax revenue. This fund will ensure correct and effective measures are set up to combat money laundering, match-fixing, and other illegal activities that could threaten those working in the Brazil gambling market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For players, a proposed tax levy of 30% will be placed on any winnings over BR$2,112 (US$430).</p>



 Challenges and controversies. 



<p>Changing a country’s gambling laws and introducing new regulations for an already multi-billion dollar industry is understandably not without challenges, concerns, and controversies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the core concerns is the social impact of introducing a regulated Brazilian gambling licensing structure. The safety of players should be paramount to the Brazilian authorities. While legalizing gambling will open up the sector to increased numbers of operators and customers, it will also result in increased risk of fraud, match-fixing, and other fraudulent activities that could cause irreparable harm. Ensuring due attention is paid to creating and enforcing safety rules, and responsible gambling measures must come first and foremost in operators’ plans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The economic boost created by gambling legislation in Brazil is understandably appealing for new and old operators alike. However, in the race to become licensed, it is important to strike a balance between maximizing profitability and ensuring the safety of all parties.</p>

 Successful gambling licensing models. 



<p>To introduce a successful gambling licensing model, the Brazilian authorities would be well served to study and learn from the experiences of other markets, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">Ontario</a> or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta</a>, as well as the <a href="https://iagr.org/">International Association of Gaming Regulators (IAGR)</a>. The IAGR consists of representatives from gaming regulatory organizations throughout the world, including ABRADIE, which meet and exchange knowledge on best regulatory gaming practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-get-uk-gambling-licence/"> UKGC gambling licensing structure</a>&nbsp; [which is also going through major revisions to bring it up-to-date with the online gambling era] provides a fantastic framework for successful licensing regulation and is a good case study for the Brazilian gambling licensing process. A clearly defined application process is crucial, as ensuring the correct level of information is provided for acceptance and ongoing protection creates a bubble of safety that encourages growth and attracts new business.</p>

 Technological advancements and future legislation. 



<p>With the rapid advancement of technology and the global expansion of online gambling, the future presents both lucrative opportunities and dangerous pitfalls. It is therefore essential to establish clear licensing structures that address emerging risks, ensure user safety, and prevent system abuse.</p>



<p>The rise in online gambling in Brazil began amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and has caused a groundswell pointing toward highly sustainable growth for the foreseeable future. Early predictions show expected growth from $2.1 billion to <a href="https://www.delasport.com/brazil-igaming-market-report/">£2.6 billion by 2026</a>. Of course, the forecast is based on the current landscape, which has no comprehensive regulatory framework. By introducing a well-managed legislation and licensing structure, the future of gambling in Brazil is even brighter, and would significantly boost its dwindling economy.</p>



<p>The proposed changes and introduction of a Brazilian gambling licensing structure will see gambling legalized and regulated for the first time since the 1940s. This will open up a world of possibilities for the emergence of new Brazilian-based gambling companies. The market would become instantly more accessible while also bringing a level of safety to all involved.</p>



<p>Online gambling is huge in Brazil, with&nbsp; <a href="https://tgmresearch.com/gambling-sports-betting-market-research-in-brazil.html">86,43% of sports fans</a> admitting to using online betting services. The current lack of active legislation and licensing for gambling in Brazil means other countries benefit from Brazil’s keen interest in the iGaming market. Although the potential impact of Brazil formally and legally entering the gambling market will benefit the iGaming industry on a global scale, it will likely impact the markets of the individual countries’ and gambling jurisdictions who are currently collecting Brazilian online gambling traffic.</p>

 Brazilian gambling license FAQs. 


 
 
 
 What types of gambling activities are allowed under the Brazilian licensing structure? 
 

<p>The only forms of permitted gambling under the Brazilian licensing structure are state-owned, such as lotteries and horse racing. No non-state-driven operators are allowed to be active in Brazil. However, changes are in the works, with a finalized plan to issue gambling licenses in Brazil going through a final ratification process. This will see the introduction of purchasable gambling licenses and the revocation of a law in place since the early 1940s.</p>

 
 
 
 How does Brazil’s taxation system for gambling operators work 
 

<p>The Brazilian taxation system for gambling operators works by taxing operators approximately 18% of their GGR. This taxation will be spread across several government funds, primarily the Social Security budget, with an additional portion being appropriated to help track and prevent fraud and other illegal activities within the newly regulated space.</p>

 
 
 
 What responsible gambling measures are in place to address gambling addiction? 
 

<p>Under the final gambling regulation drafts, all gambling or iGaming operators in Brazil must point out the dangers of gambling addiction. Additionally, those currently listed as under the control of credit protection agencies or those with a poor credit rating are still prohibited from gambling through Brazilian-based iGaming companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An extensive campaign stresses the importance of self-control and responsibility when gambling to prevent people from getting into trouble.</p>

 
 
 
 Are foreign entities eligible to apply for gambling licenses in Brazil? 
 

<p>Yes, under the current proposal, foreign entities are eligible to apply for gambling licenses in Brazil. Under the new proposals for gambling permits in Brazil, both foreign and national operators will need to meet the same set of requirements that will be scrutinized by the Finance Ministry.</p>

 
 
 
 Does Brazil allow gambling? 
 

<p>For more than seven decades, Brazil has maintained a strict prohibition on the vast majority of gambling pursuits. Since the sweeping decree of 1941 that outlawed games of chance, the nation has permitted only two legal forms of gambling: state-controlled lotteries and wagering on horse racing events. To date, Games of chance remain entirely illegal. Nonetheless, the Brazilian gambling licensing framework is poised for a substantial transformation, aligning with impending gambling legislation and overseen by ABRADIE.</p>

 
 
 
 What is the legal gambling age in Brazil? 
 

<p>The Brazilian Civil Code classifies bets as contractual agreements, hence permitting only individuals aged 18 and older to engage in legal gambling activities.</p>

  <p>Somit werden auch kleinere Unternehmen innerhalb von digitalisierten Lieferketten von NIS2 betroffen sein. Da eine Lieferkette immer nur so stark wie ihr schwächstes Glied ist, müssen sich alle Player innerhalb der Kette gegen die Risiken von Cyberangriffen schützen. Schlimmstenfalls kann sonst Industriespionage dazu führen, dass vertrauliche Informationen gestohlen, Produktionsanlagen gehackt oder der Informationsfluss und der Produktionsablauf gestört werden und so ganze Wirtschaftszweige lahmgelegt werden. Deshalb müssen Unternehmen jedweder Größe jetzt tätig werden und die Umsetzung der NIS2-Richtlinie einleiten.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole Principal Analyst Martin Kuppinger wird einleitend erklären, warum es NIS2 braucht und weshalb Organisationen sich frühzeitig damit auseinandersetzen und eine Identity-Roadmap erstellen sollten.</p>
<p>Klaus Hild, Principal Identity Strategist bei SailPoint, wird anhand von Beispielen darlegen, warum sich Unternehmen Gedanken über den „Lifecycle“ eines Mitarbeiters machen sollten, auch wenn dieser womöglich bereits das Unternehmen verlassen hat und wie Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) Lieferketten beeinflusst.</p>
<p>Abschließend wird Dr. Sven Hübner, Head of Consulting, Principal Consultant bei KOGIT GmbH, erläutern welche Relevanz NIS2 im Bereich der Lieferketten-Sicherheit hat und wie Projektkosten durch gezielte Planung kontrollierbar bleiben.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/warum-identity-governance"></a>

				  Indicio’s new open-source tool enables websockets to quickly manage large scale mediation without dropping messages  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Colton Watkins</p>
<p>Imagine the following&nbsp; scenario. It’s a Friday morning, the first day of a convention that only comes around once a year, and you’re extremely excited about attending. It’s one of the few yearly events that you’re willing to ask your boss for time off to attend. This year, the convention happens to be using a digital ticket system built on the new <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries Framework</a> technology, and they’ve issued a virtual ticket to a mobile app on your phone. Because the technology is so new, you chose the app that the convention’s website recommended you download.</p>
<p>The new ticket system is supposed to make the entire process of checking in and getting your badge quicker and more convenient than ever before. There’s no need to rush to be early as the lines should be pretty short. Getting ready for the day ahead, you grab your phone, leave your hotel room, and head to the convention center.</p>
<p>The Problem</p>
<p>A short walk later, you make it to the convention center only to be greeted with slow moving lines. This new technology is supposed to be faster, so why are the lines moving as slow as or slower than the previous system?</p>
<p>Turns out, you weren’t the only one who went with the first phone app recommended to you on the convention’s website. Most everyone chose to do the same and, upon checking-in, the convention staff encountered issues retrieving the tickets from each person’s phone. The massive amount of people trying to enter the convention at the same time have overloaded the Mediator the app on their phone was using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Mediator is a service that allows software agents (such as those issuing or verifying credentials) to contact other agents that may not have a static IP address—such as mobile devices—or that may be behind a firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overloaded Mediator leaves&nbsp; the convention center&nbsp; struggling to communicate&nbsp; with conference attendee’s mobile wallets.</p>
<p>Introducing SocketDock</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock">SocketDock</a> is a new tool service created by Indicio that we’ve donated to the open-source community via the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>. In the world of fast and responsive technology, websockets are the go-to solution for quick and snappy applications; however, using websockets means that an online service needs to be able to maintain a continuous connection with the user’s application. Depending on the server architecture, this could spell bad news when it comes to creating clustered applications. A clustered application is when&nbsp; more than one server is used to service many more users than a single server can service on their own. In practice, there are many different ways to handle this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our scenario, if the mediation were to be clustered out to distribute the load, performance would increase and the slowdowns would disappear; however, we would then encounter an issue with missed messages. When the convention center asks you for your ticket, its system would send the request to one of the clustered mediators for your ticket information.&nbsp; But unless it&nbsp; talks to the same computer system that your phone happens to be connected to, the Mediator would have no idea where to send the message and it would be forced to store it for later retrieval — resulting in your phone needing to manually request the messages from the mediator. This is not a great user experience.</p>
<p>How can SocketDock Help?</p>
<p>When Mediators are running on multiple servers, messages to mobile agents need to be sent to the mediator server that the mobile agent is directly connected to. To get around this, we need to separate the websocket server from the Mediator’s application server. Doing so allows mediators to instantly forward messages to mobile agents without concern for which server an agent is connected to. That’s exactly what SocketDock was made to do. SocketDock can sit behind a load balancer, forwarding any messages that it receives to a mediation system (or any system that runs an HTTP/S server). When a message is forwarded to the mediator, extra information is included in the request informing the mediator as to where it can send replies to.&nbsp;<br>Now the convention staff can request your ticket from the mediator and the mediator doesn’t need to have an active connection to the mobile wallet. All it needs to know is which instance of SocketDock to send a message to, bringing back the speed and snappiness to the application and providing the user with a better experience. The lines leading to the convention center’s check-in stations should be moving a lot faster now that the mediator isn’t overloaded.</p>

				 <p>Where can I get SocketDock?</p>
<p>All of this sounds fine and dandy, but it’s not very useful unless it can be deployed in front of a clustered mediator system. Fortunately, all of the code is open-sourced over on GitHub in the Hyperledger organization, which you can find here: <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock</a></p>
<p>How can I get involved</p>
<p>If you’re looking to learn more about SocketDock, or how you can help out, there are multiple ways to get involved. You can do so by joining the discord or the weekly User Group/Working Group meetings. Links to both of these are on the Hyperledger website.<br><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries</a></p>
<p>Another way to help out is by submitting any issues that you may find or submitting pull requests to contribute fixes over at the SocketDock repository. While it may not seem like it, users of the technology can have a larger impact than they realize, so don’t be afraid to lend a hand.</p>
<p>And if you have questions about implementing your own full decentralized solution don’t hesitate to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out to the team at Indicio.</a></p>

<p>Embossed payment cards have been the industry standard since their inception in the 1950s, when point-of-sale terminals included carbon copy card imprinters. With growing innovation in payment card ecosystems, flat card formats are rapidly gaining momentum around the world, as financial institutions, issuers, and consumers recognize the value and opportunity they bring. Even though traditional embossing offers a robust, tactile look and feel, it continues to wane in popularity vs. newer trends. This evolution to an un-embossed card, or more commonly called flat card, continues to drive positive outcomes. In fact, a recent Entrust survey showed that 77% of issuers polled experienced higher transaction volumes after adopting flat cards. Let’s look at a few reasons un-embossed cards continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Aesthetic Appeal</p>
<p>Flat cards are, put simply, cool, hip, and trendy. They aren’t exactly new to the card issuance market, but they continue to dazzle consumers with a sleek, durable finish. In fairness, the acceptance of this alternative to embossing took time to adopt, as first impressions for some were that the “flatness” of these cards gave them a cheap feel. In hindsight, those first-generation flat cards used an identical design layout to their predecessors, giving the initial user interface a “substitution effect.” Account information and other personal identifiers were all located in the same place, but the embossed characters were absent, leaving consumers to question whether this switch was merely a cost consideration or sourcing exercise from their card issuer. Over the past few years though, banks, issuers, and marketers alike have flipped the script to shift paradigm with flat cards by trying new things to entice consumers. The result has been nothing short of demonstrable eye-popping design and card-orientation flexibility, giving flat cards top-of-wallet status today with a clean, modern look.</p>
<p>Brand-Building Opportunities</p>
<p>With the movement of personal information to the back of the card, the front has morphed into a blank canvas to bring a bank’s brand to life. Banks are even able to call out niche programs like eco-friendly, loyalty, or others that connect more meaningfully to consumers. In parallel, flat card designs offer an enhanced user experience (UX) by offering <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/central/financial-card/c/print-on-demand">print-on-demand</a> features like the ability to customize them with high-quality personal pictures directly printed onto a card (i.e., family portrait, kids, pets, sports, etc.). Additional options like vertical card orientation, stacked primary account number (PAN), and full edge-to-edge printing offer limitless opportunities to make the physical card experience exciting. Banks and consumers continue to connect with each other through these designs, while dynamic card verification value (CVV), embedded biometric sensors, and digital credentials also continue to surprise and delight customers throughout their financial credential journey.</p>
<p>Operational Efficiencies</p>
<p>Bureaus and card issuers continue to see shifts to flat card technology as their customers incorporate new requirements to capitalize on these enhanced benefits. In a recent Entrust survey, 60% of card-issuance respondents cited increased efficiency and/or reduced cost as a primary driver for switching to flat cards, in addition to market demands. As the scale of flat cards continues to ramp, so will operational gains, eventually leading to its place at the top of the preferred issuance technology list.</p>
<p>Overall, flat cards offer more flexibility and operational efficiency. Card marketers can simply go further with design, customization, and UX, and consumers like the look and feel of flat card technology. Banks can leverage flat card benefits to go further with top-of-wallet status, and issuers are citing improvements in their operating expenses.</p>
<p>Meeting the Moment</p>
<p>Entrust continues to support this movement by bridging the gap between personalization equipment, secure customer interactions, and the latest innovations in high-volume central and instant financial issuance for flat cards.

<p>In May 2023, Utah’s Governor <a href="https://governor.utah.gov/">Spencer</a><a href="https://governor.utah.gov/"> </a><a href="https://governor.utah.gov/">Cox</a> appointed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown">Steve</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown"> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown">McCown</a> (Chief Architect, <a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>) to serve on the state’s Personal Privacy Oversight Commission (PPOC). The PPOC was created in 2021 by the Utah State Legislature (see <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0243.html">H.B. 243</a>) in order to develop guiding standards and best practices for protecting personal data and to work directly with the Chief Privacy Officer to have those standards and practices adopted by government entities.</p>



 What is the Personal Privacy Oversight Commission (PPOC)? 



<p>The PPOC is comprised of twelve representatives from industry and government who collectively have expertise in cybersecurity, information technology, operational technology, law enforcement, data privacy law, civil liberties law, and prosecutorial / appellate law. Each of the members has been appointed by either the governor, state auditor, or the attorney general.</p>



<p>Government entities are required to collect, use, and share some personal data in order to provide public services. However, all processing of personal data by public entities must be done in a manner that protects privacy rights. Privacy and security principles and best practices must guide the way.</p>



<p>Utah has a pioneering history in privacy and security. In 1862, legislators in the Territory of Utah introduced the nation’s first communications privacy and security law, entitled An Act For the Regulation of the Telegraph, and to secure Secrecy and Fidelity in the transmission of Telegraphic Messages (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Acts_Resolutions_and_Memorials_Passed_by/Y2xLAQAAMAAJ">source</a>). Passed in January 1863, this forward-thinking law also established the legal standing and privacy requirements for electronic “Contracts”, “power of attorney”, “payment or delivery of money”, etc. when delivered by telegraph. Codifying a variation of e-commerce in the 1800s is pretty forward thinking!</p>



 Modern Challenges in Data Privacy 



<p>The expanding use of digital services experienced over the last few decades has changed the landscape for privacy and how it must be protected. Like most other governments, Utah’s data privacy and security practices grew organically in a time when personal privacy threats were rare and difficult to identify. Utah is responding to changing times, just as it did in 1862, by investing in proactive efforts to protect privacy rights. Rather than simply enacting data breach penalties, Utah is demonstrating a special concern for “the privacy implications and civil liberties concerns of the privacy practices of government entities” (<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0243.html">H.B. 243</a>).</p>



<p>In June 2023, Utah’s Office of the Legislative Auditor General published a report entitled “<a href="https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2023-07_RPT.pdf">A Performance Audit of the Collection, Protection, and Use of Personal Information by State Agencies</a>” (<a href="https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2023-07_SMRY.pdf">summary</a>, <a href="https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2023-07_PRSNT.pdf">slides</a>). Leading up to this report, the state conducted a statewide self-audit and found numerous different data collection policies and handling procedures. Given the current and emerging threats to personal data, the reported found that “current data collection and sharing practices create data privacy risk.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to protect the personal data collected and held by state agencies, the report recommends “defining data privacy in statute for all state agencies” and “requiring government entities to adopt data privacy principles that include items such as: clear consent, notice, and the disclosure of data collection, use, and sharing”. The report went on to recommend that “Statutory data privacy guardrails could alleviate the risk.”</p>



 Privacy Guardrails: Defining the Future 



<p>What are the “privacy guardrails”? That is the central focus of what is being created in the very near-term. Defining and proposing specific actions and requirements is currently underway and is expected to include a cohesive combination of legislation, policy, and training, together with leading technologies and technology standards.</p>



<p>Utah’s efforts are not only vital to the protection of Utahans’ data but are foreseen to provide an example or blueprint for other states and governments to follow. The work of the PPOC gives the state government important insights from experts in several key legal and technology domains, which will ensure that Utah’s solution meets the state’s technical and legal requirements. Utah’s privacy efforts are expected to provide far reaching benefits to government and private organizations globally. Anonyome Labs is proud to support Steve McCown as he serves as a member of Utah’s Personal Privacy Oversight Commission.</p>

 Platform solution fights underage gambling and bonus abuse, while preventing money laundering 



<p>Munich, September 5, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider, announces the integration of the Brazilian CPF database check (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas, Register of Natural Persons) into its multi-dimensional identity proofing and fraud prevention solution.</p>



<p>IDnow’s platform solution combines the new CPF database checks with automated document liveness capabilities, fully automated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) services, the latter of which screen against multiple global Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) and Sanction lists. To detect single and serial fraud attempts, IDnow’s platform uses proprietary fraud prevention technology that collects risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources.</p>



<p>Issued by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Department, the CPF document provides name, date of birth, and situation of CPF, among others, and is needed to vote, enter university, or go into politics in Brazil. The newly added CPF checks provide an additional layer of identity assurance from a trusted, federal source within the IDnow onboarding process.</p>



<p>In addition to the CPF, Brazilian citizens carry numerous kinds of paper-based documents with no standardized or centralized ID scheme from the federal government. Historically, this has made the automation of document proofing challenging. IDnow’s new solution addresses this problem head-on.</p>



<p>“We have collaborated with government and industry experts to ensure our solution delivers high automation for Brazil’s paper-based documents, in addition to an integration with the CPF database. This provides <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/">holistic, scalable identity assurance to Brazilian gaming and gambling operators</a>. When designing our solution for the Brazilian market, we quickly realized that without the additional security step of the CPF checks, it would be easy for fraudsters to forge documents. Out of all document proofing solutions, IDnow’s is one of the only ones to implement this check into its document verification process without any extra costs to the operator. KYC should never be a burden, but an enabler and we will continue to focus on that for our customers and players”, explains Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President Global Gaming at IDnow.</p>



<p>Seamlessly verify age and protect players, platform, brand and reputation</p>



<p>In light of <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/brazil-sports-betting/">the recent move of the Brazilian government to regulate sports betting</a>, the market is expected to grow further while operators will be looking for fully compliant solutions that stop money laundering and other financial crime in its tracks.</p>



<p>Redfearn-Tyrzyk explains: “One of the goals of the new regulation is to make sports betting safer for players and platforms by preventing fraud and underage gambling. IDnow’s automated solution with the integrated CPF checks can stop and protect underage individuals from engaging in gambling while still enabling a seamless and efficient onboarding that balances consumer demands for security and privacy without adding friction to their journey. Thanks to our high level of automation and orchestration, gambling providers can drive conversions and increase operational efficiencies while adhering to the new gambling regulations.”</p>



<p>An operator in the online gaming industry,&nbsp;<a href="https://eyasgaming.com/">Eyas Gaming</a>, is already partnering with IDnow in the Brazilian market. Andrejs Cuzans, Head of Fraud, Risk and Payments of Eyas Gaming, says: “Some new players who wish to sign up will go through an automated, AI-based document verification process. After having successfully partnered with IDnow in New Zealand, Eyas is expanding the collaboration to Latin America, by relying on the wide document coverage that IDnow provides.”</p>

			 Marçal Torà is a Back-End Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Marçal Torà, and I was born and raised in Barcelona. Before the age of 6, I always said, “when I am older, I want to be a firefighter!” — my father “ruined” that when he gave me a computer. From that moment on, I began experimenting with it in every possible way; I would install viruses disguised as regular software and then ask for his help to remove them. Then, at some point, I started playing online video games that were infested with cheaters, which led me to learn programming languages so that I could write my own, secure code and have a fair chance against them.</p>
<p>Being exposed to computers and technology at such a young age sparked a profound interest in me, and I was soon convinced that writing code was more interesting than extinguishing fires. I even forgot about video games completely to focus solely on personal projects. Later on, after finishing mandatory studies, I enrolled in a vocational degree program to continue learning in this field, and that’s how I became a Software Developer.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny, and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I was part of an emerging startup in Edinburgh. It is a very small team of four members, working on building an ad-free, privacy-preserving search engine. Working in such a recently-established and small company was enjoyable because we had a lot of freedom to shape the product to our liking.</p>
<p>At the time, however, I was looking for a change and came across an employment opportunity at Tokeny. I read about their modern and familiar tech stack, mission, and involvement in cutting-edge blockchain technologies. Since I have a keen interest in machine learning, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain, I was very interested in getting involved in a project like this. So, I reached out to Xavi, Head of Product, and on the day of my birthday, we had our first introductory call.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Fantastic! Working at Tokeny is an authentic definition of WFH (Work From Home)! Although there is an office in Luxembourg and a co-working space in Barcelona, most of the time, everybody works in silence from their homes. The traditional physical office has been reduced to Slack, which suits all our communication needs.</p>
<p>It’s certainly good to see each other once in a while, so if you happen to be around the aforementioned cities, you have the option to meet up with some of the other members of the company. However, not needing to work in a physical office gives you the freedom to organize your day according to your personal needs while also managing to complete all your tasks by the end of the day!</p>
<p>I am very happy to be here, surrounded by other committed individuals who are making a shared vision a reality.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p></p>
<p>To be honest, I enjoy what I do — writing code. However, over the years, I’ve come to realize that there is nothing like the outside world, nature, sports, or anything that brings a sense of well-being. To me, one of the best ways to spend my time nowadays is outdoors. I have become very passionate about doing a little bit of everything: running, cycling, swimming, and in the warmer seasons, I tend to do hikes around the region, whereas in winter, I exchange that with ski mountaineering.</p>
<p>Engaging in so many disciplines is challenging but fun and entertaining. It has also revealed a lot about myself and made me more conscious of how I treat my body because injuries are setbacks, but they also force you to learn more about the anatomy of the body to find ways to overcome them.</p>
<p>It’s not all about sports and nature. One also needs to rest and nourish oneself properly, both physically and mentally. In the last few years, I have been learning a lot about nutrition and neuroscience, respectively. In summary, I would say that these topics have become my biggest interests, and my greatest passion has been putting all this knowledge into practice.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I would love to learn a language, travel to its country of origin, and sound like a native. This would be a dream come true and a very fulfilling experience!</p>
 What excites you about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Being part of a relatively small-sized company that has already become the leader in the industry is very exciting in itself! I think that we are all aware that Tokeny is bringing a unique and disruptive infrastructure solution for public markets. Besides, its standard, the ERC3643, has already become the industry standard for permissioned tokens and digital assets. It’s only a matter of time before traditional public markets migrate to the public blockchain, either by using the standard or by contracting our solutions.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Operational Technology is comprised of the hardware, software, and networks that actuate, control, monitor, and analyze physical processes, machines, and infrastructure used in various industries such as manufacturing, transportation, health care, power generation and distribution, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, water treatment, etc. OT encompasses multiple categories including Critical Infrastructure Systems (CIS) for civil and national interests, such as power generation and distribution, traffic control, water treatment, etc.; Industrial Control Systems (ICS) such as SCADA nodes, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) that are in used in manufacturing, warehouses, pharmaceutical, agricultural, transportation, and oil and gas industries; and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which include commoditized IP-enabled sensors that are commonly used in CIS and ICS environments today.</p>
<p>OT systems face cybersecurity threats that are different from enterprise IT because the equipment, software, and communications protocols used in these areas are often not the same as found in IT environments. However, given the push for Digital Transformation and the benefits it offers, many OT-deploying organizations have connected ICS, IIoT, and even CIS networks to their IT infrastructure and cloud services. Moreover, many organizations have deployed common enterprise IT hardware and software as well as commoditized Internet of Things (IoT) devices (such as temperature and lighting sensors, Wi-Fi cameras within their OT networks. This opens these OT environments, some of which had been physically air-gapped previously, to the ever-evolving threat landscape of IT.</p>
<p>Over the last few decades, enterprise IT departments have developed management hierarchies for handling their sprawling technology estates. However, some organizations that have OT assets have not integrated OT management, particularly security, into that enterprise IT management array. In most cases, there are historical reasons for this separation of duties.</p>
<p>Why IT and OT are often not aligned at the enterprise level</p>
<p>Power utility companies: These organizations have highly specialized and critical OT hardware and software. In some jurisdictions, regulations mandate logical and physical separation of OT assets from the enterprise. Different teams have managed the OT and IT environments, and to this day their reporting structures are not combined. They may have different budgets and even different security policies.</p>
<p>Conglomerates with autonomous or semi-autonomous business units: Companies that have acquired others but without strong centralization of IT (not to mention OT) very often leave most of the management and infrastructure as it was prior to the acquisition. This means that there may be multiple CIOs and CISOs as well as OT security managers, and little impetus for alignment of security technologies and policies.</p>
<p>Security and safety: IT security departments seek to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and assets. Organizations with OT must also maximize human safety, which means that OT equipment must fail-safe to prevent worker injuries, prevent contamination of products and services, ensure national security, and protect the public at large from catastrophic incidents. These objectives may sometimes compete with enterprise IT policies; therefore enterprise IT security and OT security remain distinct in some of these organizations. For examples of security solutions for ICS, see our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80913/cybersecurity-for-industrial-control-systems">Market Compass</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), in their special publication <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-82r2.pdf">NIST SP800-82r2 Guide to Industrial Control Systems Security</a> (p. 45), states that:</p>
<p>The information security team should report directly to the information security manager at the mission/business process or organization tier, who in turn reports to the mission/business process manager (e.g., facility superintendent) or enterprise information security manager (e.g., the company’s CIO/CSO), respectively. Ultimate authority and responsibility rests in the Tier 1 risk executive function that provides a comprehensive, organization-wide approach to risk management. The risk executive function works with the top management to accept a level of residual risk and accountability for the information security of the ICS.</p>
<p>Though NIST recommends that ICS security responsibilities bubble up to enterprise CISOs, that is largely not the case in many enterprises with OT (of which ICS is a subset), as reflected in the <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/maindam/PUBLIC/02_MARKETING/08_Report/report-2022-ot-cybersecurity.pdf">Fortinet 2022 State of Operational Technology and Cybersecurity Report</a> (p. 9), which states that only 15% of organizations with OT have the security responsibility aligned through the enterprise CISO.</p>
<p>Aligning enterprise IT and OT security is certainly a best practice for risk management, considering the increasingly blurry lines of demarcation between the types of technology. Combining IT and OT security at the enterprise risk management level as well as at the technical integration levels present opportunities for synergies that can increase the overall cybersecurity posture of organizations with OT.</p>
<p>Recommendation: Enterprises with OT components must begin the journey toward centralizing security policies, technologies, and management under the purview of enterprise CISOs.</p>

<p>KuppingerCole is hosting our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution conference in Frankfurt, Germany on November 14-16</a>, where we will discuss leading edge topics such as digitalization, cybersecurity, and the impact of AI. There will be tracks for cyber resilience, securing the autonomous world, the cybersecurity fabric, supply chain security, and unified security for IT, OT, IoT, and IIoT. We hope you can join us for this one-of-a-kind event.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p>Operational resilience is essential for every organization embracing digital transformation to ensure that all business IT systems are able to resist and recover from any type of disruption, including cyberattacks. The European Union has put together a framework of requirements in the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which although aimed at the financial services industry, can be used by all organizations to benefit from digital transformation while reducing the risk of disruption to information and communications technology (ICT). This Advisory Note highlights the most important requirements of the regulation and provides recommendations on how to achieve compliance.

			<p>4th September, Luxembourg, and Seoul – Tokeny, the global leading tokenization platform, announces its strategic alliance with Klaytn Foundation, an EVM-compatible public blockchain developed by the renowned Korean IT giant, Kakao. This strategic alliance is set to catalyze the widespread adoption of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, empowering the Asian markets to embrace this cutting-edge financial evolution. A number of RWA projects relating to commodities, accounts receivables, and more are already live or in development on Klaytn.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of this partnership lies in the provision of a seamless infrastructure for companies to effortlessly issue, manage, and distribute tokenized RWAs via Klaytn’s robust network. Tokeny’s state-of-the-art tokenization platform adheres to the industry-standard ERC3643 for RWA tokenization, ensuring compliance and interoperability.</p>
<p>Diverging from the world of cryptocurrencies, fractionalizing RWAs requires issuers to establish investment vehicles, holding these assets. By issuing financial instruments such as shares or debts of the vehicles, issuers enable investors to participate in the RWA investment opportunities. Tokenized RWAs are the representation of these financial instruments on-chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The complexity arises from the necessity to enforce compliance on the blockchain with existing regulations. This entails that only investors meeting predetermined criteria can qualify as asset owners, thereby mandating rigorous adherence to the stipulated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.</p>
<p>Tokeny’s platform elegantly resolves this intricate challenge by leveraging the ERC3643 token standard. Through reusable digital identities and verifiable credentials, this standard ensures that only qualified investors can engage in transactions involving tokenized RWAs. Their platform has been used to tokenize more than $28 billion in assets.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    RWA tokenization is rapidly gaining traction in the Asian market. Drawing from our six-year track record in Europe, we are thrilled to collaborate with Klaytn, extending our expertise to Asia to simplify the capital market through tokenization. As digitization takes center stage in Asia, in line with the efficiency seen in other aspects of daily life, investors are demanding real-time and user-friendly financial services. The time is ripe for Asian issuers to seize this market opportunity, and we're eager to accelerate their market entry with our platform, enabling them to retain current clients and attract new ones.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny       In the world of RWA tokenization, ERC3643 reigns as the paramount standard. It is the catalyst that propels us towards a token-centered economy, where compliance harmonizes with interoperability. As this standard sweeps the industry across the globe, we're determined to extend its reach within our community, forging a new era for tokenization. Tokeny takes the center stage, an enabler that propels the Asian market into an era of massive adoption, meticulously crafting the most comprehensive platform atop this very standard.  Sam SeoRepresentative Director of Klaytn Foundation    
	 
		 
			<p>As a united force, Klaytn Foundation and Tokeny set out to dissolve barriers and digitize capital markets in Asia. Their shared goal transcends complexities, aiming to make value transfer as effortless as an e-commerce experience. Together, they forge an ecosystem that thrives on real-time interaction, peer-to-peer transactions, unwavering transparency, and seamless interoperability—a visionary financial realm sculpted by RWA tokenization.</p>

  <p>On July 11, 2023, we introduced <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-expands-into-security-service-edge-with-two-new/ba-p/3847829">Microsoft’s identity-centric security service edge (SSE) solution</a> and two new services: Microsoft Entra Private Access and Microsoft Entra Internet Access, which are now in public preview. In this blog, we take a deeper look into Microsoft&nbsp;Entra Private Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Traditional network security stacks and legacy VPNs are no longer sufficient</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Private Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional network security approaches that use legacy VPNs simply cannot scale to modern demands. Once your remote users connect to your corporate network through VPN, they are granted excessive access to your entire network, all it takes is a single compromised user account, infected device, or open port for an attacker to gain entry, move laterally, and access your most critical assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access, an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), reduces the operational complexity and cost of legacy VPNs, while eliminating excessive access and preventing lateral movement. It modernizes access to private applications and resources, helping users quickly and easily connect to private applications from any device and any network, whether they’re at home, remote, or in their corporate office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What makes Private Access unique&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of Microsoft’s SSE solution, Private Access is built on Zero Trust principles. It verifies every user and enforces least privilege, giving users access only to the private applications and resources they need. Private Access significantly expands Entra ID Application Proxy capabilities in Microsoft Entra to a complete ZTNA solution that shares the same connectors but offers so much more, it helps you simplify and secure access to any private resource on any port, and protocol. You can apply policies that enable secure, segmented, and granular access to all your private applications in your corporate network, on-premises, or in the cloud. For customers already using Application Proxy, they can seamlessly transition to Private Access – all existing use-cases and access to existing private web applications would continue to work with no disruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create and enforce per-app, least privilege access controls based on the granular Conditional Access policies that are enriched with context about users, devices, and their locations. You can also terminate ongoing sessions in response to anomalies or changes in user context or device health. For example, if a user connects from one part of the world and then immediately connects from another part of the world (what we call “impossible travel"), you can enforce re-authorization or step up to a stronger authentication method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access enables secure access to any application, on-premises or cloud-based, and it works across any port or protocol, including RDP, SSH, SMB, FTP, and anything else that uses TCP or UDP. In addition, you can enable single sign-on (SSO) using SAML or http headers or even legacy Kerberos authentication for both web and non-web applications, without making any changes to those applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Private Access delivered from one of the largest global private networks, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft global network</a>, your private applications are not only more secure, but your employees can also access them faster compared to legacy VPNs. The unmatched scale and vast global network edge presence enables you to optimally connect your users and devices to private resources, especially those who work in a hybrid or remote work environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Secure access to all private applications, for users anywhere, with an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Private Access key capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access can help you enable secure access to all your private applications and resources. Key capabilities include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access. Replacing legacy VPNs with an identity-centric ZTNA minimizes the risk of implicit trust and lateral movement. Using Quick Access, you can easily configure broad private IP ranges and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to quickly enable identity-centric, Zero-Trust-based access to all private resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications. With Private Access, you can create Conditional Access policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) that require modern authentication for accessing any private application, even those using legacy protocols such as Kerberos and NT LAN Manager (NTLM). This brings policies based on the sensitivity of the application, level of user risk, network compliance, and so forth to legacy applications. For example, you can easily require multi-factor authentication (MFA) and device compliance checks for users trying to access remote desktop (RDP), secure shell (SSH) or SMB applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatic private application discovery and onboarding. You can discover private applications, including existing App Proxy private web applications, whether the applications are hosted locally in a private network, in an on-premises data center, or in the cloud.&nbsp; You can then onboard them to Microsoft Entra ID, group them, and define granular access policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Automatic private application discovery and onboarding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granular segmented application access. Instead of granting remote users access to your entire network, as traditional VPNs do, you can define granular segmented access policies for each application or group of applications based on user, device, or processes running on the endpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Granular segmented application access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intelligent local access. Employees need a consistent security posture whether they’re accessing private applications remotely or on-premises. The intelligent local access capability enables fast and seamless ZTNA for users, whether they’re within the corporate network or connecting remotely from anywhere outside corporate network boundaries. For example, a user while on the corporate network can connect to on-premises private applications such as RDP or SMB while CA policies such as MFA are still enforced, and application traffic remains local on the corporate network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started with Entra Private Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">Global Secure Access</a> (preview) is the centralized location in the Microsoft Entra admin center where you can configure and manage Microsoft Entra Private Access. Remote workers don't need to use a VPN to access these resources if they have the Global Secure Access Client installed. The client quietly and seamlessly connects them with the resources they need. The most current version of the client can be downloaded from the Microsoft Entra admin center. You can install the client interactively, silently with the /quiet switch, or use mobile device management platforms like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management">Microsoft Intune to deploy</a> it to their devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QuickAccess makes it very easy to get started with a minimum configuration for Private Access, especially when you are planning to move from legacy VPN to ZTNA. After completing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/how-to-get-started-with-global-secure-access">initial configurations</a>, and once you deploy a connector agent on-premises, to enable quick access all you need to do is specify the IP address, IP address range, or FQDN and port number. You can then assign specific conditional access policies, which QuickAccess applies to ALL app segments you configured. For example, you can create a “myRDP app” and assign it an IP address-based app segment. You only need to provide a name for the private app, then select the connector you wish to use with the app, and then specify the IP address/range and port number. You can then access your destination by simply launching an RDP session from your remote client machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This month, we're joined by the founders and organizers of Strange Loop and Papers We Love conferences. <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/about.html">Strange Loop</a> was founded by Alex Miller in 2009 and is regarded as one of the most prestigious multi-disciplinary tech conferences. Strange Loop talks span both academia and industry, covering a range of topics, including emerging languages, alternative databases, distributed systems, security, AI, the web, and more. </p><p>Papers We Love is a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">repository</a> of academic computer science papers and a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/wiki/Creating-a-PWL-chapter">community</a> that loves reading them. Organized by Zeeshan Lakhani, Darren Newton, David Ashby, and Chas Emerick, Papers We Love was a collection of local meetups until it joined forces with Strange Loop as part of the pre-conference programming a few years ago.</p>     EP02: In Conversation: Strange Loop and PWL Organizers  0:00 /60:02 1×   <p>In this episode, you'll hear:</p>  How Strange Loop and Papers We Love conferences got their start  How having a background outside of computer science helps to gain perspective on new ways to explore technology  How opportunity grants have left a positive impact on both recipients and the Strange Loop Conference itself  Alex's thoughts on the future of conferences, including why he's bullish on hybrid conferences  <p>Here's a glance at the episode...</p>  [2:00] Alex Miller created Lambda Lounge, a meetup for folks interested in functional programming, dynamic languages, and no-SQL databases. He regularly had 50-100 people in attendance and realized he could turn it into a conference. The first Strange Loop had 300 attendees!  [4:30] David Ashby shares how he, Zeeshan, and Darren came together to read academic papers in New York City and started to get requests from folks in other cities who wanted to replicate what they were doing locally. Hence, the Papers We Love chapters were born! The number of chapters in existence at one time was 30.  [10:56] Alex shares his marketing strategy for Strange Loop, where he began with the Lambda Lounge audience and initiated a more grassroots effort to raise awareness.   [15:20] Alex talks about how he became acquainted with the Papers We Love crew and how it became part of the pre-conference track of Strange Loop.  [16:45] Zeeshan explains how Strange Loop was his first exposure to people from academia talking about obscure programming languages and how it inspired PWL.  [19:00] David shares how none of the PWL team had a background in computer science but rather came from the humanities. This drove them to read computer science papers to better understand their field. Alex expands on this by talking about technology's implications in various other disciplines, which is often something technologists forget about. They are so focused on solving interesting problems that they sometimes can't see the forest through the trees.  [32:30] Alex talks about how the Strange Loop opportunity grants started and the impact their recipients have had on the conference over the years.  [43:16] Alex talks about the emerging hybrid model for conferences and how it can help build community while reducing climate impact.  [46:40] Alex shares why he's sunsetting Strange Loop.   [53:40] Boris talks about unconference-style conferences  <p>Listen to the podcast embedded above, or head to our <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">podcast landing page</a> to subscribe to the podcast on your preferred platform.</p> Episode Links and Shoutouts: <p><br>Co-Host: Boris Mann - CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Organizer of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a></p><p>Co-Host: Zeeshan Lakhani - Staff Research Engineer at <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Member of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> Programming Committee</p><p>Causal Islands Theme Song by <a href="http://depatchedmode.xyz/">depatchedmode</a></p><p>Editing by Becky Vazquez</p><p>Guests: Alex Miller, Founder of <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/index.html">Strange Loop Conference</a>, and Zeeshan Lakhani, Darren Newton, David Ashby, and Chas Emerick, organizers of <a href="https://paperswelove.org/">Papers We Love Conference</a>.</p><p>Additional Links:</p>  <a href="https://theorizingtheweb.tumblr.com/">Theorizing the Web</a>  <a href="https://www.polyglotsoftware.com/">Polyglot Conference</a>  <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691208480/you-are-not-expected-to-understand-this">"You Are Not Expected to Understand This"</a>  <a href="https://github.com/bridgethillyer">Bridget Hillyer</a>  <a href="https://devopsdays.org/">DevOpsDays</a>

 Tokeny becomes the 1st tokenization platform to achieve SOC2 Type I Compliance 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in August 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>In the dynamic financial landscape, trust with your stakeholders and users is the lifeline of any successful organization. With fraud and theft in the blockchain space experiencing high activity, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure the security of users’ privacy and confidential data. While many companies advocate for their security and protection measures, without third-party validations, the true integrity of a tech stack remains uncertain.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, we always took security at heart, starting with the evaluation of our software solutions and, today, with the audit of our whole organization.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that we have achieved SOC2 Type I compliance, making us the pioneering tokenization platform in the world to earn this esteemed certification.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with SOC2, this report recognizes Tokeny’s commitment to creating the secured enterprise-grade solution that the market deserves. After a careful review conducted by a third-party independent auditor, we can now confidently prove that all of our departments have the procedures in place to meet the security requirements of the financial markets including:<br>
<br>
HR (from recruitment to employee management), Production (change management, code security, release management, etc), IT (privacy controls and asset classification), Customer Success Management (BCP and DRP regularly tested, incident communication management).</p>
<p>In this review, we had no less than 99 security controls carefully reviewed amongst all departments making Tokeny the most secure tokenization platform on the market, allowing us to not only bring trust and confidence through our products and services, but also by the way we manage the company.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The standards and guidelines were provided by <a href="https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/aicpasoc2report">The American Institute of CPAs® (AICPA),</a> an organization that has been involved in the public interest for over 136 years.</p>
<p>Obtaining this report was only the first step towards the “Security and Compliance” pillar of our Technological Strategy, with plans to go even further than this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we are aiming to get ISO27001 certified in the coming months, completing the controls from SOC2 and making Tokeny even more secure. Then we will be pushing for the SOC2 Type II certification, confirming that all the hard work that has been done for the Type I report has been efficiently implemented next year.</p>
<p>Thank you for trusting us on this journey. We remain dedicated to advancing the frontier of secure, compliant, and efficient financial solutions in the digital age.</p>

			<p>The tokenization industry has seen interest blossom over the last few years, with many key financial incumbents jumping on the bandwagon. It unfortunately took longer than ideal, but that’s expected as some of the ‘low-hanging fruit’ blockchain use cases like NFTs and cryptocurrencies were in the limelight initially,</p>
<p>Once institutions finally understood the powerful ‘weapon’ that blockchain can be for their infrastructure, it didn’t take long to begin to experiment and engage with leading experts in the field</p>
<p>Prominent entities such as Invesco, KKR, Hamilton Lane, Aberdeen, Franklin Templeton, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of China, BlackRock, and more are now active participants in the tokenization space – a shift that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the first movers were small issuers tokenizing as a way to either fundraise and expand their investor base or to tokenize their existing cap table, but now everyone is seeing the writing on the wall.</p>
<p>In fact, Boston Consulting Group, anticipates that up to $16T of illiquid assets could be tokenized and unlocked by 2030.</p>
<p>Even more exciting is that according to a report from Bain &amp; Co, the real estate industry alone has a global value of approximately $330T.</p>
<p>In this two-part interview series conducted by CMS, Daniel Coheur, our Chief Commercial Officer had the pleasure to further expand and provide insights on the current status of the tokenization industry and where we are heading:</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p>Main takeaways from part 1:</p>
 
 The momentum is building fast for tokenization 
 Smaller jurisdictions have been pioneering an attractive regulatory framework with larger jurisdictions lagging behind 
 The fraudulent actors have only shed more light on the opportunity to enforce compliance on-chain 
 Blockchain applied to real-world assets and securities is extremely powerful 
 

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Main takeaways from part 2:</p>
 
 Institutions are moving from private chains to public ones&nbsp; 
 Tokenization isn’t as sexy as AI but it’s the essential ‘plumbing’ necessary to transform our financial system 
 AI and blockchain have potential to complement each other very well 
 How we tackle blockchain complexities for massive adoption

  <p>We have an important update to provide on MS Graph Device Registration Policy resource type currently in preview and available in beta API version. We are making some changes to resource type properties that introduce breaking changes. These changes are expected to happen in the week of September 25, 2023. To ensure continued support and functionality, and minimize impact, it’s very important that all customers take note of these changes and prioritize modifying their applications that depend on this resource type accordingly.   &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Why and when are we making this change? &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we make the devcieRegistrationPolicy resource type generally available in our v1.0 API version, we need to align to MS Graph REST API best practices and design patterns. This change will be made to beta endpoint in the week of September 25, 2023, and then generally available to v1.0 endpoint later this year. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 What are the Required Actions?&nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 
  If you’re using Entra ID portal to configure device registration policy settings then no action is required.&nbsp; 
 If you’re crafting your own MS Graph API requests to configure deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type, then you need to immediately update your application to start configuring the resource type with both the new and deprecated properties.&nbsp; 
 Once the deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type with new properties is deployed in the week of September 25, 2023, verify using GET call that you see the new properties and their values as being configured by your application. &nbsp; 
 At a later point in time of convenience, remove the deprecated properties from your application.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are the updates to MS Graph deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 
 The "multiFactorAuthConfiguration" property is changing from an integer to a string value. The old integer value of “0” represented "notRequired" and “1” represented "required". The new string property will now support the values of "notRequired" and "required".&nbsp; 
 The "appliesTo", "allowedUsers" and "allowedGroups" properties within "azureADJoin" and "azureADRegistration" are being deprecated. Instead, these will be replaced by the "allowedToJoin" and "allowedToRegister" properties, which are of the type microsoft.graph.deviceRegistrationMembership and contain one of the following values for "@odata.type":&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 "#microsoft.graph.allDeviceRegistrationMembership": Indicates that all users are allowed to join or register devices.&nbsp; 
 "#microsoft.graph.noDeviceRegistrationMembership": Indicates that no users are allowed to join or register devices.&nbsp; 
 "#microsoft.graph.enumeratedDeviceRegistrationMembership": Indicates that a selected group or users and groups are allowed to join or register devices. Only for this value, the "allowedToJoin" or "allowedToRegister" values contain two additional properties, "users" and "groups", each being an array of user and group IDs which are allowed to join or register devices. 
 
 
 The changes will be deployed to MS Graph beta endpoint the week of September 25, 2023, at which point the deprecated properties of the resource type will stop working.&nbsp; 
 Customers should prepare to update their applications and start using the new properties of the resource type as soon as possible.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What happens to applications if they don’t use the new properties of deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type the week of September 25, 2023? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The applications will encounter an error (Bad Request) as new properties will be expected when configuring the deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Can I do something now to prepare my application for this change without waiting until the week of September 25, 2023? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you modify your application immediately to configure deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type with both new and deprecated properties. The resource type available in beta endpoint today will honor both the deprecated and new properties. It will stop honoring deprecated properties during the week of September 25, 2023. Here’s an example of how you’ll use PUT to configure both new and deprecated properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{ &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "@odata.context": <a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#policies/deviceRegistrationPolicy/$entity">https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#policies/deviceRegistrationPolicy/$entity</a>, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "multiFactorAuthConfiguration": "notRequired", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "id": "deviceRegistrationPolicy", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "displayName": "Device Registration Policy", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "description": "Tenant-wide policy that manages initial provisioning controls using quota restrictions, additional authentication and authorization checks", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "userDeviceQuota": 20, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "azureADRegistration": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "isAdminConfigurable": false, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedToRegister": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.allDeviceRegistrationMembership" &nbsp;</p>
<p>    }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "appliesTo": "1", &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedUsers": [], &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedGroups": [] &nbsp;</p>
<p>  }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "azureADJoin": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "isAdminConfigurable": true, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedToJoin": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.enumeratedDeviceRegistrationMembership", &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "users": [ &nbsp;</p>
<p>        "a6aebac8-1faf-4ebd-9a68-727fa53376f4" &nbsp;</p>
<p>      ], &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "groups": [] &nbsp;</p>
<p>    }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "appliesTo": "2", &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedUsers": [&nbsp;</p>
<p> "a6aebac8-1faf-4ebd-9a68-727fa53376f4"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ], &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedGroups": [], &nbsp;</p>
<p>  }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "localAdminPassword": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "isEnabled": true &nbsp;</p>
<p>  } &nbsp;</p>
<p>}&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes: &nbsp;</p>
 
 "multiFactorAuthConfiguration" should always be sent as a string value ("required" or "notRequired").&nbsp; 
 users and groups list are only needed when you set&nbsp;microsoft.graph.deviceRegistrationMembership data type to enumerated.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 When should I remove configuring old properties from my application? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you follow our above recommendation to configure deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type with both new and deprecated properties, you can remove deprecated properties at any future time of convenience. Once the deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type is deployed with the new properties during the week of September 25, 2023, deprecated properties will be ignored by the resourceType.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Can I selectively configure the new properties from my application? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not currently. The API supports PUT operation for update, which means you need to configure all properties of deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What will the GET call return? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type will return the deprecated properties until the week of September 25, 2023, after which the resource type will return the new properties.&nbsp;</p>

Fluctuations in IAM engagement lead to stress and reduced productivity. Insufficient transparency and prioritization cause financial losses. Organizations struggle to adapt to changing dynamics, impacting security and competitiveness. Uncertainty in decision-making hampers risk management. A strategic, adaptive approach to capacity planning is crucial to address these challenges effectively.
