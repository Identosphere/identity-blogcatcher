<p>This blog has been written as an explainer to support the wider <a href="https://lee.darkmatterlabs.org/">Life-Ennobling Economics conversation</a>. It is focused on the LEE aspiration of moving beyond colonising capital and explores how this could be applied to financing a FreeHouse. The work is part of a collaborative initiative between Dark Matter’s Next Economics Lab and Radicle Civics&nbsp;Arc.</p><p>In our work at Dark Matter Labs we talk a lot about the need to respect and steward the shared commons. Whilst a Commons framing is frequently associated with governing communal resources such as grazing land and fishing stocks, it can also be applied to less tangible value flows. Real estate prices are an interesting example. Driven by diverse contributions, from local businesses and schools to parks and improved transport links, the shared value generated is largely captured by privately owned assets. Put another way, public investment is driving private wealth. A logical intervention is to bring land and buildings into common stewardship, rendering embedded dynamics such as price speculation and extractive rent obsolete.</p><blockquote>So far so good but there is a giant elephant in the room: how can we bring a house or a piece of land into common ownership in the first place? Why would an existing property owner give up their rights to receive future benefits? If we need to borrow money and generate future financial returns to secure the initial site, are we simply perpetuating the status quo in the name of a new economy? If the transfer is funded by philanthropy or gifted, how will this translate into shifts in the ‘real’&nbsp;economy?</blockquote> Setting a strong intention for practical action <p>Recently we have received feedback questioning whether this kind of discussion is adding anything of value. There is a rising and palpable sense of frustration. Rhetoric and provocations are one thing, but are they really doing anything to help? Are they of any practical use to those at the frontline of the housing crisis? Actually we agree, but from a yes / and perspective. We absolutely need practical action, but let’s not forget that the actions taken in response to the 2008 financial crisis are a big driver for the mess that we find ourselves in today. Perhaps if more inclusive conversations had taken place, involving diverse voices, things would have evolved differently. We can’t know for sure, but demystifying topics such as finance and governance is core to our&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>So here we are wondering what to do about the entrenched dynamics of housing and the financial system. Where should we start? Probably with a few obvious yet difficult questions: how can we interact with finance to bring a house into common ownership? In doing so, what would be the least extractive way possible? If we manage, what kind of financial setup would ensure that regenerative and equitable intentions sit at the heart of its operations? Critically, how can we test our ideas on the&nbsp;ground?</blockquote><p>We are using the following principles to develop non-extractive pathways for bringing a house into the commons. The aim is to apply these examples to a FreeHouse demonstrator that <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle Civics</a> intend to start work on later this year. We also hope to connect with mainstream financial actors who are innovating in this field to test our assumptions. If you are working in this field and would be interested to join a conversation then please do get in&nbsp;touch:</p><p>Financing principles for a FreeHouse:</p>  No economic rent (generated by the set up funding or in the ongoing operation);  Utilise multi-sensory, ‘buffer’ metrics (to reduce unintended value extraction);  Minimise new money creation (to reduce future claims on finite resources);  IOE — Infinite Outcome Exchange¹ (remove capital from the current extractive, overshoot economy in exchange for infinite economic outcomes e.g. solidarity, knowledge)  Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@journosousa?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Aaron Sousa</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>  No economic&nbsp;rent  <p>Economic rent = income derived from ownership or control over a limited asset or resource. Such income is attained without any expenditure or effort on behalf of the resource holder OR the income is in excess of their opportunity cost i.e. the minimum the asset holder would accept to transfer or invest&nbsp;it².</p><p>In the context of a Freehouse, we want to protect against two sources of economic&nbsp;rent:</p>  Re-commoning the House: to begin the Freehouse journey we need to transfer the ownership of the House from the market to the Commons. This involves making a capital payment to the current holders of the property rights. We want to design this initial funding agreement so that the provider of financial capital does not receive any economic&nbsp;rent.  Financing the Commons: once the House is under commons stewardship the intention is that it will generate value to support itself, via activities such as community energy and user contributions. The goal will then be to direct any unused financial surplus to align with the no-rent principle. One example of this would be to create a fund for future house projects to reduce the external capital required on start-up. Surplus above a set percentage could be automatically redistributed to this&nbsp;fund.  <p>2. Utilise, multi-sensory ‘buffer’&nbsp;metrics</p><p>Where measures of success are required to secure funding, we will strive to incorporate indicators that respect the intrinsic and entangled values that are generated by living systems. This principle aims to avoid the erosion of often unnoticed stocks and flows of value in pursuit of a defined one. For example, if outcomes based financing is secured for planned community solar panels, we might unintentionally disrupt vital pollinator habitats in the area surrounding the house whilst striving to meet this singular target. If multi-point and multi-sensory indicators are used to validate outcomes and improve the learning capacity of governance systems, misaligned incentives can be&nbsp;reduced.</p><blockquote>The Rumsfeld Matrix of knowns and unknowns:</blockquote><blockquote>“Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones” — Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defence,&nbsp;2002</blockquote><p>3. Minimise future&nbsp;claims</p><p>This principle will keep the amount of new credit used (i.e. commercial bank loans) to a minimum. Where a loan is deemed the most appropriate financing instrument, we will strive to find a product that is linked to existing savings (e.g. Credit Union loans). By doing this, the intention is to take a stand against unsustainable future claims on the environment and increasing fragility of the global financial system. When new money is created, this credit (together with its associated interest) creates a future productive liability, which equates to a future claim on the energy and materials that will be required to settle it. The physical claims are coded into fiat money³ creation and at current levels are essentially a fatal contract with the future of the&nbsp;Earth⁴.</p><p>4. IOE (Infinite Outcome Exchange)</p><p>Here the house will playfully subvert the concept of Outcomes Based Financing. The aim is to provide infinite returns such as reciprocity, trust and knowledge in exchange for non-returnable financial capital. The principle is based on an aspiration to remove fiat money from circulation and thus in a small way weaken its extractive power. In its current form fiat money converts complex, entangled values into an abstract and highly liquid exchange medium. If you wanted to, you could exchange a Canadian lynx for a barrel of oil, potentially even making a profit in the process⁵. Incredibly, you could do so from such an emotional and physical distance that you wouldn’t even need to question the morality of your actions. Our current monetary system rewards the exploitation and pollution of everything that we need to thrive (and even survive), whilst money itself self-perpetuates, creating an ever increasing cycle of destruction.</p><blockquote>How could this work in practice? Perhaps the European Investment Bank (or a development bank) could step up to invest in the non-specific benefits of city transitions? By doing so it could set a precedent to shift outcomes based financing to a new level for other transition initiatives. If the benefits are achieved then the surplus could even be paid-forward to a public trust to improve other local services.</blockquote> Using speculative case studies to test the edges of what might be&nbsp;possible <p>The four speculative case studies described below have been designed to match the motivations of capital holders with the principles outlined above. They might seem far-fetched at first, but for each case study we have included some potential pathways that align with existing organisations and financial motivations. The next step will be to socialise them with people working in these areas for critical feedback.</p><blockquote>We are genuinely curious and open to be challenged. What are we missing? What are we getting wrong? Are there similar or adjacent innovations being developed?</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lunarts?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Volodymyr Hryshchenko</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>1Layered economy&nbsp;approach</p><p>This will involve looking at the different economies that the House will be part of (e.g. land, materials, energy generation, right-of-use) and matching them to appropriate funding streams. This could take the form of a portfolio of investments, loans and grants which have differential interest rates depending on the activity supported. The idea would be to create a matching platform to work out where differential interest rates, grants or preferential loans terms that are already on offer can be matched with elements of the House’s economy. For the model to remain non-extractive each funding stream will need to be carefully assessed in terms of fair effort or opportunity cost (for example an ultra low interest rate would be a significant opportunity cost for the investor).</p><p>As an example, a three way split could be proposed as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Right-of-use economy: for the areas of the House that are designated for residents, an ultra long-term loan (10 years +) could be used to secure a fixed monthly cost. This might suit a private impact investor or local pension scheme interested in supporting just transition outcomes.  Creative economy: for paying guests (accommodation and events), a more flexible shorter-term loan could be arranged based on forecast guest income. Potentially, paydowns could be planned to align with the busy visiting periods i.e. immediately after summer. For this type of funding to meet the ‘no economic rent’ principle the lender could commit to developing pathways to make it easier for other mixed housing models to access preferential loan rates. An example would be to use the <a href="http://www.positivemoney.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021_Building-Renovation-TLTROs.pdf">ECB’s TLTROs</a> (targeted long term refinancing operations) as an onramp for other alternative housing&nbsp;models.  Generative systems: grants or incentivised green loans could support the installation of renewable energy systems. The surplus generated would provide additional income to paydown the other loans further in the&nbsp;future.  <p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actors: private impact investor, local pension fund, business lenders, government matched funding for green initiatives.  Motivations: reputation, ESG compliance, political pressure for banks to play their part in a just transition.  Proposed agreement: mixed contracts via a central platform.  Potential partners / collaborators: Positive Money Europe has been<a href="https://unlock.green/about/"> campaigning</a> for commercial banks to play their part in green home renovations by leveraging European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy instruments. One suggested pathway is to channel preferential interest rates offered on TLTROs (targeted long term refinancing operations) towards sustainability loans. These loans can be at extremely low or even negative interest rates. A coalition of German development banks recently co-issued <a href="https://www.imug-rating.de/en/news-en/first-german-social-community-bond-wins-environmental-finances-bond-award-2023/">a social bond</a> linked to affordable housing provision and might be interested in providing low interest finance (Investitionsbank des Landes Brandenburg<a href="http://www.ilb.de/"> (ILB)</a>, <a href="http://www.ifbhh.de/">IFB Hamburg</a>, <a href="http://www.isb.rlp.de/">ISB&nbsp;Mainz</a>)  <blockquote>Terms like targeted ‘long term financing operations’ and ‘central bank monetary policy instruments’ can seem technocratic and removed from everyday life. In reality, they are not as complicated as we might be led to believe. For example, TLTROs are simply long-term loans made by the European Central Bank to commercial banks, at low or even negative interest rates, to stimulate lending to customers⁶. Organisations like Positive Money are doing a brilliant job of debunking and opening these topics up for conversation. In fact, central banks exist in service of economic stability so their role in addressing the public housing crisis would seem a logical extension of their current&nbsp;remit.</blockquote><p>2Resilience investment mortgage</p><p>This proposal is based on the risk exposure of mortgage providers. Tighter ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting requirements are forcing lenders to openly state their strategies for hedging against cascading climate and social risks. We see this as an opportunity to design a new class of mortgage, where the provider makes an advanced purchase order for future resilience as part of the agreement. In practical terms, this would mean that a proportion of the mortgage loan would not be repayable. Initially this would be a direct cost to the mortgage provider, based on the risk of future weather damage or defaults due to the rising cost of living. The remainder of the mortgage would be a standard arrangement where the House would make regular repayments plus interest. However, the advance resilience discount would in effect reduce the interest paid compared to a regular mortgage.</p><p>For example:</p><p>If the cost of the property was EUR 200,000 and the future risk was assessed at&nbsp;15%</p>  Risk cost = EUR 16k (15% *&nbsp;200,000)  Base mortgage = EUR 184 (residual value)  <blockquote>We appreciate that not everyone is interested, familiar or comfortable with accounting. This is actually something we would like to address. Why should the inner workings of professions like accountancy remain out of reach? Given their impact on decision making at the highest levels, it seems a missed opportunity to leave it in the hands of a small sector of society. For anyone that is interested the accounting entries on the mortgage providers books could work as&nbsp;follows:</blockquote><p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actor: a mortgage provider with a high volume of mortgage loans in a specific&nbsp;area.  Motivation: protecting against the future risk of mortgage defaults (e.g. caused by extreme weather, cost of living pressures).  Proposed agreement: Part advance purchase order, part mortgage.  Potential partners / collaborators: Mortgage providers who are innovating in the field such as <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/business/corporate-banking/specialist-teams/sustainability-and-esg-financing.html">ESG Financing at Lloyds&nbsp;Bank</a>.  Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lg17?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Lance Grandahl</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>3Strategic co-investment</p><p>This proposal looks at stakeholders providing a non-returnable financial investment and becoming partners with the House for mutually beneficial activities. The motivation for the investor would be having access to the House to test innovative technologies or to become part of its creative infrastructure. For example, a private company could co-invest (with The House) in the opportunity to test computational value mapping tools. A university might partner with the House to look at the links between collaborative living and sustainable outcomes. The capital would not be repayable and the house would be investing itself as an innovation catalyst.</p><p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actor: private tech company, university, performing arts&nbsp;group.  Motivation: innovation potential, reputation, ESG.  Proposed agreement: time bound generative use of the house in exchange for a non-returnable financial investment.  Potential partners / collaborators: universities who are focused on exploring new economic thinking in urban environments, for example the <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/studieren/studienangebot/gesamtes-studienangebot/studiengang/urban-management-m-sc">Urban Management Programme at Technische Universität Berlin.</a>  <p>4Joint ownership linked to pay-it-forwards mortgage</p><p>Here the suggestion is for a lender to become a co-owner of the House, and for the House to gradually purchase the lender’s share until it owns itself in full. This type of arrangement allows for a better alignment of shared risk at the outset. Over the period of co-ownership the House would pay rent to the lender for using the part that is still under their ownership. The principle is similar to Islamic Diminishing Musharaka Financing Products (DMFPs) which are designed to avoid income being generated via interest.</p><p>With existing DMFPs the rent is normally fixed, but there is potential for the rent to be linked to the surplus generated from the house’s activities. In this case, the mortgage agreement would stipulate that the principal repayments are based on a percentage of the surplus generated by the house. If there is no surplus nothing is due and no ‘rent’ accrues. This idea could be extended into a pay-it-forward solidarity mortgage. For example, a proportion of any surplus could be used to repay the principal and a percentage placed into a protected account for future house projects.</p><p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actor: credit union, progressive mortgage provider.  Motivation: strengthening lender balance sheet positions, political pressure.  Proposed agreement: co-ownership and rent linked to surplus generated being paid for use of the non-owned space.  Potential partners / collaborators: <a href="https://www.syndikat.org/en/">Miethäusersyndikat</a> for their expertise on solidarity forward funding, value aligned investment platforms such as <a href="https://urban.partners/">Urban Partners.</a>   Next steps <p>As a collaboration between Dark Matter’s Next Economics Lab and the Radicle Civics Arc, we are currently developing a proposal to begin practical work on a FreeHouse Demonstrator later this year.

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software as a service</a> (SaaS) applications have become a boon for enterprises looking to maximize network agility while minimizing costs. They offer app developers on-demand scalability and faster time-to-benefit for new features and software updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SaaS takes advantage of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> infrastructure and economies of scale to provide clients a more streamlined approach to adopting, using and paying for software.</p>



<p>However, SaaS architectures can easily overwhelm DevOps teams with data aggregation, sorting and analysis tasks. Given the <a href="https://ascendixtech.com/number-saas-companies-statistics/">volume of SaaS apps on the market</a> (more than 30,000 SaaS developers were operating in 2023) and the <a href="https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/saas-statistics/#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20(53%25),use%20a%20staggering%20473%20apps.">volume of data a single app can generate</a> (with each enterprise businesses using roughly 470 SaaS apps), SaaS leaves businesses with loads of structured and unstructured data to parse.</p>



<p>That’s why today’s application analytics platforms rely on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML) technology to sift through big data, provide valuable business insights and deliver superior data observability.</p>



 What are application analytics? 



<p>Broadly speaking, application analytics refers to the process of collecting application data and performing real-time analysis of SaaS, mobile, desktop and web application performance and usage data.</p>



<p>App analytics include:</p>



 
 App usage analytics, which show app usage patterns (such as daily and monthly active users, most- and least-used features and geographical distribution of downloads). 
 



 
 App performance analytics, which show how apps are performing across the network (with metrics such as response times and failure rates) and identify the cause and location of app, server or network problems. 
 



 
 App cost and revenue analytics, which track app revenue—such as annual recurring revenue and customer lifetime value (the total profit a business can expect to make from a single customer for the duration the business relationship)—and expenditures such as customer acquisition cost (the costs associated with acquiring a new customer). 
 



<p>Using sophisticated data visualization tools, many of which are powered by AI, app analytics services empower businesses to better understand <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/it-operations">IT operations</a>, helping teams make smarter decisions, faster.</p>



 AI in SaaS analytics 



<p>Most industries have had to reckon with AI proliferation and AI-driven business practices to some extent.</p>



<p>Roughly 42% of enterprise-scale organizations (more than 1,000 employees) have used AI for business purposes, with nearly 60% of enterprises already using AI to <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters">accelerate tech investment</a>. And by 2026, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-10-11-gartner-says-more-than-80-percent-of-enterprises-will-have-used-generative-ai-apis-or-deployed-generative-ai-enabled-applications-by-2026">more than 80% of companies</a> will have deployed <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai"></a>AI) <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">)</a>AI-enabled apps in their IT environments (up from only 5% in 2023).</p>



<p>SaaS app development and management is no different.</p>



<p>SaaS offers businesses cloud-native app capabilities, but AI and ML turn the data generated by SaaS apps into actionable insights. Modern SaaS analytics solutions can seamlessly integrate with AI models to predict user behavior and automate data sorting and analysis; and ML algorithms enable SaaS apps to learn and improve over time.</p>



<p>Using comprehensive, AI-driven SaaS analytics, businesses can make data-driven decisions about feature enhancements, UI/UX improvements and marketing strategies to maximize user engagement and meet—or exceed—business goals.&nbsp;</p>



 SaaS app analytics use cases 



<p>While effective for some organizations, traditional SaaS data analysis methods (such as relying solely on human data analysts to aggregate data points) sometimes fall short in handling the massive quantities of data SaaS apps produce. They may also struggle to fully leverage the predictive capabilities of app analytics.</p>



<p>The introduction of AI and ML technologies, however, can provide more nuanced observability and more effective decision automation. AI- and ML-generated SaaS analytics enhance:</p>



 1. Data insights and reporting 



 
 
  



<p>Application analytics help businesses monitor key performance indicators (KPIs)—such as error rates, response time, resource utilization, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-retention">user retention</a> and dependency rates, among other key metrics—to identify performance issues and bottlenecks and create a smoother user experience. AI and ML algorithms enhance these features by processing unique app data more efficiently.</p>



<p>AI technologies can also reveal and visualize data patterns to help with feature development.</p>



<p>If, for instance, a development team wants to understand which app features most significantly impact retention, it might use AI-driven <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a> (NLP) to analyze unstructured data. NLP protocols will auto-categorize user-generated content (such as customer reviews and support tickets), summarize the data and offer insights into the features that keep customers returning to the app. AI can even use NLP to suggest new tests, algorithms, lines of code or entirely new app functions to increase retention.</p>



<p>With AI and ML algorithms, SaaS developers also get granular <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> into app analytics. AI-powered analytics programs can create real-time, fully customizable dashboards that provide up-to-the-minute insights into KPIs. And most machine learning tools will automatically generate summaries of complex data, making it easier for executives and other decision-makers to understand reports without needing to review the raw data themselves.</p>



 2. Predictive analytics. 



<p><a></a><a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-analytics">Predictive analytics</a> forecast future events based on historical data; AI and ML models—such as <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/linear-regression">regression analysis</a>, <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a> and <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decision-trees">decision trees</a>—enhance the accuracy of these predictions. An e-commerce app, for example, can predict which products will be popular during the holidays by analyzing historical purchase data from previous holiday seasons.</p>



<p>Most SaaS analytics tools—including Google Analytics, Microsoft Azure and IBM® Instana®—offer predictive analytics features that enable developers to anticipate both market and user behavior trends &nbsp;and shift their business strategy accordingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Predictive analytics are equally valuable for user insights.</p>



<p>AI and ML features enable SaaS analytics software to run complex analyses of user interactions within the app (click patterns, navigation paths, feature usage and session duration, among other metrics), which ultimately helps teams anticipate user behavior.</p>



<p>For instance, if a company wants to implement churn prediction protocols to identify at-risk users, they can use AI functions to analyze activity reduction and negative feedback patterns, two user engagement metrics that often precede churn. After the program identifies at-risk users, machine learning algorithms can suggest personalized interventions to re-engage them (a subscription service might offer discounted or exclusive content to users showing signs of disengagement).</p>



<p>Diving deeper into user behavior data also helps businesses proactively identify app usability issues. And during unexpected disruptions (such as those caused by a natural disaster), AI and SaaS analytics provide real-time data visibility that keeps businesses running—or even improving—in challenging times.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Personalization and user experience optimization. 



<p>Machine learning technologies are often integral to providing a personalized customer experience in SaaS applications.</p>



<p>Using customer preferences (preferred themes, layouts and functions), historical trends and user interaction data, ML models in SaaS can dynamically tailor the content that users see based on real-time data. In other words, AI-powered SaaS apps can automatically implement adaptive interface design to keep users engaged with personalized recommendations and content experiences.</p>



<p>News apps, for instance, can highlight articles similar to the ones a user has previously read and liked. An online learning platform can recommend courses or onboarding steps based on a user’s learning history and preferences. And notification systems can send targeted messages to each user at the time they’re likeliest to engage, making the overall experience more relevant and enjoyable.</p>



<p>At the application level, AI can analyze user journey data to understand the typical navigation paths users take through the app and streamline navigation for the entire user base.</p>



 4. Conversion rate optimization and marketing. 



<p>AI analytics tools offer businesses the opportunity to optimize conversion rates, whether through form submissions, purchases, sign-ups or subscriptions.</p>



<p>AI-based analytics programs can automate funnel analyses (which identify where in the conversion funnel users drop off), A/B tests (where developers test multiple design elements, features or conversion paths to see which performs better) and call-to-action button optimization to increase conversions.</p>



<p>Data insights from AI and ML also help improve product marketing and increase overall app profitability, both vital components to maintaining SaaS applications.</p>



<p>Companies can use AI to automate tedious marketing tasks (such as lead generation and ad targeting), maximizing both advertising ROI and conversation rates. And with ML features, developers can track user activity to more accurately segment and sell products to the user base (with conversion incentives, for instance).&nbsp;</p>



 5. Pricing optimization. 



<p>Managing IT infrastructure can be an expensive undertaking, especially for an enterprise running a large network of cloud-native applications. AI and ML features help <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-cost-management">minimize cloud expenditures (and cloud waste)</a> by automating SaaS process responsibilities and streamlining workflows.</p>



<p>Using AI-generated predictive analytics and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/cloud-spend-management/">real-time financial observability tools</a>, teams can anticipate resource usage fluctuations and allocate network resources accordingly. SaaS analytics also enable decision-makers to identify underutilized or problematic assets, preventing over- and under-spending and freeing up capital for app innovations and improvements.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/field-programmable-gate-arrays">Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/microcontroller">microcontroller units (MCUs)</a> are two types of commonly compared integrated circuits (ICs) that are typically used in embedded systems and digital design. Both FPGAs and microcontrollers can be thought of as “small computers” that can be integrated into devices and larger systems.</p>



<p>As processors, the primary difference between FPGAs and microcontrollers comes down to programmability and processing capabilities. While FPGAs are more powerful and more versatile, they are also more expensive. Microcontrollers are less customizable, but also less costly. In many applications, microcontrollers are exceptionally capable and cost-effective. However, for certain demanding or developing applications, like those requiring parallel processing, FPGAs are necessary.</p>



<p>Unlike microcontrollers, FPGAs offer reprogrammability on the hardware level. Their unique design allows users to configure and reconfigure the chip’s architecture depending on the task. FPGA design can also handle parallel inputs simultaneously, whereas microcontrollers can only read one line of code at a time. An FPGA can be programmed to perform the functions of a microcontroller; however, a microcontroller cannot be reprogrammed to perform as an FPGA.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a field programmable gate array (FPGA)? 



<p>First introduced by manufacturer Xilinx in 1985, FPGAs are highly valued for their versatility and processing power. As a result, they are a preferred choice in many <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hpc">high-performance computing (HPC</a>), digital signal processing (DSP) and prototyping applications.<br><br>Unlike traditional application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), FPGAs are designed to be configured (and reconfigured) “in the field” after the initial manufacturing process is complete. While customization is the FPGAs greatest value offering, it should be noted that FPGAs not only allow for programmability, they require it. Unlike ASICs, FPGAs are not “out-of-the-box” solutions, and they must be configured prior to use with a hardware description language (HDL), such as verilog or VHDL. Programming an FPGA requires specialized knowledge, which can increase costs and delay deployments. While some FPGAs do offer non-volatile memory that can retain programming instructions when powered off, typically FPGAs must be configured on start-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 FPGA benefits 



<p>Despite these challenges, FPGAs remain useful in applications requiring high-performance, low-latency and real-time flexibility. FPGAs are particularly well suited for applications requiring the following:</p>



 
 Rapid prototyping: FPGAs can be quickly configured into multiple types of customized digital circuits, allowing for expedited deployments, assessments and modifications without the need for costly and time-consuming fabrication processes.&nbsp; 



 Hardware acceleration: Demanding applications benefit from the FPGA’s parallel-processing capabilities. FPGAs may offer significant performance improvements for computationally intensive tasks, such as signal processing, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cryptography">cryptography</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> algorithms. 



 Customization: FPGAs are a flexible hardware solution that can be easily optimized to meet specific project requirements.&nbsp; 



 Longevity: FPGA-based designs may benefit from a longer hardware lifespan as FPGAs can be updated and reconfigured to meet evolving project demands and technology standards.&nbsp; 
 



 FPGA components 



<p>To achieve reconfigurability, FPGAs are composed of an array of programmable logic blocks interconnected by a programmable routing fabric. The main components of a typical FPGA are as follows:</p>



 
 Configurable logic blocks (CLBs): CLBs provide compute functionality and may contain a small number of primitive logic elements, such as logic gates, small look-up tables (LUTs), multiplexors and flip-flops for data storage.&nbsp; 



 Programmable interconnects: Made up of wire segments joined by electrically programmable switches, these linkages provide routing pathways between the various FPGA resources, allowing for different configurations and the creation of custom digital circuits.&nbsp; 



 I/O Blocks (IOBs): The interface between an FPGA and other external devices is enabled by input output (I/O) blocks, which allow the FPGA to receive data from and control peripherals&nbsp; 
 



 FPGA use cases 



<p>Versatile by nature, FPGAs are common among a wide variety of industries and applications:</p>



 
 Aerospace and defense: Offering high-speed parallel processing valuable for data acquisition, FPGAs are a preferred choice for radar systems, image processing and secure communications.&nbsp; 



 Industrial control systems (ICS): Industrial control systems used to monitor infrastructure—like power grids, oil refineries and water treatment plants—use FPGAs that can be easily optimized to meet the unique needs of various industries. In these critical industries, FPGAs can be used to implement various automations and hardware-based encryption features for efficient cybersecurity. 



 ASIC development: FPGAs are often used in the prototyping of new ASIC chips.&nbsp; 



 Automotive: Advanced signal processing also makes FPGAs well-suited for automotive applications, including advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), sensor fusion and GPS. 



 Data centers: FPGAs add value to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> by optimizing high-bandwidth, low-latency servers, networking and storage infrastructure.

 Reconfigurability: Highly reconfigurable, reprogrammable logic 
 



 What is a microcontroller? 



<p>Microcontrollers are a type of compact, ready-made ASIC containing a processor core (or cores), memory (RAM), and erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) for storing the custom programs that run on the microcontroller. Known as a “system-on-a-chip (SoC)” solution, microcontrollers are essentially small computers integrated into a single piece of hardware that can be used independently or in larger embedded systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumer-grade microcontrollers, such as the Arduino Starter Kit or Microchip Technology PIC, can be configured using assembly language or common programming languages (C, C++), and they are favored by hobbyists and educators for their cost-effective accessibility. Microcontrollers are also capable of handling more complex and critical tasks and are common in industrial applications. However, decreased processing power and memory resources can limit the microcontroller’s efficacy in more demanding applications.&nbsp;</p>



 Microcontroller benefits 



<p>Despite their limitations, microcontrollers offer many advantages, including the following:</p>



 
 Compact design: Microcontrollers integrate all necessary components onto a small, single chip offering a small footprint valuable in applications where size and weight are a priority.&nbsp; 



 Energy efficiency: Designed to operate on low power, microcontrollers are well suited for battery-powered devices and other applications where power consumption is a concern. 



 Cost-effective: Microcontrollers offer a complete SoC solution that reduces the need for additional peripherals and components. Low-cost, general-purpose microcontrollers can greatly reduce overall project expenses.&nbsp; 



 Flexibility: Although not as versatile as FPGAs, microcontrollers are programmable for a wide range of various applications. While they cannot be reprogrammed on the hardware level, microcontrollers can be easily reconfigured, updated and optimized on a software level.&nbsp; 
 



 Microcontroller components 



<p>When reprogrammability is not a priority, self-contained microcontrollers offer a compact and capable alternative. The following are the key components of a microcontroller:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Central processing unit (CPU): Colloquially referred to as the “brain,” the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/central-processing-unit">central processing unit (CPU)</a> serves as the core component responsible for executing instructions and controlling operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Memory: Microcontrollers contain both volatile memory (RAM), which stores temporary data that may be lost if the system loses power, and non-volatile memory (ROM, FLASH) for storing the microcontroller’s programming code. 



 Peripherals: Depending on the intended application, a microcontroller may contain various peripheral components, such as input/output (I/O) interfaces like timers, counters, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C). 
 



 Microcontroller use cases 



<p>Unlike FPGAs, small, affordable, and non-volatile microcontrollers are ubiquitous in modern electronics, frequently deployed for specific tasks, including the following:</p>



 
 Automotive systems: Microcontrollers are used in engine control, airbag deployment and in-car infotainment systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Consumer electronics: Microcontrollers are critical to smartphones, smart TVs and other home appliances, especially devices that integrate into the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>. 



 Industrial automation: Microcontrollers are well-suited to industrial applications, such as controlling machinery, monitoring systems and process automation.&nbsp; 



 Medical devices: Microcontrollers are often deployed in life-saving devices, such as pacemakers, blood glucose monitors and diagnostic tools.&nbsp; 
 



 Microcontroller features 



 
 Processing core: Fixed CPU 



 Memory: Integrated RAM and ROM/Flash&nbsp; 



 Peripherals: Built-in I/O interfaces for 



 Programming: Software (C, Assembly)&nbsp; 



 Reconfigurability: Limited, firmware updates

 How can Liminal analyze the passwordless authentication space in different verticals to create a tailored GTM strategy that identifies key metrics, use cases, and ideal customer profiles? 



 







 



 Introduction 



<p>As the CIAM and authentication market spaces evolve, new vendors enter and compete against one another. Liminal was tasked with a Go-to-Market Strategy engagement with a prominent, large-scale digital identity vendor client as they launched their passwordless platform. The project aimed to develop actionable playbooks that the client’s salesforce team could leverage when working with its global customers with significant presence across key identified verticals, such as financial institutions and eCommerce. To achieve this goal, the Liminal team of skilled consultants and strategists worked closely with the client to refine a GTM strategy that tasked Liminal with creating playbooks specific to the client’s key verticals that outlined the buyer’s journey. It increased their ability to grow their customer portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



 Challenge 



<p>While the client’s product portfolio boasted innovative capabilities and features, developing tailored sales materials that differentiated the client from its competition proved difficult. Liminal wanted to ensure the vendor could leverage unique insights into different verticals aligned with other industries’ various goals, personas, and metrics. Specifically, Liminal wanted to identify these key elements:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs): Who are the personas with whom the sales team would interact across different verticals?&nbsp; 
 



 
 Key use cases: Which use cases most apply to the respective vertical the sales team is targeting?&nbsp; 
 



 
 The buyer/customer journey: What is the timeline for each vertical and ICP’s buying process? What questions or roadblocks might the potential customer raise along the way?&nbsp; 
 



 
 Tailored sales metrics: How can Liminal provide the client with quantifiable sales metrics that differentiate their product from other vendors while specifically targeting each vertical?&nbsp; 
 



<p>To tackle the challenge, Liminal leveraged market research, extensive customer interviews, and the creation of a dynamic ROI Calculator for each vertical. Through our analysis of the identity market, we landed on two key verticals that the client could focus on in its sales efforts: Financial Services and e-commerce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, Liminal pursued a long list of customer interviews to collect key insights about what customers seek in an identity vendor. Our research helped us identify the key use cases relevant to each vertical, such as Account Takeover Fraud in Financial Services or Cart Abandonment in e-commerce. We met with various personas that also led us to pinpoint which roles our client would interact with when selling. Our interviews provided information regarding the buying journey, helping us to identify how long the client could expect to engage with potential customers and who these customers might be.&nbsp;</p>



 Solution 



<p>The knowledge we gained during our extensive research led to developing two vertical-specific GTM Playbooks for our clients to leverage in their sales efforts. We used our four main takeaways from the research (ICPs, key use cases, buying journey, and sales metrics) to differentiate the playbooks so that our clients knew how to approach different sales scenarios across verticals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using our resources, we created ICP profiles in each vertical to provide insights into the different industries. We also made sure to weave in the key use cases we identified from our research so the sales team could understand which use cases applied more directly to the two verticals. This information allowed us to create specific sales enablement strategy materials, such as questions to ask the customer, key points to make, or categories where the customer wants to save money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We combined the work in our vertical playbooks to transfer into dynamic ROI Calculators for the client to use in each vertical. The goal was to make the vertical playbooks go hand-in-hand with the ROI Calculators so our client could further their sales efforts with tailored metrics to the customer and their industry. This would allow our clients to avoid any industry-knowledge gaps in the sales process and expedite the sales process without conducting initial discovery or research into the industry. The goal was to enhance our client’s sales efforts as their products launched.&nbsp;</p>



 Outcome 



<p>Liminal successfully provided the client with two actionable GTM playbooks and two dynamic ROI Calculators, each tied to a unique vertical. The playbooks combined all of our key findings and presented them in a logical flow that followed the client’s specific sales framework and methodology. We hosted training sessions with the client, walking them through the playbooks so they could understand how to&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most unique outcome of the engagement was the two ROI Calculators we provided to the client. The calculators allowed our client to walk through a potential deal with a customer, selecting the use cases they were most interested in and the products they wanted to purchase. From there, the calculators also had customizable options, allowing the salesperson to work closely with their customers, tailoring specific metrics to their needs. This helped our client calculate savings categories across industry pain points, making the data digestible to the potential customer. Our ROI Calculators predicted an average of a 7x ROI for customers with a million end-users, providing the client with a metrics breakdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The client was able to target unique personas in different verticals, understand their wants and needs in the market, and provide uniquely differentiated metrics from competitors.&nbsp;</p>



 Conclusion&nbsp; 



<p>As a result of our engagement, the client walked away with actionable GTM vertical-specific playbooks and a customizable ROI Calculator to leverage in sales efforts. The engagement was successful from the client’s perspective, along with Liminal’s, and proved our ability to enhance a client’s sales process. Additionally, the engagement materials demonstrated tangible results, where the client could convert perspectives to customers and increase their revenue. As one of the first major GTM Strategy engagements, this project promoted our ability to leverage industry knowledge and combine it with feedback from customers we spoke to turn it into easily comprehensible deliverables. Overall, the engagement highlighted the team’s ability to successfully leverage our data-driven research and turn it into practical sales materials for a company to utilize in its sales strategy efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two months ago, we launched a new part of the Dark Matter Labs ecosystem: Property &amp; Beyond Lab. Since then, we have expanded our portfolio of <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/">strategic property provocations</a>; we have launched a <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/tool">digital platform</a> that maps the connections between global systemic risks and property; and we have co-hosted the conference “<a href="https://www.notion.so/what-and-how-we-own/What-How-We-Own-The-Politics-of-Change-0755201b081549bfa8ff8426c1fdeb0f">What and How We Own: The Politics of Change</a>”, where we gathered with over a hundred experts to explore the intricate workings of property systems, their extensive impacts on our everyday lives, as well as promising ideas, case studies, and methods that can seed different futures.</p><p>If there is one thing that has become unmistakably clear at our conference and through this work, it is that the time of tinkering at the margins is over. In a similar way that we cannot address the biodiversity crisis by simply planting additional trees, we are seeing that we cannot address the micro-massive impacts of failing property institutions — such as rising inequality, growing numbers of unhoused peoples, and concentrations of power — by tweaks to surface level codes such as taxes, regulation, and contracts.</p><p>The global real estate market (which includes commercial and residential real estate and agricultural land) is the <a href="https://www.savills.com/impacts/market-trends/the-total-value-of-global-real-estate-property-remains-the-worlds-biggest-store-of-wealth.html">world’s biggest source of wealth at $379.7 trillion</a>, yet much of that is owned by the <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/family-office-uhnw/reports/global-wealth-report-2023.html">global top 1% whose wealth share rose to 44.5%</a> in 2022. While the planet is headed for at least 1.5C of heating — with disastrous results for people and ecosystems — control over the critical minerals necessary for our green transitions has been highly concentrated, with<a href="https://www.oecd.org/trade/topics/global-value-chains-and-trade/documents/clean-energy-supply-chains-OECD-G7-202305.pdf"> only 3 companies owning 49% of global lithium production in 2020.</a> Meanwhile, our housing crisis puts us in a tight double bind, with our need to house people contributing heavily to even more carbon emissions and biodiversity loss (our own research suggests that <a href="https://www.irresistiblecircularsociety.eu/news/invitation-paper-a-new-european-bauhaus-economy-designing-our-futures">Europe can afford to build only 176,000 new homes a year </a>to remain within the carbon budget set by the Paris Agreement, which is far below the housing supply required to meet&nbsp;demand).</p><p>Governments have been dealing with these emerging and evolving risks and impacts by shoring up flaws in policies or trying to course-correct. Yet we believe it is time to ask the more fundamental question of whether property and ownership in its current form, with its hierarchies of control and worldview of separation, is in fact the right framework to deal with the challenges at hand. Or to put it simply, it is becoming clear that without innovating the deep code of property and the cultural norms that surround it, the scale of the transitions ahead of us feel out of&nbsp;reach.</p><p>This blog is an attempt to dive deeper into the complexities of the property problem space, by starting to unpack two of its most pressing yet knotted challenges: housing and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Part 1: In this first part, we will start to peel back the layers of the multifaceted crisis of housing looking at its intertwined economic, social, and ecological impacts.</p><p>Part 2: A second part on data ownership will follow, in which we will look at the need to transition away from governing data itself to governing access to data and what it is used&nbsp;for.</p><p>These blogs are intended both as an exploratory journey and a rallying cry to policymakers and strategic risk holders to deepen their commitment to systemic innovation and invest in compelling visions for the future to be able to overcome political and institutional lock-ins and match the necessity of the contexts we&nbsp;face.</p><p>HOW A DIFFERENT LENS ALLOWS US TO SEE PROPERTY&nbsp;ANEW</p><p>At Dark Matter Labs, we have found it increasingly helpful to get a better picture of property’s complex problem landscapes by looking through the lens of affordances and disaffordances: what do our property systems allow us to do, see, be and imagine? And consequently, how could its redesign recast our relationship with each other, with ecosystems, and with the planet and build a pathway to systemic thriving?</p><p>Affordance is a concept that was originally developed in the late 1960s by the ecological psychologist James Gibson, who defined affordance as what an artifact “offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill” (<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs137/2017/readings/Gibson-AFF.pdf">Gibson, 1979</a>). It was later popularized in design by Donald Norman’s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, where he defined it as the “perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine how the thing could possibly be used.” Affordances can be both positive and negative, which is to say beneficial and injurious depending on the context. A fire can afford both the warmth necessary to life, but it can also cause destruction.</p><p>What is interesting in adopting the lens of affordances is that it allows us to see our legal designs as not just socially-constructed, but as having ontological effects: what we design designs us back. Our legal designs mediate our understanding of perceptions of the world and what is possible to do. Our individual and collective sense of agency is mediated by these designs, and so too is our understanding of ourselves and the world co-constituted through the lens of that mediation.</p><p>When we apply this lens to our property rights frameworks, what becomes very clear is how it allows for a very specific, narrow range of behaviors and actions that are increasingly misaligned with our changing material reality (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VUCA">VUCA&nbsp;world</a>).</p><p>Through its legal coding, property rights have turned the world into abstract objects and things, and subsequently a world of capital assets. Land is no longer a source of social and cultural value, a sense of belonging and group identity, or existential and ecological rootedness, but an object that can be mortgaged and sold for the extraction of profits. The prism of property as it currently stands stamps out any different modes of relating to land other than through the lens of financial value. Property detaches ‘things’ from their social and ecological relationships, resulting in absurdities like timber being valued as a resource more than the forest as a living ecosystem.</p><p>Property tends to create competing interests of the individual owner versus society. As Blackstone famously formulated, the “sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe” (<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/blackstone-on-property-1753">Blackstone, 1753</a>). It generates an artificial distinction between first and third parties, and then systematically structures relationships in service of property-owners at the expense of non-owners and that which is ‘owned’. In this process of optimizing for individual rights and interests, it purports to provide security — as if somehow the world is made up of a series of individual parts, rather than recognizing that everything happens out of the coming together of complex wholes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA5GV-XmwtM">Iain McGilchrist</a>, 2023).</p><p>Property affords only a reductive mode of information processing and organizing in which complexity and entanglement is reduced to systems of low information burdens. Boundaries are drawn, fences put up, to communicate the limit of where rights apply, from which the world and their interests are excluded. Definitions of what counts as “property”, “property damage” and externalities limit actions that can be taken to mitigate distributed risks and impacts, or acknowledge multiple value creation, as is becoming increasingly pressing with copyright and other forms of IP in the context of machine learning systems which extract private value from the availability of vast amounts of public training data and the “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">collective intelligence</a>” of humanity.</p><p>Where Friedrich Hayek recognized that “liberty and responsibility are inseparable” in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution_of_Liberty#:~:text=Hayek%20highlights%20the%20decline%20in,guides%20individuals%20in%20their%20choices.">The Constitution of Liberty</a>, our current forms of property have failed to balance the freedoms of rights with the burdens of responsibilities, especially when those consequences fall on non-individualized and non-human, such as the social and ecological commons.</p><p>Seeing property and ownership through the lens of affordances — by looking at how it shapes our ways of being and relating, the incentives it creates, the priorities it assigns, the asymmetries it creates — allows us to lift our gaze from the micro-institutional or domain-specific level where impacts are felt, one case or transaction at a time, towards the wider system-level operation of property and the logic and norms that define and sustain&nbsp;it.</p><p>THE HOUSING CRISIS: A KNOTTED PROBLEM&nbsp;SPACE</p><p>By diving deeper into the deep codes of our systems, we get to see our problem spaces more clearly. The housing crisis, often portrayed as a singular issue, starts to quickly reveal itself as a complex web of challenges and deeply intertwined with and restrained by the disaffordances of our dominant systems of property and ownership.</p><p>New York, Toronto, London, Amsterdam, and Seoul, indeed nearly every urban center faces a housing crisis. In 200 cities studied across the world, <a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/kallergis_wp18ak1.pdf">90% were found to be unaffordable to live in</a>. <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/press-releases/new-report-shows-rent-unaffordable-half-renters-cost-burdens-surge-record-levels">Nearly half of all renters in the US spend more than 30% of their income on rent</a>, and a quarter spend more than 50%. Houselessness is on the rise and not just limited to major cities:<a href="https://www.security.org/resources/homeless-statistics/"> the number of people without access to housing climbed in every type of setting</a> — including a 10% increase in rural areas. Globally, UN-Habitat estimates that <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-11-01-01.pdf">1.6 billion people live in inadequate housing</a>, of which 1 billion live in slums and informal settlements; numbers which are likely to only increase with growing displacement by conflicts and climate-related impacts like water scarcity, crop failure, and rising sea&nbsp;levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, real estate lobbyists, policy makers, and some housing experts have portrayed the housing crisis as simply a problem of supply. If we build more housing, the argument goes, people will have more choices, and rents will be lower. The problem with this supply-side argument is that it is not the full picture. In fact, research shows that there tends to be a surplus in virtually every urban area. New York, for example, has an <a href="https://jacobin.com/2016/10/housing-crisis-rent-landlords-homeless-affordability">excess of a quarter-million units</a> beyond what is necessary to house its current population. Not to mention its vacant office and commercial space — 74,582,671 square feet to be precise, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/10/opinion/nyc-office-vacancy-playground-city.html">26 Empire State buildings</a> worth — that could potentially be retrofitted for housing and community-serving uses.</p><p>Simply building more homes won’t solve the problem of affordability. The crisis is much deeper than that: it is rooted in a cluster of dysfunctions of property and ownership. In order to craft effective solutions, we need a new approach that unpacks how our legal coding, institutional logics, and cultural norms around property all play a complex, entangled role in creating this multi-faceted problem space. This means developing a new understanding of how property as a framework has articulated and captured social imaginaries as to the goals we set around housing, how it has enabled the privatization of benefits while commoning costs to society and the environment, and how it has built a systemic lock-in for NIMBY solutions. This is especially critical because pathways to democratizing access to housing as we currently understand it are becoming increasingly unavailable, through rising costs, carbon constraints, material affordability, and declining public investments.</p><p>UNTANGLING THE&nbsp;KNOT</p><p>So what are the different strands of this knotted problem space? What actions, behaviors, and imaginaries does property and ownership afford us when it comes to our&nbsp;homes?</p><p>Homes are seen as a financial asset, rather than a place to live&nbsp;…</p><p><a href="https://www.savills.com/impacts/market-trends/the-total-value-of-global-real-estate-property-remains-the-worlds-biggest-store-of-wealth.html">Housing has become the world’s most valuable asset class</a>, worth US$379.7 trillion or three times global GDP. Owning property is viewed as a secure pathway to long-term financial stability for individual and institutional investors alike. Residential real estate has become an investment of choice for private equity firms, pension funds, and insurance companies, who have turned to real estate looking to diversify and hedge against market volatility, driving up housing prices — and financial volatility for individual residents — as a result. This prioritization of housing as a financial asset over its social value or human right is problematic, but the reality is presently essential to the economic models of our cities and countries.<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-state-and-local-property-taxes-work"> Property taxes account for over 60% of township/municipal revenue in the US</a>, while also being an essential part of the financial health and sustainability of the pensions of our nurses, teachers, and firefighters. We are facing deep institutional lock-ins that make dealing with any systemic change a political hot&nbsp;potato.</p><p>… where security of tenure for some comes at the expense of that of&nbsp;others</p><p>By perceiving and treating housing as just another commodity, we fall into a persistent analytical error. At the heart of this error is that land, on which housing is built, is a fixed resource. We cannot produce more of it. Especially highly desirable land — be it downtown building lots or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/16/arizona-colorado-river-water-rights-drought">arable farmland</a> — are scarce, giving those who own it the upper hand. In addition, housing is immobile and has high transaction and construction costs (<a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/rethinking-the-economics-of-land-and-housing-9781350374270/">Ryan-Collins et al. 2017</a>). These features are not market failures, but fundamental properties that limit how the housing system is able to behave. They mean that increased demand invariably translates into upward spirals of housing prices, rent-seeking and hoarding, rather than increased supply as in real commodity markets. Housing increases in value over time, incentivizing someone to hold on to an empty apartment, to keep land lying dormant, or to buy an additional investment property. The result is that the security of tenure and investment by some deprives others, accelerating and externalizing the costs of insecurity.</p><p>Home ownership allows for the privatization of public value&nbsp;…</p><p>What would your home be worth if you were to move it to McCarthy, Alaska? (one of the most isolated places with a population of a mere 107 at the 2020 census) This might be a strange question, but not if you consider tha<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1376634/land-price-as-a-share-of-property-value-in-selected-cities-in-the-us/">t most of what our homes are worth is made up of the value of the land on which it is built</a>, sometimes over two-thirds. In matters of real estate, it really is location, location, location. The majority of current property value is derived from what is called “unearned increment”, the financial value that is captured by homeowners, landlords, and speculators of the non-financial value generated by our social and ecological commons. These are the things that make a place desirable, such as access to schools, safe streets, the amount of sunlight, or ecological integrity. Property rights have enabled homeowners to systematically gain an unfair dividend of our shared public goods and investments. This private enclosure of public goods is nowhere more evident than in the example of the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">NYC High Line</a>. A US$187 million investment (of which 77% from public funds from a mixture of NYC, federal and state government) led to a US$3.4 billion surge in surrounding property values. Individual homeowners reaped most of this benefit, whilst property tax revenue only went up by US$103&nbsp;million.</p><blockquote>“Roads are made, streets are made, services are improved, electric light turns night into day, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains — and all the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements is effected by the labor and cost of other people and the taxpayers. To not one of those improvements does the land monopolist, as a land monopolist, contribute, and yet by every one of them the value of his land is enhanced.”</blockquote><blockquote>— W. Churchill</blockquote><p>… and the externalization of&nbsp;costs</p><p>Whenever we build a house, we create social and ecological impacts that reach well beyond the construction site, impacts that are seldom factored into the overall costs. This includes environmental degradation, depletion of resources, and both direct and indirect displacement of communities — costs that society bears rather than them being included in the price of construction. In 2020, the<a href="https://globalabc.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/GABC_Buildings-GSR-2021_BOOK.pdf"> built environment accounted for 37% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions</a> and the use of <a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/introducing-retrofirst-a-new-aj-campaign-championing-reuse-in-the-built-environment">25% of all plastic</a> worldwide. Construction is spending our sand ‘budgets’ faster than it can be produced naturally and responsibly, leading to pollution, hoarding, price gouging and even the<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sand-mafias-are-plundering-the-earth/"> rise of “sand mafias”.</a> All these forms of lifecycle costs are rarely taken into account, never mind priced in for investors, developers or builders, and the impacts accumulate. As the necessity to internalize these costs grows, we are likely to see a significant decrease in housing affordability for the majority. This will also challenge the supply-side approach to solving the housing crisis, potentially leading to an erosion of the housing market’s capacity to meet demand affordably.</p><p>CRAFTING PATHWAYS TOWARDS NEW AFFORDANCES</p><p>Untangling the knot of the housing crisis shows that if we were to meaningfully take on its interwoven challenges, we would have to reimagine and recode the problematizing structures of property and ownership. We would need to build new institutional mechanisms that provide a wider scope of affordances, allowing for (re)new(ed) ways of relating to our homes, the land it is built on, the materials it is drawn from, the ecologies it supports, and the public goods it relies on. It would involve unhooking homes from both control and extractive dynamics in favor of stewardship, mutual care, and responsibility.</p><p>On our journey so far, we have begun to progressively craft some of the blueprints for instruments, institutions, and interfaces that allow for new ways of relating to our&nbsp;homes.</p><p>What if building materials of a house were rented and not&nbsp;owned?</p><p>This might involve a system where materials are not owned but are part of an<a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/gg6r1tfm/production/e2d01e567642a433f4eb812cf19ab5c20f2aa0e2.pdf"> Open Chain Digital Trust. </a>This idea reflects the philosophy once expressed by the Indigenous peoples of Taiwan: “I will borrow the stones and give them back once I’m done.” Such a system is now feasible digitally and enables a fully circular material economy — designed to remove incentives for waste, rent-seeking and hoarding and encourage maximum utility and sustainability. Open Chain Digital Trusts are one way in which new technologies are creating affordances that surpass the qualitative affordances of not just property rights but law as such, allowing us to dynamically and transparently manage multiple entangled risks, interests, and values and distribute power in unprecedented ways.</p><p>What if a house could generate value for the&nbsp;commons?</p><p>Community Land Trusts have long been around as a promising way of removing housing from the speculative market to create stable, affordable housing options that are controlled by the community and stewarded by the residents that live in them. The <a href="https://www.theguild.community/peoples-community-land-trust/">People’s Community Land Trust in Atlanta</a> is an inspiring example of leveraging housing to build community wealth. Yet regulatory barriers and long and expensive development trajectories have meant that CLTs are still not widespread: there are an<a href="https://www.policylink.org/resources-tools/tools/all-in-cities/housing-anti-displacement/community-land-trusts#:~:text=Today%2C%20there%20are%20an%20estimated,close%20to%2020%2C000%20rental%20units."> estimated 225 CLTs in the US that provide only around 10,000 homeownership units</a> and 20,000 rentals. That’s why we have been contemplating what kind of additional pathways are opened up when a house is not just put in the hands of the community, but removed entirely from property structures and is made self-owning. Liberating a house from its extractive rent-seeking logic allows it to be put fully in the service of both the ecological and social commons. It could unlock (re)generative returns currently unavailable within housing policy, such as savings in healthcare or ecosystem restoration. We are looking to demonstrate this with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19cSm8Wj0N5DrOXNwOSfsAOt3--O73mP4/view?usp=drive_link">FreeHouse Toronto</a>, where we aim to build regenerative housing on ravine land, where residents carry out land stewardship under the leadership of Indigenous stewardship stakeholder groups.</p><p>What if our contract would not be with a landlord, but with our neighbors?</p><p>Rent-seeking behavior has largely undermined property’s classical justification as a means of securing future returns on labor and contribution and has instead led to increasing waste and inefficiencies of use. Previously we have written about how our Proof of Possibility <a href="https://bloombergcities.jhu.edu/news/city-putting-its-people-charge-public-space#:~:text=They%27re%20doing%20so%20by,billboards%E2%80%94in%20the%20people%27s%20hands">Permissioning the City</a> with local government in Daegu, South Korea seeks to overcome the inefficiencies and barriers of centralized management and regulation by unlocking vacant and underutilized spaces for creative use via a digital peer-to-peer permissioning system. Yet distributed permissioning systems could open up many other new pathways for commoning, for instance by using it to create a <a href="https://www.landcommission.gov.scot/downloads/655b1bb264fac_SLC-DML_Discussion-Paper_for%20publication.pdf">partial commons layer over privately-owned properties</a> to facilitate the development of shared green spaces or joint renewable energy projects.</p><p>OUR CALL TO&nbsp;ACTION</p><p>Addressing the knotted problem spaces of our housing crisis demands a deep-code perspective. Solutions so far have focused too often on single, isolated aspects. Whether it is by boosting public and private housing supplies or establishing CLTs, these solutions individually fail to address the deep-rooted asymmetries, distributed harms, and underperformance plaguing the housing system — dysfunctions that can be traced back to the narrow range of affordances of our axiomatic property and ownership institutions. By diving deep into the deep code, we can start to see how seemingly discrete challenges are in fact interrelated and interdependent, and idiosyncratic for a wider system that optimizes for control, single point optimization, and financial value. A meaningful transition for the housing sector demands we recognize the need to build truly new option spaces. We are in need of new institutional capabilities — governance instruments, cultural norms, technical infrastructures, and legal contracts — that allow us to relate differently to housing as a critical infrastructure and its effects on our shared economic stability, social wellbeing, and environmental thriving.</p><p>Did this blog resonate with you and are you interested in getting involved?

				  Indicio Proven® adds support for OpenID protocols and the SD JWT credential format for interoperability with a wide variety of existing and emerging solutions and specifications, including the European Union’s digital identity requirements.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert, CTO</p>
<p>We at Indicio have been closely monitoring the European Union’s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age_en">eIDAS 2.0</a> (electronic IDentification, Authentication, and Trust Services) regulation and the associated <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">EUDI</a> (European Digital Identity) wallet specification. We are excited to announce that Indicio Proven® supports the OpenID protocols required for both.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that our government and business customers can more easily build verifiable credential solutions and digital wallets that work with emerging EU digital identity wallet specifications in anticipation of the EU’s requirement that all member-state citizens have access to a digital identity wallet by 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follows Indicio’s implementation of OpenID for <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-badges/">Open Badges 3.0</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenID</p>
<p>The OpenID communication <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">protocols</a>, consisting of OpenID4VCI (Verifiable Credential Issuance) and OpenID4VP (Verifiable Credential Presentation), are required by the European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework and are included in the EUDI specification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These protocols enable verifiable digital identity credentials to be issued to a digital wallet and then be presented from that digital wallet to a relying party for verification. Through these mechanisms, European citizens can use digital identity credentials to access government services, prove their age, hold mobile driver’s licenses, and cross borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selective disclosure and EUDI</p>
<p>In addition to our ongoing support for selective disclosure in AnonCreds, Indicio now also supports the new SD JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT) credential format. Selective disclosure is a feature that allows credential holders to present specific information in a credential for verification (instead of having to disclose all the information in the credential at once). This feature is key to meeting the European Union’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/Security+and+Privacy">requirements</a> for data minimization and privacy in eIDAS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven: One solution, many options</p>
<p>We understand the first-mover advantage. And we understand the cost and worry of having to adapt to new specifications, standards, and customer needs. It’s why Indicio ensures our customers have the best and most flexible technology. They can deploy today with the confidence that they can quickly evolve as new specs roll in and stay ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding support for OpenID and SD JWT to Indicio Proven doesn’t just mean satisfying EU requirements; it also means customers satisfy EU requirements and get a host of more advanced features to satisfy business needs, such as the ability to issue KYC credentials, Digital Travel Credentials, and Open Badges 3.0.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s competitive business environment, firms are confronted with complex, computational issues that demand swift resolution. Such problems might be too intricate for a single system to handle or might require an extended time to resolve. For companies that need quick answers, every minute counts. Allowing problems to linger for weeks or months is not feasible for businesses determined to stay ahead of the competition. To address these challenges, enterprises across various industries, such as those in the semiconductor, life sciences, healthcare, financial services and more, have embraced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/high-performance-computing">high-performance computing (HPC)</a>.</p>



<p>With HPC, enterprises are taking advantage of the speed and performance that comes with powerful computers working together. This can be especially helpful amid a steadily growing push to build AI on a larger and larger scale. While analyzing massive amounts of data might feel impossible, HPC enables the use of high-end computational resources that can perform many computations rapidly and in parallel to help businesses get insights faster. At the same time, HPC is used to help businesses bring new products to market. It is also used to better manage risks and more, which is why an increasing number of enterprises are adopting it.</p>



 The role of cloud in HPC 



<p>Most commonly, enterprises that run workloads with surges in activity are finding that they exceed the <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloud/blogs/terry-fisher/2024/02/28/achieving-the-impossible-rightsizing-your-hpc?CommunityKey=74d589b7-7276-4d70-acf5-0fc26430c6c0">compute capacity</a> available on-premises. This is an example of where cloud computing can augment on-premises HPC to transform the business’s approach to HPC with cloud resources. Cloud can help address peaks in demand during product development cycles, which might last from a short duration to a longer duration, and enable organizations to get access to the resources and capabilities that they might not have a need for around the clock. Businesses using HPC from the cloud can take advantage of the benefits of greater flexibility, enhanced scalability, better agility, improved cost efficiencies and more.</p>



 Cadence uses IBM Cloud HPC

 Taking a hybrid cloud approach to HPC 



<p>Traditionally, HPC systems were built on-premises. However, the large models and large workloads that exist today are often not compatible with the hardware that most companies have on premises. Given the high up-front costs of obtaining GPUs, CPUs and networking, as well as those of building the data center infrastructures needed to efficiently run compute at scale, many companies have used cloud infrastructure providers that have already made massive investments in their hardware. To realize the full value of public cloud and on-premises infrastructures, many organizations are adopting a hybrid cloud architecture that is focused on the mechanics of transforming portions of a company’s on-premises data center into private cloud infrastructure.</p>



<p>By adopting a <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloud/blogs/john-easton/2024/02/13/the-what-and-why-of-hpc-and-why-hybrid-matters?CommunityKey=74d589b7-7276-4d70-acf5-0fc26430c6c0">hybrid cloud approach to HPC</a> where cloud and on premises are used together, organizations can use the strengths of both, allowing organizations to achieve the agility, flexibility and security required to meet their demands. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/high-performance-computing">IBM Cloud® HPC</a> can help organizations flexibly manage compute-intensive workloads on-premises. With security and controls built into the platform, IBM Cloud HPC also allows organizations to consume HPC as a fully managed service while helping them address third- and fourth-party risks.</p>



 Looking ahead 



<p>By using hybrid cloud services through platforms like IBM Cloud HPC, enterprises can solve many of their most difficult challenges. As organizations continue to embrace HPC, they should consider how a hybrid cloud approach can complement traditional on-premises HPC infrastructure deployments.</p>

 What is a CPU? 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/central-processing-unit">central processing unit (CPU)</a> is the computer’s brain. It handles the assignment and processing of tasks and manages operational functions that all types of computers use.</p>



<p>CPU types are designated according to the kind of chip that they use for processing data. There’s a wide variety of processors and microprocessors available, with new powerhouse processors always in development. The processing power CPUs provide enables computers to engage in multitasking activities. Before discussing the types of CPUs available, we should clarify some basic terms that are essential to our understanding of CPU types.</p>



 Key CPU terms 



<p>There are numerous components within a CPU, but these aspects are especially critical to CPU operation and our understanding of how they operate:</p>



 
 Cache: When it comes to information retrieval, memory caches are indispensable. Caches are storage areas whose location allows users to quickly access data that’s been in recent use. Caches store data in areas of memory built into a CPU’s processor chip to reach data retrieval speeds even faster than random access memory (RAM) can achieve. Caches can be created through software development or hardware components. 
 



 
 Clock speed: All computers are equipped with an internal clock, which regulates the speed and frequency of computer operations. The clock manages the CPU’s circuitry through the transmittal of electrical pulses. The delivery rate of those pulses is termed clock speed, which is measured in Hertz (Hz) or megahertz (MHz). Traditionally, one way to increase processing speed has been to set the clock to run faster than normal. 
 



 
 Core: Cores act as the processor within the processor. Cores are processing units that read and carry out various program instructions. Processors are classified according to how many cores are embedded into them. CPUs with multiple cores can process instructions considerably faster than single-core processors. (Note: The term “Intel® Core™” is used commercially to market Intel’s product line of multi-core CPUs.) 
 



 
 Threads: Threads are the shortest sequences of programmable instructions that an operating system’s scheduler can independently administer and send to the CPU for processing. Through multithreading—the use of multiple threads running simultaneously—a computer process can be run concurrently. Hyper-threading refers to Intel’s proprietary form of multithreading for the parallelization of computations. 
 



 Other components of the CPU 



<p>In addition to the above components, modern CPUs typically contain the following:</p>



 
 Arithmetic logic unit (ALU): Carries out all arithmetic operations and logical operations, including math equations and logic-based comparisons. Both types are tied to specific computer actions. 



 Buses: Ensures proper data transfer and data flow between components of a computer system. 



 Control unit: Contains intensive circuitry that controls the computer system by issuing a system of electrical pulses and instructs the system to carry out high-level computer instructions. 



 Instruction register and pointer: Displays location of the next instruction set to be executed by the CPU. 



 Memory unit: Manages memory usage and the flow of data between RAM and the CPU. Also, the memory unit supervises the handling of cache memory. 



 Registers: Provides built-in permanent memory for constant, repeated data needs that must be handled regularly and immediately. 
 



 How do CPUs work? 



<p>CPUs use a type of repeated command cycle that’s administered by the control unit in association with the computer clock, which provides synchronization assistance.</p>



<p>The work a CPU does occurs according to an established cycle (called the CPU instruction cycle). The CPU instruction cycle designates a certain number of repetitions, and this is the number of times the basic computing instructions will be repeated, as enabled by that computer’s processing power.</p>



<p>The three basic computing instructions are as follows:</p>



 
 Fetch: Fetches occur anytime data is retrieved from memory. 



 Decode: The decoder within the CPU translates binary instructions into electrical signals, which engage with other parts of the CPU. 



 Execute: Execution occurs when computers interpret and carry out a computer program’s set of instructions. 
 



<p>Basic attempts to generate faster processing speeds have led some computer owners to forego the usual steps involved in creating high-speed performance, which normally require the application of more memory cores. Instead, these users adjust the computer clock so it runs faster on their machine(s). The “overclocking” process is analogous to “jailbreaking” smartphones so their performance can be altered. Unfortunately, like jailbreaking a smartphone, such tinkering is potentially harmful to the device and is roundly disapproved by computer manufacturers.</p>



 Types of central processing units 



<p>CPUs are defined by the processor or microprocessor driving them:</p>



 
 Single-core processor: A single-core processor is a microprocessor with one CPU on its die (the silicon-based material to which chips and microchips are attached). Single-core processors typically run slower than multi-core processors, operate on a single thread and perform the instruction cycle sequence only once at a time. They are best suited to general-purpose computing. 



 Multi-core processor: A multi-core processor is split into two or more sections of activity, with each core carrying out instructions as if they were completely distinct computers, although the sections are technically located together on a single chip. For many computer programs, a multi-core processor provides superior, high-performance output. 



 Embedded processor: An embedded processor is a microprocessor expressly engineered for use in embedded systems. Embedded systems are small and designed to consume less power and be contained within the processor for immediate access to data. Embedded processors include microprocessors and microcontrollers. 



 Dual-core processor: A dual-core processor is a multi-core processor containing two microprocessors that act independently from each other. 



 Quad-core processor: A quad-core processor is a multi-core processor that has four microprocessors functioning independently. 



 Octa-core: An octa-core processor is a multi-core processor that has eight microprocessors functioning independently. 



 Deca-core processor: A deca-core processor is an integrated circuit that has 10 cores on one die or per package. 
 



 Leading CPU manufacturers and the CPUs they make 



<p>Although several companies manufacture products or develop software that supports CPUs, that number has dwindled down to just a few major players in recent years.</p>



<p>The two major companies in this area are Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Each uses a different type of instruction set architecture (ISA). Intel processors use a complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture. AMD processors follow a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture.</p>



 
 Intel: Intel markets processors and microprocessors through four product lines. Its premium, high-end line is Intel Core. Intel’s Xeon® processors are targeted toward offices and businesses. Intel’s Celeron® and Intel Pentium® lines are considered slower and less powerful than the Core line. 
 



 
 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD sells processors and microprocessors through two product types: CPUs and APUs (which stands for accelerated processing units). APUs are CPUs that have been equipped with proprietary Radeon™ graphics. AMD’s Ryzen™ processors are high-speed, high-performance microprocessors intended for the video game market. Athlon™ processors was formerly considered AMD’s high-end line, but AMD now uses it as a basic computing alternative. 
 



 
 Arm: Although Arm doesn’t actually manufacture equipment, it does lease out its valued, high-end processor designs and/or other proprietary technologies to other companies who do make equipment. Apple, for example, no longer uses Intel chips in Mac® CPUs but makes its own customized processors based on Arm designs. Other companies are following this example. 
 



 Related CPU and processor concepts 



 Graphics processing unit (GPUs) 



<p>While the term “graphics processing unit” includes the word “graphics,” this phrasing does not truly capture what GPUs are about, which is speed. In this instance, its increased speed is the cause of accelerating computer graphics.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/gpu">GPU</a> is a type of electronic circuit with immediate applications for PCs, smartphones and video game consoles, which was their original use. Now GPUs also serve purposes unrelated to graphics acceleration, like cryptocurrency mining and the training of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a>.</p>



 Microprocessors 



<p>The quest for computer miniaturization continued when <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/computer-science#:">computer science</a> created a CPU so small that it could be contained within a small integrated circuit chip, called the microprocessor. Microprocessors are designated by the number of cores they support.</p>



<p>A CPU core is “the brain within the brain,” serving as the physical processing unit within a CPU. Microprocessors can contain multiple processors. Meanwhile, a physical core is a CPU built right into a chip, but which only occupies one socket, thus enabling other physical cores to tap into the same computing environment.</p>



 Output devices 



<p>Computing would be a vastly limited activity without the presence of output devices to execute the CPU’s sets of instruction. Such devices include peripherals, which attach to the outside of a computer and vastly increase its functionality.</p>



<p>Peripherals provide the means for the computer user to interact with the computer and get it to process instructions according to the computer user’s wishes. They include desktop essentials like keyboards, mice, scanners and printers.</p>



<p>Peripherals are not the only attachments common to the modern computer. There are also input/output devices in wide use and they both receive information and transmit information, like video cameras and microphones.</p>



 Power consumption 



<p>Several issues are impacted by power consumption. One of them is the amount of heat produced by multi-core processors and how to dissipate excess heat from that device so the computer processor remains thermally protected. For this reason, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperscale">hyperscale data centers</a> (which house and use thousands of servers) are designed with extensive air-conditioning and cooling systems.</p>



<p>There are also questions of sustainability, even if we’re talking about a few computers instead of a few thousand. The more powerful the computer and its CPUs, the more energy will be required to support its operation—and in some macro-sized cases, that can mean gigahertz (GHz) of computing power.</p>



 Specialized chips 



<p>The most profound development in computing since its origins, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> is now impacting most if not all computing environments. One development we’re seeing in the CPU space is the creation of specialty processors that have been built specifically to handle the large and complex <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workload">workloads</a> associated with AI (or other specialty purposes):</p>



 
 Such equipment includes the Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP), which handles <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> tasks in addition to AI applications. Other products equally suited to AI work are the AMD Ryzen Threadripper™ 3990X 64-Core processor and the Intel Core i9-13900KS Desktop Processor, which uses 24 cores. 



 For an application like video editing, many users opt for the Intel Core i7 14700KF 20-Core, 28-thread CPU. Still others select the Ryzen 9 7900X, which is considered AMD’s best CPU for video editing purposes. 



 In terms of video game processors, the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D features a 3D V-Cache technology that helps it elevate and accelerate game graphics. 



 For general-purpose computing, such as running an OS like Windows or browsing multimedia websites, any recent-model AMD or Intel processor should easily handle routine tasks. 
 



 Transistors 



<p>Transistors are hugely important to electronics in general and to computing in particular. The term is a mix of “transfer resistance” and typically refers to&nbsp;a component made of semiconductors used to limit and/or control the amount of electrical current flowing through a circuit.</p>



<p>In computing, transistors are just as elemental. The transistor is the basic building unit behind the creation of all microchips. Transistors help comprise the CPU, and they’re what makes the binary language of 0s and 1s that computers use to interpret Boolean logic.</p>



 The next wave of CPUs 



<p>Computer scientists are always working to increase the output and functionality of CPUs. Here are some projections about future CPUs:</p>



 
 New chip materials: The silicon chip has long been the mainstay of the computing industry and other electronics. The <a href="https://medium.com/@starcompseo/the-future-of-processors-emerging-technologies-and-trends-560f54ac0998#:~:text=The%20future%20of%20processors%20will,as%20autonomous%20vehicles%20and%20healthcare.">new wave </a>of processors (link resides outside ibm.com) will take advantage of new chip materials that offer increased performance. These include carbon nanotubes (which display excellent thermal conductivity through carbon-based tubes approximately 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), graphene (a substance that possesses outstanding thermal and electrical properties) and spintronic components (which rely on the study of the way electrons spin, and which could eventually produce a spinning transistor). 



 Quantum over binary: Although current CPUs depend on the use of a binary language, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">quantum computing</a> will eventually change that. Instead of binary language, quantum computing derives its core principles from quantum mechanics, a discipline that has revolutionized the study of physics. In quantum computing, binary digits (1s and 0s) can exist in multiple environments (instead of in two environments currently). And because this data will live in more than one location, fetches will become easier and faster. The upshot of this for the user will be a marked increase in computing speed and an overall boost in processing power. 
 



 
 AI everywhere: As artificial intelligence continues to make its profound presence felt—both in the computing industry and in our daily lives—it will have a direct influence on CPU design. As the future unfolds, expect to see an increasing integration of AI functionality directly into computer hardware. When this happens, we’ll experience AI processing that’s significantly more efficient. Further, users will notice an increase in processing speed and devices that will be able to make decisions independently in real time. While we wait for that hardware implementation to occur, chip manufacturer Cerebras has already unveiled a processor its makers claim to be the “<a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-fastest-ai-chip-in-the-world-gigantic-ai-cpu-has-almost-one-million-cores-cerebras-has-nvidia-firmily-in-its-sights-as-it-unveils-the-wse-3-a-chip-that-can-train-ai-models-with-24-trillion-parameters#:~:text=Pro-,'The%20fastest%20AI%20chip%20in%20the%20world'%3A%20Gigantic%20AI,models%20with%2024%20trillion%20parameters">fastest AI chip in the world</a>” (link resides outside ibm.com). Its WSE-3 chip can train AI models with as many as 24 trillion parameters. This mega-chip contains four trillion transistors, in addition to 900,000 cores.

  The minimum threshold for Crypto Travel Rule in South Africa is R25,000 ($1,357).  CASPs must verify and share originator and beneficiary details for regulatory compliance.  CASPs need risk-based policies for handling transactions, especially with unhosted wallets, to mitigate financial crimes.  <p>With the majority of adults in Africa not having access to a bank account, cryptocurrency is widely popular in this continent. In sub-Saharan Africa, crypto adoption is among the highest in South&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>While cryptocurrency adoption is still in its infancy in the country, the authorities have initiated several initiatives, such as declaring crypto a financial product and implementing regulatory measures, including <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p> ‍Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in South&nbsp;Africa <p>‍In 2020, changes to the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FIC Act of FICA), which applies AML/CFT laws in South Africa, aligned its cryptocurrency regulatory framework with that of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s standards on crypto and exchange regulation.</p><p>This includes enacting the Crypto Travel Rule, which applies to crypto companies operating inside and outside South Africa. It is also imperative to mention that the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) is the one governing the crypto sector in South&nbsp;Africa.</p> ‍Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>‍South Africa’s IFWG <a href="https://www.treasury.gov.za/comm_media/press/2020/20200414%20IFWG%20Position%20Paper%20on%20Crypto%20Assets.pdf">2020 Position Paper on Crypto Assets</a> mandates the Crypto Travel Rule. According to this, originating and beneficiary Crypto Asset Service Providers or CASPs should obtain, hold, and provide accurate information on their customers.</p><p>On April 18, 2024, the FIC <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Draft-Directive-9-Travel-rule-relating-to-crypto-asset-transfers.pdf">published a draft directive</a> regarding the implementation of the “Travel Rule” regarding crypto transfers. The directive’s purpose is to ensure that those who engage in crypto transfer activities implement FATF’s recommendations. Those who fail to comply with this directive are subject to an administrative sanction.</p><p>The compliance requirement includes conducting customer identification and verification (KYC), developing and implementing a Risk Management and Compliance Programme, training employees, conducting customer due diligence (CDD), keeping accurate records, regularly monitoring for suspicious and unusual activity, and reporting any unusual transactions to the&nbsp;FIC.</p> ‍Compliance Requirements <p>‍Crypto asset service providers (CASPs) must report cash transactions over R25,000 ($1,357). They need to provide the following details: For originators:</p>  Full name  Wallet address  Residential address (if available)  Date and place of&nbsp;birth  Identity number for South Africans, or passport number for non-residents  <p>For Beneficiary:</p>  Name  Wallet address  <p>This data must be verified according to the FIC Act and the CASP’s Risk Management and Compliance Programme.</p><p>For cross-border transfers below R5,000 (about $270), CASPs must share the originator’s full name and wallet address, along with the beneficiary’s name and wallet address, without needing to verify the information unless there are concerns of money laundering or terrorism financing.</p><p>CASPs must also identify and vet the receiving CASP, ensuring it can protect data confidentiality and isn’t involved in illicit activities. They should not process transfers that cannot meet these security and verification requirements. Moreover, CASPs should have policies to decide when to suspend or reject a transfer that lacks necessary details, with procedures in place for any follow-up actions.</p><p>Finally, both originating and beneficiary CASPs are responsible for securely storing this information to ensure record accuracy and protection from unauthorized disclosure. Measures like post-event or real-time monitoring are also used to track transfers that are missing required information.</p> ‍Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>‍In South Africa, CASPs must register as “accountable institutions.” As of March 2024, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-financial-conduct-regulator-approves-59-crypto-licences-2024-03-13/#:~:text=JOHANNESBURG%2C%20March%2013%20(Reuters),with%20regulating%20the%20asset%20class.">the FSCA has approved 59 operating licenses</a> for crypto businesses, with another 262 applications under&nbsp;review.</p><p>Exchanges are required to monitor transfers between CASPs and those involving unhosted wallets — where owners control their private keys directly. Following the FIC directive, both the sending and receiving CASPs must develop and maintain risk-based policies for handling transfers to and from unhosted wallets. This includes establishing procedures for gathering additional information on these wallets when there’s an elevated risk of money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing.</p> ‍Global Context and Comparisons <p>‍As a member of FATF, South Africa was greylisted by the international agency in 2023. Since then, it has been <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/High-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/Increased-monitoring-february-2024.html">working with FATF</a> to strengthen the effectiveness of its AML/CFT&nbsp;regime.</p><p>‍<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/almost-70-of-all-fatf-assessed-countries-have-implemented-the-crypto-travel-rule">According to the latest FATF report</a>, South Africa has been labeled as “Partially Complaint,” along with Brazil, Denmark, Estonia, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Venezuela, regarding its implementation of the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> ‍Concluding Thoughts <p>‍To dissuade financial crimes and avoid increased monitoring by the FATF, South Africa has created a robust regulatory <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML/CFT framework</a> to govern crypto assets. With citizens’ interest in crypto growing and regulators providing a clear set of rules that are challenging to follow, South Africa believes these measures will help it attract more crypto companies and investor attention while mitigating risks.</p> ‍FAQs  ‍‍Q1: What is the minimum transaction amount that triggers the FATF Travel Rule in South&nbsp;Africa? <p>‍Transactions over R25,000 ($1,357) must comply with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> ‍Q2: What information must CASPs exchange under the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>‍CASPs must exchange detailed information, including the full names and wallet addresses of both the originator and beneficiary.</p> ‍Q3: What requirements apply to transactions involving unhosted wallets under the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>‍Transactions involving unhosted wallets require CASPs to implement risk-based policies to identify and mitigate potential financial crimes.</p> ‍Q4: What is the best Travel Rule solution for VASPs in South&nbsp;Africa? <p>‍Shyft Veriscope stands out as the best Travel Rule solution for VASPs in South Africa due to its automated counterparty VASP detection, secure peer-to-peer data transfer without third-party servers, and robust compliance features that align with FATF guidelines.</p> About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 16th May to 31th&nbsp;May <p>Welcome to the latest issue of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This edition unpacks the shifts in the US crypto regulatory landscape as the 2024 presidential elections draw near, highlighting how these changes could impact users and the broader crypto&nbsp;market.</p> Crypto is Now a Major Election&nbsp;Issue <p>With crypto now a hot topic in the US political scene, presidential candidates have reportedly started warming up to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Take Presidential candidate Donald Trump, for instance. Once a Bitcoin skeptic, calling it a “scam” in 2021, the former US President is now promising to protect citizens’ rights to own BTC and “stop Joe Biden’s crusade to crush&nbsp;crypto.”</p><p>He has made several other promises, including supporting the right to self-custody, ensuring the future of BTC remains in the US, opposing the creation of a CBDC, and advocating for the release of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht.</p><p>Additionally, Trump’s campaign has begun accepting crypto donations, and his crypto holdings have now surpassed $10&nbsp;million.</p><p>As a result, Trump’s potential return to the White House is being seen as “broadly positive” for&nbsp;crypto.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1794537413907214356">Image Source</a>)<p>In response, President Joe Biden also made a surprising shift as his re-election campaign began consulting crypto industry players for advice on “crypto policy moving forward.”</p><p>These outreach efforts, however, started just a few weeks ago, shortly after the Biden administration announced it would veto the SAB 121’s repeal, a bill that discourages banks and financial institutions from offering crypto custody services.</p> Change in Voters’ Crypto Perception <p>This growing political engagement with crypto is also shaping public&nbsp;opinion.</p><p>A recent Grayscale survey reveals a shift in how voters view crypto’s role in politics. Conducted by The Harris Poll from April 30 to May 2, the survey polled 1,768 adults planning to vote in the upcoming election.</p><p>The results highlight a cautious approach among potential investors: 44% of US voters who currently don’t own any crypto stated they are “waiting on additional policies and/or regulation” before making a purchase.</p><p>Millennial and GenZ voters, in particular, are strongly interested in crypto, with 62% seeing it as the “future of finance.”</p> SEC Approves Spot ETH&nbsp;ETFs <p>In a surprising move, the securities regulator approved 19b-4 applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, and Invesco Galaxy for Spot Ethereum ETFs last&nbsp;week.</p><p>What makes this interesting is that it happened despite the SEC considering Ether security, according to several&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Spot Ether ETFs, however, won’t begin trading yet as they await the necessary S-1 registration approvals. This process is expected to take a few weeks to a few&nbsp;months.</p> Crypto-favorable Bill also&nbsp;Approved <p>Another recent significant development is the approval of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the US House of Representatives. This act establishes a new legal framework for cryptocurrencies, aiming to provide regulatory clarity and promote&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The bill also gives the CFTC the regulatory authority to regulate crypto as a commodity when it runs on a decentralized blockchain and clarifies the jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and CFTC over digital asset&nbsp;markets.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1793400905028547009">Image Source</a>)<p>The bill was approved with a bipartisan 279–136 vote (with 208 Republicans and 71 Democrats voting in favor) despite the SEC Chairman Gary Gensler warning about “new regulatory gaps,” financial risks, and the bill undermining “decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts.”</p> Wisconsin’s Pension Funds Invests in Bitcoin&nbsp;ETF <p>Another interesting development came from Wisconsin, where the state-owned Wisconsin Pension Fund recently ventured into the cryptocurrency market by investing $180 million in a Bitcoin ETF. This move, constituting 0.1% of its total assets, represents a significant step towards integrating high-risk, potentially high-return investments into a traditionally conservative portfolio.</p><a href="https://x.com/saylor/status/1797535279278072302">(Image Source)</a><p>According to <a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/david-krause-on-the-state-of-wisconsin-investing-in-bitcoin/">Marquette University’s David Krause</a>, this strategic allocation not only introduces diversification but serves as a trial to gauge public reaction and could potentially act as an inflation hedge, thus redefining traditional investment strategies for pension&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Moreover, this approach might just set a precedent, prompting other US pension funds to consider similar investments in the evolving asset class of digital currencies.</p> Concluding Thoughts: What’s&nbsp;Ahead? <p>As we wrap up this edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, it’s clear that political support for crypto in the US could reshape the industry both here and globally. With key elections coming up and significant laws being passed, the future looks promising for wider crypto adoption. How these changes affect the global market will be something to&nbsp;watch.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-guide-for-south-africa">FATF Travel Rule Compliance Guide for South&nbsp;Africa</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-switzerland">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Switzerland</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-germany">FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Germany</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-mexico">Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Mexico</a></p><p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

			<p>Here’s how you can benefit from these updated self-service token settings:</p>
<p>Set up compliance on tokens anytime:&nbsp;Unlike other token standards, the ERC-3643 standard allows compliance configurations to be set up during token creation or after deployment, without requiring redeployment. Our user-friendly T-REX Platform makes it easy to deploy tokens and configure compliance settings, including identity eligibility, jurisdictions, supply rules, and transfer rules through simple forms. You can update compliance settings at any time.</p>
<p>Plug additional custom compliance rules to cover any use case:&nbsp;With the modular compliance capability of the ERC-3643 smart contracts, you can add compliance rules over time, ensuring flexibility and scalability. Our platform provides the most commonly used compliance settings and allows you to incorporate additional rules to tailor the setup for any specific use case.</p>
<p>Change tokenization providers made effortless:&nbsp;One of the key advantages of tokenized securities using ERC-3643 is their independent smart contract suite, ensuring no dependency on a software provider. Tokens can be imported from one tokenization platform to another, allowing issuers to switch to solutions that better address their pain points. We ensure that ERC-3643 tokens can be easily imported to our SaaS tokenization platform, making setup simple and efficient.</p>
<p>Our goal is to simplify token management for your operational teams, enabling you and your agents to effortlessly issue, manage, and distribute tokenized securities on your own.</p>

 Introduction to Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 



<p>If you’re delving into decentralized digital identity (SSI), understanding Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) is crucial. DIDs are unique identifiers that users can create and control without relying on third parties. They use cryptographic elements (public and private keys) to demonstrate ownership. At Extrimian, we provide comprehensive guidance to help you choose the right DID method for your needs.</p>



Source: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 | W3C: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/



 



 Disclaimer 



<p>This article covers only a few of the many points to consider when choosing a DID method. For a deeper understanding, we invite you to watch the following Extrimian Academy Masterclass: <a href="https://extrimian.io/courses/masterclass-what-to-consider-before-choosing-a-did-method/" title="">What to consider before choosing a DID Method.</a></p>



 Understanding DID Documents 



<p>Each DID comes with a DID document. This is a standard file that contains the DID controller’s public key, possibly other keys, and relevant metadata. This document is key for verifying the DID’s authenticity and enabling digital authentication and signing.</p>



 What Is a DID Method? 



<p>A DID method is a technical specification detailing how DIDs and their documents are created, resolved, and managed across systems. DID methods can vary, catering to different functionalities and infrastructure needs.</p>



<p>Learn more about DIDs or Decentralized Identifiers with this: <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="">DIDs Wiki</a></p>



 Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a DID Method 



 Subject of the DID 



 
 Individuals: Data protection regulations like GDPR impose strict requirements that DID methods must meet, including the ability to delete personal data. 



 Organizations: Often require advanced functionalities like managing multiple authorized signatories. 



 Objects (IoT): Need to support a high volume of transactions and secure interactions. 
 



 Legal and Regulatory Framework 



<p>The legal and regulatory environment is crucial when selecting a DID method. Privacy and data protection laws vary across jurisdictions and can influence the choice of method and infrastructure used.</p>



 Required Functionality vs. Technical Complexity 



<p>It’s important to balance the functionality you need against the technical complexity and infrastructure requirements. Some DID methods offer advanced features like key rotation and designated signatories but may be more costly to implement and maintain.</p>



 Regulation Compatibility 



<p>To comply with data protection regulations, it’s essential to choose a DID method that allows for efficient modification or deletion of personal information to respect privacy rights like the right to be forgotten.</p>



 Examples of DID Methods 



 
 DID Web: Uses standard URLs for resolvability via HTTP/S. Ideal for web interoperability. 



 DID Key: Creates DIDs directly from cryptographic keys. Suitable for straightforward setups. 



 DID ION: Based on Bitcoin, it offers a scalable and secure solution. Recommended for high-security needs. 



 DID QuarkID: A decentralized, open, extensible, and multi-chain SSI protocol. Perfect for flexible digital identity management in Latin America. 
 



<p>For more examples, visit the <a href="https://identity.foundation/" title="">DIF documentation</a>.</p>



 Quick Guide: 10 Questions to Choose a DID Method 



<p>Here’s a quick guide from Extrimian with key questions to help you select a DID method that fits your legal, security, and functionality needs:</p>



 
 What type of entity does the DID represent (individual, organization, IoT device)? 



 What are the legal and regulatory requirements in the entity’s jurisdiction? 



 Does the DID method allow for data deletion to comply with regulations like GDPR? 



 What level of security is required for the specific application? 



 What advanced functionalities are needed (key rotation, multiple signatories, etc.)? 



 What is the estimated cost of implementation and maintenance of the DID method? 



 Is it necessary for the DID method to support a high volume of transactions? 



 How critical are ease of resolution and web interoperability for the application? 



 Does the DID method allow for efficient modification or deletion of personal information? 



 How flexible is the DID method to adapt to future needs and technological changes? 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Choosing a DID method involves a detailed understanding of the subject, legal and regulatory requirements, and specific functional needs against technical complexity and costs.

<p>In the realm of software development, efficiency and innovation are of paramount importance. As businesses strive to deliver cutting-edge solutions at an unprecedented pace, generative AI is poised to transform every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unleashing-developer-productivity-with-generative-ai">McKinsey study</a> shows that software developers can complete coding tasks up to twice as fast with generative AI. From use case creation to test script generation, generative AI offers a streamlined approach that accelerates development, while maintaining quality. This ground-breaking technology is revolutionizing software development and offering tangible benefits for businesses and enterprises.</p>



 Bottlenecks in the software development lifecycle 



<p>Traditionally, software development involves a series of time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks. For instance, creating use cases require meticulous planning and documentation, often involving multiple stakeholders and iterations. Designing data models and generating Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) demand significant effort and expertise. Moreover, techno-functional consultants with specialized expertise need to be onboarded to translate the business requirements (for example, converting use cases into process interactions in the form of sequence diagrams).</p>



<p>Once the architecture is defined, translating it into backend Java Spring Boot code adds another layer of complexity. Developers must write and debug code, a process that is prone to errors and delays. Crafting frontend UI mock-ups involves extensive design work, often requiring specialized skills and tools.</p>



<p>Testing further compounds these challenges. Writing test cases and scripts manually is laborious and maintaining test coverage across evolving codebases is a persistent challenge. As a result, software development cycles can be prolonged, hindering time-to-market and increasing costs.</p>



<p>In summary, traditional SDLC can be riddled with inefficiencies. Here are some common pain points:</p>



 
 Time-consuming Tasks: Creating use cases, data models, Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), sequence diagrams and test scenarios and test cases creation often involve repetitive, manual work. 



 Inconsistent documentation:&nbsp;Documentation can be scattered and outdated, leading to confusion and rework. 



 Limited developer resources:&nbsp;Highly skilled developers are in high demand and repetitive tasks can drain their time and focus. 
 



 The new approach: IBM watsonx to the rescue 



<p><a href="https://www.tcs.com/">Tata Consultancy Services</a>, in partnership with IBM®, developed a point of view that incorporates IBM watsonx™. It can automate many tedious tasks and empower developers to focus on innovation. Features include:</p>



 
 Use case creation:&nbsp;Users can describe a desired feature in natural language, then watsonx analyses the input and drafts comprehensive use cases to save valuable time. 



 Data model creation:&nbsp;Based on use cases and user stories, watsonx can generate robust data models representing the software’s data structure. 



 ERD generation:&nbsp;The data model can be automatically translated into a visual ERD, providing a clear picture of the relationships between entities. 



 DDL script generation: Once the ERD is defined, watsonx can generate the DDL scripts for creating the database. 



 Sequence diagram generation: watsonx can automatically generate the visual representation of the process interactions of a use case and data models, providing a clear understanding of the business process. 



 Back-end code generation:&nbsp;watsonx can translate data models and use cases into functional back-end code, like Java Springboot. This doesn’t eliminate developers, but allows them to focus on complex logic and optimization. 



 Front-end UI mock-up generation:&nbsp;watsonx can analyze user stories and data models to generate mock-ups of the software’s user interface (UI). These mock-ups help visualize the application and gather early feedback. 



 Test case and script generation:&nbsp;watsonx can analyse code and use cases to create automated test cases and scripts, thereby boosting software quality. 
 



 Efficiency, speed, and cost savings 



<p>All of these watsonx automations lead to benefits, such as:</p>



 
 Increased developer productivity:&nbsp;By automating repetitive tasks, watsonx frees up developers’ time for creative problem-solving and innovation. 



 Accelerated time-to-market:&nbsp;With streamlined processes and automated tasks, businesses can get their software to market quicker, capitalizing on new opportunities. 



 Reduced costs:&nbsp;Less manual work translates to lower development costs. Additionally, catching bugs early with watsonx-powered testing saves time and resources. 
 



 Embracing the future of software development 



<p>TCS and IBM believe that generative AI is not here to replace developers, but to empower them. By automating the mundane tasks &nbsp;and generating artifacts throughout the SDLC, watsonx paves the way for faster, more efficient and more cost-effective software development. Embracing platforms like IBM watsonx is not just about adopting new technology, it’s about unlocking the full potential of efficient software development in a digital age.</p>

<p>The new era of generative AI has spurred the exploration of AI use cases to enhance productivity, improve customer service, increase efficiency and scale IT modernization.</p>



<p>Recent <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters">research</a> commissioned by IBM® indicates that as many as 42% of surveyed enterprise-scale businesses have actively deployed AI, while an additional&nbsp;40%&nbsp;are actively exploring the use of AI technology. But the rates of exploration of AI use cases and deployment of new AI-powered tools have been slower in the public sector because of potential risks.</p>



<p>However, the <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-05-16-IBM-Study-As-CEOs-Race-Towards-Gen-AI-Adoption,-Questions-Around-Workforce-and-Culture-Persist">latest CEO Study by the IBM Institute for the Business Value</a> found that 72% of the surveyed government leaders say that the potential productivity gains from AI and automation are so great that they must accept significant risk to stay competitive.</p>



 Driving innovation for tax agencies with trust in mind 



<p>Tax or revenue management agencies are a part of the public sector that might likely benefit from the use of responsible AI tools. Generative AI can revolutionize tax administration and drive toward a more personalized and ethical future. But tax agencies must adopt AI tools with adequate oversight and governance to mitigate risks and build public trust.</p>



<p>These agencies have a myriad of complex challenges unique to each country, but most of them share the goal of increasing efficiency and providing the transparency that taxpayers demand.</p>



<p>In the world of government agencies, risks associated to the deployment of AI present themselves in many ways, often with higher stakes than in the private sector. Mitigating data bias, unethical use of data, lack of transparency or privacy breaches is essential.</p>



<p>Governments can help manage and mitigate these risks by relying on IBM’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics-focus-areas">five fundamental properties</a>&nbsp;for trustworthy AI: explainability, fairness, transparency, robustness and privacy. Governments can also create and execute AI design and deployment strategies that keep humans at the hearth of the decision-making process.</p>



 Exploring the views of global tax agency leaders 



<p>To explore the point of view of global tax agency leaders, the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ibm-cbg/">IBM Center for The Business of Government</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/american-university/">American University</a> Kogod School of Business Tax Policy Center, organized a series of roundtables with key stakeholders and released a <a href="https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/AI%20and%20The%20Modern%20Tax%20Agency.pdf">report</a> exploring AI and taxes in the modern age. Drawing on insights from academics and tax experts from around the world, the report helps us understand how these agencies can harness technology to improve efficiencies and create a better experience for taxpayers.</p>



<p>The report details the potential benefits of scaling the use of AI by tax agencies, including enhancing customer service, detecting threats faster, identifying and tackling tax scams effectively and allowing citizens to access benefits faster.</p>



<p>Since the release of the report, a subsequent roundtable allowed global tax leaders to explore what is next in their journey to bring tax agencies around the globe closer to the future. At both gatherings, participants emphasized the importance of <a href="https://www.businessofgovernment.org/blog/ai-tax-administrations-governance-and-innovation">effective governance and risk management</a>.</p>



 Responsible AI services improve taxpayer experiences  



<p>According to the FTA’s <a href="https://read.oecd.org/10.1787/900b6382-en?format=html">Tax Administration 2023</a>&nbsp;report, 85% of individual taxpayers and 90% of businesses now file taxes digitally. And 80% of tax agencies around the world are implementing leading-edge techniques to capture taxpayer data, with over 60% using virtual assistants. The <a href="https://read.oecd.org/10.1787/900b6382-en?format=html">FTA research</a>&nbsp;indicates that this represents a 30% increase from 2018.</p>



<p>For tax agencies, virtual assistants can be a powerful way to reduce waiting time to answer citizen inquiries; 24/7 assistants, such as watsonx™’s advanced AI chatbots, can help tax agencies by decentralizing tax support and reducing errors to prevent incorrect processing of tax filings. The use of these AI assistants also helps streamline fast, accurate answers that deliver elevated experiences with measurable cost savings. It also allows for compliance-by-design tax systems, providing early warnings of incidental errors made by taxpayers that can contribute to significant tax losses for governments if left unresolved.</p>



<p>However, these advanced AI and generative AI applications come with risks, and agencies must address concerns around data privacy and protection, reliability, tax rights and hallucinations from generative models.</p>



<p>Furthermore, biases against marginalized groups remain a risk. Current risk mitigation strategies (including having human-in-system roles and robust training data) are not necessarily enough. Every country needs to independently determine appropriate risk management strategies for AI, accounting for the complexity of their tax policies and public trust.</p>



 What’s next? 



<p>Whether using existing large language models or creating their own, global tax leaders should prioritize AI governance frameworks to manage risks, mitigate damage to their reputation and support their compliance programs. This is possible by training generative AI models using their own quality data and by having transparent processes with safeguards that identify and alert for risk mitigation and for instances of drift and toxic language.</p>



<p>Tax agencies should make sure that technology delivers benefits and produces results that are transparent, unbiased and appropriate. As leaders of these agencies continue to scale the use of generative AI, IBM can help global tax agency leaders deliver a personalized and supportive experience for taxpayers.</p>



<p>IBM’s decades of work with the largest tax agencies around the world, paired with leading AI technology with watsonx™ and watsonx.governance™, can help scale and accelerate the responsible and tailored deployment of governed AI in tax agencies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technical interoperability refers to the ability of different systems, devices, applications, or components to connect, communicate, and exchange data seamlessly and effectively. This involves adhering to common standards and protocols to ensure compatibility, enabling diverse systems to work together without requiring significant modifications.</p>
</blockquote>
 Introduction 
<p>As more ecosystems look to enable digital trust architectures for their participants, interoperability continues to be deemed important but often misunderstood. If you’re working towards enabling a digital trust ecosystem for B2C use cases, consider the following questions:</p>
 
 What ‘technical interoperability’ strategy should you consider to ensure maximum uptake and value creation for your ecosystem? 
 What technical dependencies exist in outside ecosystems when it comes to credentials and wallets? 
 
<p>In my opinion, it looks likely that Government Wallets and OEM Wallets will dominate the storage of high-value personal identity credentials, both in the short term and potentially in the long term. This means that not only will government credential issuers define their own issuance technical requirements, but they will also place conditions on what wallets their issued credentials can be issued to, what technical stack these wallets support, and even business logic.</p>
<p>This raises an important question for non-government credential issuers, verifiers, and ecosystem governance authorities: Should you invest time and resources in defining new technical interoperability profiles, or what your ecosystem will support? Or is this effort redundant if your goal is to verify high-value personal identity credentials?</p>
 Defining Your Ecosystem Strategy 
<p>When thinking about how to best benefit your ecosystem with digital trust tools, here are some considerations to think about:</p>
 
 Ecosystem Goals: Define your business goals. Define the primary functions and goals of your ecosystem. Define your locus of governance and influence. This helps in understanding the scope and the specific needs of your ecosystem. What ecosystems are you working in, and do they fit together nicely? 
 Bootstrapping: Decide whether or not your ecosystem requires a foundational credential from outside your ecosystem to get started. If so, understand the technical interoperability requirements of that system to know what bridges are needed to first become a consumer of credentials. 
 Wallet: Decide where it makes sense for your ecosystem’s credentials to be issued to. Should there be any conditions on what wallets can receive these credential offers? 
 Consuming External Inputs: Understand what additional inputs your ecosystem needs from external ecosystems and how these can be consumed by your participants. This involves defining the necessary bridges and ensuring compatibility with external profiles to create a frictionless user experience. 
 Providing Outputs Externally: Determine if your ecosystem wants to produce outputs that are usable by other ecosystems. This might involve aligning with common standards and external ecosystem interoperability profiles. 
 
 Interoperability Profiles and Wallet Compliance 
<p>If your ecosystem requires consuming credentials from external ecosystems and their wallets (Bootstrapping), you will need to demonstrate alignment to their technical profiles.</p>
<p>Examples of technical interoperability profiles that Governments Issuers, Government Wallets and OEM Wallet providers are aligning to include the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile#aries-interop-profile-version-10">Aries Interop Profile 1.0</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md">Aries Interop Profile 2.0</a>, the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO mDL profile (ISO 18013-5)</a>, the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-sd-jwt-vc-1_0-00.html">OpenID4VC High Assurance Interoperability Profile with SD-JWT VC</a>, the <a href="https://dutchblockchaincoalition.org/en/bouwstenen-2/diip-2">Dutch Decentralized Identity Interop Profile (DIIP)</a>, and others. You’ll notice that they all make hard decisions on credential exchange protocols, credential formats, identifier types, signatures schemes, revocation methods and more. Further, some credentials are bound to wallets, others aren’t – this may be valuable for you to know for your own use cases.</p>
<p>If you decide that it’s not important for your ecosystem and its participants to exert any sort of wallet control today, does it make sense to have your ecosystem credentials issued to these government or OEM wallets? A positive aspect of this approach is that your credentials will sit alongside high-value identity credentials and can be used in conjunction with them during verification interactions. A potential downside is the dependency on these third-party wallets, which could pose risks in the future. However, this approach is straightforward, as illustrated in the next section when we discuss practical examples.</p>
<p>If it is important for you and your participants to exert control over wallets, consider whether you are dependent on other ecosystems to bootstrap your use case. If the answer is no, then think about the demand side for your ecosystem’s credentials. Will demand come from external ecosystems outside of your governance, or solely from within your ecosystem?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, and governments are unlikely to issue credentials to non-government or OEM wallets in the near term, it’s crucial to consider user flows and associated risks. If you’re conducting proofs by accepting credentials from third-party wallets and want to extend a credential offer to participants in your ecosystem-approved wallets, ensure the user experience remains smooth and the risk vectors low. This is particularly important given the difficulty of conducting app-to-app binding for data exchanges on certain mobile phones.</p>
 Practical Examples and User Experience 
 Vancouver’s Digital Credentials Initiative 
<p>A practical example of this concept is the <a href="https://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/vancouver-leads-development-of-credentials-technology-may-2024.aspx">City of Vancouver’s initiative to modernize city services using digital credentials</a>. In collaboration with Technical Safety BC (TSBC), the Land Title and Survey Authority of BC (LTSA), and the Ministry of Citizens’ Services, Vancouver is issuing digital credentials to municipal residents to streamline processes such as permitting and licensing.</p>
 
 Ecosystem Goals: The City of Vancouver, and broader municipal primary function is to modernize city services by reducing manual verification steps in permitting and licensing processes. Their locus of governance is municipal services. 
 Bootstrapping: Vancouver’s initiative relies on foundational credentials issued by provincial partners such as the Ministry of Citizens’ Services (<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/online-identity/person-credential/">Person credential</a>, and BC Registries (<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/online-identity/digital-business-card/">Digital Business Card</a>). 
 Wallet: The city has decided that it makes sense for their ecosystem to rely on the provincial wallet as a utility for their ecosystem’s credentials. There’s limited value in them owning the wallet experience as there is a direct dependency between the municipality and the province. 
 Consuming External Inputs: Beyond consuming provincial credentials, the municipality integrates inputs from provincial partners such as Technical Safety BC (TSBC), the Land Title and Survey Authority of BC (LTSA) to enable more modernization of municipal services. 
 Providing Outputs Externally: Vancouver produces digital credentials that can be used by other government ecosystem organizations. 
 
<p>After answering these questions, it’s clear that technical interoperability isn’t a complicated discussion. The fact that the ecosystem is localized makes a difference as well. Therefore, a decision was made to align with the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-wallet">BC Wallet</a> (based on Aries Interop Profile 1.0).</p>
 Airlines and Seamless Travel Initiatives 
<p>There are many other efforts underway within the airlines to improve customer journeys through the use of digital credentials and other digital trust tools. Being an IATA Strategic Partner allows Northern Block to have purview over active industry efforts to modernize travel experiences.</p>
 
 Ecosystem Goals: Airlines aim to provide seamless travel experiences through identity management, offer management, payments and fulfillments.&nbsp; 
 Bootstrapping: Airlines may require foundational government personal identity credentials such prior to issuing their own credentials to customers. 
 Wallet: Airlines require direct interactions with their customers, therefore any wallet functionalities must be embedded within their existing channels. 
 Consuming External Inputs: Outside of government-issued credentials, airlines may need to consume credentials from other travel ecosystem participants such as airports for security clearances, loyalty providers for frequent flier benefits, and retailers for duty-free shopping privileges. 
 Providing Outputs Externally: Just like airlines will value the consumption of credentials from third parties, these same third parties will also value airline issued credentials within their business processes. 
 
<p>Airlines must remain in control of their products, money flows and data. This changes the outlook around technical interoperability profiles compared to the first example with the City of Vancouver.</p>
<p>To this end, airlines prefer to integrate wallet capabilities into their existing mobile apps. Their customers are already using these apps, and customer data is crucial for creating personalized travel experiences. Their interoperability story gets more complex considering the ecosystem needs and the global footprint of the industry. Ongoing work is happening to address industry technical interoperability challenges.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>In summary, while evaluating technical interoperability profiles for your ecosystem might seem like a daunting task, we hope this blog has provided valuable insights on how to approach this challenge. It may not be as complicated as you think, and you may not need to overanalyze the short-term implications. As the adoption of digital credentials grows, you can adapt to the evolving landscape. The key is to start by demonstrating value to your ecosystem and build from there.<br>

 We unpack our ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’ and reveal the different priorities of global and Latin American operators. 



<p>The gross gaming revenue (GGR) of the Latin American (LATAM) gambling market is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1326686/betting-market-gross-gaming-revenue-latin-america/">projected to exceed $3.4 billion</a> by the end of 2025. Considering the GGR in 2020 was just $1.3 billion, this is a huge leap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many reasons for LATAM’s projected rapid growth, including the opening of multiple lucrative markets and simply the sheer number of potential players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2024/02/12/colombia-2024-gambling-tax/">Colombia</a>, which has had relatively clear regulation since 2016, many Latin American countries are either in their infancy or gestation phases, meaning they have a valuable opportunity to learn from the mistakes and successes that established markets have already made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand the challenges facing gambling operators, new and old, we commissioned the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-top-compliance-challenges-2024/">‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’</a>, featuring insights and opinions from 104 global compliance professionals from the gambling industry. Respondents were a mixture of the old guard, including the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">UK</a>, Malta and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">Germany</a> to the new like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/peru-gambling-regulation/">Peru</a> and Chile. In this blog we explore the differences in responses between global players and LATAM operators and consider the reasons.</p>



 Top compliance concerns for LATAM operators. 



<p>In answer to the question, ‘How challenging for your business are the following compliance issues’, there did appear to be consensus on the most difficult issue, with 30% of LATAM operators and 22.73% of global respondents choosing the ‘Source of funds check’ option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most interesting, but perhaps unsurprising compliance challenges for LATAM (considering its ever-changing regulatory landscape) was ‘Staying up to date with regulatory changes’, with more than one in five (22.2%) saying it was the most difficult challenge, compared to just 6% of global respondents.</p>



<p>[Read more about the regulatory status of some of the biggest LATAM markets later in the blog.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other stark difference in responses was the 22.2% of LATAM respondents that cited ‘Licensing and permissions’ as the most difficult compliance challenge, compared to just 7.58% of global respondents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With the LATAM gambling market so early in its journey toward regulation, it’s understandable that almost half of LATAM respondents list regulatory concerns and licensing and permission as their most difficult compliance challenges. From rates of taxation and anti-money laundering policies to licensing requirements and responsible gambling measures, each country is approaching issues slightly differently.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>As many LATAM countries are at a similar stage, there is also a very real game of ‘let’s wait to see what our neighbors are doing’ being played out. A game of chicken, if you will, of who’ll move first and what path will they take.</p>Ronaldo Kos, Head of LATAM Gaming at IDnow.</blockquote>



 The global impact of fraud. 



<p>When asked which types of fraud they had been subjected to in the last 12 months, there were negligible differences between responses, with bonus abuse (Global: 65.57% LATAM: 70%) and document fraud (Global: 57.38% LATAM: 50%) the two most common fraud attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, operators based in LATAM said that they had not been subjected to any money laundering in the last 12 months, whereas almost one in five global operators (19.67%) said they had. Whether this is indicative of fewer Latin American money launderers or less robust AML controls in LATAM gambling platforms is up for debate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the next 12 months, respondents cited both <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">‘Bonus abuse’</a> (Global: 54.10%, LATAM: 80%) and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">‘Social engineering’</a> (Global: 54.10%, LATAM: 60%) as the top areas for concern.</p>



 AI and the different approaches in fighting fraud and optimizing onboarding. 



<p>As gambling operators scale and look for ways to expand their business, especially during periods of increased activity, many have implemented AI-based tools to help in their fight against fraud, but perhaps not as many as you think.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, despite AI’s ability to increase automation, reduce costs and act as an effective fraud prevention tool, just over a third of global respondents (36%), and under a third of LATAM respondents (30%) said they were currently using AI to fight fraud. Interestingly, however, LATAM operators appear to be more forward-thinking regarding the implementation of AI-based tools in the next 12 months, with 50% saying they have plans to implement vs just 37.70% of global respondents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The extensive consultation periods on Brazil’s gambling regulations, and on the technical, payment and security requirements operators must follow (including geolocation requirements) clearly shows that LATAM operators are taking the threat of fraud very seriously.</p>



<p>Operators be warned: if you’re not taking advantage of the benefits of AI-based tools to enhance your identity verification efforts, or bolster your fraud-prevention arsenal, then know that fraudsters are probably using them to attack you.</p>



<p>“While in the past, cybercriminals needed a certain base level of technical skills to produce fake documents or websites, AI-augmented fraudsters can utilize generative AI to create authentic-looking documents, videos, images and audio,” said Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow.</p>



<p>Of course, the other major use case for implementing AI tools is to aid with huge volumes of new customers.</p>



 







<p>“Onboarding is the most crucial stage of the customer journey, so it should be as seamless as possible. While the above data speaks to the myriads of different components that operators deem as ‘very important,’ it also reveals some interesting difference between the priorities of global and LATAM operators. </p>



<p>“For example, almost 7 out of 10 global respondents agreed that ‘Security and data privacy’ was very important, but only 37.5% of LATAM respondents agreed. A similar disparity was also seen for ‘Cost’, with almost double the number of global respondents (25.49%) citing it as a very important factor compared to LATAM respondents (12.5%),” said&nbsp;Ronaldo.</p>



<p>Clearly, LATAM operators are prepared to make the necessary financial investment and although concerned about security and data privacy, remain less so than their global counterparts, suggesting they are eager to enter the market and participate by any means necessary.</p>



 Get onboard. Pick-ups and drop-offs. 



<p>While global operators believed there were a variety of reasons that customers abandoned onboarding, including Registration; Document Verification; Selfie Checks and Document Submission, the only area that appears to be a cause for concern for LATAM operators is ‘Document submission.’ In the ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey,’ we separated Document submission into two categories: a) including personal information; bank statements; utility bills (Global: 50.98% LATAM: 62.5%) and ‘b: ID documents (Global: 13.73% LATAM: 37.5%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two most common other factors that deter players from completing onboarding were an ‘Extensive KYC process’ (Global: 60.78% LATAM: 100%) and a ‘Complex and lengthy registration’ (Global: 54.90% LATAM: 75%).</p>



 All onboard: All eyes on Brazil. 



<p>The grey areas in which many LATAM countries’ gambling communities exist has meant that onboarding processes have historically either been non-existent or light touch; perhaps requiring players to just submit a name and address. As KYC and identity verification is the cornerstone of any trustworthy customer-business relationship within a regulated market, this will change dramatically. In the highly anticipated market of Brazil, for example, onboarding will become more complex than it’s ever been. Practically overnight (likely one night at the end of 2024), operators will be required to perform a three-step identification process, each of which carries a unique challenge.</p>



  Due to each Brazilian region having its own form of identity document, operators will need the capability to process a wide range of different documents<br>  Another requirement for operators is the ability to verify citizens’ Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas (Natural Persons Register) number<br>  Biometric verification will also be mandated, with weekly facial reverifications to become a requirement  



<p>“Although such measures have long been in place for financial services, for many Brazilian gambling operators and players, these onboarding requirements will be completely new, so it’s important that operators are able to comply with regulations while still offering an attractive-enough user experience to ensure players migrate over from the grey market to the regulated market,” said Rayissa Armata, Director of Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>



 5 LATAM countries to place your bets on in 2025. 



 Brazil&nbsp; 



<p>Perhaps the LATAM market with the most potential, Brazil&nbsp;will roll out the particulars of its new gaming policies in a series of ordinances released in four phases throughout the coming months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first phase (featuring the technical, payment and security requirements operators must follow) wrapped at the end of the April. The remaining three stages will be held throughout May, June and July:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stage two:&nbsp; AML/KYC and bettors’ rights;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stage three: Technical and security standards and advertising;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stage four: Industry contributions to social responsibility clauses;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, the Ministry of Finance will implement the approved sports betting by the end of July 2024, and operators will have six months to become compliant in order to participate in LATAM’s largest gambling market. Perhaps most eagerly anticipated, Brazil issued an ordinance on May 22 that allows operators to apply for licenses to offer sports betting and online gaming.</p>



 Peru&nbsp; 



<p>Peru has a long-standing relationship with gambling and is one of a few South American countries to have allowed local and international companies to operate online casinos and betting sites. In October 2023, Peru decided to introduce new gambling rules and licenses for local and international operators. Testament to the size of the market is the fact that Peru’s Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/licensing/peru-receives-145-licence-applications/">received 145 requests for operator licences</a> within the first 30 days. Read more about the gambling market in Peru in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/peru-gambling-regulation/">‘Open for business: Understanding gambling regulation in Peru.’</a></p>



 Argentina&nbsp; 



<p>The LATAM country with perhaps the most confusing regulatory environment (and that’s saying something) is without doubt Argentina. The main cause of the confusion is the fact that Argentina does not have one national regulatory body, and instead cedes control to each of its 24 autonomous jurisdictions. As two thirds of jurisdictions have legalized gambling, it makes for <a href="https://www.vixio.com/insights/gc-argentina-enacts-decree-raising-taxes-online-gambling">16 different regulatory regimes</a> throughout the country. Although differences between regimes are negligible, operators need to ensure they comply with each and every requirement to serve different region’s customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that Germany used to have a similar arrangement, with 16 different states offering unharmonized gaming requirements. Now that Germany has a central Gaming Authority operating under one gaming regime, the expectations are high that operators and gamers are moving away from the black market. Of course, it may take time to reap the benefits of a harmonized regime but considering stricter global requirements on Anti-Money Laundering and the roll out of digital identities, new regulations and digital services are here to stay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Read more about Germany’s challenge with the black market in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">‘Exploring black market gambling in Germany’.</a>]</p>



 Chile 



<p>In Chile, it’s not a question of ‘Will they?’ but more a case of ‘When will they?’ finally pass gambling regulation. Like many LATAM countries, until that happens, offshore operators have stepped into the void, circumnavigating domestic regulatory restrictions to offer gambling services to Chilean players. This will all be set to change when the Senate finally gives the green light to regulations. As said, when that will be is anyone’s guess (it was supposed to be finalized by 2023), but it is likely to be later this year or early 2025. For now, and for Chile’s Senate and National Congress, it’s back to the drawing board to find a resolution, in particular, regarding the <a href="https://casinobeats.com/2024/03/08/developments-continue-for-online-gambling-framework-in-chile/">legal status of operators currently offering services</a>.</p>



 Colombia&nbsp; 



<p>In Colombia, the <a href="https://practiceguides.chambers.com/practice-guides/gaming-law-2023/colombia">GGR generated from online gambling exceeded $56 million in 2022</a>. The industry is regulated as part of the Columbian Gambling Act 2002, which organizes the administration and control of the industry at both national and regional level. In this regard, the gaming industry in Colombia is considered a monopoly.</p>

Of course, to enable reliable predictions, our dev team constantly works on improving the toolset. Crafting reliable and fast access to large amounts of data is not an easy task, and often we encounter puzzles like the one I’m about to show&nbsp;you.</p> In the name of&nbsp;speed <p>Recently, our team has started leveraging <a href="http://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a>, an SQL database management system for fast in-memory data access. Coupled with <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a>, a lightning fast DataFrame implementation, this gives predictoors a competitive edge. But what about tradeoffs? Speed matters, but not if it requires sacrifices to data integrity and precision. Which is why we run regular integrity checks and CI&nbsp;pipes.</p><p>One rainy day, an interesting issue popped up in one of our builds. It was definitely… mysterious. No one could reproduce it locally. But we relentlessly hunted it, cornered it and squashed it, albeit sometimes questioning our own&nbsp;sanity.</p><p>And while no bard will sing about the time booleans turned random and the valiant developers SSH-ed into Github Actions… well, it’s still a story of&nbsp;triumph.</p> A cute, harmless DataFrame <p>I will not use real Predictoor data to demonstrate, since those structures are still being developed. Instead, I will use this regular, vanilla, completely harmless data frame that shows people and&nbsp;apples:</p><p>The schema is inferred automatically from the data itself, so Polars knows that names are strings and ages and update timestamps are ints. It also shows our booleans just as they should be. The Arrow representation is uniform and nothing seems out of the ordinary.</p> To filter or not to&nbsp;filter? <p>Given our vanilla example above, a simple filter can and will change this idyllic situation. Let’s filter our DataFrame by age. And… you know what? I think everyone from Alice to Fiona deserves to stay with us. Everyone’s age is under 100, so filtering should produce an identical DataFrame. Right?</p><p>First, it seems so. Our filtered DataFrame looks identical to our unfiltered one. All its values are the same. But what if we look even&nbsp;closer?</p><p>Well, first, the arrow representation of the data frame is a bit off. You can see some weird grouping for each column, but it shouldn’t be of much concern. But then, we try to see what DuckDB sees, and suddenly most of our false values become true.&nbsp;Ayyyyyy…</p> How does FALSE become&nbsp;TRUE? <p>We must be dreaming. Let’s look at the data again, just to make&nbsp;sure:</p><p>Our Dataframes look the same, each value is equal to its counterpart, but DuckDB seems to think something else. That is because DuckDB uses the arrow representation of the DataFrame, which has splintered our contingous DataFrame into four different chunks. Polars represents its data in memory by contiguous allocation, but when we filtered the data, this left some… scars. Those scars are invisible to the naked eye, but indeed, calling n_chunks() on the filtered dataset gives us four different chunks. Same data, but organised differently under the&nbsp;hood.</p> What is happening under the&nbsp;hood? <p>So, what happens when DuckDB gets a hold of those chunks? The chunks represented by [false] are evaluated as boolean true, i.e. lists containing at least an element. Our “invisible scars” suddenly turn into a critical issue! Boolean values become unreliable, and we could end up saving the wrong value to persistent storage, via&nbsp;DuckDB.</p><p>Much of this is happening “under the hood”, so it’s difficult to figure out. But, luckily, the fix is very easy. After filtering, we simply run a rechunk() to make sure the memory is reallocated and everything is uniformly in&nbsp;place:</p> “Never tell me the&nbsp;odds” <p>Please note that this only happens on some architectures, only if large values are used as part of some columns (like the int64 here), only if chunks happen to contain single [false] values that unexpectedly evaluate to true. Filtering doesn’t always result in chunking, but keep in mind that lazy functions such as chunked reading from a file or vstack-ing DataFrames do have this chunking effect, which is almost invisible.</p><p>Yes, this perfect storm of corner cases is improbable. Alas, in programming, odds are irrelevant. If it can happen, it will happen. Murphy strikes&nbsp;again.</p> Conclusion <p>The moral of the story is to of course always inspect data for integrity, expect the unexpected when it comes to representations by 3rd parties and… keep a level head. Booleans do not go rogue overnight. It’s just a matter of finding out who told them to&nbsp;“rebel”.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>There's a post that hasn’t left your mind since you read it, and now you want to send it to a friend… but you can't find it anymore. We’ve been there before too. Let’s dive into all the tips and tricks for advanced Bluesky search!</p>
<p>Over time, we’ll make these features easier to use directly within the Bluesky app. Think of these as advanced features!</p>
 Find a specific phrase 
<p>Use quotes around keywords, like <code>"hello world"</code>.</p>
 
 Results include posts that use the phrase in its alt text on images as well. 
 
 Find posts with a specific hashtag 
<p>Any term that has the <code>#</code> prefix will show you posts with that tag. For example, if you searched for <code>#hello</code>, you’d see all posts that contain that hashtag.</p>
 Find posts that mention a specific user 
<p>Search for a handle like <code>@jay.bsky.team</code> to see posts that mention that user (in this example, Jay). If the user has changed handles, you may still get posts that mention their previous username too.</p>
 
 <code>to:jay.bsky.team</code> or <code>mentions:jay.bsky.team</code> also show posts that mention the user. 
 <code>mentions:me</code> will show you posts that mention your username, if you’re logged in. 
 If you use quotes around the username, like <code>"@jay.bsky.team"</code>, you will see results that include the text <code>@jay.bsky.team</code>, whether or not it actually tags Jay’s account. 
 
 Find posts from a specific user 
<p>Use <code>from:jay.bsky.team</code> to see posts from that user (in this example, Jay). If you’re logged in, you can use <code>from:me</code> to show your own posts.</p>
 
 You can use a combination of these keywords. For example, <code>to:jay.bsky.team from:me </code>shows my own posts that mention Jay. 
 
 Find posts that mention or are from you 
<p>If you are logged in, you can use the <code>me</code> keyword or search for your own username.</p>
 
 <code>from:me</code> shows your own posts 
 <code>mentions:me</code> shows posts that mention your username 
 
 Find a specific URL 
<p>Paste in a URL to see posts that have also shared that URL.</p>
 
 To see all posts with links from a specific domain, use <code>domain:example.com</code>. For example, searching for <code>domain:npr.org</code> shows you all posts that have linked an NPR article. 
 
 Find posts in a specific language 
<p>Use the keyword <code>lang</code> to search for posts in a specific language.</p>
 
 Use the two-character ISO language code. Wikipedia has a handy chart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes">here</a> — use the codes under the column “Set 1.” 
 For example, to see posts in English that have the keyword <code>"science"</code>, use the search term <code>lang:en "science"</code>. To see posts in Japanese that have the keyword <code>"science"</code>, use <code>lang:ja "science"</code>. 
 
 Find posts within a specific date range 
<p>Specify your date range with <code>since:</code> and/or <code>until:</code>. You can use full dates (YYYY-MM-DD format), or full UTC timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).</p>
 
 This currently does not work for local datetime/date or other time formats. Please use the UTC date. Here is a <a href="https://www.utctime.net/utc-time-zone-converter">timezone converter.</a> 
 
 Searching while logged in 
<p>We can customize your search results for you more when you are logged in, though users that are logged out are also able to search Bluesky.</p>
 
 You can use the <code>me</code> keyword when searching for your own posts or posts that mention you. 
 People that you follow are prioritized in search results when you search for accounts. 
 
 Developer API 
<p>Bluesky’s search API allows HTTP query params for most of these facets and filters. Read more in the developer documentation <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-actor-search-actors">here</a>.</p>

 Why Real Gold Bars Tokenized Through Mattereum are a Step Change for the Blockchain <p>Mattereum has always talked about the importance of tokenized gold, we even ran a small number of gold bars through the system as proof of concept years back — it worked, we tokenized gold with a <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport</a> (MAP), listed it on OpenSea, sold it to buyers, who then used their NFT and MAP to go claim the gold bars from the vault. It was a bit rough, but it all worked, and this was <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/05/26/lohko-and-mattereum-launch-groundbreaking-verifiable-gold-bullion-nfts/">in 2021</a> — back when everyone else was still mostly talking about RWAs being some sort of vision for the future. You may ask “what is so amazing and revolutionary about this?” because other people already offer “tokenized gold”, but this is not the same — tokenized gold products such as <a href="https://paxos.com/paxgold/">Paxos</a> and <a href="https://gold.tether.to/">Tether Gold</a> are not tokenized gold per se, they are gold backed tokens, i.e. they are tokens whose value is guaranteed by gold owned by the issuers. This is an important difference. Mattereum works with partners to tokenize and fractionalize gold directly; that is, to create tokens that can be traded on the blockchain that also give the token holder actual legal ownership of the underlying physical gold itself. This is literally, ownership of a numbered, specific gold bar in a named vault that is owned by whoever owns the token, and they can, if they so wish, burn the token and take the physical gold home from the vault and hold it in their hands. The gold is owned by the token holder and not the token&nbsp;issuer.</p><blockquote>Mattereum works with partners to tokenize and fractionalize gold&nbsp;directly</blockquote>Tokenized Gold until now — a gold token connected by opaque legals to bars owned by the issuer in a vault somewhere<p>So, we did proof of concept. Now we have partnered with <a href="https://mattereum.com/2024/04/30/tokenized-gold/">Sempsa JP,</a> a Madrid-based globally recognized producer and distributor of precious metals, with decades of experience in the precious metals industry and renowned for its commitment to quality, integrity, and innovation. This partnership enables us to work with Sempsa JP to tokenize gold through our German regulated exchange partner <a href="https://mattereum.com/2023/07/23/announcing-swarm-x-mattereum-partnership/">Swarm</a> in quantity, giving investors immutable proof of ownership and provenance so that every token has a traceable, legally enforceable, connection to a specific gold bar in a named vault. This will offer unparalleled security, transparency, and accessibility worldwide under the protection of international law in over<a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/english"> 170 jurisdictions</a>.</p><blockquote>Every token has a traceable, legally enforceable, connection to a specific gold bar in a named&nbsp;vault</blockquote>Gold Tokenized through Mattereum &amp; Sempsa JP— A gold token giving its holder direct ownership of gold in a known&nbsp;vault<p>So why is this important? I think it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan">JP Morgan</a>, or one of those guys, a century or so back, who said “Gold is money! Silver is money! Everything else is credit!” That’s the absolutely hardline position. That is because gold is a hedge against risk in some global sense. In the same way that Bitcoin is a hedge against risk in some global sense, but there are slightly different hypotheses for gold and Bitcoin about what happens if the existing fiat regime crumbles. The difference between the two is that Bitcoin is appreciating value very, very quickly and is extremely volatile. It is also subject to regulatory attack. Gold is accumulating value relatively slowly, but it is doing so steadily and is dramatically less volatile; it is also dramatically less subject to attack. The bottom line is that gold is extremely likely to hold value globally, even in a regime where the US dollar is in trouble. You don’t want to be 100% in Bitcoin as it may not, ultimately, hold its value, and because Bitcoin may also get into trouble with regulators. Gold on chain, though, gives you a lot of the same advantages that Bitcoin does, but with dramatically lower volatility. And there is a pretty good chance that even in your nightmare scenarios your legal claim on the gold, if it was done properly, through Mattereum, will&nbsp;survive.</p><blockquote>“Gold is money! Silver is money! Everything else is&nbsp;credit!”</blockquote><p>Now we get to the Mattereum role in this. It begins and ends with the ultra transparent documentation value provided by the Mattereum Asset Passport. There are a bunch of things that can be wrong with a gold bar. The most common problem with a gold bar is that you don’t actually own it. You have a piece of paper that says somebody owes you a gold bar, you go and ask him for the gold bar, it turns out that they do not own the gold bar, and there’s an entire industry around all of those issues. It’s not uncommon for people to sell your gold bar or lend the gold bar out to somebody else for interest. Then, at the point where you ask them for your gold bar, they go and get another gold bar from a third vendor, because the gold bar that you gave them is out for loan and if you need a bunch of gold in a hurry, they borrow it from somebody else. There are very complicated arrangements behind the scenes that give you the impression that everybody has all the gold that you want all the time but in actual fact, it can be a shuffle. It’s widely perceived in the gold industry that if everybody pulls the gold out at the same time you’d get a phenomenal wave of bankruptcy. Now, of course, nobody can prove that, because that would be illegal. A MAP nails the NFT to a specific, named, gold bar, so it makes all this jiggery pokery impossible. You unambiguously own that gold bar, not some notional one the gold dealer claims to have while switching it about behind your back for profit and which, when push comes to shove, there is a small, but reasonable, chance they might not be able to pony up when you ask them for&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>You unambiguously own that gold bar, not some notional&nbsp;one</blockquote><p>To make it even easier to put gold, or any other high value asset on chain, the Mattereum group, through its German subsidiary Mattereum GmbH has a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/permanent-summer-the-new-matr-token-and-why-the-rwa-bull-market-goes-on-forever-0d4fb0f7c3e9">discount token</a>, <a href="https://mattereum.de/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=marsmatr">MATR*</a>, on sale through the fully regulated German exchange Swarm. This gives anyone onboarding assets a discount of up to 50% on their onboarding fees, which is significant when you are talking about gold&nbsp;bars.</p><p>Mattereum also helps handle the the risks. The gold industry as it currently stands is very well equipped to deal with the major one, which is fake gold — gold bars that turn out to be tungsten bars coated with a thin layer of gold — tungsten has the same density as gold, so that happens. There are various other kinds of shenanigans too, where you’ve got gold in the vault, but somebody’s pulling bars out of the middle of the pile where it can’t easily be seen, those kinds of things. There’s just a whole bunch of gold fraud and a whole bunch of expertise in the industry dedicated to stopping it using lots of science or technology. The thing the gold industry is really not geared up for is gold bars, which are made of actual solid, real, gold, but not the gold you thought it was. This is the whole world of <a href="https://thesentry.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ConflictGoldResponsibleGold-TheSentry-Feb2021.pdf">conflict&nbsp;gold</a>.</p><p>The original, staggeringly bad, conflict gold problem was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_gold">Nazi gold</a>. We never fully dealt with that problem, and then it came back around with <a href="https://www.congoresearchgroup.org/en/2023/05/15/all-that-glitters-the-struggle-over-congolese-gold/">Congo</a> and maybe even <a href="https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Organized-Crime-and-Illegally-Mined-Gold-in-Latin-America.pdf">South America</a>. No one really has a good understanding of the conflict gold landscape and where it’s really coming from, or not, as the case may be. But we know it’s an issue. A few years ago English banks were doing audits of their gold holdings and they kept finding duplicate bars, so they would have a bar that was Valcambi 123456, 400 pounds, then a bit later, they’d turn up another bar, and that too was Valcambi 123456, 400 pounds, and the problem was that they couldn’t tell which one was the original gold bar and which was the conflict gold bar that had cloned its identity. Now, there’s a whole bunch of ever more sophisticated science and technology stuff constantly being developed to stop that happening, but what that means is that there’s an arms race to get conflict gold sold as legit gold before the science catches up with it. That is a new fight for the gold industry and both sides are very sophisticated. <a href="https://www.gold.org/">The World Gold Council</a> is attempting to set up some global scheme for bar registers as part of this, but a bar registry also becomes a record of who owns what, and people are quite freaked out by that for obvious reasons. People still remember the US’s<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act#:~:text=A%20year%20earlier%2C%20in%201933,some%20jewelry%20and%20collector's%20coins."> 1933 confiscation</a> of privately held gold. Basically, nobody knows exactly what to do about conflict gold, but Mattereum can help deal with this too by having an asset passport that provides money-back warranties on the gold’s origin and history. If you buy a bar, you know it isn’t conflict gold, because it is backed by warranties that give you your money back if it is, and this is legally enforceable almost anywhere in the world. We’re now in a position where it is possible to make peace over conflict gold by aligning global systems using English common law through MAPs and the blockchain. Gold can be put on chain at source, with a MAP documenting its origin and updated every step of the way, giving purchasers a scrupulous and unambiguous provenance that makes it impossible to slip dodgy conflict bars into the supply chain&nbsp;unseen.</p><blockquote>Mattereum makes it impossible to slip dodgy conflict bars into the supply chain&nbsp;unseen</blockquote><p>This gold story is complex, and there are lots of aspects to it that are relevant to Mattereum’s tokenized gold partnership. The next aspect is the business of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp">yield generating assets</a> — there are a bunch of games which are played on yield. Let’s narrow it down to variable yield assets. I own a property, it generates rent. The rent varies over time and the value of the property varies over time, but we’ll just deal with the rent. The rent is a yield and that yield varies over time. We can then do a bunch of weird things with that yield so I can make you a bet that the yield will be over 1200 dollars, and if it is over 1200 dollars, you give me money. That’s a bizarre kind of thing, but the world is filled with bizarre kinds of things that people do with yield — tranching your mortgage, collateralized debt obligations, all those kinds of things. As soon as you have a variable yield asset like rent, or mortgages, people start finding ways of betting on it. So the typical way of doing this is the repayment rate on a mortgage. I basically have 100 mortgages. I tell you that on average 98% of those mortgages pay back. I then say I would like to sell you 20 years of these mortgages paying back at 98% for 95% of that amount. You say I get 3% free money. Realistically, I might take 80% and you get the equivalent of 3% a year for that time period because you bought it low and then they paid back over time and you go “great, I made money!”. If the yield is thought to be more variable than that, I might take a<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tranches.asp"> tranche</a>. The basis of that is taking the most certain payments and the least certain payments, and selling them to different people at different prices, and those are what’s called tranches, e.g. for one buyer you say, “They’re meant to pay me a million dollars a month in total. I am going to sell you the first 600k that comes in”, in theory that should be completely secure for the rest of time. So for the next buyer you say “I’m gonna sell you everything that comes in between $950,000 and $1 million”. That might not come in all the time, but it’s probably going to be there most of the time. What I’m doing is I’m pulling the payments forward and invariably discounting the payments depending on how probable they are. Make sense? This stuff is basically just various forms of sophisticated invoice factoring when all is said and done. It’s invoice factoring, but they call it high finance. A lot of hedge funds and pension funds will try and have a mixed balanced portfolio of these kinds of things and they’ll use sophisticated maths to try and make sure it all balances out over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The entire world runs on these bets <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresmarket.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20a%20Futures%20Market,at%20a%20price%20set%20today.">— futures markets</a>. But in the long run, what we know is that most people are optimistic about their guesses about the future, because of persistent psychological biases; everybody wears rose-tinted glasses, particularly when they’re selling. As a result, what happens is that bad bets accumulate in the system at an enormous scale for a variety of factors, but mainly it’s down to optimism about the future, a tendency to ignore bad data, expectation of government bailout and and things along these lines. This causes this entire world of variable return stuff to gradually be assumed to be more and more shaky. The further out you go, the more risk piles up into the system, and more or less the entire global financial system is built out with this. It doesn’t have to be, though. If you want a relatively steady state economy, you start looking at things like tranching corn. Here is a field. It grows about 100 kilos a year. I would like you to pay me now for 80 kilos of that and the remaining 20 kilos you could have for half, right? You get where you can start making bets about things which are more sure. Then you get down to things which have no variability at&nbsp;all.</p><blockquote>The further out you go, the more risk piles up into the&nbsp;system</blockquote><p>When we ran society with no credit and no optimism bias and no betting about the future, we were in a steady state for centuries. When we injected optimism about the future and bets, what we got was crazy amounts of risk taking and speculation which turned out overall to be staggeringly performative in terms of generating innovation, which generated wealth, but in the process, we also generated a system of massively pathological incentives, because if you’re only dealing with a 20 year variable rate, the thing only has the last 20 years. So the suggestion is that basically, because we kind of packaged all that risk in particular ways, we created a situation where the underlying stuff of the world began to be depreciated in the same way that the financial instruments deriving the stuff tended to be trashed. The construction of the system basically faded the future out in a variety of ways. As a result, what we’ve been doing is consuming the underlying yield-generating resources as a way of generating artificial fake yield. In theory, you’re meant to be selling the harvest from the land. In practice, you push the land so hard that you’re effectively burning the capital of the land to generate the harvest. It’s almost like a Ponzi scheme on farmland. If we deplete the farmland every year to keep the same consistent yield, and then one day that stops, any financial instruments that are based on this yield continuing are suddenly worth nothing. What we’re doing is basically exporting risk into the future by destroying the present invisibly by&nbsp;degrees.</p><p>That’s been quite a detour, but let’s get back to the case for digital gold. The world needs to be more like the world was like before 1971, which is when we came off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard">gold standard</a>, so money stopped being gold and the basis for its value became free floating. The world before 1971 did much heavier innovation at a much larger scale. We were staggeringly wealthy and the whole thing was really running great, apart from the fact that we had an infinite demand for oil and we didn’t have an infinite amount of gold to pay for it. But if we had to pay for the oil in gold, there’s a pretty good chance we’d be using a whole hell of a lot less of it and we’d be much more careful about how we&nbsp;lived.</p><p>The case for digital gold is the case against credit. It’s the case against tranches. It’s the case against complicated index portfolios and all the rest of that stuff. It’s the case against risk. We have gold, a 5000- to 8000-year-old asset that has had relatively consistent value for the entire time period, and we’re going to use that as our yardstick of value, rather than this portfolio of&nbsp;.com stocks, and rather than Bitcoin, which is a very untested bet, and is not even intended to be stable, it’s intended to be massively deflationary. Then we come to gold on the blockchain, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold">e-gold</a>, which I was paid in in the 1990s, <a href="https://www.royalmint.com/digital-investments/digigold/?utm_term=digital%20gold&amp;utm_campaign=PRM+-+LT+%26+DigiGold&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=7880654689&amp;hsa_cam=19902811424&amp;hsa_grp=150568997034&amp;hsa_ad=694956823871&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-297814713027&amp;hsa_kw=digital%20gold&amp;hsa_mt=p&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjLGyBhCYARIsAPqTz19BxjXx6xJQUlAysOX0IedRyZ8zlGXrgE-fE4knfGbKIBvfLaFcfvQaApYeEALw_wcB">Digi gold</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_contract">Ian Grigg</a> stuff, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/06/e-gold/">Doug Jackson </a>stuff. The way that cryptocurrency started was with gold, but this was derailed by both external and internal actions. Firstly, the US government absolutely hates crypto, it likes to have control over currency and information and crypto threatens both. With cryptography itself, in the ’90s, the US decided that uncrackable strong cryptographic applications like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)</a> were munitions and put them under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations">ITAR</a>, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, a regulatory regime to restrict and control the export of defence and military technologies. This led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk">cypherpunks</a> getting tattoos of PGP code, and suggested that the US really hadn’t got the hang of this internet thing back then, despite their military academic complex having invented it. This did not work, unsurprisingly, and strong crypto went on to underpin Web 2.0 and modern online payment systems. The US government sat hard on e-gold too, on the basis that it was a conduit for money laundering and criminal enterprise. They also saw huge potential for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi schemes</a> in crypto, and the US government absolutely loathes Ponzi’s since such things were at the root of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929">1929 bank crash</a>. So, early attempts at de-dollarizing through crypto were stifled at birth. Mattereum’s system breathes new life into the concept, though, as it is built on transparency and legal compliance, so cannot be used in the way the US fears. Secondly, internal resistance came from blockchain purists, who felt the link to gold tied crypto too heavily to the physical world that it was intended to transcend, although, I note, they seemed less resistant to linking it to the dollar. The paranoid among you might see some kind of hidden hand at work there…. But in the end, gold is a global system not controlled by any single government, which is exactly what crypto aspires to be, so logic suggests they are natural partners. Mattereum’s creation of a global marketplace of 170 countries in which tokenized gold can be freely traded enables this, by binding the NFT to the physical gold and backing it with legally enforceable money-back guarantees.</p><blockquote>The case for digital gold is the case against&nbsp;risk</blockquote><p>For the notion of a digital economy, gold is an exemplar. Gold is old and stable. For digital economics we need to use old global stable assets as yardsticks and value. Gold is the first, but then there’s agricultural land — this is why Matterum is interested in gold and real estate. These are things which have been valuable in consistent ways for the whole of human history, and nothing says that we can’t use those things for payments. Nothing says we can’t use those things for wealth storage. It has been very difficult to do because of stuff in the fear ecosystem that’s existed since ’71. The transactional costs have always made it very difficult to do that stuff as well. But the fundamental truth of the situation is that most of the world’s genuinely wealthy people keep most of their assets in things which are pretty durable and the exception is the new money.com stuff. If you look at the old money, the old money’s more or less all buildings, and occasionally trade. So the argument is basically this. It is possible, using crypto, to massively cut the transactional costs and open up the old money ecosystem to young money, and to open up the big money ecosystem to small money. This is what Mattereum is&nbsp;doing.</p><blockquote>Mattereum opens up the old money ecosystem to young money and the big money ecosystem to small&nbsp;money</blockquote><p>Gold is the beginning of that process and then you do land, then you do real estate, potentially art, this is the democratization of the real wealth machinery. Then what goes with all these asset classes, the fundamental question is, “is it there?” And the answer to all doubts about “is it there?” is massively ramified insurance. Again, the old money assets are heavily insured, and heavily physically protected. That’s what the vaulting system is like. And by the way, there’s $20 trillion in vaults or whatever the number is. This is how the big guys do it and, yes, you could do it that way. We do not expect the existing system to survive without radical transformation, partly because of the overuse of credit in the American economy, or at least the global economy. And secondly, there is a huge push, I mean, just a huge push to try and figure out some kind of ecological economics framework which will work more globally and that’s the fundamental bedrock.</p><p>So you have gold, you’re doing transactions in gold, you have all the same fundamental financial needs that anybody has in the money economy. So if you need to borrow, if you’re making payments in gold and you don’t have enough gold, so somebody lends you gold, by all means do that, but it has to be understood by all parties that the gold is not yield generating. It’s not that you can make a bunch of investments, borrow money, hope investments going up will be enough to pay the interest and then come back to it. It’s just not that kind of thing, because the gold itself is not yield generating. While there will always be people to play games at the edge of that stuff and make bets on the gap between the say, fiat performance, gold performance, Bitcoin performance, all those games are there, but that is just dragging a hard asset back into the insanity.</p><p>By tokenizing gold, we are making it possible to do transactions in actual, real, gold in the modern system, digitally, on the blockchain, backed by warranties and insurance, which no one else can do. It has all the advantages of a slick modern system along with those of having someone turn up in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugger_family">Fugger</a> counting house and make their payment by tipping out a bunch of gold coins on a table that then go in a vault. Solid and tangible, but liquid and tradable; unambiguous ownership, consistent, long term value, and it isn’t going to destroy the world in a riot of over-optimistic speculation and evaporated value:</p><p>Tokenized gold on chain with a Mattereum Asset Passport.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.de/get-tokens?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">Find out more about Mattereum GmbH’s token&nbsp;sale*.</a></p><p>*The Mattereum Discount Token (MATR) is available for purchase through Mattereum GmbH’s fully regulated German crypto exchange partner, Swarm.

 Digital Identification in Africa — notes from ID4Africa credit: ID4Africa<p>Digital identification is one of the central elements of digital transformation, and governments, civil society and development actors are paying increasing attention to it. At the industry’s leading conference for digital identity in Cape Town, South Africa, <a href="https://id4africa.com/">ID4Africa</a> on May 21st-24th, over 2,000 exhibitors, governments, and civil society representatives gathered to discuss how digital identification could empower and enable choice. <a href="https://id4africa.com/the-general-secretariat/">Joseph Atick</a>, the visionary behind ID4Africa, has established the convening as the continent’s premier forum for thinking about digital identification and development.</p><p>It was a privilege to attend the forum, supporting UNDP’s efforts around <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benjamin-bertelsen_governance-digitalpublicinfrastructure-activity-7201125020855603200-qdo-?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Model Governance Frameworks</a> and <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/announcements/unhcr-welcomes-commitments-id4africa-2024-digital-identity-gains-displaced">UNHCR’s efforts to ensure refugee inclusion</a>, and to explore the implications of <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/identity-and-migration/">digital identity and wallets for migrants</a>. I was left thinking about three key&nbsp;themes:</p><p>Digital ID as digital public infrastructure (DPI) — but what is DPI? The conference tagline was ‘digital ID as DPI’, and there was much discussion of the importance of digital ID not only an end in itself, but as an enabler. In practice, this means that efforts prioritising ‘public interest’ and ‘public value’ are increasingly prominent. These include efforts such as <a href="https://mosip.io/#1">MOSIP</a>, a non-profit open source ID solution that establishes an interoperable ecosystem, with increasing numbers of vendors advertising their ‘MOSIP Compliance’. Private vendors were also promoting interoperability through the <a href="https://osia.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">OSIA standard</a>, now an <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/osia-officially-adopted-as-itu-standard-for-interoperable-digital-identity-management">officially adopted by the ITU</a>. There were also normative efforts around public interest of digital digital identity, such as UNDP and the United Nations Office of the Secretary General’s Envoy on Technology (OSET) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/un-tech-envoy_safedpi-sdgs-digitalcooperation-activity-7199850430967820288-OBLp?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">convening on how to ensure that DPI is safe, inclusive and rights protecting</a>.</p><p>Yet, despite this growing attention, there’s still a lot of questions about what DPI actually means and what it looks like. As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hilda-barasa-3467355_id4africa2024-activity-7198933848447938560-_7Gm?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Hilda Barasa of the Tony Blair Institute noted</a> following the UNDP and OSET consultation, there’s a lack of clarity about what DPI means. Even with some established definitions, it’s still not clear to many in the international development community how to distinguish ‘vanilla’ digital transformation from a ‘DPI approach’, and how DPI relates to earlier lessons learned, strategies, and thinking about DPI. I think this is really critical if the current momentum is to be maintained and translated into impact. As a firm believer in evidence and specificity, at Caribou Digital going to invest in efforts to advance this&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>Digital ID innovation — is it the future of identity wallets? There was much conversation around wallets as the ‘next thing’ in digital ID innovation. Digital wallets are digital versions of the wallet you hold in your pocket or purse — a way to store digital documents so that people who need to rely on them as proof of an entitlement or status can trust them. There are many reasons for the growing interest in digital wallets — from promising to simplify the management of credentials to giving individuals greater control over their credentials and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest driver of interest in digital wallets comes from the EC’s adoption of a new digital identity regulation, eIDAS2.0, that specifies a digital wallet and mandates all member countries to provide one to citizens. This has prompted speculation about whether the EC’s new standard may define a new global standard for identification — a <a href="https://www.brusselseffect.com/">‘Brussels effect’</a> that pushes this particular approach to digital identification on&nbsp;others.</p><p>But digital wallets also introduce new challenges. In <a href="https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/mobile-economy/europe/">2022 only 81% of the EU population had a smartphone</a>, while across <a href="https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/mobile-economy/sub-saharan-africa/">Africa only 41% had access to any phone</a>. So questions of exclusion are increasingly important, not just in terms of access to technology, but also access to the legal credentials and status that underpin wallets. For example, it may have significant implications for marginalised and vulnerable populations, such as migrants and refugees. UNHCR, the UN agency responsible for refugees, has already developed a digital wallet, which we’re currently researching related to <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/identity-and-migration/">migrants’ identification needs in Kenya and&nbsp;Germany</a>.</p><p>Empowerment and choice — but for whom? Empowerment and choice was another important theme of the conference. At first this seemed to refer to empowerment and choice for individuals, as wallets are promised to enable. But throughout the conference it became clear that this theme is also about governments and their capacity to choose an approach to digital identification that meets their needs. As one senior figure put it, many countries feel that they have particular systems, approaches, and ways of thinking about digital identification imposed on them. In a conference panel of parliamentarians convened by UNDP there was resistance to this imposition, and a strong call for greater recognition of their role in the process of establishing digital identification — as representatives of their citizens, ‘we need to be involved’, and asked for more support to empower their capacity to choose their own approach to digital identification.</p><p>I think this was significant for two reasons. Firstly, recognising government and institutions as users of ID systems highlights questions of sovereignty — the right to choose and assert authority — and of responsibility and accountability. This year’s conference marked the first time civil society organisations participated; they shared stories of holding their governments to account through advocacy and the judiciary. This highlights the importance of national sovereignty and individual civic&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Second, digital identification is increasingly one of the fields in which geopolitics are played out. Technologies, standards, and governance models are manifestations of ideas, values, and interests. The competing definitions of DPI are one example, but so too is the close relation that many vendors of ID systems have or claim to have with states, like Thales from France, NEC from Japan, and Veridos from&nbsp;Germany.</p><p>So I think this is only the beginning of calls from African governments and civil society to strengthen their capacity to understand and choose digital systems and governance approaches that meet their needs. It will be incumbent on development partners to support them to make decisions and choices that reflect their&nbsp;needs.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identification-in-africa-insights-from-id4africa-dfd74b4ec86d">Digital Identification in Africa — insights from ID4Africa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Combating deepfakes and misinformation is commonly framed as an arms race, constantly one-upping each other for more realistic attacks and more sophisticated detection. But is this a game that really needs to be played? Rather than escalating competition, is it possible to disarm deepfakes? Decentralized identity is all about a chain of trust for transactions, building the foundation for proving identity and content authenticity. Is it possible that decentralized systems can fundamentally negate the risk that deepfakes pose?</p>
<p>Blockchain and decentralized identity leverage an immutable ledger to establish trust. Through cryptographic signatures and distributed consensus, they create transparent, verifiable records of identity and content provenance, fostering accountability and authenticity in the digital realm.</p>
<p>Such a system undermines the very concept of deepfakes and misinformation, which thrive on obfuscating origins and manipulating trust. By anchoring identities and content to transparent, verifiable records, deepfakes can potentially lose their potency.</p>
<p>Rather than perpetuating an arms race, decentralization is a method of restructuring trust in the digital world. Combating deepfakes through decentralized identity is a departure from reactive measures towards proactive resilience, where authenticity is upheld through collective validation rather than relentless competition.</p>
<p>The three panelists of this webinar are all speakers that you can hear in person at the European Identity and Cloud conference in Berlin, June 4. It is a star-studded cast, with Wayne Chang, CEO of SpruceID, Kim Hamilton Duffy, Executive Director of the Decentralized Identity Foundation, and Linda Jeng, Founder and CEO of Digital Self Labs. The panel will be moderated by Annie Bailey, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts.</p>

<p>Protecting ESXi hosts is crucial to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of virtualized environments, preventing data breaches, downtime, and regulatory non-compliance. With administrators frequently altering configurations within your virtualized environments, how do you maintain and/or enhance your security posture? These questions are becoming increasingly critical for all IT security professionals managing VMware products. With threats constantly evolving and new challenges emerging, it’s essential to stay vigilant and proactive in your security practices.</p>
<p>Recently, in a security advisory, <a href="https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2024-0006.html">Broadcom disclosed four critical vulnerabilities</a> that could allow attackers to bypass sandbox and hypervisor protections in all versions of VMware ESXi products, including those no longer supported. An attacker with privileged access – root or administrator – to the guest operating system within a virtual machine (VM) could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to the hypervisor. Given the critical role hypervisors play in enterprise environments, these vulnerabilities pose a serious risk.</p>
 Understanding the Environment 
<p>A physical host computer can operate multiple independent guest virtual machines, each isolated from one another and the host. Managed by a hypervisor like VMware ESXi, these VMs utilize the host’s physical resources.</p>
<p>The sandbox, a controlled and isolated environment within which VMs operate, is designed to limit the machines’ ability to interact with the host system or other VMs beyond specific, intended interactions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Scope of the Vulnerabilities 
<p>The vulnerabilities disclosed by Broadcom relate to flaws in USB controllers, which could allow attackers to compromise the sandbox and hypervisor protections across all versions of VMware ESXi and Cloud Foundation products. These vulnerabilities are particularly alarming because they compromise one of the core functions of VMware products: to securely isolate sensitive operations within VMs, away from the host machine.</p>
 Proactive Measures With Entrust CloudControl 
<p>Virtualization and cloud technologies have brought new capabilities to automation, time to market, and IT flexibility, but have also heightened the need for hypervisor security. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/cloudcontrol">Entrust CloudControl</a> plays a key role in capturing vital data for compliance, forensics, and troubleshooting, while identifying hypervisor configuration errors in VMware vSphere for ongoing compliance.</p>
<p>CloudControl offers a comprehensive range of capabilities, including the ability to automatically disable USB controllers on virtual machines across all ESXi hosts. This feature could be used to mitigate all vulnerabilities described in the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2024-0006.html">Security Advisory VMSA-2024-0006</a> by quickly removing USB controllers from all virtual machines as described in <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/96682">KB96682,</a> pending the patching of all ESXi machines.</p>
<p>A second line of defense involves ensuring that patches addressing the vulnerabilities have been properly applied to all ESXi hosts. This time-consuming operation can also be managed by CloudControl, which ensures that these vulnerabilities have been eliminated across the entire virtual infrastructure.</p>
<p>Once this verification has been carried out by CloudControl, it will then be possible to reactivate the USB controllers on all virtual machines.</p>
<p>In the ever-changing security landscape, every component of your IT infrastructure remains susceptible to potential threats. Staying informed about the latest security challenges is crucial. Implementing proactive security measures and continuously monitoring for vulnerabilities are key to ensuring that your VMware environments remain secure, resilient, and trustworthy. Automatic monitoring and remediation tools like Entrust CloudControl can greatly <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management">improve your overall security posture</a>.</p>

  <p>Zero Trust has become the industry standard for safeguarding your entire digital estate. Central to Zero Trust is securing identity and access, which is essential for protecting resources, enforcing security policies, and ensuring compliance in today’s dynamic digital landscape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Microsoft Entra, we help our customers create <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/08/how-implementing-a-trust-fabric-strengthens-identity-and-network/">a trust fabric that securely connects any trustworthy identity with anything, anywhere</a>. Driven by the adoption of multicloud strategies in the era of AI, customers are encountering more challenges in securing access, not just across multiple public and private clouds, but also for business apps and on-premises resources. Unlike securing access for humans or within a single environment, where customers have established methods to address challenges, securing access anywhere is more complicated due to the dynamic nature of today’s digital estate and tools to address emerging challenges need further development. To support our customers, we unveiled <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-announcements-and-demos-at-rsac-2024/ba-p/2520429">our vision for securing access in any cloud at this year’s RSA conference</a>. Today, we're excited to dive deeper into our future investment aimed at securing access to cloud resources from any identity across diverse cloud environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Managing multicloud complexity in a rapidly evolving digital environment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations are grappling with substantial challenges in navigating cloud access complexities, often citing issues like fragmented role-based access control (RBAC) systems, and compliance violations. These challenges are compounded by the growing use of cloud services from various cloud service providers.&nbsp; There have been links to several notable breaches attributed to over-permissioned identities. Our customer engagements reveal that organizations are currently using 7 to 8 products, including privileged access management (PAM) and identity governance and administration (IGA) solutions to tackle multicloud access challenges. Despite their efforts, such as toggling across multiple solutions and increasing their workforce, many organizations still struggle to achieve full visibility into their cloud access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://aka.ms/multicloudriskreport">Our 2024 State of Multicloud Security Risk Report</a> underscores these ongoing challenges arising from over-permissioned human and workload identities. Analysis of past year usage data from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management">Microsoft Entra Permissions Management</a> confirms that the complexities in multicloud environments primarily stem from rapid identity growth and over-provisioned permissions (<a href="https://aka.ms/multicloudinfographic">learn more</a>), including:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Over 51,000 permissions that can be granted to identities – 50% of which are identified as high-risk permissions. 
 Only 2% of those 51,000 permissions were used. 
 Of the 209M identities discovered, more than 50% are identified as super identities that have all permissions to access all resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Introducing our vision for cloud access management: Building a converged platform 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I’m excited to expand on our vision for cloud access management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As businesses expand, organizations inevitably face challenges of overprovisioning at various levels. Initially, this manifests as granting more access to accommodate growing teams and workloads and can lead to overlapping access privileges. To address these issues, organizations must proactively identify vulnerabilities in identities and permissions and respond swiftly and, eventually, automatically. There’s a pressing need for a new solution that empowers all identities to access resources in any cloud securely while adhering to least-privileged permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address this critical need, we’re developing a converged platform that encompasses a comprehensive set of capabilities. This upcoming platform is designed to streamline the journey from risk discovery to remediation for secure access to any cloud resource whenever deviations occur, offering:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Visibility: Gain insights into all identities and permissions assigned and used and detect risky permissions. 
 Risk remediation: Remediate risky permissions with recommendations. 
 Granular controls: Grant the right privileges for role-specific durations. 
 Automated governance: Implement continuous compliance through automated policies.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: How to secure access from any identity across multiple clouds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our journey to secure access to resources in any cloud is advancing by building upon our industry-leading Microsoft Entra products:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management">Permissions Management</a> (CIEM) for delivering visibility into identities, permissions, and usage. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id">Privileged Identity Management</a> (PAM) for enforcing least-privileged controls for both human and workload identities. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-governance">ID Governance</a> (IGA) for automating identity lifecycle and access workflows regardless of origin or usage. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-workload-id">Workload ID</a> (IAM for workloads) for offering customized authorization policies for workload identities.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Convergence of four critical areas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, as part of our continuous Copilot journey, we're leveraging AI/ML to enhance all the technologies within the cloud access management platform. This enables organizations to uncover risks that are otherwise challenging to detect manually, identify the most significant risks, propose impactful remediations, and recommend usage-based custom roles and policies for any identity as the platform adoption grows. It will help simplify cloud access management and provide more effective ways to secure cloud environments for organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Our commitment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Microsoft, we’re committed to bringing this vision to life for our customers through the advancement and innovation of our newly converged platform, designed to secure access to resources in any cloud. Additionally, this vision extends to securing access to resources anywhere, including on-premises and business apps. Our goal is to help our customers enhance their security for any access to any resource in the era of AI and robust workload identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to collaborating with the community to realize this vision, empowering every organization to implement least-privileged access and permissions across all identities in multicloud and hybrid environments. We’ll keep you posted on our progress towards this vision. Until our next update, we invite you to explore our products that form the foundation of our cloud access management vision.

  Name: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjen-van-veen-b77529109/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Arjen van Veen</a><br>Team: Credible<br>Based in: The Netherlands   About Arjen <p>Although my educational background is as a geophysicist, I became an IT consultant out of University. I was exposed to what was then still described as the “SSI” (Self-Sovereign Identity) space. I got hooked on the idea of helping to build a privacy-preserving digital experience and wanted to join a company solely focused on exactly that, which is when I found SpruceID.</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>I’m a software engineer at SpruceID, working, among others, on open standards implementations such as the OpenID family and the ISO 18013-x specifications. I’m excited that some of our Rust libraries are already open-source and open for anyone to use, even if you still need to be somewhat of an expert to get started.</p> What do you find most rewarding about your job? <p>I love working on a team with the smartest people I’ve ever met. Seeing our solutions in the real world comes in at a close second.</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Be collaborative and communicative within the team. This stuff is hard, and mistakes can have awful consequences. It’s best to build these solutions together.</p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>I will always strive to write better code. I’m still taking my first steps in the standards community and hope to become much faster at assessing protocols and identifying potential problems or missing features.</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>I’m going to go with our company retreat to Kyoto while the cherry blossoms were in full swing.</p> What's the best advice you’ve received since starting your job here? <p>“Don’t get stuck”</p><p>Meaning, it is easy to waste a lot of time researching something you don't understand properly when there might be somebody around who can give you a TLDR or move you forward immediately. So we don't want to pay the price of learning something over and over, especially in such a complicated space as ours.</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>If we securely get credentials into people’s hands and their day is improved by using them, that is what I count as a win!

 Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET Finalize Token Merger Details to Create Artificial Superintelligence Alliance <p>Artificial Intelligence Pioneers Combine to Create a Decentralized<br>Alternative to AI Projects Controlled by Big&nbsp;Tech</p><p>Fully Diluted Market Cap of $ASI token is USD$6 billion as of May 28,&nbsp;2024</p><p>Zug and Singapore — May 29, 2024. SingularityNET (SNET), the world’s first decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) network, Fetch.ai, a Web3 platform for the new AI economy, and Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange platform to protect data, today announced the June 13 finalization of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) merger. The newly combined $ASI token represents the largest open-sourced, decentralized network focused on the AI industry.</p><p>As of June 11, 2024, $FET will be renamed $ASI and on June 13 the merger completes. The $ASI token will function across the combined decentralized AI network, providing unprecedented scale and power. As of June 11, ERC20 tokens will be made available for users to swap $FET to $ASI tokens via a token migration contract, followed by $AGIX and $OCEAN on June 13. An audited, secure token migration contract will allow the conveyance of tokens into $ASI from over 200,000 token holders of the constituent communities with $AGI, $FET and $OCEAN tokens swapped at the previously announced pegged&nbsp;ratios.</p><blockquote>“This merger paves the way for a new era in AI, combining our strengths to achieve unprecedented advancements,” states Ben Goertzel, CEO of ASI Alliance, renowned pioneer of AGIX and SNET&nbsp;Founder.</blockquote><p>“This is only the start of a broader movement to gather together forces working toward beneficial decentralized AGI and super-intelligence. The ASI token serves as a symbol and a practical tool for our shared quest to leverage advanced AI, blockchain and decentralized governance to move quickly and effectively toward an amazing future for&nbsp;all.”</p> Turbocharged ASI&nbsp;Future <p>With the closing of this merger, a decentralized AI infrastructure at scale is a reality. This fusion of SNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol’s research, brands, technologies, and products lays the groundwork for an open, scalable AI infrastructure that leverages blockchain to ensure ethical and trustworthy practices in AI development and deployment.

<p>The concept of identity has taken on newfound significance. As our lives become increasingly entwined with technology, the way we define, manage, and protect our identities has become a crucial concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike.&nbsp;</p><p>To better understand the challenges and opportunities in this space, we spoke with Kim Duffy, the Executive Director of the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p><p>At the heart of this conversation lies the delicate balance between privacy, security, and convenience — a trinity of competing priorities that shape the development and adoption of digital identity systems.</p><p>The stakes are high. In a world where personal data is often likened to the new oil, the consequences of mismanaged or compromised digital identities can be severe. From data breaches and identity theft to the erosion of privacy and the commodification of personal information, the risks are manifold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, so too are the opportunities. Advancements in decentralized technologies offer the potential for more secure, private, and user-centric identity management solutions.</p> Defining Identity in the Digital Landscape <p>People consider digital identity many different things. And it is. It often refers to the information that represents an individual in digital interactions, including usernames, email addresses, social media profiles, and biometric data. However, the scope of digital identity has expanded to include a much broader range of data points, from browsing histories to financial data. As Kim stated, "Identity, I think, to your point, is very large and amorphous."</p><p>The challenge lies in managing this vast array of personal information in a way that balances privacy, security, and convenience. Traditional centralized identity models, where user data is stored and controlled by a single entity, have proven vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, decentralized identity solutions aim to give users greater control over their personal data, using cryptographic techniques to enable users to create and manage their own digital identities without intermediaries.</p> The Pitfalls of Traditional Digital Identity Models <p>The traditional approach to digital identity management has given rise to significant challenges and risks. One pressing concern is the lack of user control and consent over the collection, use, and sharing of personal data. As Kim noted, "We are still accustomed to this model where we share all our data for purposes of someone vetting us, but we're not afforded that in return."</p><p>This lack of control has led to the proliferation of data brokers and the commodification of personal information, often without the knowledge or consent of the individuals involved. Additionally, the centralization of user data has made digital identity systems an attractive target for hackers, with data breaches exposing millions of users' personal information to potential misuse.</p><p>Another pitfall is the erosion of privacy in the pursuit of convenience. Simplified login processes, such as social media authentication, can create a single point of failure and enable third parties to track user activity across different platforms.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Kim highlighted the risks, stating, "The text messages that you receive from ‘Wells Fargo’, or, you know, all of these things. One of our new members at DIF is focusing on the impact specifically to senior citizens. And if they can confuse people who work daily in technology, like my God, they're getting really good at deceiving us."</blockquote><p>The limitations of traditional digital identity models have led to a growing recognition of the need for more secure, privacy-preserving, and user-centric approaches. Decentralized identity systems have emerged as a promising alternative, aiming to give users greater control over their personal data and reduce reliance on centralized authorities.&nbsp;</p> Balancing Privacy and Accountability in Decentralized Systems <p>As decentralized identity systems gain traction, it is crucial to strike a balance between privacy and accountability. With their public designs, blockchain-based identity systems also come with risks.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>As Kim pointed out, "People have thought about the risks of having your activities on-chain for 20 years. Then, to hear people talk of them as a benefit, like one that I heard that Vitalik himself said was if criminal convictions were recorded on a blockchain — you can maybe use that as a negative reputation. It would make us crazy."</blockquote><p>The key is to prioritize user agency and control over shared information, preventing the weaponization of personal data against individuals. Decentralized systems must be designed to empower users to selectively disclose their information, ensuring that their privacy is protected while still enabling necessary accountability.</p><p>As Kim emphasized, "Yes, we sometimes want or need personal information from people. But if everything is public on the blockchain, it isn't simply information or reputation — it can also be weaponized against people. We have to give agency to people over their identity and ensure that what they share isn't just some free-for-all where anyone with the most time or money can find it and use it against us."</p><p>Finding this balance requires a combination of thoughtful system design, robust privacy controls, and clear governance frameworks. By putting users at the center and prioritizing their needs, decentralized identity systems can pave the way for a more secure, private, and accountable digital future.</p> Decentralized Identity and the Path Forward <p>As we navigate the complex landscape of digital identity, it is clear that decentralized solutions will play a crucial role in shaping a more secure, private, and user-centric future. The emergence of technologies like Holochain, with its agent-centric, distributed architecture, offers a promising path forward for building decentralized identity management systems that prioritize user agency and control.</p><p>However, the success of these solutions will depend on our ability to strike the right balance between privacy, security, and convenience. It will require ongoing collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and industry leaders to ensure that the systems we build are not only technologically sound but also aligned with the needs and values of the individuals they serve.</p><p>The journey ahead may be complex, but with the right tools, mindset, and commitment to putting users first, we have the opportunity to redefine the way we manage and protect our digital identities. One that prioritizes the rights, needs, and aspirations of individuals in an increasingly connected world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the 5th blog in the <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping">series</a>. The collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB) resulted previously in <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping/urban-land-ownership-mapping-in-copenhagen-eb13bfbbded1">mapping of Copenhagen</a>, Lisbon.</p><p>Through findings in this blog, we aim to point towards the role of land ownership ptterns and related dynamics that led to increasing unaffordability and spatial injustice.</p>  *Note: We are still in a process of establishing a collaboration with the Municipality of Athens and Ktimatologio to obtain needed data for analysis of the largest landowners in Athens. This article will be updated by a map, visualization and reflection based on further findings.   Introduction <p>Athens, just like Lisbon, became <a href="https://greekcitytimes.com/2024/04/05/athens-ranked-second-least-liveable-city-in-europe/">one of the least affordable cities</a> in Europe for its citizens in the last decade. There are multiple reasons for it which relate to similar patterns as observed in <a>Lisbon</a>. The below outlined findings of the project Eteron — Institute for Research and Social Change (a non-profit organisation based in Athens, produces knowledge, contributes to citizen empowerment and promotes partnerships) reveal some of the contributing dynamics.</p> Athens soaring&nbsp;prices <p><a href="https://eteron.org/">Eteron</a> — the Institute for Research and Social Change — a non-profit organization working with production of knowledge and citizen empowerment through its project Housing360 provides a <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/">great overview</a> of the present housing problem in Greece. The issues are&nbsp;known:</p>  Increasing rents to sky-high levels, causing “79.2% of renters are overburdened by housing costs”, combined with worsening housing conditions, caused by a combination of factors that include, lack of adequate housing policy, regulation or protection of tennants, short-term rentals popularity, financialization of housing so a shift of domestic and international capital to the real estate market combined with little affordable housing&nbsp;supply.  <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/short-term-rentals/">Short-term rental</a> induced by platforms such as AirBnb, combined with lack of regulation, and promotion of touristification by the central authorities (see also this&nbsp;article)  <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/financialisation/">Speculation and financialization</a> — institutional foreign investments combined with the “Golden Visa” programme (similar to&nbsp;Lisbon)  Vacant buildings — large proportions of empty housing in urban centers (31% in Athens in 2011) incl. Significant amount of sqare meters owned by public institutions.  <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/youth-housing/">Youth housing</a> — increasing difficulties for young men and women combined with high rates of unemployment following the financial crisis in&nbsp;2008.  <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/home-ownership/">Issues of ownership</a> — as 74.6 % of Greeks own their home post-financial crisis reality characterized itself by a an over-indebtedness of households.  <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/energy-poverty/">Energy poverty</a> impacting citizens&nbsp;health  combined with the <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/urban-space/">Urban planning focus merely on urban space improvements</a>  <p>All contributing to increasing inequality affecting <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/vulnerable-groups/">vulnerable groups</a>.</p> Data transparency review <p>Establishing land ownership overview has been a long process that finally is being crystalized into a unified set of online data services. The creation of the <a href="https://www.ktimatologio.gr/">National Property Registry, also known as the Ktimatologio,</a> has been a laborious process spanning over three decades. Presently, the Greek government expresses optimism regarding the project’s culmination by the year&nbsp;2026.</p><p>Recently, an <a href="https://www.ktimatologio.gr/">interactive digital map</a> with all properties currently incorporated into the registry has been released, accompanied by the number for each plot. In adherence to data protection protocols, ownership details will remain undisclosed within the&nbsp;map.</p><p>To find out the information on owners, under Greek Law, anyone invoking <a href="https://www.elra.eu/contact-point-contribution/greece/how-to-get-the-information-7/">“legitimate interest” can apply for information held in the land registry, which is provided by the Land Registrar in the form of a certificate or excerpt of the Land Book</a> (ELRA) — therefore the information can be considered public in the sense that anyone can have access in the books. Each property has been marked with a unique number, the so-called Code Number E of the national K thematic catalog ( KAEK )&nbsp;, which is the exclusive code number for each parcel of land, the identity of the property. The <a href="https://www.ktimatologio.gr/">interactive digital map</a> provides for the first time these codes for each plot. One can <a href="https://www.ktimatologio.gr/pliroforiako-yliko/ktimatologio-se-leitourgia/21">purchase</a> different types of information upon registration through a Greek digital system <a href="https://login.gsis.gr/mylogin/login.jsp?bmctx=1DB55AB50C08F2B418903DE4EB7466AD47038BC455E39B9EA82B1EB28CE52BC6&amp;contextType=external&amp;username=string&amp;password=secure_string&amp;challenge_url=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.gsis.gr%2Fmylogin%2Flogin.jsp&amp;ssoCookie=disablehttponly&amp;request_id=6618290009597394467&amp;authn_try_count=0&amp;locale=en&amp;resource_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww1.gsis.gr%252Ftaxisnet%252Fmytaxisnet">Taxisnet</a> for residents with Tax registration number.</p><p>As this is a work in progress, property holders are still having the liberty to register their properties and update information conveniently, eliminating the need for physical visits to government agencies with supporting documentation. Though the deadline for property registration has lapsed, the online map aims to serve as an incentive for registration, ideally before November 30th,&nbsp;2024.</p> Athen’s largest landowners   *Note: We are still in a process of establishing a collaboration with the Municipality of Athens and Ktimatologio to obtain needed data for analysis of the largest landowners in Athens.

 Highlights 
 
 How to Obtain a SelfKey iD 
 SelfKey iD Benefits 
 Conclusions 
 
 How to Obtain a SelfKey iD 
 Prerequisites 
<p>Obtaining your very own SelfKey iD is a simple process. You will need:</p>
 
 A passport or a government-issued iD. 
 A valid email address. 
 A Laptop/PC with a webcam to successfully take a selfie.&nbsp; 
 Metamask wallet browser extension set up. For important details, please open the following <a href="https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-metamask/">link</a>. 
 MATIC in the wallet - instructions on how to obtain MATIC will be provided within the wallet. 
 
<p></p>
<p>These are crucial to verify your identity and ensure that you are indeed the individual you claim to be.</p>
<p>Please note that certain steps may take varying amounts of time to complete, ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Your patience is appreciated as the process unfolds.</p>
 Step One: Getting started 
<p>The first step is to access SelfKey DAO’s <a href="https://app.selfkey.org/">official website</a> and connect your wallet. After your wallet connects, simply press the Metamask button to start your journey.</p>
<p></p>
 Step Two: Input Email Address and agree with Terms 
<p>Once you’ve completed the first step, you will be required to initiate the verification process. You must enter a valid email address and you must make sure to acknowledge SelfKey DAO’s <a href="https://staging.gc.selfkey.org/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> by checking the box below.</p>
<p></p>
 Step Three: Invitation to join KYC Application 
<p>After completing the second step, you will receive an email from <a href="mailto:verification@kycs.ai">verification@kycs.ai</a>, with the title “Invitation to join KYC Application”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure to also double check your spam folder if the email did not arrive. If you accidentally introduced a typo in the email address, you can try to send the invitation again.</p>
<p>The email should open to the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>After clicking on the “Start the KYC application” button, you will be redirected to the application page, where you will begin the KYC (know your customer) verification process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of KYC in SelfKey DAO is to verify the authenticity and uniqueness of each individual and confirm their claimed identity. This measure prevents users owning more than one SelfKey iD and ensures that the SelfKey DAO and its partners are sybil or bot-free.</p>
 Step Four: Connecting Wallet and Signing 
<p>Before beginning your KYC verification process, you'll be prompted to connect your digital wallet and provide a signature.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You're now starting the onboarding process. Please read each instruction thoroughly to successfully complete each step.</p>
 Step Five: ID Document verification 
<p>Before proceeding, it's essential to read and agree to the <a href="http://kycs.ai">KYCS.AI Privacy Policy &amp; Terms of Service</a>. Make sure to scroll through the entire document for the next button to activate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While verification via other devices is possible using a QR code, it's advisable to continue on a desktop or laptop.</p>
<p>A brief guide will be provided to demonstrate how to position your ID or passport for the desktop or laptop camera to capture a photo. Alternatively, you can upload the document directly from your computer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's crucial that the document is clear, fully visible, not tilted, and not cropped. If the upload fails, please make sure the guidelines are followed and attempt the upload again.</p>
<p></p>
 Step Six: Selfie Check 
<p>The next, and one of the most crucial steps in the process, is the selfie check. Given that the number of attempts is limited to only three, you must be extra cautious to respect the following guidelines before pressing the photo button:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Make sure that you are facing the camera directly. 
  You must be in good light, so that all your features are visible. 
  Position your face close enough to the camera to fit within the oval guide provided. 
 
<p></p>
 Step Seven: Details and Information 
<p>After passing the selfie check, you will be required to confirm the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please make sure that the fields are filled in correctly before continuing to the next step.</p>
<p>Following this, you will need to confirm additional details, such as your date of birth, nationality, and country of residence. These fields must be completed before proceeding to the next step.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The final step will be to review the information you've submitted for accuracy. Once you submit the form, you won't be able to make any further changes.</p>
<p></p>
 Step Eight: Verification and Onboarding 
<p>The verification process can take a few minutes up to a few hours but if all is well, your application will be approved. If you’ve successfully completed the KYC process, you will receive an email redirecting you to selfkey.app.org.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Make sure you thoroughly read, understand, and agree with the <a href="https://staging.gc.selfkey.org/terms-of-service">terms of service</a> before proceeding.</p>
 Step Nine: Claiming your SelfKey iD SBT 
<p>Once you've finished the preceding step, you'll be able to claim your SelfKey iD. This involves an additional selfie check as an added security measure.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please make sure that the additional selfie matches the one taken during onboarding and that you check the agreement box before proceeding.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With this final step, you’ve completed your onboarding.</p>
<p>If you’re experiencing any issues during or after obtaining your SelfKey iD, please make sure to open a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/897002577831526460/1128242522829897758">support ticket</a>. SelfKey DAO is here to provide assistance every step of the way, as promptly as possible.</p>
 SelfKey iD Benefits 
<p>Congratulations on obtaining your very own SelfKey iD SBT! Now that you’re a valued member of SelfKey DAO, it is vital to take note of all the perks and benefits you can enjoy as a proud SelfKey iD user.</p>
<p></p>
 Claiming SELF tokens 
<p>Upon completing onboarding, each new SelfKey iD user has the opportunity to claim a generous 50 SELF tokens to ignite their journey. This gesture serves as a token of appreciation and a heartfelt welcome from SelfKey DAO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the initial 50 SELF tokens must be manually claimed by the user, ensuring active participation in the process.&nbsp;</p>
 Redeeming Invite Code 
<p>Each SelfKey iD holder receives a unique invite code, which remains usable indefinitely. This code offers one of the simplest means to accumulate SELF tokens while also fostering the growth and expansion of the DAO.</p>
<p>To benefit, users merely need to distribute their code among friends, family, and acquaintances. For each eligible member successfully onboarded into SelfKey DAO using this code, both the user and the referred individual stand to potentially qualify for SELF tokens.</p>
<p>With the invite code's indefinite usability, it presents an exceptional chance for active members to consistently build their SELF holdings over time.</p>
 Credential Locking 
<p>Within the SelfKey iD framework, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-id-credential-locking/">Credential Locking</a> serves as an added layer of security for online identity verification. This process typically involves the following steps:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie as part of the initial KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure. 
 For continued access to SelfKey DAO, users undergo additional selfie checks. 
 Upon successful check, users receive a credential that can be locked using KEY. This verification procedure ensures the authentication of users' identities, potentially enhancing their digital security. 
 
<p>By securing KEY on their credentials, users actively contribute to fortifying the security of the SelfKey DAO ecosystem and may have the opportunity to mint SELF tokens themselves.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Through the development of cutting-edge digital solutions, SelfKey DAO aims to erect barriers against cyber threats that could result in identity theft. One such solution could be SelfKey iD.</p>
<p>Leveraging the remarkable capabilities of artificial intelligence, SelfKey iD stands ready to counter the risks posed by data breaches and identity theft. Moreover, it offers unique advantages and presents opportunities for active members of the SelfKey DAO community.</p>
<p>If you're prepared to enhance your digital identity management, seize the opportunity to acquire your very own SelfKey iD today!</p>

<p>Virtually every organization recognizes the power of data to enhance customer and employee experiences and drive better business decisions. Yet, as data becomes more valuable, it’s also becoming harder to protect. Companies continue to create more attack surfaces with hybrid models, scattering critical data across cloud, third-party and on-premises locations, while&nbsp;threat actors constantly devise new and creative ways to exploit vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>In response, many organizations are focusing more on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-protection">data protection</a>, only to find a lack of formal guidelines and advice.</p>



<p>While every data protection strategy is unique, below are several key components and best practices to consider when building one for your organization.</p>



 What is a data protection strategy? 



<p>A data protection strategy is a set of measures and processes to safeguard an organization’s sensitive information from data loss and corruption. Its principles are the same as those of data protection—to protect data&nbsp;and&nbsp;support data availability.</p>



<p>To fulfill these principles, data protection strategies generally focus on the following three areas:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">Data security</a>—protecting digital information from unauthorized access, corruption or theft throughout its entire lifecycle. 



 Data availability—ensuring critical data is available for business operations even during a data breach, malware or ransomware attack. 



 Access control—making critical data accessible only to employees who need it and not to those who don’t. 
 



<p>Data protection’s emphasis on accessibility and availability is one of the main reasons it differs from data security. While data security focuses on protecting digital information from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/threat-actor">threat actors</a>&nbsp;and unauthorized access, data protection does all that and more. It supports the same security measures as data security but also covers authentication, data backup, data storage and achieving regulatory compliance, as in the European Union’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/gdpr-eu">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR).</p>



<p>Most data protection strategies now have traditional data protection measures, like data backups and restore functions, as well as business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) plans, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/draas">disaster recovery as a service</a> (DRaaS). Together, these comprehensive approaches not only deter threat actors but also standardize the management of sensitive data and corporate information security and limit any business operations lost to downtime.</p>



 Why it’s important for your security strategy 



<p>Data powers much of the world economy—and unfortunately, cybercriminals know its value.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">Cyberattacks</a> that aim to steal sensitive information continue to rise.&nbsp;According to IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">Cost of a Data Breach</a>, the global average cost to remediate a data breach in 2023 was USD 4.45 million, a 15 percent increase over three years.</p>



<p>These data breaches can cost their victims in many ways. Unexpected downtime can lead to lost business, a company can lose customers and suffer significant reputational damage, and stolen intellectual property can hurt a company’s profitability, eroding its competitive edge.</p>



<p>Data breach victims also frequently face steep regulatory fines or legal penalties. Government regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and industry regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA), oblige companies to protect their customers’ personal data.</p>



<p>Failure to comply with these data protection laws can result in hefty fines. In May 2023, Ireland’s data protection authority imposed a USD 1.3 billion fine on the California-based Meta for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/22/facebook-fined-mishandling-user-information-ireland-eu-meta">GDPR violations</a>.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, companies are increasingly prioritizing data protection within their cybersecurity initiatives, realizing that a robust data protection strategy not only defends against potential data breaches but also ensures ongoing compliance with regulatory laws and standards. Even more, a good data protection strategy can improve business operations and minimize downtime in a cyberattack, saving critical time and money.</p>



 Key components of data protection strategies&nbsp; 



<p>While every data protection strategy is different (and should be tailored to the specific needs of your organization), there are several solutions you should cover.</p>



<p>Some of these key components include:</p>



 Data lifecycle management&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lifecycle-management">Data lifecycle management</a>&nbsp;(DLM) is an approach that helps manage an organization’s data throughout its lifecycle—from data entry to data destruction. It separates data into phases based on different criteria and moves through these stages as it completes different tasks or requirements. The phases of DLM include data creation, data storage, data sharing and usage, data archiving, and data deletion.</p>



<p>A good DLM process can help organize and structure critical data, particularly when organizations rely on diverse types of data storage. It can also help them reduce vulnerabilities and ensure data is efficiently managed, compliant with regulations, and not at risk of misuse or loss.</p>



 Data access management controls 



<p>Access controls help prevent unauthorized access, use or transfer of sensitive data by ensuring that only authorized users can access certain types of data. They keep out threat actors while still allowing every employee to do their jobs by having the exact permissions they need and nothing more.</p>



<p>Organizations can use role-based access controls (RBAC),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>&nbsp;or regular reviews of user permissions.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/identity-access-management">Identity and access management (IAM)</a>&nbsp;initiatives are especially helpful for streamlining access controls and protecting assets without disrupting legitimate business processes. They assign all users a distinct digital identity with permissions tailored to their role, compliance needs and other factors.</p>



 Data encryption 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">Data encryption</a>&nbsp;involves converting data from its original, readable form (plaintext) into an encoded version (ciphertext) using encryption algorithms. This process helps ensure that even if unauthorized individuals access encrypted data, they won’t be able to understand or use it without a decryption key.</p>



<p>Encryption is critical to data security. It helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access both when it’s being transmitted over networks (in transit)&nbsp;and&nbsp;when it’s being stored on devices or servers (at rest). Typically, authorized users only perform decryption when necessary to ensure that sensitive data is almost always secure and unreadable.</p>



 Data risk management 



<p>To protect their data, organizations first need to know their risks. Data&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/risk-management">risk management</a>&nbsp;involves conducting a full audit/risk assessment of an organization’s data to understand what types of data it has, where it’s stored and who has access to it.</p>



<p>Companies then use this assessment to identify threats and vulnerabilities and implement risk mitigation strategies. These strategies help fill security gaps and strengthen an organization’s data security and cybersecurity posture. Some include adding security measures, updating data protection policies, conducting employee training or investing in new technologies.</p>



<p>Additionally, ongoing risk assessments can help organizations catch emerging data risks early, allowing them to adapt their security measures accordingly.</p>



 Data backup and recovery 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/backup-disaster-recovery">Data backup and disaster recovery</a>&nbsp;involves periodically creating or updating more copies of files, storing them in one or more remote locations, and using the copies to continue or resume business operations in the event of data loss due to file damage, data corruption, cyberattack or natural disaster.</p>



<p>The subprocesses ‘backup’ and ‘disaster recovery’ are sometimes mistaken for each other or the entire process. However, backup is the process of making file copies, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/disaster-recovery">disaster recovery</a>&nbsp;is the plan and process for using the copies to quickly reestablish access to applications, data and IT resources after an outage. That plan might involve switching over to a redundant set of servers and storage systems until your primary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a>&nbsp;is functional again.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/draas">Disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS)</a>&nbsp;is a managed approach to disaster recovery. A third-party provider hosts and manages the infrastructure used for disaster recovery. Some DRaaS offerings might provide tools to manage the disaster recovery processes or enable organizations to have those processes managed for them.</p>



 Data storage management 



<p>Whenever organizations move their data, they need strong security. Otherwise, they risk exposing themselves to data loss, cyber threats and potential data breaches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data storage management helps simplify this process by reducing vulnerabilities, particularly for hybrid and cloud storage. It oversees all tasks related to securely transferring production data to data stores, whether on-premises or in external cloud environments. These stores cater to either frequent, high-performance access or serve as archival storage for infrequent retrieval.</p>



 Incident response 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/incident-response">Incident response</a>&nbsp;(IR) refers to an organization’s processes and technologies for detecting and responding to cyber threats, security breaches and cyberattacks. Its goal is to prevent cyberattacks before they happen and minimize the cost and business disruption resulting from any that do occur.</p>



<p>Incorporating incident response into a broader data protection strategy can help organizations take a more proactive approach to cybersecurity and improve the fight against cybercriminals.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2023</a>, organizations with high levels of IR countermeasures in place incurred USD 1.49 million lower data breach costs compared to organizations with low levels or none, and they resolved incidents 54 days faster.</p>



 Data protection policies and procedures 



<p>Data protection policies help organizations outline their approach to data security and data privacy. These policies can cover a range of topics, including data classification, access controls, encryption standards, data retention and disposal practices, incident response protocols, and technical controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and antivirus and data loss prevention (DLP) software.</p>



<p>A major benefit of data protection policies is that they set clear standards. Employees know their responsibilities for safeguarding sensitive information and often have training on data security policies, such as identifying phishing attempts, handling sensitive information securely and promptly reporting security incidents.</p>



<p>Additionally, data protection policies can enhance operational efficiency by offering clear processes for data-related activities such as access requests, user provisioning, incident reporting and conducting security audits.</p>



 Standards and regulatory compliance 



<p>Governments and other authorities increasingly recognize the importance of data protection and have established standards and data protection laws that companies must meet to do business with customers.</p>



<p>Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines, including legal fees. However, a robust data protection strategy can help ensure ongoing regulatory compliance by laying out strict internal policies and procedures.</p>



<p>The most notable regulation is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/gdpr-eu">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, enacted by the European Union (EU) to safeguard individuals’ personal data. GDPR focuses on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;and imposes stringent compliance requirements on data providers. It mandates transparency in data collection practices and imposes substantial fines for non-compliance, up to 4 percent of an organization’s annual global turnover or EUR 20 million.</p>



<p>Another significant data privacy law is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which, like GDPR, emphasizes transparency and empowers individuals to control their personal information. Under CCPA, California residents can request details about their data, opt out of sales, and request deletion.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates data security and compliance standards for “covered entities” like healthcare providers handling patients’ personal health information (PHI).</p>

 Best practices for every data protection strategy 



 Inventory all available data 



<p>Having secure data starts with knowing what types of data you have, where it’s stored and who has access to it. Conduct a comprehensive data inventory to identify and categorize all information held by your organization. Determine the sensitivity and criticality of each data type to prioritize protection efforts, then regularly update the inventory with any changes in data usage or storage.</p>



 Keep stakeholders informed 



<p>Maintain strong communications with key stakeholders, such as executives, vendors, suppliers, customers and PR and marketing personnel, so they know your data protection strategy and approach. This open line of communication will create greater trust, transparency and awareness of data security policies and empower employees and others to make better cybersecurity decisions.</p>



 Conduct security awareness training 



<p>Conduct security awareness training across your entire workforce on your data protection strategy. Cyberattacks often exploit human weakness, making&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/insider-threats">insider threats</a> a significant concern and employees the first line of defense against cybercriminals. With presentations, webinars, classes and more, employees can learn to recognize security threats and better protect critical data and other sensitive information.</p>



 Run regular risk assessments 



<p>Running ongoing risk assessments and analyses helps identify potential threats and avoid data breaches. Risk assessments allow you to take stock of your data footprint and security measures and isolate vulnerabilities while maintaining updated data protection policies. Additionally, some data protection laws and regulations require them.</p>



 Maintain strict documentation 



<p>Documenting sensitive data in a hybrid IT environment is challenging but necessary for any good data protection strategy. Maintain strict records for regulators, executives, vendors and others in case of audits, investigations or other cybersecurity events. Updated documentation creates operational efficiency and ensures transparency, accountability and compliance with data protection laws. Additionally, data protection policies and procedures should always be up-to-date to combat emerging cyber threats.</p>



 Perform ongoing monitoring&nbsp; 



<p>Monitoring offers real-time visibility into data activities, allowing for the swift detection and remediation of potential vulnerabilities. Certain data protection laws may even require it. And even when it’s not required, monitoring can help keep data activities compliant with data protection policies (as with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/compliance-monitoring">compliance monitoring</a>). Organizations can also use it to test the effectiveness of proposed security measures.</p>



<p>While strategies will differ across industries, geographies, customer needs and a range of other factors, nailing down these essentials will help set your organization on the right path forward when it comes to fortifying its data protection.</p>

<div class='wrap'>


<p>In November 2023, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) released a set of draft regulations on the use of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and automated decision-making technology (ADMT).</p>



<p>The proposed rules are still in development, but organizations may want to pay close attention to their evolution. Because the state is home to many of the world’s biggest technology companies, any AI regulations that California adopts could have an impact far beyond its borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, a California appeals court <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/major-win-california-privacy-protection-agency-enforcement-regulations-can-begin">recently ruled</a> that the CPPA can immediately enforce rules as soon as they are finalized. By following how the ADMT rules progress, organizations can better position themselves to comply as soon as the regulations take effect.</p>



<p>The CPPA is still accepting public comments and reviewing the rules, so the regulations are liable to change before they are officially adopted. This post is based on the most current draft as of 9 April 2024.</p>



 Why is California developing new rules for ADMT and AI? 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ccpa-compliance">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA</a>), California’s landmark <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-privacy">data privacy</a> law, did not originally address the use of ADMT directly. That changed with the passage of the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in 2020, which amended the CCPA in several important ways.</p>



<p>The CPRA created the CPPA, a regulatory agency that implements and enforces CCPA rules. The CPRA also gave the CPPA the authority to issue regulations concerning California consumers’ rights to access information about, and opt out of, automated decisions. The CPPA is working on ADMT rules under this authority.</p>



 Who must comply with California’s ADMT and AI rules? 



<p>As with the rest of the CCPA, the draft rules would apply to for-profit organizations that do business in California and meet at least one of the following criteria:</p>



 
 The business has a total annual revenue of more than USD 25 million. 
 



 
 The business buys, sells, or shares the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii">personal data</a> of 100,000+ California residents. 
 



 
 The business makes at least half of its total annual revenue from selling the data of California residents. 
 



<p>Furthermore, the proposed regulations would only apply to certain uses of AI and ADMT: making significant decisions, extensively profiling consumers, and training ADMT tools.&nbsp;</p>



 How does the CPPA define ADMT? 



<p>The <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/meetings/materials/20240308_item4_draft_risk.pdf">current draft</a> (PDF, 827 KB) defines automated decision-making technology as any software or program that processes personal data and uses computation to execute a decision, replace human decision-making, or substantially facilitate human decision-making. The draft specifically notes that this definition includes software and programs “derived from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a>, statistics, other data-processing techniques or artificial intelligence.”</p>



<p>The draft rules explicitly name some tools that do not count as ADMT, including spam filters, spreadsheets, and firewalls. However, if an organization attempts to use these exempt tools to make automated decisions in a way that circumvents regulations, the rules will apply to that use.</p>



 Covered uses of ADMT 



 Making significant decisions 



<p>The draft rules would apply to any use of ADMT to make decisions that have significant effects on consumers. Generally speaking, a significant decision is one that affects a person’s rights or access to critical goods, services, and opportunities.</p>



<p>For example, the draft rules would cover automated decisions that impact a person’s ability to get a job, go to school, receive healthcare, or obtain a loan.</p>



 Extensive profiling 



<p>Profiling is the act of automatically processing someone’s personal information to evaluate, analyze, or predict their traits and characteristics, such as job performance, product interests, or behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Extensive profiling” refers to particular kinds of profiling:</p>



 
 Systematically profiling consumers in the context of work or school, such as by using a keystroke logger to track employee performance. 
 



 
 Systematically profiling consumers in publicly accessible places, such as using facial recognition to analyze shoppers’ emotions in a store. 
 



 
 Profiling consumers for behavioral advertising. Behavioral advertising is the act of using someone’s personal data to display targeted ads to them. 
 



 Training ADMT 



<p>The draft rules would apply to businesses’ use of consumer personal data to train certain ADMT tools. Specifically, the rules would cover training an ADMT that can be used to make significant decisions, identify people, <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/Blog-Heres-What-Policymakers-Can-Do-About-Deepfakes">generate deepfakes,</a> or perform physical or biological identification and profiling.</p>



 Who would be protected under the AI and ADMT rules? 



<p>As a California law, the CCPA’s consumer protections extend only to consumers who reside in California. The same holds true for the protections that the draft ADMT rules grant.</p>



<p>That said, these rules define “consumer” more broadly than many other data privacy regulations. In addition to people who interact with a business, the rules cover employees, students, independent contractors, and school and job applicants.</p>



 What are the draft CCPA rules on AI and automated decision-making technology? 



<p>The draft CCPA AI regulations have three key requirements. Organizations that use covered ADMT must issue pre-use notices to consumers, offer ways to opt out of ADMT, and explain how the business’s use of ADMT affects the consumer.</p>



<p>While the CPPA has revised the regulations once and is likely to do so again before the rules are formally adopted, these core requirements appear in each draft so far. The fact that these requirements persist suggests they will remain in the final rules, even if the details of their implementation change.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/guardium-insights/data-compliance">Learn how IBM Security® Guardium® Insights helps organizations meet their cybersecurity and data compliance regulations.</a></p>



 Pre-use notices 



<p>Before using ADMT for one of the covered purposes, organizations must clearly and conspicuously serve consumers a pre-use notice. The notice must detail in plain language how the company uses ADMT and explain consumers’ rights to access more information about ADMT and opt out of the process.</p>



<p>The company cannot fall back on generic language to describe how it uses ADMT, like “We use automated tools to improve our services.” Instead, the organization must describe the specific use.</p>



<p>The notice must direct consumers to additional information about how the ADMT works, including the tool’s logic and how the business uses its outputs. This information does not have to be in the body of the notice. The organization can give consumers a hyperlink or other way to access it.</p>



<p>If the business allows consumers to appeal automated decisions, the pre-use notice must explain the appeals process.</p>



 Opt-out rights 



<p>Consumers have a right to opt out of most covered uses of ADMT. Businesses must facilitate this right by giving consumers at least two ways to submit opt-out requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least one of the opt-out methods must use the same channel through which the business primarily interacts with consumers. For example, a digital retailer can have a web form for users to complete.</p>



<p>Opt-out methods must be simple and cannot have extraneous steps, like requiring users to create accounts.</p>



<p>Upon receiving an opt-out request, a business must stop processing a consumer’s personal information using that automated decision-making technology within 15 days. The business can no longer use any of the consumer’s data that it previously processed. The business must also notify any service providers or third parties with whom it shared the user’s data.</p>



 Exemptions 



<p>Organizations do not need to let consumers opt out of ADMT used for safety, security, and fraud prevention. The draft rules specifically mention using ADMT to detect and respond to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">data security</a> incidents, prevent and prosecute fraudulent and illegal acts, and ensure the physical safety of a natural person.</p>



<p>Under the human appeal exception, an organization need not enable opt-outs if it allows people to appeal automated decisions to a qualified human reviewer with the authority to overturn those decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations can also forgo opt-outs for certain narrow uses of ADMT in work and school contexts. These uses include:</p>



 
 Evaluating a person’s performance to make admission, acceptance, and hiring decisions. 
 



 
 Allocating tasks and determining compensation at work. 
 



 
 Profiling used solely to assess a person’s performance as a student or employee. 
 



<p>However, these work and school uses are only exempt from opt-outs if they meet the following criteria:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The ADMT in question must be necessary to achieve the business’s specific purpose and used only for that purpose.&nbsp; 
 



 
 The business must formally evaluate the ADMT to ensure that it is accurate and does not discriminate. 
 



 
 The business must put safeguards in place to ensure that the ADMT remains accurate and unbiased.&nbsp; 
 



<p>None of these exemptions apply to behavioral advertising or training ADMT. Consumers can always opt out of these uses.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/data-security">Learn how IBM data security solutions protect data across hybrid clouds and help simplify compliance requirements.</a></p>



 The right to access information about ADMT use&nbsp; 



<p>Consumers have a right to access information about how a business uses ADMT on them. Organizations must give consumers an easy way to request this information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When responding to access requests, organizations must provide details like the reason for using ADMT, the output of the ADMT regarding the consumer, and a description of how the business used the output to make a decision.</p>



<p>Access request responses should also include information on how the consumer can exercise their CCPA rights, such as filing complaints or requesting the deletion of their data.</p>



 Notification of adverse significant decisions 



<p>If a business uses ADMT to make a significant decision that negatively affects a consumer—for example, by leading to job termination—the business must send a special notice to the consumer about their access rights regarding this decision.</p>



<p>The notice must include:</p>



 
 An explanation that the business used ADMT to make an adverse decision. 
 



 
 Notification that the business cannot retaliate against the consumer for exercising their CCPA rights. 
 



 
 A description of how the consumer can access additional information about how ADMT was used. 
 



 
 Information on how to appeal the decision, if applicable.&nbsp; 
 



 Risk assessments for AI and ADMT 



<p>The CPPA is developing draft regulations on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-risk-management">risk assessments</a> alongside the proposed rules on AI and ADMT. While these are technically two separate sets of rules, the risk assessment regulations would affect how organizations use AI and ADMT.</p>



<p>The risk assessment rules would require organizations to conduct assessments before they use ADMT to make significant decisions or carry out extensive profiling. Organizations would also need to conduct risk assessments before they use personal information to train certain ADMT or AI models.</p>



<p>Risk assessments must identify the risks that the ADMT poses to consumers, the potential benefits to the organization or other stakeholders, and safeguards to mitigate or remove the risk. Organizations must refrain from using AI and ADMT where the risk outweighs the benefits.&nbsp;</p>



 How do the draft CCPA regulations relate to other AI laws? 



<p>California’s draft rules on ADMT are far from the first attempt at regulating the use of AI and automated decisions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/eu-ai-act">European Union’s AI Act</a> imposes strict requirements on the development and use of AI in Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the US, the Colorado Privacy Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act both give consumers the right to opt out of having their personal information processed to make significant decisions.</p>



<p>At the national level, President Biden signed an executive order in October 2023 directing federal agencies and departments to create standards for developing, using, and overseeing AI in their respective jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But California’s proposed ADMT regulations attract more attention than other state laws because they can potentially affect how companies behave beyond the state’s borders.</p>



<p>Much of the global technology industry is headquartered in California, so many of the organizations that make the most advanced automated decision-making tools will have to comply with these rules. The consumer protections extend only to California residents, but organizations might give consumers outside of California the same options for simplicity’s sake.</p>



<p>The original CCPA is often considered the US version of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/gdpr-eu">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> because it raised the bar for data privacy practices nationwide. These new AI and ADMT rules might produce similar results.</p>



 When do the CCPA AI and ADMT regulations take effect? 



<p>The rules are not finalized yet, so it’s impossible to say with certainty. That said, many observers estimate that the rules won’t take effect until mid-2025 at the earliest.</p>



<p>The CPPA is expected to hold another board meeting in July 2024 to discuss the rules further. Many believe that the CPPA Board is likely to begin the formal rulemaking process at this meeting. If so, the agency would have a year to finalize the rules, hence the estimated effective date of mid-2025.</p>



 How will the rules be enforced? 



<p>As with other parts of the CCPA, the CPPA will be empowered to investigate violations and fine organizations. The California attorney general can also levy civil penalties for noncompliance.</p>



<p>Organizations can be fined USD 2,500 for unintentional violations and USD 7,500 for intentional ones. These amounts are per violation, and each affected consumer counts as one violation. Penalties can quickly escalate when violations involve multiple consumers, as they often do.</p>



 What is the status of the CCPA AI and ADMT regulations? 



<p>The draft rules are still in flux. The CPPA continues to solicit public comments and hold board discussions, and the rules are likely to change further before they are adopted.</p>



<p>The CPPA has already made significant revisions to the rules based on prior feedback. For example, following the December 2023 board meeting, the agency added new exemptions from the right to opt out and placed restrictions on physical and biological profiling.</p>



<p>The agency also adjusted the definition of ADMT to limit the number of tools the rules would apply to. While the original draft included any technology that facilitated human decision-making, the most current draft applies only to ADMT that substantially facilitates human decision-making.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many industry groups feel the updated definition better reflects the practical realities of ADMT use, while privacy advocates worry it creates exploitable loopholes.</p>



<p>Even the CPPA Board itself is split on how the final rules should look. At a March 2024 meeting, two board members <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/california-proposed-amendments-to-5668070/">expressed concerns</a> that the current draft exceeds the board’s authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given how the rules have evolved so far, the core requirements for pre-use notices, opt-out rights, and access rights have a strong chance to remain intact. However, organizations may have lingering questions like:</p>



 
 What kinds of AI and automated decision-making technology will the final rules cover? 
 



 
 How will consumer protections be implemented on a practical level? 
 



 
 What kind of exemptions, if any, will organizations be granted? 
 



<p>Whatever the outcome, these rules will have significant implications for how AI and automation are regulated nationwide—and how consumers are protected in the wake of this booming technology.</p>

<p>With Generative AI being used to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-21/scarlett-johansson-shocked-by-openai-voice/103872924">imitate celebrities</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/podcasts/the-daily/ai-deepfake-drake.html">creators</a>, the question arises, is your likeness a form of intellectual property (IP)? Can you trademark your face or copyright your voice?</p>
<p>These questions are on the <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=40f40397-c091-4259-8e97-eab0943f565f">bleeding edge of IP law</a> and could take years to resolve. But I find there may be a simpler way to legally protect personal appearance.</p>
<p>On my reading of technology-neutral data protection law, generating likenesses of people without their permission could be a privacy breach.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the generally accepted definition of&nbsp;personal data as any data that may reasonably be related to an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data (sometimes called&nbsp;personal information) is treated in much the same way by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.caprivacy.org/cpra-text/">California Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;(CPRA), Europe’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data">General Data Protection Regulation</a>&nbsp;(GDPR), Australia’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information">Privacy Act</a>, and the new draft&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/the-american-privacy-rights-acts-definition-of-covered-data">American Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;(APRA).</p>
<p>These regulatory approaches to privacy place limits on how personal data is collected, used and disclosed. If personal data is collected without a good reason, or in excess of what’s reasonable for the purpose, or without the knowledge of the individual concerned, then privacy law may be breached.</p>
<p>What’s more,&nbsp;<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/the-regulatory-superpower-of-technology-neutrality/">technology neutrality in privacy law</a> means it does not matter how personal data comes to be held in a storage system; if it’s there, it may be deemed to have been collected.</p>
<p>Collection may be done directly and overtly via forms, questionnaires and measurements, or indirectly and subtly by way of acquisitions, analytics and algorithms.</p>
<p>To help stakeholders deal with the rise of analytics and Big Data, the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/">Australian privacy regulator</a> developed the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/more-guidance/guide-to-data-analytics-and-the-australian-privacy-principles">Guide to Data Analytics and the Australian Privacy Principles</a> which explains that:</p>
<p>“The concept of ‘collects’ applies broadly, and includes gathering, acquiring or obtaining personal information from any source and by any means. This includes collection by ‘creation’ which may occur when information is created with reference to, or generated from, other information” (underline added).</p>
<p>That guidance should apply to Deep Fakes, for what are digital images and voices if not data?</p>
<p>Digital recordings are series of ‘ones and zeros’ representing optical or acoustic samples that can be converted back to analog to be viewed or heard by people. If those sounds and images are identifiable as a natural person—that is, the output looks like or sounds like someone in particular—then logically that data is personal data about that person.</p>
[Aside: If it seems like a stretch to label digitally sampled light and sound as personal data, then consider digital text. That too is merely ‘ones and zeros’, in this case representing coded characters, which can be converted by a display device or printer to be human readable. If those characters form words and sentences which relate to an identifiable individual, then the ones and zeros from which they were all derived are clearly treated by privacy law as personal data.]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it ought not matter under technology neutral privacy law if an identifiable image or sound was recorded from real life or synthesised by software: the law would apply in both cases.</p>
<p>The same sort of interpretation would seem to be available under any similar technology neutral data protection regime.</p>
<p>That is, if a Generative AI model makes a likeness of a real-life individual Alice, then we can say the model has collected [by creation] personal information about Alice, and the operation of the model could be subject to privacy law.</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer but this seems to me to be easy enough to test in a ‘digital line up’. If a face or voice is presented to a sample of people, and an agreed percentage of them say the face or voice reminds them of Alice, then that would be evidence that personal data of Alice has been collected.</p>
<p>Moreover, if it was found that the model was actually prompted to mimic someone, then the case would be pretty strong, shall we say, on its face.</p>

   The internet's security relies on complex math, or cryptography. However, with quantum computers on the horizon, current encryption could become easily breakable.  Post-quantum cryptography research is now focused on developing new, quantum-resistant methods. With the possibility of large-scale quantum computers within the next twenty years, organizations must prepare for the quantum apocalypse, w

<p>The security, confidentiality, and integrity of the Internet are ultimately based on really hard math, aka cryptography. Computers get faster every few years (Moore’s Law, anyone?), meaning those math problems need to be That Much Harder to remain the foundation of security for the digital world. But what happens when our computers shift from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/transistor">transistors</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsquantum-mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>? That’s when everything based on today’s really hard math problems becomes laughably easy to crack.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity enthusiasts are not looking forward to that moment; it will be an Internet-wide emergency like we’ve never seen before. So, when can we expect quantum cryptography to break Internet security? Great question! That emergency may happen pretty soon. Or it may be a few more years. Some conspiracy theorists suggest it has already happened, and hackers are keeping quiet about it so they can suck up all the data with none the wiser. Ultimately, no one knows, though there are various predictions out there.</p>



 What is Quantum Mechanics? 



<p>You’ve probably heard about atoms. Teeny tiny particles that combine in various ways to make matter like oxygen and iron. Those teeny tiny particles are made up of even teenier tinier particles, and those sub-atomic particles are like magic.</p>



<p>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Arthur C. Clarke</p>



<p>Those subatomic particles offer some very interesting behavior that scientists and engineers can sometimes predict and manipulate. Predicting and manipulating those subatomic particles is what quantum mechanics is all about, and when it works, it is blindingly fast.</p>



 Quantum Computing 



<p>Scientists have been studying quantum mechanics for over a hundred years. It wasn’t until 1982, when Richard Feynman wrote in his famous paper,&nbsp;<a href="https://s2.smu.edu/~mitch/class/5395/papers/feynman-quantum-1981.pdf">Simulating Physics with Computers</a>, that people started thinking about the possibilities. Things got exciting in 1994 when Peter Shor developed a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">quantum algorithm</a>. That algorithm was the warning bell that cryptographic systems based on solving current complex math problems would be blown out of the water.</p>



<p>What that algorithm could do was find the prime factors of large numbers in shorter timeframes than ever before. You have probably seen those tables about how long it takes to crack a password (like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2023/05/18/time-taken-for-hackers-to-crack-passwords-revealed/">this one</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.response-it.co.uk/news/2020/9/2/how-long-does-it-take-to-crack-your-password">this one</a>) that shows millions or billions of years to crack a long, complicated password. Now, imagine those numbers cut down to days. More bluntly, what once took a few billion years to solve using traditional computing and existing algorithms will take days with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bairesdev.com/blog/quantum-computing-how-affect-cybersecurity/">quantum computing</a>.</p>



 Post-Quantum Cryptography 



<p>With Shor’s Algorithm kicking things off, research is underway to develop more quantum algorithms that can be used as the basis of new cryptographic methods. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a&nbsp;<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">very active program</a>&nbsp;focused entirely on this area of study.</p>



<p>The goal of this program isn’t just new, advanced math. It’s advanced math that can interoperate with both new and traditional protocols and networks. It takes an amazing mind to figure out how to develop an algorithm that takes advantage of quantum mechanics when computers that use quantum mechanics are not quite ready for prime time. (See what I did there?)</p>



<p>NIST’s take on the probability and timing of the quantum apocalypse scenario is:</p>



<p>“While in the past it was less clear that large quantum computers are a physical possibility, many scientists now believe it to be merely a significant engineering challenge. Some engineers even predict that within the next twenty or so years sufficiently large quantum computers will be built to break essentially all public key schemes currently in use.”</p>



 Looking into the Void 



<p>The world is on the brink of having new computers that can crack code faster than dropping fine china on a granite countertop. Even if post-quantum cryptography is ready for real-world use around the same time those new computers are a reality, we still have a big problem. Great! What happens to all the material that people, organizations, and governments have been collecting and storing, waiting for the day they can crack it right open? Because it’s unrealistic to say that data collection isn’t happening.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/check-point-research-cyber-attacks-increased-50-year-over-year/">number of cybersecurity attacks</a>&nbsp;reported goes up every year. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2024/02/why-data-breaches-spiked-in-2023">Harvard Business Review,</a>&nbsp;breaches spiked in 2023. And all that is just what we know about. There is a lot of data already out there, and it’s unlikely that said data is encrypted with quantum-resistant algorithms.</p>



<p>When the first quantum-based computer is produced, we will see some interesting and terrifying information exposures. And if you want to freak out and head to your closest off-the-grid bunker, imagine AI powered by quantum-based computers.</p>



 Planning for an Emergency 



<p>Like all animals, humans are terrible at staying in emergency mode for long. And preparing for something as mind-blowing as the quantum apocalypse when we don’t know the timing is difficult. Do we treat it as an imminent emergency? Or do we slide it behind all the other emergencies clamoring for our attention? The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/01/navigating-quantum-shift-preparing-people-products-systems-quantum-resilience/">World Economic Forum</a>&nbsp;breaks down the steps that organizations should build into their plans into three items:</p>



 
 Be aware that changes in computing that will make your current security models irrelevant will happen. 



 Train your workforce to stay aware of changes in best practices for cryptography and conduct assessments of what data you have that is most sensitive to changes in advances in cryptography. 



 Remember your IoT devices and other digital assets may also be impacted. 
 



 Wrap Up 



<p>The Quantum Apocalypse has many cybersecurity practitioners biting their nails as responding to the brave new world of quantum cryptography will not be simple, quick, or cheap. It has business leaders thinking about retirement. And it’s just another Urgent Event for everyone else to worry about (because we don’t have enough to worry about today).</p>



<p>Still, the only thing worse than an apocalyptic event is an apocalyptic event no one saw coming. While there may be nothing for you and your organization to do right now beyond staying aware, that awareness will put you ahead of the game when this new computing paradigm becomes available to the world.</p>

<p>I’ve been part of the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Key Management working group for 3+ years. We try to meet up virtually every two weeks, skillfully facilitated by our CSA staff member Marina Bregkou. The working group is formed from a dozen or so people, some who attend regularly and some who drop in and out. It can sometimes be tricky for us trying to make time in our calendars while still trying to do our day jobs; however, the mix of backgrounds, experience, and characters that make up our group keep us engaged and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>We’ve been working on a paper for many months, discussing hardware security modules (HSMs) and, in particular, their as-a-service manifestation (HSMaaS). If you’re not familiar with HSMs and their cloud-based as-a-service relatives, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/what-are-hardware-security-modules">here’s an introduction to HSMs</a>.</p>
<p>The CSA approach is to always remain vendor agnostic so no one contributor can shift the content of the paper to promote or discuss specific product or vendor solutions. However, that doesn’t stop us from sharing our experience and insight.</p>
<p>I’m sure like other CSA working groups, of which there are 20 or more, the major milestone is when we get to the point where we publish a paper. It is the culmination of weeks of contribution, discussion, cogitation, and deliberation. Recently we published <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/hsm-as-a-service-use-cases-considerations-and-best-practices">HSM-as-a-Service Use Cases, Considerations, and Best Practices</a>, which tackles the following topics:</p>
 
 The definition and architecture of an HSM 
 The current and future state of the HSMaaS market 
 Industry, compliance, and risk use cases for the HSMaaS model 
 The importance of clearly defined responsibilities in the HSMaaS model 
 Security considerations for HSMs 
 Key management considerations unique to HSMaaS 
 Important considerations when setting up governance for HSMs 
 HSM vendor selection best practices 
 
<p></p>
<p>We hope it will be a useful, impartial reference for cloud service customers, whose industry, compliance, security, or risk drivers necessitate increased control over HSMs and key-management operations.</p>
<p>Once you’ve read the CSA paper and decide you want to use a trusted HSM-as-a-Service provider with 25+ years’ experience and global coverage, I suggest you check out <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/hsm/nshield-as-a-service">Entrust nShield as a Service</a>.</p>

<p>PKI and cryptography are critical components of a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework?edc_sfid=7015Y000003dRWZQA2&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA_5WvBhBAEiwAZtCU78IhLzN7Zgxf6ga0wROR5TnGvrInZctKnGfXrquicZEBwdRyL_gufRoCeq4QAvD_BwE">Zero Trust</a> strategy, driving the use of encryption to keep identities, devices, data, connections, and communications secure. Like many things, increased use of encryption starts with good intentions, but may have unintended consequences. In this case, the proliferation of certificates across the organization may create a management and ownership challenge, adding cyber risk. This is the Zero Trust encryption paradox, which is why two of the critical early steps on an organization’s Zero Trust journey are to identify and inventory all cryptographic assets, followed by establishing clear ownership.</p>
<p>As a clear example, the 2024 State of Zero Trust &amp; Encryption Study sponsored by Entrust highlights how a lack of skilled personnel and no clear ownership makes the management of credentials painful, cited by 50% and 47% of respondents, respectively. And at the same time, 59% of respondents say managing keys has a severe impact on their organizations.</p>
<p>Establishing visibility and clear ownership of cryptographic assets may seem very logical and manageable on the surface, but today’s reality is far more complex. Long gone are the days of a massive Active Directory implementation to service an entirely on-prem certificate authority (CA). Today’s digital ecosystem spans servers, applications, networks, identities, infrastructure, hardware, and endpoints, with some data residing in the cloud and other data on-prem. New use cases continue to add to PKI deployment complexity as more teams use certificates, causing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/sites/default/files/documentation/infographics/state-of-pki-in.pdf">PKI sprawl</a>. As well, in their zeal to implement a Zero Trust strategy, different siloed teams from IT to security to infrastructure and beyond often acquire their own certificate authorities, deploying PKI and certificates without proper governance. In fact, the Entrust study revealed that 37% of organizations polled cited unmanaged certificates as a main area of concern that might result in the exposure of sensitive or confidential data.</p>
 Why an enterprise-wide Zero Trust strategy is critical 
<p>Without an <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/05/the-critical-role-of-clm-for-zero-trust-today-and-pq-tomorrow/">enterprise-wide Zero Trust strategy</a>, this increased use of PKI can actually increase an organization’s vulnerability both today and in the future when planning for PQC migration. Plus, expired certificates can cause significant organization disruption, costing time and money to locate the expired certificate and identify everywhere it was installed.</p>
<p>Today, PKI and cryptographic assets are critical infrastructure, expanding in number, and essential to a Zero Trust strategy. However, it is a false assumption to think that systems will be secured forever with conventional PKI cryptography, and the magnitude of this risk is often unknown because organizations lack enterprise-wide crypto asset visibility. Simply put, you can’t manage what you can’t see. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> (ZTMM) features five pillars underpinned by three core tenets: Visibility and Analytics, Automation and Orchestration, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2024/04/why-zero-trust-is-a-must-for-strong-corporate-governance/">Governance</a>. Visibility in the CISA ZTMM refers to observable artifacts that result from the characteristics of and events within enterprise-wide environments. This focus on cyber-related data analysis helps inform policy decisions, facilitate response activities, and build a proactive security risk profile.</p>
 Essential early steps 
<p>So how do you resolve the Zero Trust encryption paradox? The first step is to establish clear ownership with a team accountable for enterprise-wide Zero Trust and encryption strategy and migration. And it appears more organizations are taking this to heart with dedicated PKI specialists operating under CxO oversight vs. being the domain IT generalists. Next is to inventory data and flows to identify the location of high-value data at rest, in transit, and in use. With ownership and data flows identified, the next step is to inventory the organization’s cryptographic assets, which is usually a combined automated manual effort to identify all keys, certificates, secrets, and libraries. Armed with this information, the dedicated team is now able to draft a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/do-you-have-cryptographic-agility/">crypto-agility</a> strategy. This is a critical milestone in the Zero Trust journey, mitigating the organization’s crypto-related risk – including people, processes, and technology – with built-in capabilities.</p>
<p>And there you have it: An enterprise-wide Zero Trust strategy with clear ownership and crypto asset visibility and agility not only resolves the Zero Trust encryption paradox, but also provides a strong foundation for the next step of your Zero Trust journey.</p>

<p>Cyberattacks were forecast to have cost the global economy <a href="https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/606505844/cybercrime-damages-to-cost-the-world-8-trillion-usd-in-2023">$8 trillion USD</a> in 2023, and this number is forecast to grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025. In many cases, the scale and effectiveness of these attacks are being fueled by artificial intelligence (AI), especially deepfakes. Our Identity Fraud Report 2024 shows a <a href="https://go.entrust.com/identity-fraud-report-2024">31x increase in the volume of deepfake attempts</a> between 2022 and 2023. Facing this intensifying threat landscape, governments and enterprises around the world are scrambling to implement <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework?edc_sfid=7015Y000003dRWZQA2&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA_5WvBhBAEiwAZtCU78IhLzN7Zgxf6ga0wROR5TnGvrInZctKnGfXrquicZEBwdRyL_gufRoCeq4QAvD_BwE">Zero Trust</a> strategies to improve their cyber-risk posture and resilience. As evidence of the importance of Zero Trust to secure the organization, just 18% of respondents in the 2024 State of Zero Trust &amp; Encryption Study sponsored by Entrust say that Zero Trust is not a priority at this time.</p>
<p>While previous Zero Trust journeys may have sputtered due to the limits of existing technology and a rigorous framework, AI is a game changer. On the surface, Zero Trust and AI may appear to be polar-opposite concepts with the former framed by the strict “Never Trust, Always Verify” principle, while the latter is characterized by both the promise and fear of the great unknown. However, much like “opposites attract,” Zero Trust and AI are natural partners.</p>
 An AI-Powered Approach to Zero Trust  
<p>With the biggest challenge to implementing Zero Trust being cited as a lack of in-house expertise (by 47 percent of respondents) in the Entrust report, it becomes apparent that additional resources are needed. Zero Trust demands constant vigilance and that’s where AI’s ability to discover, classify, and process large volumes of distributed data comes in. AI can literally speed up the detection of and response to cyberattacks.</p>
<p>However, bad actors may try to poison or otherwise manipulate the training data to blunt the effectiveness of such AI systems. So, Zero Trust and AI are somewhat akin to the “which came first, the chicken or the egg” metaphor. AI-enhanced visibility and decision-making can increase Zero Trust effectiveness, but Zero Trust is needed to protect the integrity of the data being used to train the AI model.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> (ZTMM) 2.0 foreshadowed this emerging relationship between Zero Trust and AI with a significant focus on the modernization of the Identity and Devices domains to improve an organization’s cyber-risk posture. Some specific examples include:</p>
 
 Identity Verification – Establishing and maintaining trusted identity is a critical component of any Zero Trust strategy, yet this is becoming harder and harder with AI-generated fakes. This is where <a href="https://fintechmagazine.com/fraud-id-verification/entrust-set-to-acquire-onfido">AI-enabled biometric identity verification</a> can help level the playing field to identify deepfakes in real time. 
 <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/iam/capabilities/adaptive-authentication?edc_sfid=7015Y000001zvXAQAY&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI--S5rcCIhQMVHIiuBR164w5AEAAYASAAEgKqnfD_BwE">Adaptive Authentication</a> – AI-enabled authentication can dynamically adjust privileges to respond to real-time risk factors like device reputation, geolocation, and behavioral biometrics. This AI-enabled approach aligns directly with Zero Trust’s “least privilege” construct. 
 Behavioral Analytics and Pattern Recognition – AI models that continuously learn and adapt to emerging patterns are ideal to analyze large volumes of distributed data to flag anomalies and potential threats. With this AI-enabled approach, Zero Trust’s “Never Trust, Always Verify” is more easily attainable. 
 
<p>So, there you have it: Zero Trust and AI are inextricably linked for organizational success and safety. With strict access controls, comprehensive visibility, and continual monitoring, Zero Trust lets organizations take advantage of the power of AI, while also helping to neutralize AI risks.</p>

Verida Missions users can prove ownership of their trading account on Gate, MEXC, Binance, Bybit and KuCoin to earn XP points and participate in the Verida rewards&nbsp;program.</p>Generate proofs for Gate, MEXC, Binance, Bybit and KuCoin centralized exchanges (CEX) with zkPass&nbsp;Protocol<p><a href="https://missions.verida.network/">Visit Verida Missions to get&nbsp;started</a></p> zkPass and Verida are bridging web2 and web3&nbsp;data <p>Enabling users to prove ownership of their verified trading accounts that have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) processes is a powerful demonstration of bridging web2 and web3 data in a privacy preserving manner. The zkPass protocol is used to generate zero-knowledge proofs of web2 data which is stored on Verida’s storage&nbsp;network.</p><p>This collaboration enhances user privacy by allowing decentralized identity and data management without central authorities. Zero-knowledge proofs ensure secure information verification without unnecessary data disclosure. This information can be shared with other applications, entirely off-chain and privately, or it can be shared on the blockchain to interact with smart contracts.</p><p>Together zkPass and Verida are enabling reusable and interoperable verified digital identities. This offers significant reductions in cost and time saving for users and apps looking to onboard verified&nbsp;users.</p> Unlocking web3 mass&nbsp;adoption <p>This integration is a powerful demonstration of using third party verification processes as a sybil resistance measure in web3. If a user has been verified by a centralized exchange there’s strong guarantees you are interacting with a real person. Each verification has an identifier unique to the account number stored on the centralized exchange account. Applications can utilize that unique identifier to ensure someone doesn’t create multiple accounts or claim airdrops multiple times — a significant problem in web3&nbsp;today.</p><p>Beyond sybil resistance, this combination of technology enables lots of other critical use cases that will help drive mainstream adoption of web3 technology into new industries.</p><p>For example:</p>  Proving ownership of real world assets (cash in the bank, house, car) that can then be tokenized  Proving personal healthcare information to access decentralized health insurance  Proving skills and qualifications to become eligible for new jobs in an equitable manner  Proving an incident occurred to make an insurance claim   Future of Privacy-First Technology <p>This “user choice” is a fundamental design of the Verida network and is critical for the next generation of privacy preserving applications that protect user data and give them&nbsp;control.</p><p>“Verida has built a next generation privacy-preserving, decentralized technology stack,” said Chris Were, CEO of Verida. “zkPass’ technology is a powerful addition to the Verida ecosystem.”</p><p><a href="https://missions.verida.network/">Explore the new zkPass Missions on Verida</a> and join the data ownership revolution in&nbsp;web3.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href="http://verida.network">Verida</a> and <a href="https://zkpass.org/">zkPass</a> websites and follow their latest updates on social&nbsp;media.</p><p>Stay tuned for further innovations from Verida and&nbsp;zkPass.</p> About zkPass <p>zkPass is a private data protocol that enables privacy-preserving verification. It primarily employs technologies such as Three-Party TLS (3P-TLS), Multi-party Computation (MPC), and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). It allows the conversion of private data from HTTPS websites into zk proofs without needing API authorization. This approach not only safeguards privacy but also protects against data forgery by malicious actors.</p><p><a href="https://zkpass.org/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/zkPass">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/zkPass">Medium</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/zkpass">Discord</a></p> About Verida <p>The <a href="http://verida.io/">Verida Wallet</a> is a self-custody web3 mobile wallet and a gateway for decentralized identities.

Podium Introduction <p>Participants in the “Google Trends” Data Challenge analyzed the influence of public search interest on cryptocurrency market prices. The challenge required a detailed analysis of Google Trends data, integration of additional data sources, and the application of advanced ML methods to predict market behaviors. Essential tasks included conducting exploratory data analyses (EDA), identifying correlations, and investigating how historical and current trends could forecast future market movements.</p><p>Data scientists across various expertise levels engaged in this challenge to determine Google Trends’ impact on cryptocurrency valuations. They examined data from the past and present to predict future trends and built models that could potentially guide real-world investment decisions. This competition highlighted the power of Google Trends data in predicting cryptocurrency markets and showcased the importance of combining various data sources to strengthen financial models.</p><p>The winners of the challenge, through their exceptional skills in interpreting complex datasets and developing predictive models, have not only enhanced their technical skills but also contributed significantly to advancing data-driven financial analysis in the cryptocurrency field. Their models offer insights that could influence investment strategies in the dynamic cryptocurrency market, inspiring others to follow in their footsteps.</p> Podium and Top-10 Submissions <p>The top submissions of this challenge were exceptional. Participants demonstrated outstanding abilities in utilizing ML and data analysis to probe and predict movements within the cryptocurrency market. Let’s explore the top three submissions that stood out due to their thorough analytics and insightful conclusions.</p>Top 10 1st Place:&nbsp;Anamaria <p>Anamaria secured first place in the “Google Trends” Data Challenge by applying advanced ML techniques to analyze the correlation between Google Trends data and cryptocurrency prices. Her analytical framework led to precise findings on the predictive nature of search data on cryptocurrency values. [<a href="https://bit.ly/google_trends_anamaria">Click here to see the&nbsp;report</a>]</p><p>In her analysis, Anamaria integrated data and preparation process culminated in a comprehensive analysis of multiple cryptocurrency trends from 2019 to 2024. She found that Google Trends data had a measurable impact on cryptocurrency prices, with a correlation coefficient often exceeding 0.5. This indicates a moderate to strong positive relationship, suggesting that changes in search interest could potentially lead to significant price movements. Her model highlighted that significant spikes in search volumes, especially noted in 2021, preceded price increases in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In 2021 alone, during the peak interest phase, her analysis directly correlated with the highest market prices observed during that&nbsp;year.</p><p>Anamaria’s findings, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.53, mean squared error (MSE) of 28.47, and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 5.34, have significant implications for investors and market analysts. Her research suggests that monitoring search trend spikes could provide a strategic advantage in predicting market movements, a practical application that can guide investment strategies in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.</p><p>2nd Place: Ekpenyong</p><p>Ekpenyong earned second place in the Data Challenge with his detailed statistical analysis of the relationship between Google Trends data and cryptocurrency prices. His project employed rigorous statistical methods to uncover significant insights about market dynamics. [<a href="https://bit.ly/google_trends_ekpenyong">Click here to see the&nbsp;report</a>]</p><p>He used the Jarque-Bera test to check for normality in his analysis, revealing that cryptocurrency prices and Google Trends data were non-normally distributed with p-values less than 0.05. He also applied the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, confirming non-stationarity in the time series data for both prices and trends. This non-stationarity was further validated by the Phillips-Perron and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests, showing unit roots and time-varying statistical properties. These findings indicated that advanced models like Neural Networks were more suitable for his analysis due to their ability to handle non-stationary data.</p><p>Ekpenyong’s correlation analysis, using Spearman and Pearson coefficients, showed strong positive correlations between search trends and cryptocurrency prices for significant tokens. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibited correlation coefficients of 0.75 and 0.68, respectively. His Granger causality tests revealed significant bidirectional relationships for several cryptocurrencies, including Fetch.ai and Monero, with p-values less than 0.05, indicating that search interest could predict price changes and vice versa. Okpo also conducted an optimal lag analysis, finding that a one-week lag often provided the highest correlation, with Fetch.ai showing a correlation coefficient of 0.84 at a two-week&nbsp;lag.</p><p>3rd Place:&nbsp;Ahan</p><p>Ahan secured third place in the Data Challenge with his rigorous analysis of the correlation between Google Trends data and cryptocurrency prices, focusing on various market capitalizations. His project involved detailed statistical examination and predictive modeling to uncover critical insights. [<a href="https://bit.ly/google_trends_ahan">Click here to see the&nbsp;report</a>]</p><p>He categorized cryptocurrencies into large, mid, and small-cap based on market capitalization, analyzing top assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. His exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed that Bitcoin showed a 1200% increase in Google search interest from 2016 to 2017, correlating with a price surge from $1,000 to nearly $20,000. Similarly, from 2020 to 2021, Bitcoin’s search interest grew by 150%, with prices rising from approximately $7,200 to over $64,000. Ethereum showed a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.28, indicating that about 7.84% of its price variability could be explained by changes in Google search trends, particularly around significant network upgrades and DeFi activities.</p><p>Ahan’s analysis extended to the correlation and time-lagged impact of search trends on prices. He found that Dogecoin exhibited a high correlation coefficient of 0.59, suggesting that 34.81% of its price movements were linked to changes in Google Trends data. His time-lag analysis showed that Bitcoin’s price had an optimal correlation of 0.34 with a one-day lag, explaining about 11.56% of the price variability. In contrast, Ethereum’s optimal lag was seven days with a correlation of 0.48, accounting for 23.04% of price movements. On the other hand, Dogecoin had a significant correlation of 0.65 with a one-day lag, explaining 42.25% of its price variability, highlighting its sensitivity to social media and public sentiment.</p> Interesting Facts <p>High Correlation Between Search Interest and Dogecoin Price Movements</p><p>Dogecoin’s price movements show a high correlation coefficient of approximately 0.59 with Google search trends. This indicates that 34.81% of Dogecoin’s price variability is directly influenced by changes in search interest, highlighting the strong impact of public sentiment on this cryptocurrency.</p><p>Optimal Time Lags for Predicting Bitcoin&nbsp;Prices</p><p>Analysis revealed that Bitcoin’s price had an optimal correlation of 0.34 with Google Trends data at a 1-day lag. This correlation explains 11.56% of the price variability, suggesting that Bitcoin’s market reacts quickly to changes in public interest.</p><p>Significant Increase in Bitcoin Search Interest During Bull&nbsp;Markets</p><p>From 2020 to 2021, Google search interest in Bitcoin increased by approximately 150%, correlating with a price rise from around $7,200 to over $64,000. This surge in interest and price underscores the strong relationship between public attention and market performance during bull&nbsp;runs.</p><p>ARIMA Model Predictive Accuracy for Cryptocurrency Prices</p><p>An ARIMA model used to predict cryptocurrency prices based on Google Trends data showed substantial accuracy, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.53, mean squared error (MSE) of 28.47, and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 5.34. This demonstrates the model’s effectiveness in capturing the relationship between search trends and market&nbsp;prices.</p><p>Volatility and Search Trends in Smaller Market Cap Cryptocurrencies</p><p>Emerging cryptocurrencies like Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET exhibited strong correlations with Google search trends, especially within a week of changes in search behavior. This suggests that smaller market-cap cryptocurrencies are highly sensitive to public interest, with search trends as a predictive tool for price movements.</p> 2024 Championship <p>Each challenge features a prize pool of $10,000, distributed among the top 10 participants. Our championship points system distributes 100 points across the top 10 finishers in each challenge, with each point valued at&nbsp;$100.</p><p>Contestants accumulate points toward the 2024 Championship by participating in challenges.

<p>As our network evolves, maintaining its integrity and efficiency becomes increasingly vital.&nbsp;</p><p>To this end, we are excited to introduce <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/referenda/10?ref=blog.dock.io">two new significant governance proposals</a> to enhance the transparency of Council membership and the efficiency of transaction fees.</p><p>In summary:</p>  We propose to reduce our length fee from 0.01 to 0.0001 tokens per byte to ensure that transactions and network upgrades become more cost-effective for our users.  We propose that all council members have verified identities to reduce spam generated by anonymous members and to promote greater accountability and trust within our governance structure.  <p>Below, we will delve into the details of these proposals and explain their rationale and anticipated impact on our community and network.</p> Reducing Transaction Fees for a More Efficient Network <p></p><p>Transaction fees on the Dock network depend on several factors, including the transaction's byte size, the amount of storage read or written, and the compute resources required.</p><p>Currently the network charges 0.01 tokens per byte of transaction, which we call the “length-fee”. For instance, if your transaction is 1000 bytes, the length-fee alone contributes 10 tokens (1000 * 0.01).&nbsp;</p><p>We recognize that our length fee is significantly higher than that of some networks in the Polkadot ecosystem, such as KILT, Moonbeam or Centrifuge.</p><p>To address this, we are reducing the length fee by 100 times, bringing it down to 0.0001 tokens per byte.</p><p>Here are examples of how this change will affect popular transactions:</p>  Transfer transactions will cost 1.3 tokens instead of 1.8 tokens.  Creating DIDs will cost 2.75 tokens instead of 4.5 tokens.  Revocation (status lists) will cost 2.9 tokens instead of 10.8 tokens.  <p>Additionally, network upgrades will also become much cheaper, as their costs are primarily driven by their large size.</p><p>We believe this will ensure Dock’s network fees remain very competitive and entice more and more organizations to our platform.&nbsp;</p><p>You can vote on this proposal <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/referenda/10?ref=blog.dock.io">here</a>.</p> Introducing Verified Identities for Council Membership <p></p><p>Currently, anyone can become a Council member by locking a certain amount of tokens and submitting their candidacy.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we’ve witnessed a recent increase in spam made by anonymous members, including a failed attempt by a Validator to become elected so they could pay themselves additional treasury rewards.</p><p>To dissuade future scam attempts, we propose that all Council members must have a verified identity, indicated by a green checkmark.&nbsp;</p><p>This new requirement ensures transparency and accountability within the Council.</p><p>Prospective members must set up their identities and request verification before submitting their candidacy for Council membership. Once verified, they can proceed to submit their candidacy.</p><p>Learn more about setting up an identity <a href="https://docs.dock.io/open-source-community/blockchain-validators/identity-setup?ref=blog.dock.io">here</a>.</p><p>Vote on this governance proposal <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/referenda/10?ref=blog.dock.io">here</a>.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Identity security is at a crossroads. As digital transformation accelerates, organizations are increasingly vulnerable to identity-focused attacks, which are now the primary entry point for cybercriminals. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into the attacker’s arsenal ups the stakes even higher. Cybercriminals recently stole $25 million from a multinational finance firm in a single stroke by impersonating executives using deepfake video and audio.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With security teams grappling with unprecedented demands, we’ve expanded our seminal State of Passwordless annual report to encompass the broader identity security field. Now titled <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">State of Passwordless Identity Assurance</a>, this fourth edition investigates current and emerging identity threats to organizations, their security perspectives and practices, and greatest areas of vulnerability. Conducted by HYPR and Vanson Bourne, the report is based on interviews with 750 IT/IS decision makers, representing a cross-section of industries across the globe. The results expose the gap between evolving threats and outdated identity models, and the extent that this undermines global security and business growth.</p> 
 Key Findings  
  
  Widespread Vulnerabilities: 91% of breached organizations cited credential misuse as a critical failure point.  
  Financial Impacts: The average cost of authentication-related breaches reached a staggering $5.48 million and identity fraud costs a further $2.78 million.  
  Adoption Challenges: Despite the clear benefits, the shift towards more secure passwordless methods like passkeys is slow, hindered by implementation complexities and costs.  
  
 Threat Trends  
<p>Our research reveals&nbsp; an unsettling rise in identity theft and fraud, driven by the availability of compromised credentials and sophisticated phishing schemes. Nearly all (99%) surveyed organizations faced some kind of attack over the past 12 months and almost eight in ten (78%) were targeted by identity-based attacks.</p> 
<p>Not surprisingly, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-phishing-prevention">phishing</a> and malware are the most prevalent. Push notification attacks, also called <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">MFA-prompt bombing</a>, continue to be a favorite technique of modern hacking groups. Toward the bottom of the list just two years ago, push attacks figure prominently in many recent high-profile attacks including the widespread campaign against Apple users last month.</p> 
 Types of cyberattacks faced in the last 12 months  
<p></p> 
 The Widespread Impact of Identity Breaches  
<p>The consequences of identity security breaches are significant. A staggering 84% of organizations that experienced a cyberattack subsequently suffered a breach, with 62% experiencing multiple breaches. For those organizations that were breached, 91% blame authentication weaknesses and the misuse of credentials for one or more breaches, a notable increase from 82% the previous year.</p> 
<p>These breaches not only carry significant financial burdens — with costs averaging $5.48 million — but also lead to customer loss, reputational damage, and substantial fines.</p>

<p>In a hybrid world that blends on-premises and cloud-based resources, securing access to sensitive data and systems is no longer achieved by defending a perimeter, but through authentication. While authentication technologies have evolved over the past decades from their humble password origins, preventing unauthorized access still hinges on choosing and implementing the right identity-based controls.<br>
This involves navigating a landscape where knowledge-based, possession-based, biometric, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods offer a variety of advantages and limitations. Let’s consider each of the options available to organizations and how to select the right mix of controls to improve their security posture.</p>
 Knowledge-Based Authentication 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA), which encompasses passwords and PINs, is the most traditional form of authentication. Its widespread adoption and user familiarity make it a convenient starting point for many security protocols. However, its susceptibility to social engineering, phishing attacks, and the perennial issue of weak password creation by users necessitate a cautious approach. For environments where ease of use is paramount and risk levels are comparatively low, KBA can serve as a component of a more comprehensive security strategy, particularly when augmented with additional authentication factors.<br>
Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is best suited for environments with comparatively low risk levels, where ease of use is paramount and the accessed information is not highly sensitive or critical. It can serve as a supplementary authentication factor in conjunction with other methods, such as biometric or device-based authentication. Examples include accessing non-critical information, utilizing KBA alongside other authentication methods as a first factor, and implementing it in public Wi-Fi hotspots for streamlined user access without compromising security.</p>
 Possession-Based Authentication 
<p>Possession-based authentication methods require users to have a physical object, such as a security token or a mobile device, to gain access. This approach adds a tangible layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access without physical possession of the required object. It’s particularly effective in scenarios where additional security is needed without significantly complicating the user experience, such as in financial transactions or access to high-security areas. However, the risk of loss or theft and the potential cost implications of deploying hardware devices must be considered.<br>
Possession-based authentication methods offer heightened security measures for a range of scenarios, including financial transactions, remote work access, secure online transactions, and compliance-driven environments like legal and government agencies. In online banking, users require physical possession of a security token or mobile device to access their accounts securely. Similarly, in remote work settings, this method ensures that only authorized employees with designated devices can connect to corporate networks and sensitive data, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access. Additionally, in e-commerce platforms and online payment systems, possession-based authentication enhances transaction security, reducing the risk of fraud and protecting sensitive financial information. Furthermore, compliance-driven industries can benefit from this approach to meet regulatory obligations and safeguard confidential information.</p>
 Biometrics 
<p>Biometric authentication offers a high-security level by utilizing unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. This method is highly resistant to traditional hacking attempts and provides a seamless user experience. It is well-suited for environments where security cannot be compromised, such as in government or healthcare settings. Nevertheless, concerns around privacy, the potential for spoofing, and the need for compatible hardware investments can pose challenges. Organizations must weigh these factors against the critical need for secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.<br>
Biometric authentication, which leverages unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, is ideal for various high-security environments. It is best suited for secure access to sensitive data and fortifying high-risk online systems. Despite its advantages, organizations must consider privacy concerns, potential spoofing, and compatible hardware investments when deploying biometric authentication systems.</p>
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>MFA combines two or more authentication methods listed above to create a layered security approach, significantly enhancing protection against various threats. By integrating knowledge, possession, and biometric factors, MFA creates a dynamic defense mechanism that is much harder for attackers to bypass. This method is ideal for protecting sensitive data and critical systems, offering a balanced solution that addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in single-method authentication systems. While MFA introduces complexity and potential user resistance, its ability to significantly reduce security risks makes it a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategies.<br>
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a versatile security method that finds applications across industries, serving to protect sensitive data and critical systems. More commonly, MFA is required to ensure secure access to corporate systems from outside the office, and in e-commerce platforms to safeguard customer accounts and high-risk customer and citizen transactions. Overall, MFA provides a defense mechanism against various threats, combining multiple authentication factors to significantly enhance security and mitigate risks inherent in single-method authentication systems.</p>
 Passwordless 
<p>Passwordless authentication represents a significant leap forward in cybersecurity, eliminating the vulnerabilities associated with traditional knowledge-based methods. The majority of authentication methods included in the above still require a user name AND password as a first step in authenticating users. But, by leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a user-friendly and highly secure alternative that reduces the risk of phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This method is particularly advantageous in creating a seamless user experience without compromising security, and ideal for environments aiming to minimize friction while maintaining high security standards. Organizations looking to bolster access security while enhancing user satisfaction should consider integrating passwordless authentication into their strategic security framework, offering an optimal balance between ease of use and robust protection.<br>
Organizations across diverse sectors, particularly those looking for a better, more secure user experience, should carefully consider integrating passwordless authentication into their security frameworks. By leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a robust and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based methods, effectively mitigating the risks associated with phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This approach not only enhances security posture but also fosters a seamless and efficient user experience, aligning with the modern landscape of digital operations where stringent security measures and user satisfaction are paramount.</p>
 Choosing the Right Strategy 
<p>The choice of authentication method should be driven by an organization’s specific needs, considering factors such as the sensitivity of the data, user experience requirements, and regulatory compliance mandates. Here are four key considerations for selecting the appropriate authentication method:</p>
 
 Risk Assessment: Evaluate the level of security risk associated with the data or systems being protected. Higher risk scenarios may warrant more stringent authentication methods, such as biometric or MFA. 
 User Experience: Consider the impact on the user. While security is paramount, overly cumbersome authentication processes can lead to poor compliance and user frustration. 
 Cost and Infrastructure: Assess the financial and infrastructure implications of deploying new authentication technologies. While advanced methods like biometric authentication offer enhanced security, they also come with higher implementation costs. 
 Compliance Requirements: Ensure that the chosen authentication method aligns with industry regulations and standards, which may dictate specific security measures. 
 
<p>Defending against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats requires understanding the unique advantages and limitations of available authentication methods, and selecting the controls that are best aligned with organizational needs and user expectations. Using the methods described above can help define an authentication strategy that ensures security measures remain robust, responsive, and user-friendly.</p>

  The minimum threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in Switzerland is transactions over 1,000&nbsp;CHF.  VASPs must obtain and transmit originator and beneficiary information.  Originator info required includes name, account/transaction number, and address or ID&nbsp;details.  <p>Switzerland, a Central European country, has a crypto-enthusiastic population. According to Statista, the number of people <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1202468/global-cryptocurrency-ownership/">who own or use cryptocurrencies reached 21% in 2023</a>, up from 10% in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>Switzerland’s clear regulatory environment, focus on innovation, and economic factors also helped it bag the second spot on the Henley &amp; Partners Crypto Adoption Index with a score of&nbsp;46.9%.</p><p>When it comes to regulation, the European banking hub requires the country’s crypto sector to comply with its strict standards, which include <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a>, to ensure transparency, financial stability, and customer security.</p> Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in Switzerland <p>In 2019, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA in short, <a href="https://www.finma.ch/en/~/media/finma/dokumente/dokumentencenter/myfinma/4dokumentation/finma-aufsichtsmitteilungen/20190826-finma-aufsichtsmitteilung-02-2019.pdf?la=en">published guidance</a> covering the FATF Travel Rule. With the latest update to the FINMA-AMLO legislation (Article 10), FINMA approved the text requiring the transmission of information on the originator and beneficiary customer along with payment orders. With this, the Crypto Travel Rule came into effect in Switzerland in&nbsp;2020.</p> Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>According to FINMA guidance, the AML Act has always applied to all blockchain service providers (VASPs), including exchanges, trading platforms, and wallets. The regulator believes the blockchain’s inherent anonymity presents increased risks, requiring existing rules on combating money laundering and terrorist financing to apply to blockchain and crypto service providers.</p><p>FINMA mandates that organizations register with the regulator,<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it"> implement Know Your Customer (KYC) processes</a>, conduct extensive customer due diligence (CDD), and follow strict reporting guidelines. Providers must verify their customers’ identities, establish the identity of the beneficial owner, and take a risk-based approach to monitoring business relationships. If there is reasonable suspicion of illegal behavior, such as money laundering, providers must report to the Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland (MROS).</p><p>The basic idea here is to “make it more difficult for sanctioned persons or states to act anonymously in the payment transaction system.”</p> Compliance Requirements <p>In Switzerland, the FATF Travel Rule applies to transactions over $1,000 (1,000 CHF), down from $5,000 (5,000 CHF) after an amendment to FINMA’s AML Ordinance in Feb.&nbsp;2020.</p><p>For the originator, the following information must be collected and verified:</p>  Name  Account number or unique transaction reference number  The physical address, date and place of birth, client identification number, or national ID&nbsp;number  <p>For the beneficiary, the following information must be collected:</p>  Name  Account number or unique transaction reference number  <p>The originating VASP must ensure the originator information is complete and accurate and that the beneficiary information is complete. All information should be provided to the counterparty or authorities upon&nbsp;request.</p><p>For domestic transactions, the originating VASP can provide only the originator’s name and transaction reference number as long as it can submit additional information to the beneficiary VASP and authorities within three working&nbsp;days.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>A VASP, as per the Anti Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO), is considered to be operating professionally if any of the following applies:</p><p>- Performing transactions worth more than CHF 2 million per&nbsp;year;</p><p>- Achieving a gross revenue of over CHF 50,000 in a calendar&nbsp;year;</p><p>- Unlimited control of third-party funds surpassing CHF 5 million&nbsp;or</p><p>- Have business relationships with over 20 contractual parties in a calendar&nbsp;year.</p><p>Now, under FINMA’s AML Act, financial intermediaries are required to obtain a license from the regulator. Different types of crypto licenses available include Exchange licenses, Fintech licenses, Investment fund licenses, and Banking licenses.</p><p>Some trading activities require ongoing monitoring by FINMA, which also applies to those who keep crypto from customers in “wallets” and manage accounts.</p><p>FINMA’s Crypto Travel Rule guidance further applies to non-custodial wallets, self-hosted wallets, or, as FINMA states, external wallets. As per this, VASPs are required to prove the ownership of these wallets when transacting with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Only after the identity of the wallet owner is verified, the beneficial owner’s identity is established, and address ownership is proved via ‘suitable technical means’ that the VASP is to transact with these external or self-hosted wallets.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Virtualassets/VACG-Snapshot-Jurisdictions.html">FATF’s latest report revealed</a> that Switzerland is “Largely Complaint” when it comes to the adoption of the Crypto Travel Rule, like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-germany">Germany</a>, France, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-canada">Canada</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-regulations-in-the-united-kingdom-a-comprehensive-analysis">the UK</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">the&nbsp;US</a>.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Switzerland, one of the top 10 economies by GDP per capita ranking, has been seeing a lot of digital innovation thanks to its clear and proactive regulations.

				  Passwordless login isn’t new, but, with the constant increase in data breaches from identity fraud, it is now a necessity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The problems with passwords</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/resources/top-password-strengths-and-vulnerabilities">Thirty-percent of users have experienced a security breach due to weak passwords</a> and <a href="https://cms9files.revize.com/martincountymn/Internal/Cyber%20Security/Ransomware_and_Passwords.pdf">81% of hacking-related breaches</a> take advantage of stolen or weak passwords. We know that the username and password method of authentication has been flawed for years and cannot be fixed; and yet, it is still the most common way to access accounts online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that there has not been an efficient way to create and secure a user’s account at the point of creation. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) practices are done to set up a bank account, but they can vary by organization and by area. Once this information has been collected, and an account has been set up, the easiest way that organizations control access is through a username and password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many organizations have chosen to continue using password security with multi-factor authentication (MFA). — While this offers improved security, MFA is now under stress from <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/cyberattackers-double-down-bypassing-mfa">attackers who have found ways to bypass it</a>. MFA also requires additional effort from end users who have become accustomed to less friction in digital interaction, and as a result it is struggling with adoption and user fatigue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But MFA simply underscores the problem of passwords in general: People hate them. First, we all have too many — one 2023 study found that the average person has <a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person">100 passwords</a>. — Second, if they are easy to remember, they are easy to fake; and if they are hard to fake, they are hard to remember. Given all this, <a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/resources/top-password-strengths-and-vulnerabilities">45.7% of people admit to re-using passwords</a> across multiple websites or accounts, making them even more insecure and dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s time to overhaul the system. With verifiable credential technology financial institutions do their initial KYC and issue their customers a verifiable account credential. Authentication and access is managed by cryptography, meaning that when the account holder presents their credential for login to their account, the bank instantly verifies that they are an account holder (the account holder also instantly verifies that they are interacting with their bank). No logins or passwords or MFA is needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outcome of safer login methods</p>
<p>By removing passwords, your team becomes much more resilient toward phishing attacks, which is where a bad actor will try to get an unsuspecting person to share their login credentials by posing as a trusted party. Because of their decentralized nature, verifiable credentials cannot be lost, stolen, or copied, so you can be confident that the person presenting the credential is the person who should have it.</p>
<p>You will also see an increase in efficiency once passwords are removed. Employees spend <a href="https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/article/business-reporter/how-much-time-and-money-does-your-organization-spend-on-managing-passwords">11 hours per year</a> on average remembering or resetting passwords, which doesn’t sound like too much, but for an organization of 15,000 could be costing as much as <a href="https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/article/business-reporter/how-much-time-and-money-does-your-organization-spend-on-managing-passwords">$5.2 million</a> in lost productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better efficiency doesn’t just mean less money lost and more productive employees, the customer experience also improves. <a href="https://worldretailbankingreport.com/resources/baas-platform-model-is-the-way-forward/">44% of consumers</a> reported facing medium to high friction when engaging with their digital banking platform. This means that almost half of people trying to access online banking have some form of difficulty. Simple, quick authentication processes will make your organization stand out, keep your customers happy, and keep them coming back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passwordless login is the future of online interaction. To see an example of how this technology will soon allow you to interact with your financial institution you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMZlop-TvnQ&amp;t=61s&amp;ab_channel=Indicio">see a demonstration here.</a></p>

Introduction <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. We developed tools for “predictoors” running simulations of their predictoor bots to test parameters. The simulations can now display visualizations in the browser using <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">Dash</a> to show bot accuracy, profit, and more. An example screen shot of some (but not all) Dash visualizations is shown&nbsp;below:</p>These simulation plots include the profits for both Predictoor bots &amp; Trader bots and Predictoor bot accuracy. The screenshots later in the blogpost show all other plots generated by&nbsp;Dash. 2. Evolution of Simulator Visualization  2.1 Before: Matplotlib <p>Originally, we used <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> to generate visualizations of simulation analytics. Why plot simulations? Plots give way more insight into simulation performance than just console log output. Why matplotlib? Matplotlib is Python library &amp; has good documentation, so we could rapidly develop visualizations. Plus, our users are all data scientists operating in Python. But, there were problems.</p> 2.2 Limitations of Matplotlib <p>Despite its initial benefits, matplotlib posed several challenges:</p>  It occupied the entire screen and disrupted other&nbsp;tasks.  Once closed, these plots could not be accessed&nbsp;again.  The interactive features were basic, limiting detailed data exploration.  It was only usable&nbsp;locally.   2.3 Then: Better Data Management, and Streamlit <p>We improved our data management. Before, data for plots was stored in memory only. So we refactored the code to store the plots on disk, via Python pickling.</p><p>Then we tried out <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>, using the updated data management. It overcame the matplotlib limitations above, except that interactivity was still&nbsp;weak.</p> 2.4 Finally: Moving to Plotly/Dash <p>So we tried <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">Plotly/Dash</a>: plotly for the core plots, Dash for the webapp. It quickly became clear that it met our needs, including interactivity. It&nbsp;offers:</p>  Advanced interactive elements for detailed data analysis.  Web-based plots that are accessible anytime and can be shared&nbsp;easily.  Compatibility with Python, allowing us to maintain rapid development.   3. Running Simulation &amp;&nbsp;Plots <p>This section walks through how to run simulation and get live plots in a&nbsp;webapp.</p><p>First, begin by following the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">Predictoor bot README</a>’s instructions to install the pdr-backend code, and set simulation parameters in my_ppss.yaml.</p><p>Then, kick off a simulation using this CLI&nbsp;command:</p> pdr sim my_ppss.yaml <p>Then, open a new terminal and get simulator plots&nbsp;going:</p> # prep<br>cd ~/code/pdr-backend # or wherever your pdr-backend dir is<br>source venv/bin/activate  # start the plots server<br>pdr sim_plots <p>The plots server will give a url, such as <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8050/">http://127.0.0.1:8050</a>. Developers can open that url in their browser to see plots update in real&nbsp;time.</p><p>Below are screenshots of the nine simulation plots currently output by Dash. We will walk through the meanings of each plot for a Logistic Regression model&nbsp;example.</p> 4. Worked Example to Interpret Plots <p>This section is a walk-through on a simple AI model (logistic regression) to predict ETH price on&nbsp;Binance.</p> 4.0 Parameter Setup <p>Here is our parameter setup, via my_ppss.yaml.</p>  “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">Logistic regression</a>” is a linear model for classification (up vs&nbsp;down).  For our example, the model predicts ETH-USDT 5m candle up/down predictions by using 5000 5m candles of training data for ETH-USDT and ETH-USDT leading up to May 9,&nbsp;2024.  The model makes <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor-introducing-two-sided-prediction-bots-66bbbb53be1b?postPublishedType=repub">two-sided predictions</a>. That is, it predicts both UP and DOWN probabilities each epoch. The predictoor stakes 100 OCEAN per epoch (candle). So if the model says a 60% probability of UP, it stakes 60 OCEAN for the UP prediction and 40 for&nbsp;DOWN.  The total staked by all other Predictoors predicting the same pairs is 10,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  The simulation also includes trader parameters. Traders start with 100,000 USDT and 2 ETH and buy 100 USD per&nbsp;epoch.  Traders have a 0% trading fee in simulation and can have up to 3 open positions at a&nbsp;time.   4.1 Predictoor Profit Vs.&nbsp;Time <p>The predictoor profit plot is the first Dash plot displayed. It updates live with each iteration of the simulation. The x-axis shows time in 5min candle intervals, and the y-axis shows a positive and increasing trend of expected predictoor profit for the input simulation parameters. So far, so&nbsp;good.</p> 4.2 Trader Profit Vs.&nbsp;Time <p>While <a href="https://docs.predictoor.ai">Predictoors earn OCEAN</a> for each accurate prediction, traders earn OCEAN by buying / selling on predictions with an automated trading&nbsp;bot.</p><p>The plot below is trader profit vs. time. We can see that over this time interval, the trader has actually lost money. Yet we know from accuracy vs time plot (further below) that accuracy is &gt;50%. What’s going&nbsp;on?</p><p>The simple answer is: on average it loses more $ when it’s wrong, compared to making $ when it’s&nbsp;right.</p><p>What are ways to actually make $? Well, this is the essence of trading! Possibilities include: have higher accuracy; use the AI model’s probability information better to bound the up/down bet size; and more sophisticated strategies like magnitude of price changes, applying triple barrier method,&nbsp;etc.</p> 4.3 Accuracy vs. Time, With Confidence Intervals <p>Predictoor’s accuracy vs. time for ETH-USDT predictions is visualized below. It also shows confidence intervals (CIs). Average accuracy is 50.66%. The blue shadow indicates 95% confidence intervals, i.e. there’s a 95% chance that the true accuracy is within the bounds given by the shadow. The CI width narrows over time as the model makes more predictions.</p><p>While the Predictoor bot would make more money if its stake was higher relative to those of other Predictoors, the simulated gains are healthy when accuracy is&nbsp;&gt;50%.</p> 4.4 Predictoor Profit Distribution <p>Predictoor profit is displayed with two lines in the plot below: one as a function that the probability that a cryptocurrency price will go UP in the next 5min and the other probability that the price will go DOWN. These lines appear to be inverses of each other because the Predictoor parameters are making two-sided predictions. You can see that Predictoor profit distribution averages at 0.46 OCEAN per iteration, therefore since profit is positive, across 3250 iterations, (0.46*3250 OCEAN) = 1495 OCEAN profit, very similar to what the first plot shows except for the rounding for significant digits.</p> 4.5 Trader Profit Distribution <p>This plot shows that as the logistic regression model’s prediction probabilities become more certain (as they near 0 or 1 for the likelihood of prices going UP), then the trader bot’s gains &amp; losses become larger. Conversely, notice how around 50% the trader bot does not profit or lose much because the bets are net neutral. At the top of plot, the trader’s profit distribution average shows -$0.01 USD, which equates to -$33 USD over the approximately 3,300 iterations since the simulation started and matches the plot in section&nbsp;4.2.</p> 4.6 Variable Importances <p>The variable importances bar plot shows which tokens’ historical data the model’s prediction accuracy the most. ETH-USDT historical data affects accuracy the most; the most recent candle (t-1) has the biggest impact, and second-most-recent has second-biggest impact (t-2). This finding makes sense as looking back 1 candle’s price is most probably closer to the next candle’s price than that of 2 candles prior (see <a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/Martingales.html">Martingale Process</a>). BTC-USDT training data at the same # of look backs also has a decent amount of impact. Of course, the sum of the relative importances is&nbsp;100%.</p> 4.7 Model Response Surface (Contour&nbsp;Plot) <p>This contour plot shows how the model’s probability of up-vs-down changes as a function of the most important variables. Darker blue or darker red means higher probability of UP or down respectively.</p><p>Contour plot&nbsp;details:</p>  The x-axis of this plot is the most important variable (ETH-USDT at t-1). The y-axis is the second-most important variable (ETH-USDT at t-2). The z-axis (looking up) is the model’s response to these two variables, with the other two variables (BTC-USDT at t-1, t-2) fixed at their most recent&nbsp;value.  The white region is equal probability of UP vs down. Darker blue means higher probability UP. Darker red means higher probability DOWN.  <p>There are no curved lines because the underlying model is linear and there is no calibration. A nonlinear model or calibration make the responses nonlinear.</p><p>Scatter plot details. The plot brings additional information via scatter plot points, to show how well the model fits the training data. Blue points are for measured UP, and the model returned UP as well. Red points are for measured DOWN, and the model returned DOWN as well (correct). Yellow points are when the model got it&nbsp;wrong.</p> 4.8 Classifier metrics: f1/recall/precision <p>Earlier, we showed the plot for classifier accuracy vs. time. But accuracy doesn’t capture the full picture. Recall, precision, and f1-score help a&nbsp;lot:</p>  Recall: of all the actual “up”, how often did the model catch&nbsp;it?  Precision: of all the predicted “up”, how often was it&nbsp;right?  f1-score: geometric mean of ^ (perfect = 1 for&nbsp;each)  <p>The plot below shows all three. The Appendix below elaborates on recall, precision, and f1-score.</p> 4.9 Classifier Metrics: Log Loss vs.&nbsp;Time <p>Log loss captures another aspect of classifier performance. It accounts for how confident the model thought it was, rather than simply being correct vs wrong (like accuracy does). The ideal log loss is 0, which would indicate perfect predictions with 100% confidence in the correct outcome every&nbsp;time.</p><p>A log loss of 1.0084 suggests that, on average, the model is making predictions that are significantly incorrect or it is highly confident in incorrect predictions. The logarithmic nature of the penalty in the log loss formula means that being wrong with high confidence results in a much larger penalty. The appendix has&nbsp;details.</p> 4.10 Discussion: Opportunities for Improvement <p>Here are example opportunities to improve the model. (There are more beyond&nbsp;this.)</p>  Enhancing Data Quality: More or better quality data might improve the model’s accuracy.  Calibrating Classification: Removing noisy or irrelevant data can help increase both precision and&nbsp;recall.  Model Tuning: Adjusting model parameters or trying different algorithms might yield better&nbsp;results.   5. Conclusion <p>This post describes how we’ve improved the visualizations for Ocean Predictoor’s simulator by migrating from Matplotlib to Plotly/Dash.</p><p>It then proceeds to do walk-through of each of the plots, from predictoor/trader profit vs time to variable importance bar plots and model response contour&nbsp;plots.</p> Appendix 1: Precision, Recall, and&nbsp;f1-score <p>Precision is the model’s ability to determine that the positives caught are correct. In the plot shown, precision is moderate at 0.5076, reflecting a balance of about being correct half the time between avoiding false positives but missing true positives.</p><p>Function Recall is the model’s ability to identify true positives of predictions (e.g., all instances where the model should predict an upward movement in cryptocurrency prices correctly). A function recall of 0.3892 shows that a significant number of positives are missed since the recall is relatively low, out of&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>What is F1 score? The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, making it a balanced metric that considers both the precision and recall of a predictive model. It is particularly useful when the costs of false positives and false negatives are different, or when the class distribution is imbalanced.</p><p>The F1 score is defined&nbsp;as:</p><p>An F1 Score = 0.4406 suggests a moderate balance between precision and recall but also indicates there’s room for improvement, as the score is not very close to 1.0 (the best possible F1&nbsp;score).</p><p>Costs Associated with model performance of an F1 Score&nbsp;&lt;50%:</p><p>The F1 score calculates where both false positives and false negatives carry a cost. Inaccuracies (false positives and false negatives) can lead to poor prediction &amp; trading decisions. For example, false positives might lead to predicting/buying assets that do not increase in value, resulting in losses. False negatives might mean missing out on profitable buying opportunities.</p> Appendix 2: Log Loss&nbsp;Details <p>What is log loss? Also known as logistic loss, calculates the accuracy of classifiers. It is particularly relevant for models where predictions are probabilistic, such as logistic regression models. Log loss quantifies how far the model’s predicted probabilities are from the true class labels. Here’s the formula for log&nbsp;loss:</p><p>Where:</p>  N is the number of observations.  yi​ is the actual class label for observation 𝑖i, which can be 0 or&nbsp;1.  pi​ is the predicted probability of the observation 𝑖i being in class&nbsp;1.  log is the natural logarithm.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The million-dollar security question that has been discussed to death in recent years is: why, despite the constantly evolving market of sophisticated cybersecurity solutions and ever-increasing investments in security by businesses, the number of successful cyberattacks does not seem to be decreasing? In fact, the scale and cost of an average breach only grows each year.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is actually quite trivial: people making executive decisions about investments in cybersecurity do not know or care much about it. Typically, this leads either to tragically understaffed and overworked security teams or, even worse, to the proliferation of the “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-cargo-cult-of-cybersecurity">cargo cult of cybersecurity</a>”, when a security solution gets purchased, but never properly deployed, operated, or monitored afterward. This is especially true for public clouds, where many customers are still struggling with the notion of “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/csp-vs-tenant-understanding-shared-responsibilities">shared responsibility model</a>”. Yes, cloud service providers usually have much more sophisticated tools and better qualified experts on their security teams, but they are not responsible for securing your applications or data – it is still entirely <a href="https://medium.com/@maciej.pocwierz/how-an-empty-s3-bucket-can-make-your-aws-bill-explode-934a383cb8b1">your problem as a customer</a>.</p>
<p>What can be done to break this vicious cycle? Well, the best approach would be to redesign your entire business processes to make them more resilient to cyberattacks. If you do not collect sensitive information about your customers, it won’t be leaked by a hacker. If you enforce the Zero Trust model across your networks, the chances of a ransomware attack would be substantially reduced. A somewhat less radical solution would be to outsource your cybersecurity to a third party, making it their concern. This works really well in certain scenarios, such as processing credit card transactions, for example. In a broader sense, however, employing a managed security service provider can be quite costly and still won’t guarantee anything (people still make mistakes, after all).</p>
<p>Would AI perhaps improve the situation? This remains to be seen – we already know that AI solutions are creating their own, entirely new kinds of cybersecurity risks. In any case, the worst enemy of security is complexity, and thus, reducing the overall complexity of your IT infrastructure and consequently simplifying and consolidating the security controls needed to protect it, should be a primary strategic goal of every digital business. Unification of technology stacks across environments, strict and consistent enforcement of declarative security policies, and intelligent automation of security operations are major factors in achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Choosing the right cloud provider that can help with it is an important first step on that journey. And it doesn’t have to be one of the “big three” – today, let’s take a look at another contender, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Being a latecomer to the cloud service market, Oracle had an opportunity to learn from its predecessors’ mistakes and design its architecture differently in several ways.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant differentiator of OCI is its unified approach towards service delivery regardless of the offered cloud model. Whether served from the public cloud, a private Cloud@Customer deployment, a dedicated commercial or government region, a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/eu-sovereign-cloud/">sovereign cloud</a> compliant with local regulatory frameworks, or even offered by Oracle’s partner using the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/alloy/">Alloy platform</a> – the services, data models, identity and security controls, and other aspects remain the same – as opposed to other providers that cannot deliver feature parity across their public and private offerings.</p>
<p>This alone allows for reducing the overall complexity of hybrid deployments dramatically, but combined with the ability to provide consistent security controls across those environments simplifies protection against cyberthreats even further. Moreover, Oracle places a strong focus on “secure defaults”, meaning that customers do not have to make each decision themselves, instead relying on best practices and controls that cannot be bypassed or deactivated accidentally.</p>
<p>Another important differentiator is maintaining an open ecosystem with not just partners and resellers, but also with 3rd party technology providers and even direct competitors. Again, as opposed to some other providers that keep their customers locked into their infrastructures with proprietary interfaces and large egress fees, Oracle strives to make their services <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/azure/oracle-database-at-azure/">available in other clouds</a> and designs services around industry standards and open protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Oracle Database services form a major part of the company’s cloud portfolio, it is unsurprising that the company invests a lot into data protection solutions – from multiple types of encryption and data masking to numerous data security controls. This includes <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev80540/oracle-data-safe">Oracle Data Safe</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/oracle-sql-firewall">SQL Firewall</a>, as well as more traditional tools like Audit Vault and Database Firewall. Oracle’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev70965/oracle-database-security-assessment">Autonomous Database</a> service turns the database into a fully managed service that delegates all administrative, operational, and security controls to AI-powered automation, completely removing human mistakes as a risk factor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/security-zones/">Security Zones</a> enable secure compartmentalization for customers’ resources and applications. All these controls are continuously updated and mapped across a multitude of compliance regulations for specific geographies and industries. Needless to say, these security controls are complemented by identity management, strong, passwordless authentication methods (including FIDO2 and passkeys), and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/deshpande/oracle-access-governance">access governance</a> tools with a high degree of automation as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/oracle-cloud-guard-from-cspm-to-cnapp">Oracle Cloud Guard</a> provides a centralized security management and monitoring hub that has evolved from security posture management towards a complete cloud-native workload protection, threat intelligence, and security analytics platform. More importantly, however, the entire OCI cloud infrastructure has been designed from scratch to incorporate security controls at every layer, from low-level network isolation to firewalls and encryption in transit. Currently, Oracle is working on implementing the industry-wide <a href="https://zpr.org/">Zero Trust Packet Routing</a> initiative across its infrastructure to provide a truly identity-aware, data-centric, self-enforcing network security architecture.</p>

			 Institutional RWA Tokenization Needs Permissioned Cash Coins 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Stablecoins are the killer use cases for the crypto space, with a market cap exceeding $160 billion according to DefiLlama. Research firm Sacra predicts that stablecoins may overtake payment giant Visa in total payment volume this quarter. However,&nbsp;financial institutions have been hesitant to embrace stablecoins&nbsp;due to regulatory concerns and the inherent volatility of the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>The skepticism surrounding stablecoins is not without basis. As highlighted in our 2022 newsletter, “<a href="https://tokeny.com/are-regulated-stablecoins-the-future-of-payments/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--J2jfyEMVeE20Ciq5G3QkxFuFVHv4THzP_n3xxsRUVr2_lzA_o52sbZV7oAInFBkyg1vHX">Stablecoins Were Not Made to Go to the Moon</a>,” the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) exposed significant vulnerabilities in certain stablecoin models. This incident underscored the&nbsp;need for stablecoins to be backed by credible and regulated entities.</p>
<p>Regulators worldwide are enhancing regulations for payment tokens, making licensed institutions like banks the most suitable cash coins issuers. Additionally, stringent&nbsp;controls are required to enforce KYC and AML rules. These controls will be needed during the full-lifecycle of the token&nbsp;and not only when they are minted and redeemed like current stablecoins. For instance, the recently introduced Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act in the US, AML legislation in Europe, and Hong Kong’s HKMA public consultation paper on regulating stablecoins all emphasize the necessity of conducting KYC and AML for stablecoin holders.</p>
<p>The future of stablecoins is likely to become permissioned, at least for regulated institutions. We expect more commercial banks to issue bank-grade digital payment coins by leveraging permissioned tokens to bring controls and restrictions that enforce compliance.&nbsp;As wallets don’t enable the proper identification of a user, banks will need advanced token smart contracts to enforce their duties, wherever the tokens are.</p>
<p>The open-source ERC-3643 permissioned token standard offers a common compliance framework suitable for both permissioned stablecoins and tokenized securities. By issuing cash and securities with the same compliance framework, we&nbsp;ensure both compliance and interoperability, eliminating silos.</p>
<p>Tokeny is at the forefront of this transformation, empowering&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;banks&nbsp;to issue and manage payment coins while upgrading operating systems for&nbsp;asset managers,&nbsp;investment banks,&nbsp;fund servicers, and&nbsp;distributors&nbsp;to bring securities seamlessly on-chain.</p>
<p>Step by step, we are solving the biggest issues in the institutional RWA tokenization industry:&nbsp;bringing cash and securities on the same ledger. This eliminates the lengthy payment process and data reconciliation using fiat rails, laying the foundation for delivering the true value of blockchain. Not only does this facilitate atomic settlement, but it also opens the door to new services like peer-to-peer secondary trading, collateralized lending, automated corporate actions, and more.</p>

<p>You can now send direct messages (DMs) to people on Bluesky! Say hi to a friend, colleague, or a crush.</p>

  

<p>These are private one-to-one messages directly within the Bluesky app. By default, your permissions allow anyone you follow to DM you. You can change these settings to allow no one or anyone to message you.</p>
 How do I send a DM? 
 
 Click the Chat icon. On mobile, you can find the icon at the bottom of your screen. On desktop, this is a chat bubble on the side bar (or go to <a href="https://bsky.app/messages">https://bsky.app/messages</a>). 
 On mobile, click the plus icon to start a new conversation. On desktop, click “New chat” in the top right to start a new conversation. Search for the user you want to message. 
 Write your message, and hit send! 
 If the app says a user cannot be messaged, they may have set their account to only allow messages from people they follow or from no one. 
 
 DM Privacy and Safety 
 Who can message me? 
<p>By default, only people you follow can send you DMs. To change this, check the settings in the DM interface. You can allow DMs from no one, only people you follow, or all Bluesky users.</p>

  
  Set who can message you, and whether you want notification sounds.

<p>Blocked users will not be able to DM you. Muted users are able to DM you. Additionally, you can easily block users right from within the DM feature.</p>
 Reporting DMs 
<p>You can report DMs directly to mods, who will review reported messages for Community Guidelines violations. Moderators are able to view the reported message and surrounding messages for context to assess the report. Infractions may result in temporary or permanent loss of DM privileges or even full account takedowns.</p>
 DM Privacy 
<p>In rare cases, the Bluesky moderation team may need to open your DMs to investigate broader patterns of abuse, such as spam or coordinated harassment. This would only be done when absolutely necessary to keep Bluesky safe. Access is extremely limited and tracked internally.</p>
<p>This first version of DMs has limited features (no images or encryption yet), but we'll be adding more safety enhancements in future updates.</p>
 Future Updates 
 
 Media in DMs: Currently, Bluesky DMs allow you to send text messages. In the future, you’ll be able to send images and other forms of media! 
 Group DMs: In the future, you’ll be able to create direct messages for groups. 
 Encrypted DMs: We intend to fully support end-to-end encrypted messaging down the line. Read more about our technical plans for E2EE messaging in our <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2024-protocol-roadmap#product-features">2024 protocol roadmap</a>. 
 Safety improvements: We’ll continue iterating on anti-harassment and safety tooling for direct messages.

<p>Join Michael Cichon, CMO, and Mike Engle, CSO of 1Kosmos, as they introduce 1Key, a groundbreaking biometric authentication solution. Learn how 1Key eliminates passwords and mobile devices, offering secure, seamless access for environments like call centers and factories. Discover its compatibility with various workstations and compliance with FIDO standards, revolutionizing user authentication and identity verification.</p>
  
<p></p>
<p>Well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, Chief Marketing Officer here at 1Kosmos. I’m joined today by Mike Engle, our Chief Strategy Officer. Mike, welcome to the vlog. I know it’s been a while. There’s a lot been happening. This is a very fast moving space. We have a new new thing to talk about. It’s called 1Key. What is 1Key?</p>
<p>Well, this is 1Key. It is a way to authenticate your users that opens up a whole new world of possibilities and usability and flexibility so let’s dive in on this thing.</p>
<p>Okay, well, we’ve talked a lot about passwordless authentication and now we have this 1Key thing so what does 1Key have to do with passwordless authentication and what is it used for?</p>
<p>Yeah, really simply way to put it, it’s a biometric authentication that you can use anywhere in the organization, so onto any workstation. So Mac, Windows, et cetera. And the idea is we’ve been dabbling with biometrics in the world. We have your face and thumb on phones now, it’s registered to your device. We’ve had smart cards, we’ve had mobile authenticators. Those things work great for some environments, but there’s many environments where you can’t use a phone, where hardware devices cannot be given to the individuals, and we can talk about those use cases. And so instead, imagine being able to walk up to a machine and have a touch ID face ID experience that doesn’t come with all of the registration challenges.</p>
<p>This is interesting. Okay, so let me get my head around this. We started whatever, two, three years ago, talking about using an app to authenticate on your mobile device. Mobile device scans a code, looks at you, recognizes you, and lets you in. Then we went to Atlas, then we went to browser, and now you’re introducing these new whatever use cases. So what are some of these environments that you’re talking about where you can’t use a mobile device?</p>
<p>Mobile device is great. We all trust and love our mobile, but there’s many environments where a mobile device does not work. For example, call centers. Would you want your call center agent when you call the bank to be able to have a mobile device to be able to… Typically they’re device free for obvious security reasons. And then there’s other environments where a mobile doesn’t work such as factory. You may have constraints, you may have legal reasons why you can’t use a mobile. And so there’s this, I don’t know, call it 20, 30% of end users out there that can’t, won’t shouldn’t use a mobile device. So for them, we’re proposing the 1Key as a way for you to be able to walk up to a machine, tap it with a thumb or finger, and you’re logged in.</p>
<p>Traditionally this has been possible where you could have your thumb registered somewhere. Biometrics aren’t new, but the usability has been challenging. So for example, if you get a new iPhone today, can you just pop your face or phone onto it without it doing anything and having it log you in, right? No, of course not. Imagine if you could. Imagine if you got the new iPhone and you just linked it back to your biometrics and you were all set up or you log in. That’s the experience that we’re creating today for those types of other environments.</p>
<p>Okay. So just to net it out briefly here, we’ve got a physical key. It’s got a biometric fingerprint reader on it. And how does this work? There’s other keys in the market. How does this work?</p>
<p>For the last couple of years we’ve been using keys that are linked to a person. For example, if I have a legacy key here and I am given this key and now it’s linked to me. The challenge with that is you now have one key per person. If I have 100,000 employees, I’m deploying 100,000 keys. And many of these keys could be given to somebody else so it doesn’t link back to a biometric. Even if it did, the biometric is typically linked to that legacy key so it still is a one-to-one mapping. Now what happens when you lose that? What’s your fallback? Well, you go through a lengthy process of getting a new key assigned to you, having it shipped to you. And in those days or weeks you’re falling back to bad practices. So this is something you can enroll anywhere and then use anywhere. And instead of one key per user, it’s one key per protected desktop.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. And the biometric, how is that tied to an identity or how is it identity-backed?</p>
<p>Yeah, so obviously my fingerprints are unique to me. My face is unique to me, my eyes and iris so it leverages best in class biometric verification. So at the time of enrollment, I just need to verify my identity, that could be done in person remotely and then I register one, two, three fingerprints. And then those are kept inside my organization. And the fingerprints themselves don’t actually go anywhere. They’re templatized, basically turned into math and that is sent somewhere, kept in the company servers for authentication later. So walk up to a machine, verify who I am, enroll and I’m done. Now I go to any one of 20,000 workstations or kiosks or whatever it would be, do that same process, tap and I’m logged in.</p>
<p>Okay. So the registration process, you said you verify your identity, that can be any number of things, right? You can self-attest your identity. You can prove it with a driver’s license, passport. However much rigor you want behind that identity proofing, you can apply it and then you tie that to the fingerprint, the biometric?</p>
<p>That’s right. Yeah. So for your existing employees, we kind of trust our existing authentication today. Let’s say I have username/password, MFA, I have all this legacy stuff, it’s okay. We know the bad guys are working on hacking that, but companies trust that many times a day across their thousands of employees. So what we do is we’ll take that and convert them to this modern enroll once, use anywhere experience, and then you can throw away the password.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So there’s a way to migrate existing users and when you need to, you could of course put them through an identity verification process. So that’s typically for new hires or just if you want to test the authenticity of a person for whatever the reason would be.</p>
<p>Got it. Got it, got it. So I understand this is a FIDO compliant key. Is that correct?</p>
<p>The authentication is FIDO. The big news in FIDO in the last year or two has been pass keys. They’ve rebranded the whole FIDO experience as pass keys and now there’s roaming pass keys versus device bound, right? And so think about this as a roaming pass key that works anywhere in the organization only. So one of the challenges with roaming pass keys out in the consumer world is my pass key can roam anywhere that my Apple ID is used or my one password account. Of course, we wouldn’t want that for the enterprise. You wouldn’t want to share your pass key with another employee or a family member so this is a controlled roaming FIDO authenticator that works anywhere inside the organization.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. And can you just run through again the differences? How is this different than the existing keys? We know it’s got a biometric reader on it, but aside from that.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. Again, let’s call out one very well known and reliable product like a YubiKey or FEITIAN. There’s a couple of them out on the internet. Again, those are given to you and they’re linked to you. So you can’t… If you lose it, you’re in trouble and there’s a lot more cost to that model. Imagine if you had a call center, their transient workers, if you had to give every one of them a hardware device that’s linked to them. First of all you have a management nightmare. So enroll once, use, then as long as they have that key, they can use it. But it’s also based on username/password and then those legacy devices would do their thing so they’re typically MFA only. Ours is a single touch experience bound to the user that they can just basically tap their thumb or finger on any device and they’re logged in. Highly trusted, highly secure. So there’s quite a number of benefits to this model.</p>
<p>Okay, and it’s up to 10 fingerprints per user?</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s really unlimited, but you’ll probably run out after 10.</p>
<p>If you cut your finger or you’ve got a band-aid on it, or maybe you broke your… I don’t know, then you can use your other digits. That’s the point.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And it’s interoperable. You take this from machine to machine?</p>
<p>You could, yeah. So these are almost, call them almost disposable. They are linked to the organization. So you couldn’t just go grab one off the internet, plug it into your company device and use it. It’s linked to the organization and this acts as an encryption, as a privacy device that can then work with the user’s biometrics in a safe way and allow login into Mac or Windows.</p>
<p>Okay, great. All right, so Passwordless biometric authentication. We no longer need a mobile device. Any restricted. So your manufacturing workers, your call center workers, anywhere where phones aren’t allowed. Maybe California, sometimes you can’t require people to use a mobile phone, right? I guess any of those environments, the 1Key is for them.</p>
<p>Exactly. You nailed it.</p>
<p>This is very cool. Appreciate your time, Mike. This is a very exciting… one of many very exciting developments that we have here at 1Kosmos so thanks for taking time today.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me. See you soon.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>The digital era demands that organizations harness the power of advanced cloud platforms while adhering to regulatory frameworks, particularly in Europe. Commercial enterprises and governmental bodies alike have shown hesitance towards cloud adoption, primarily due to the legal uncertainties highlighted by the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/there-is-no-such-thing-as-privacy">Schrems and Schrems II rulings</a>. These rulings have intensified concerns over data sovereignty and security, leading to increased scrutiny over where and how data is stored. To mitigate these issues, sovereign cloud services have emerged as a crucial solution, ensuring compliance without compromising on technological advancements.</p>
 What is a Sovereign Cloud? 
<p>So, what is a sovereign cloud, and how sovereign can sovereign be? Essentially, it’s a cloud environment designed to adhere to the strict data residency, privacy, and regulatory requirements of a specific country. Data is stored and managed within the country’s borders, ensuring it’s governed by local laws. This approach provides high levels of security and compliance, making it ideal for governmental and highly regulated industries. By leveraging sovereign clouds, organizations can enjoy advanced cloud services without the legal and security concerns tied to foreign data management.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Key principles of a sovereign cloud</p>
 The Contenders in the Sovereign Cloud Market 
<p>When it comes to meeting the high standards of sovereign cloud, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce, Alibaba, SAP, VMware, Atos, T-Systems, and Capgemini all claim promising solutions for the European markets. Microsoft’s Cloud for Sovereignty stands out, alongside Google’s partnership with T-Systems and Oracle’s EU Sovereign Cloud. However, potential customers must verify just how sovereign these solutions truly are. It’s crucial to ensure they meet the needs of highly regulated commercial entities and governmental organizations. Remember, all that glitters may not be sovereign enough.</p>
 Enter: AWS 
<p>A few years ago, AWS wasn’t keen on the sovereign cloud concept, with their Chief Security Officer, Stephen Schmidt, referring to it as “a marketing term more than anything else.” (<a href="https://www.techzine.eu/blogs/privacy-compliance/87994/aws-never-talks-about-sovereign-cloud-but-definitely-has-it-says-amazon-cso/">Source</a>) AWS believed their existing infrastructure already met most regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/security/aws-plans-to-invest-e7-8b-into-the-aws-european-sovereign-cloud-set-to-launch-by-the-end-of-2025/">this changed dramatically</a>: AWS is making a bold move with its European Sovereign Cloud, committing €7.8 billion to launch by the end of 2025 in Brandenburg, Germany. This cloud environment will be entirely separate from other AWS regions, ensuring all data and operations remain within the EU. By leveraging the powerful AWS Nitro System, it promises unmatched security and compliance for European customers. This significant investment also includes job creation and skills development, aiming to support highly regulated industries and government organizations in meeting stringent data sovereignty requirements.</p>
<p>AWS might be a latecomer to the sovereign cloud market, but their €7.8 billion investment in the AWS European Sovereign Cloud signals a significant shift in their strategy. Clearly, something has changed in their perception, pushing them to heavily invest to meet the stringent demands of European regulatory and data sovereignty needs.&nbsp;</p>
 Impact on Gaia-X 
<p>What does this move by AWS mean for the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-stoecker-enterprise-identity-eu-gaia-x">Gaia-X initiative</a>? Gaia-X itself is all about creating a federated and secure data infrastructure with a focus on data sovereignty, transparency, and interoperability with a European touch. AWS is a day-1 member of the Gaia-X group actively supporting this initiative and involved in multiple Gaia-X working groups.&nbsp; AWS’s late but powerful entry into the sovereign cloud market could either support Gaia-X’s efforts by adding robust infrastructure or challenge Gaia-X’s collaborative nature with its sheer scale and resources. Will AWS complement or overshadow Gaia-X’s goals, with both approaches navigating the evolving landscape of digital sovereignty in Europe?&nbsp;</p>
 Evaluating the Investment 
<p>So, what is the real value behind this massive expenditure? Does it truly address the stringent data sovereignty and compliance needs of German and EU customers? Additionally, will this substantial investment be sufficient from their perspective, given their high standards for data security and regulatory compliance? Moreover, how will government and public services perceive this development? Will they see AWS’s efforts as enough to meet their unique demands, or will there still be skepticism about the adequacy of these measures? These questions are pivotal as AWS attempts to secure its foothold in this highly regulated market.</p>
<p>Why now, and why with such a massive investment? Is AWS catching up with the market, or are they trying to overshadow the competition with sheer force? This Billion-Euro commitment suggests a strategic pivot: AWS might be late to the sovereign cloud game, but they’re going all-in, potentially to avoid losing market share to local providers and those already “there”. The real question is, will this investment finally deliver solutions to meet the high standards of German and EU customers by the end of 2025?</p>
<p>AWS’s extensive plans include not only building and operating the AWS European Sovereign Cloud but also creating numerous high-skilled jobs and collaborating with local communities on innovative programs. This initiative aims to accelerate productivity, empower digital transformation, and contribute significantly to Germany’s GDP. However, AWS needs to ensure they can deliver from their (actually rather late) “day one” meeting both the technical and regulatory demands of a highly competitive and scrutinized market.</p>

<p>This incident report summarizes a transaction conducted through the Aergo Swap service, which was detected as suspicious by the Fraud Detection System (FDS). The report includes actions taken and the causes identified.</p><p>Summary:<br>7.7 million Aergo tokens were withdrawn via the Aergo Swap service. All transactions were processed normally, with precise amounts transferred between the Aergo and ERC vaults. The swap service has been temporarily halted by our threat detection system due to an unusually high amount of transactions. We are conducting a comprehensive review of all systems and will resume service once everything is verified.</p><p>*Both vaults and the bridge have not been compromised by any hacks and remain&nbsp;secure.</p><p>1. Details of the Incident<br>Beginning with block 19905987 at 07:11:59 on May 19, 2024 (UTC), a notably large transaction marked the start of suspicious activity. The total Aergo tokens withdrawn in these suspicious transactions amounted to 7,706,818.22.</p><p>2. Issues and Root Cause&nbsp;Analysis</p>  The transactions were confirmed to have been made from the wallet “Am…Kp,” owned by an early Aergo investor(s).  This old multisig wallet has held tokens since the TGE and transferred funds based on a Lua Contract. Aergo scan decompiles the contract bytecode and collects related information based on Elasticsearch to provide to the FDS. A LuaJIT-related bug caused the decompile to fail, and as a result, it was not properly reflected in the Aergo scan, leading the FDS to suspect the transaction.  The failure to display transaction data correctly in Aergo scan was due to a LuaJIT-related bug that caused the decompile of the contract bytecode to fail. Consequently, the FDS did not reflect accurate transaction information.  Additionally, Aergo’s LuaJIT does not support logging for Internal Transactions, which could make funds transfers appear untraceable on the Aergo&nbsp;scan.  <p>3. Immediate actions <br>Following the detection of these unusual activities, we temporarily suspended the Aergo swap service. All functionalities have been put on hold, and emergency inspections are underway to assess and rectify the situation.</p><p>4. Action&nbsp;Items</p>  Due to the potential for manipulation of LuaJIT bytecode, which makes decompiling unreliable and poses security risks, a hotfix will be applied more quickly than planned as part of an already scheduled network&nbsp;upgrade.  The upcoming upgrade will include the addition of Internal Transaction Logging capabilities.  <p>5. Final Notes<br>We’ve temporarily halted operations on the swap service due to a false alarm caused by functionality limitations in Argoscan, which our Fraud Detection System (FDS) relies on for monitoring bridge vaults. We are currently focused on confirming the security of the funds held in the bridge&nbsp;Vault.</p><p>Upon the initial review, the issue with the bridge Vault and associated services was not due to a security vulnerability. Instead, it stemmed from a malfunction in the Fraud Detection System (FDS) triggered by an error in the explorer. This incident has been identified as a technical error, and we are confident there are no additional security concerns.</p><p>The enhancement of the Aergo Scan Explorer is actively underway. We are diligently working through the development and review processes, anticipating the completion of these improvements within two weeks following the resumption of bridge operations.</p><p>Aergo Scan does not currently show information on internal transactions, which are exchanges between contracts. Consequently, the source of funds for transactions involving multi-sig wallets may not appear on Aergo Scan. The funds originate from one of the early participants.</p><p>The swap service is expected to resume on June 5th at the latest. We are conducting extensive testing to ensure its smooth operation upon reopening.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-bridge-incident-report-317244a55b0c">Aergo Swap Incident Report (Updated-Final)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Germany monitors all virtual asset transfers, including self-custody wallets, to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  <p>Germany is a major hub of cryptocurrency activity in Europe, with over a million participants engaging in daily crypto trading. The country has a transparent regulatory environment and open policies on blockchain technology and crypto, aligning with EU and MiCA regulations.</p><p>As a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Germany also implements <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT)</a> directives, including <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p> Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Germany <p>In 2021, Germany published a bill on the transfer of crypto assets and enforced the FATF Travel Rule, requiring compliance from crypto companies by October 2021. However, once the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/understanding-the-eus-transfer-of-funds-regulation-tfr-a-primer-for-crypto-professionals">EU’s Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR)</a> is implemented, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/global-legal-monitor/2021-10-26/germany-new-ordinance-ensures-traceability-of-crypto-asset-transfers/">Germany will evaluate and potentially repeal its ordinance</a> to ensure a coordinated approach to crypto regulation within the&nbsp;EU.</p> Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>In the EU, Germany is one of the first jurisdictions to authorize the Crypto Travel Rule. To ensure the traceability of fund transfers and mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing using crypto, the country’s regulators introduced <a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Gesetzestexte/Gesetze_Gesetzesvorhaben/Abteilungen/Abteilung_VII/19_Legislaturperiode/2021-09-29-KryptoWTransferV/3-Verkuendete-Verordnung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4">the Money Transfer Regulation</a>. Germany considers all virtual asset transfers as cross-border transfers.</p><p>Under the Travel Rule, virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and crypto wallet providers must acquire, hold, and submit certain information on crypto asset transfers, making it available to appropriate authorities when requested. Licensed financial institutions, securities firms, and credit institutions that send or receive crypto on behalf of their customers must also adhere to these obligations.</p><p>Additionally, Germany follows stringent risk-based approach (RBA) policies, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) requirements. The country’s AML rules require crypto companies to follow risk management procedures, detect suspicious transactions, implement customer due diligence (CDD) processes, and engage in continuous monitoring and reporting of suspicious business transactions to the authorities.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>Germany adheres to FATF’s recommendations for the Travel Rule, applying a minimum threshold of EUR 1000 for collecting and sharing identifying information about the originator and beneficiary of a crypto transaction.</p><p>For transactions above this limit, VASPs must obtain, send, and retain the following PII:</p><p>For the originator:</p>  Name  Account number or unique transaction number  Date and place of birth or address, official personal document number, or customer identification number  <p>For the beneficiary:</p>  Name  Account number or unique transaction number  <p>However, even for crypto transfers below EUR 1000, the name and account number or unique transaction number of both the originator and beneficiary must be recorded. All this information must be provided to the official authorities or the beneficiary VASP within three business&nbsp;days.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>For a VASP to operate in Germany and offer its services to natural citizens and legal entities, it must apply for a license with BaFin, as per the amendments made to its Banking Act. Not complying with the German Banking Act makes it a felony&nbsp;offense.</p><p>When it comes to the custody of crypto, the financial regulator defines it as the custody, management, and security of crypto or the private keys used to keep, store, or transfer crypto for others. Much like a VASP, a crypto custodian also needs a license from BaFin to&nbsp;operate.</p><p>The regulator requires enhanced due diligence (EDD) for self-hosted or unhosted wallets. These wallet providers need to take risk-appropriate measures to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>As per <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Virtualassets/VACG-Snapshot-Jurisdictions.html">FATF’s latest report on the implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule</a>, Germany is “Largely Complaint.” This puts Germany in the same category as <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-canada">Canada</a>, France, Israel, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-regulations-in-the-united-kingdom-a-comprehensive-analysis">the UK</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">the US</a>, which have fully embraced the rule with proper checks and systems in&nbsp;place.</p><p>This European country strictly follows FATF recommendations in regard to the personal data that must be collected during transactions and the threshold.</p><p>However, unlike other countries, Germany has clarified rules and requires monitoring of crypto asset transfers even when users store and manage their virtual assets themselves in a self-custody wallet. In such cases, the individual is in control of their private keys and the security of their crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>German regulators see self-managed digital asset wallets “with increased risk” and believe it to be “a starting point for a suspicious transaction.”</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Overall, Germany’s implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule aims to enhance the traceability and security of cryptocurrency transactions, adhering to international standards. This impacts service providers and wallet providers, ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing directives.</p> FAQs on Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Germany <p>Q1: What is the minimum threshold for identifying information under Germany’s FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule?</p><p>Germany has a minimum threshold of EUR 1000 for the FATF Travel Rule, requiring VASPs to collect and share identifying information for crypto transactions above this&nbsp;amount.</p><p>Q2: What is the purpose of the Money Transfer Regulation in&nbsp;Germany?</p><p>The Money Transfer Regulation in Germany aims to ensure the traceability of fund transfers and mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing using cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Q3: What are the obligations of financial institutions dealing with crypto in&nbsp;Germany?</p><p>Financial institutions, securities firms, and credit institutions in Germany must comply with AML and CFT directives, implement risk management procedures, detect suspicious transactions, and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.</p> About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Every year, cyberattacks increase in severity and intensity as more and more of our collective human life is conducted online. Between 2021 and 2023, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/it-and-tech/cybersecurity-statistics/?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=Between%202021%20and%202023%2C%20data,most%20common%20vector%20for%20malware.">cyberattacks rose by 72%</a>, the fastest rise on record. The nature of these attacks is also changing: the average reader might still think of “hacking” in terms of digital theft and petty web vandalism, but we now see frequent, sophisticated, state-sponsored cyberattacks that impact physical, real-world targets – including critical infrastructure and sensitive operations - such as stealing personal data of millions of people and taking down hospital systems.</p><p>This trend poses profound risks to the basic safety and security of U.S. citizens, and 2024 has already given us a frightening example. In January, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) told members of Congress that a China-backed hacking group known as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fbi-china-espionage-hacking-db23dd96cfd825e4988852a34a99d4ea?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Volt Typhoon was working to infiltrate U.S. computer networks</a>. The group sought access to water treatment, electrical, and transportation systems, with the goal of “inciting societal panic” and compromising U.S. threat response capabilities.&nbsp;</p> Cybersecurity is National Security <p>These attacks show just how impactful cyberattacks can be and how imperfectly we secure even the most critical digital systems. As CISA head Jen Easterly told legislators, “Chinese cyber actors have taken advantage of very basic flaws in our technology … We’ve made it easy on them.”</p><p>One such flaw is the lack of verifiable digital identities that control access to everything from email servers to dams and steel mills. Current identity verification is too easily spoofed because it often relies on pre-Internet authentication concepts that are impractical and insecure in today’s threat environment. More advanced verification systems are offered by just a handful of large, centralized providers, creating single points of failure, such as those exploited in the <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/report/opm-data-breach-government-jeopardized-national-security-generation/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OPM data breach</a> of 2015. On this topic, DHS Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications Andy Ozment commented that "[if] an adversary has the credentials of a user on the network, then they can access data even if it's encrypted.” As a result, the top recommendation from the House Committee of Oversight and Reform was to move federal information security efforts toward zero trust.</p><p>To close such vulnerabilities, one tool holds particular promise: a digitally native ID system, built from the ground up to securely bridge the physical-digital gap that America’s enemies are eagerly exploit. When we increase users’ and software agents’ abilities to demonstrate who they are with high assurance to a variety of different systems, we also increase security with more granular controls over who can access what. This moves us away from singular accounts that can access large troves of sensitive data, and towards a zero trust, need-to-know basis per account, closing many outstanding security gaps in nationally important systems.</p> Critical Infrastructure and the Changing Threat Landscape <p>The OPM database is by no means the only digital “crown jewel” in the US government’s IT infrastructure. In 2013, the White House identified <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors?ref=blog.spruceid.com">16 categories of “critical infrastructure”</a> fundamental to national security. These include three broad categories of government and civilian systems: Communications and Data; Transportation and Energy; and Public Health and Emergency Response.&nbsp;</p><p>All three of those categories have been targeted by sophisticated cyberattacks, some of which can grant attackers long-term access to systems. This was the goal of the notorious Russian-backed <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SolarWinds attack</a>, and of the more recent Volt Typhoon incursions.</p><p>The compromise of these systems makes America vulnerable to a vast range of threats, from subtle to dramatic. The U.S. itself pioneered the subtler sort of attack with Stuxnet, a worm that altered control software and destroyed physical centrifuges Iran used to enrich uranium. America’s enemies might use a similar playbook to alter automated systems in a defense manufacturing facility, leading it to produce inoperable weapons. More acute and targeted cyberattacks could also<a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/lurie-childrens-hospital-cyberattack/707094/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> cripple hospital operations</a> during a disaster, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/26/nyregion/rye-brook-dam-caught-in-computer-hacking-case.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">disrupt hydroelectric dams</a> and interrupt power to millions – or even unleash devastating flooding.</p> Critical Infrastructure and the Changing Threat Landscape <p>These growing vulnerabilities are the product of a mix of technological and social changes. An increasing number of digital systems are built to allow remote access, in some cases as a product of the shift towards working from home. Even more widespread is reliance on remote “cloud computing” for data or processing. When they’re compromised, those remote services can give intruders major access to critical data and operations.</p><p>At the same time, the current confusion of access and identity systems makes these systems easier for bad actors to penetrate. Many digital identity systems rely on analog infrastructure, particularly drivers’ licenses, as their ultimate source of truth. But those pre-digital systems don’t carry all of their security guarantees into the digital world.</p><p>More advanced digital identity systems overwhelmingly rely on a very small number of commercial providers, creating a huge concentration of risk. In a 2023 incident, for instance, China-based attackers compromised Microsoft email systems by forging identity authentication tokens <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/07/11/mitigation-china-based-threat-actor/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">using a stolen “signing key.</a>"&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has generally excelled in its role as an identity manager for critical systems. But its centralized control also makes hacks of truly immense scale more of a threat. As Adam Meyers of security firm Crowdstrike has said, “having one monolithic vendor that is responsible for all of your technology, products, services and security ... can end in disaster.”</p> From Bits to Atoms: Digital Identity in the Physical World <p>Many possible cyberattacks rely on identity credentials to gain initial access to systems: According to Verizon, 91% of phishing attacks seek to <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/identity-is-key-to-stopping-these-5-cyber-security-attacks/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">compromise identity credentials</a>. In turn, 81% of data breaches make use of stolen identity credentials.</p><p>In our day-to-day lives, we frequently rely on outdated authentication methods, such as simple username-password combinations that can be easily stolen. Many would likely be stunned by how many critical systems have fewer protections than their Amazon accounts.</p><p>But what if user identities could not be remotely compromised because proof of identity was linked to physical objects, rather than only clonable strings of characters or spoofable digital tokens? This is one of the many security features provided by Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDC), which can combine cryptography and modern hardware innovations to create vastly more secure digital credentials than the current baseline.</p><p>Fundamentally, a Verifiable Digital Credential is the digitally native version of your driver’s license/identification card, professional license, or certifications, which contains verifiable cryptographic signatures from the issuer of the credential, making it provably authentic and tamper-evident.</p><p>The “cryptographic signature” isn’t just a picture of a handwritten signature, nor the cursive letters that show up in DocuSign or similar services. Instead, it’s machine-checkable evidence that a statement was made by the right entity, such as when the DMV uses a cryptographic signature to indicate that the holder of a mobile driver’s license can operate a vehicle. Unlike pictures of handwritten signatures or scans of plastic ID cards, cryptographic signatures cannot be feasibly generated by AI and are designed to be future-proof, even against quantum computers.&nbsp;</p><p>Through these new security features, digital IDs can be built from the start to assure the safety of the physical-digital frontier where many compromises occur, while ensuring privacy and user control. Breaking the protections of the secure element of a cell phone or key fob requires a high level of sophistication, such as using an electron microscope directly on the physical chip, and which is a longshot for most attackers.</p><p>Requiring a specific device to access a digital service can be used to ensure a particular person’s physical presence – for instance, in front of the control panel of a hydroelectric dam – rather than a simple badge. This is known as an “authentication factor” in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63B/AAL/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">guidance from NIST</a>, and is a widely adopted requirement to layer into security programs across federal, state, and private sector systems. Digital IDs can provide many additional improvements to identity authentication and assurance in one package.</p> Security Across Digital Borders <p>The U.S. has over 430 federal agencies, many hundreds of state agencies, and more than 200,000 government contracting firms, each with their own IT systems, technology stacks, and personnel. Significant cybersecurity risks lie at the edges of these systems: Anything from a missing USB stick to an expired contractor access card can compromise our national security.&nbsp;</p><p>Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) can help with security at the edges by providing robust ways for users and software agents to demonstrate who they are and their privileges across any environment. This is a key enabler for zero trust architectures, which allow for the granular specification of a user’s access rights - rather than “trusting” them after logging in once. VDCs can enable zero-trust interoperability because they are based on data formats and sharing protocols currently being refined by global standards organizations, such as NIST, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p><p>These standards allow many different government agencies and bodies to provision verifiable digital credentials tailored to their needs, which incorporate baseline privacy and security features. They are also usable across different agencies without the need to create a new IT super-authority.</p> Technology that Incorporates Market-Based Innovation and Democratic Values <p>VDCs can be customized for specific use cases to provide better user experiences and security properties. It is possible for many vendors to implement VDC solutions in parallel that can talk to each other, reducing vendor lock-in and increasing IT agility. In contrast to relying upon one monolithic IT system, a dynamic ecosystem of vendors each specializing in their own use cases can allow agencies to leverage competitive market forces to provide the best solutions at the lowest cost to the taxpayer.</p><p>For example, while one firm may specialize in VDCs for physical building access, another might create an identity for software packages to help prevent the next SolarWinds catastrophe. Agencies responsible for our national security will be able to pick the best-in-breed solutions for their specific problems at competitive price points.</p><p>The use of open protocols to structure a competitive market for verifiable digital credentials can create an industry that boosts domestic cybersecurity strength. These solutions can also extend to private sector use cases, ensuring a strong commercial base, as was successful for the microchip industry.</p><p>Further, when security and privacy are incorporated at the shared protocol level, all implementations can start with the same baselines for ensuring against cyberattacks, unlawful surveillance, and the creation of risky data honeypots.</p><p>This architecture can work globally across public and private sectors to increase security, protecting against cyberattacks. It can ship with base technology that encourages individual freedoms while proving of little to no value to autocratic regimes. For instance, enshrining user privacy in the foundational technical standards could render the implementing systems unusable for mass surveillance of private activity, or the implementation of “social credit” systems.<br><br>By fostering an industry of best-in-class digital identity technologies, America can retain a leadership position in the global development of digital identity infrastructure to support the security across all of its critical infrastructure sectors and beyond.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Major sporting events offer huge opportunities and risks&nbsp;for gaming operators and players. Here, we share the top five things that operators need to be aware of during Euro 2024. 



<p>Whether you’re a football fan or not, the Euros (UEFA European Football Championship) is a monumental global occasion that, for the month it lasts, captivates the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in mid-June and running until mid-July, Euro 2024 will see 24 teams compete in a series of games in cities throughout Germany to be crowned the best football team in Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Major sporting events like the Euros and the World Cup are often a time for friends and family to congregate and perhaps bet on the outcomes of games, either with each other or via increasingly popular online gaming platforms.</p>



 Surge in [legal and illegal] gambling activity predicted. 



<p>As global sporting events have such broad appeal, they tend to attract both casual and regular bettors. Plus, due to the convenience and accessibility that online platforms now offer, betting during these periods is only getting more popular. Indeed, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-to-avoid-world-cup-betting-fraud/">betting during the 2022 World Cup increased by 13%</a> compared to the 2018 World Cup. Worryingly, the surge in gambling activity was seen on both regulated and unregulated sites. For example, in the UK alone, <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/black-market-world-cup">250,000 people visited unregulated, black-market sites during the World Cup</a> compared to just 80,0000 during the same timeframe of the previous year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First-time players may be lured to unregulated platforms by ‘too good to be true’ bonus offers. However, few are aware that these platforms do not offer consumer protection measures and come with a significantly higher risk of financial fraud or data breaches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, gambling on the black market poses problems for both the player and the business. Discover the reasons [and dangers] of why some players decide to forgo KYC and identity verification checks in favor of unregulated platforms in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/">blog, ‘In the grey: So, how exactly does online gambling work in Brazil?’</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">‘Exploring black market gambling in Germany.’</a></p>



 
   
     
                     Gambling regulations 101: Europe and the UK. 
                     Discover how gaming operators can keep pace with the ever-growing multi-jurisdictional landscape in Europe and beyond.

 Challenges of operating during Euro 2024. 



<p>Although they should be concerns for operators at any time of year, there is an increased likelihood of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gnoming-multi-accounting/">multi-accounting/gnoming</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and fake documentation during sign-ups throughout the Euro 2024 tournament. Here are the top five things that gambling operators need to be aware of during Euro 2024.&nbsp;</p>



  Increase in site traffic is often used by fraudsters as a smoke screen for nefarious activities. With these sudden surges of traffic, it can be considerably harder for operators to find anomalies, which could be indicative of fraud. In addition to the above, fraudsters may conduct identity theft, or attempt account takeovers by launching phishing attacks and cyberattacks on unsuspecting users. There is also increased likelihood of more cross border transactions attempts by bots.&nbsp;  



  Unsecured public Wi-Fi networks can pose a security risk for gaming and gambling operators, when players log in to place bets. Such networks are susceptible to interception by hackers, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts, exposure of sensitive personal information and potential financial losses for both users and operators. &nbsp;  



  Rising rates of gambling fraud, with chargeback fraud a particularly common issue. While identity verification solutions can help verify the identity of users and detect fraudulent activity, preventing chargeback fraud requires additional measures such as transaction monitoring and collaboration with payment processors to identify and block suspicious transactions in real time.&nbsp;  



  Lose market share. Increased competition from illegal or unlicensed operators – many of which may offer superior UX or sign-up bonuses or offer registration without KYC – pose challenges to regulated platforms. How to capture new customers and safeguard against potentially losing existing customers should be top of mind for all operators.&nbsp;  



  Heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement to ensure operators are doing everything possible to protect end users during these times of increased betting. Those who are found to have inadequate KYC and AML and age verification controls in place may be subjected to fines.  



<p>“The challenges operators face during major sporting tournaments are not necessarily any different to their regular daily compliance challenges, but the sheer volume of new players from all around the world, coupled with increased activity is likely to cause issues for unprepared operators,” said Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Euros 2024 will be a huge opportunity for gambling platforms, new and old, so it’s essential they get it right. They’ll need to onboard huge numbers of players and verify accounts thoroughly so that they’re onboarding the right players and effectively fighting fraud</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Regulations, risks and rewards of the European gambling market. 



<p>Although all global gambling platforms are likely to see an uptick in player onboarding, it will likely be European nations that share the same time zone as the tournament (CEST), that will see the most pronounced increase in usage. But, of course, with <a href="https://copaamerica.com/en/">Copa America</a> just around the corner and many Latin American countries preparing to launch their gambling regulations, similar opportunities and challenges await the LATAM market, which is well on its way to becoming the largest in the world.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2020/11/10/81248/europe-online-gambling-market-report-2020-2025-featuring-major-players-bet365-888-holdings-gvc-holdings-kindred-group-william-hill-and-betsson/">European online gambling market is expected to grow by 9.20% by 2025</a>, fuelled not only by the rising popularity of gambling and tournaments like the Euro 2024, but also by software and hardware innovations. According to a report published by the Statista Research Department, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/586185/gross-gambling-revenue-europe-by-country/">the five European countries with the highest Gross Gaming Revenue</a> are as follows:</p>



  United Kingdom: €15.99 billion&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Italy: €13.2 billion&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Germany: €12.1 billion&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;

<p>A special mention must also be made about the Netherlands; a market that only became regulated in recent years but has enjoyed rapid growth ever since. Learn more about the Netherlands in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/dutch-online-gambling-2022/">‘What a difference a year makes: The state of play in the Dutch online gambling market.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although regarded as a single state in relation to its economy, each of the 27 members of the European Union is responsible for passing its own laws. Because of this, online gaming regulations can be quite complex. Each European country essentially shapes its own gambling regulations.

  <p>Summary</p>
<p>In this episode, Simon and David discuss the convergence of identity and cybersecurity, particularly in the context of cloud adoption. They explore the challenges and opportunities that arise from this convergence and the impact on organizations of different sizes. They also touch on the confusion caused by the abundance of acronyms in the industry and the need for clarity and standardization. Overall, they emphasize the importance of protecting identity components and the critical role of identity in security. The conversation explores the challenges and opportunities in the identity and access management (IAM) space, with a focus on the importance of data management and the need for effective discovery and remediation processes. The fragmentation of identity systems and the lack of visibility into identities and their interactions are identified as key issues. The acquisition of Q Radar by Palo Alto is discussed as a potential game-changer in the IAM space. The conversation concludes with the recognition that while automation and AI have their place, human involvement is still crucial for effective remediation.</p>

The senatorial group is championing this initiative due to their concerns about AI’s potential to disrupt jobs and electoral processes and surpass human capabilities. Their proposal includes a targeted annual investment of at least $32 billion for non-defense AI innovation and emphasizes the need to outcompete countries like China. The plan also features a comprehensive AI research and development initiative, including an “AI-ready data” program and enhanced infrastructure for AI testing within government agencies.</p>

<p>In October 2022, Entrust published the article, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/nsa-announces-new-post-quantum-resistant-algorithm-suite-2-0-and-transition-timetable/">NSA Announces New Post-Quantum Resistant Algorithm Suite 2.0 and Transition Timetable</a>. At that time the National Security Agency was one of the first to put a firm line in the sand, publishing an aggressive timeline for the recommended adoption of post-quantum-resistant algorithms. It was a bit of a wake-up call to the digital security industry. Fast forward 18 months and we have a new updated version of the paper: <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/1/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF">The Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 and Quantum Computing FAQ</a>. Algorithm specifications, recommendations, and guidance are slowly starting to crystallize. The eagerly anticipated NIST standardized PQC (post-quantum cryptography) algorithms are set to be approved in summer 2024. You can <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization">check for updates here</a>.</p>
<p>At first glance, the algorithm suite looks unchanged:</p>

<p>Table: Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0</p>
<p>The newly assigned NIST names are now included in the table (see highlighted rows above) as we prepare to let go of the names CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, chosen originally by the cryptographers who designed the algorithms. These are now replaced by the more formal ML-DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) and ML-KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism), a set of algorithms that can be used to establish a shared secret key between two parties communicating over a public channel. These algorithms now have FIPS Publications, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.ipd.pdf">FIPS PUB 203</a> and <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.204.ipd.pdf">204</a> respectively, assigned to them. The paper also includes an informative FAQ section and some guidance on which PQC algorithms can be used in which situation. Some key areas to note include:</p>
 NIST SP 800-208 
<p>Regarding stateful hash-based signature schemes, published in 2020, the NSA has only approved LMS and XMSS for use in National Security Systems (NSS). The multi-tree algorithms HSS and XMSSMT are not allowed, although no explanation has been given for this decision.</p>
 Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard (SLH-DSA) 
<p>Known to many as SPHINCS+, despite being hash-based, it cannot be used to sign software. It’s not part of the CNSA and is not approved for use.</p>
 FIPS Approval of LMS and XMSS Signing Algorithms 
<p>Hardware security modules (HSMs) are discussed in relation to certification/FIPS approval of LMS and XMSS signing algorithms. For validating signatures, they must have passed NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).</p>
 Hardware Security Modules and the Use of LMS and XMSS 
<p>Code signing applications using HSMs will need to be validated to NIST’s Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). LMS and XMSS algorithms are stateful, meaning they use one-time signatures and when deployed can only produce a finite number of signatures before a new public/private key needs to be generated. See the illustration below for a visual of the stateful key generation process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Illustration of the stateful generation of derived keys</p>
<p>The private key is a random seed that derives a new private key for each signature. To maintain their security properties, the private key must be used in conjunction with a counter. This is what limits derived private keys to only generate a single signature. The CNSA 2.0 paper further highlights the concern that these private keys, if backed up or migrated to multiple devices, could break the “one-signature-per-derived-private-key” rule. The NSA’s opening position was to forbid export of keys created using these algorithms regardless of whether they’re encrypted or not. While some vendors still believe in the doctrine of storing keys in the box, in the physical memory of the HSM, most vendors have followed Entrust’s long-standing approach: Store keys as encrypted fragments, tokens, or key blobs – whichever terminology you prefer – outside of the physical HSM. The HSM-vendor community, including Entrust, have raised strong objections with the NSA proposal since that would create a single point of failure and severely limit the lifespan of an HSM. Deployments of HSMs are typically configured in pairs where resilience, availability, and backing up keys is standard practice. The NSA has agreed to look at supporting exports without the detrimental impact on the integrity of the algorithm’s security. We’ll continue to keep you updated on the outcome on their review.</p>
 Firmware Signatures – Begin Transitioning Immediately 
<p>The updated CNSA 2.0 paper also explains the rationale for the prioritization of firmware signatures in their timeline, recognizing that in this use case, the validation algorithm is not easily updated.</p>
 
 “Software- and firmware-signing: begin transitioning immediately, support and prefer CNSA 2.0 by 2025 where available, exclusively use CNSA 2.0 by 2030.” 
 
<p>Further, the paper explains, “even in systems that are designed for extensibility and cryptographic agility, a quantum-resistant root of trust may be required in the firmware years before the rest of the system upgrades to quantum-resistance. NSA prioritizes this in our timelines to avoid unexpected costs and security issues later in our transition.”</p>
<p>The NSA is recognizing the role that HSMs as a root of trust play in signing firmware, which then acts as the foundation layer of an organization’s cryptographic stack. With 2025 only months away, Entrust is already working on firmware that is safe from a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC).</p>
 ML-DSA for Firmware or Software Signing 
<p>The paper recognizes that firmware roots of trust are long-term and, “are a critical component to upgrade…expected to be implemented for some long-lived signatures in 2025, before validated ML-DSA is widely available.” This is impactful for Entrust and our customer base.</p>
 Deployment of CNSA 2.0 Algorithms in Mission Systems 
<p>The paper encourages algorithm deployment as soon as available and recommends, “testing in vendor and government research environments now to understand the effects of deployment of the new algorithms on particular systems given the increased sizes used in these algorithms.”</p>
 Hybrid Solutions 
<p>The FAQ section covers the NSA’s position on hybrid cryptographic solutions, using a combination of both classic and post-quantum cryptography. The idea is that until PQC algorithms are standardized and proven in the field, hybrid covers both bases – if the classic algorithms are compromised by a CRQC, the PQC algorithm will protect the data. Equally, if the PQC algorithm was found to be weak, the classic algorithm will still provide some level of protection. According to <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/1/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF">the paper</a>, “the NSA has confidence in CNSA 2.0 algorithms and will not require NSS developers to use hybrid certified products for security purposes.” They further state in the paper that, “NSA recognizes that some standards may require using hybrid-like constructions to accommodate the larger sizes of CRQC algorithms and will work with industries on the best options for implementation.”</p>
<p>The NSA explained their reservations about hybrid deployments are due to concerns on complexity, compatibility, and the fact that hybrid deployments are an interim solution and will need to be migrated in the future to solely PQC algorithms.</p>
<p>However, the hybrid approach has support in the industry. Some highlight the ill-fated SIKE algorithm, which made it to the 4th round of the NIST competition only to falter and be broken on a laptop, as an example of what can happen to emerging post-quantum cryptography. Hybrid adds an extra layer of protection in case the PQC algorithm turns out to be vulnerable. I’ve published blog posts about my colleagues at Entrust actively involved in the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/06/post-quantum-cryptography-advancesunder-the-hood/">specification of composite signatures</a> in conjunction with the Internet Engineering Task Force.</p>
<p>In summary, in the space of 18 months the PQC position has moved forward. We can anticipate some of the NIST PQC short-listed algorithms to be standardized in summer 2024. What was theoretical and fuzzy a couple of years ago is starting to take shape. Timelines are firming up and the NIST and NSA are being prescriptive on which algorithms should be adopted in which particular use case, and by when.</p>
<p>For organizations who are following NSA recommendations and want to experiment now, Entrust offers a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/sites/default/files/documentation/datasheets/entrust-pqc-option-pack-ds.pdf">PQC Option Pack</a> for use in conjunction with our nShield HSMs. It supports the NIST’s PQC algorithms identified for standardization.

  <p>The emergence of cloud technology and the hybrid work model, along with the rapidly increasing intensity and sophistication of cyber threats, are significantly reshaping the work landscape. As organizational boundaries become increasingly blurred, private applications and resources that were once secure for authenticated users are now vulnerable to intrusion from compromised systems and users. When users connect to a corporate network through a traditional virtual private network (VPN), they’re granted extensive access to the entire network, which potentially poses significant security risks. These challenges have introduced new demands that traditional network security approaches struggle to meet. Even <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-13-gartner-identifies-three-factors-influencing-growth-i">Gartner predicts</a> that by 2025, at least 70% of new remote access deployments will be served predominantly by ZTNA as opposed to VPN services, up from less than 10% at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a>, part of Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution, securely connects users to any private resource and application, reducing the operational complexity and risk of legacy VPNs. It enhances the security posture of your organization by eliminating excessive access and preventing lateral movement. As traditional VPN enterprise protections continue to wane, Private Access improves a user’s ability to connect securely to private applications easily from any device and any network—whether they are working at home, remotely, or in their corporate office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Private Access (Preview), you can now implement granular app segmentation and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) on any on-premises resource authenticating to domain controller (DC) for on-premises users, across all devices and protocols without granting full network access. You can also protect your DCs from identity threats and prevent unauthorized access by simply enabling privileged access to the DCs by enforcing MFA and Privileged Identity Management (PIM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance your security posture and minimize the attack surface, it’s crucial to implement robust Conditional Access controls, such as MFA, across all private resources and applications including legacy or proprietary applications that may not support modern auth. By doing so, you can safeguard your DCs—the heart of your network infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A closer look at the mechanics of Private Access for on-prem user scenario 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how Private Access helps secure access to on-prem resources and applications and provides a seamless way for employees to access the on-premises resources when they’re locally accessing these resources, while ensuring the security of the company's critical services. Imagine a scenario where an employee is working on-premises at their company's headquarters. They need to access the company's DCs to retrieve some important information for their project or make some changes. However, when they try to access the DC directly, they find that access is blocked. This is because the company has enabled privileged access, which restricts direct access to the DC for security reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of accessing the DC directly, the employee's traffic is intercepted by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/concept-clients">Global Secure Access Client</a> and routed to the Microsoft Entra ID and Private Access Cloud for authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access the DC and its resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the employee attempts to access the private resources they need, they’re prompted to authenticate using MFA. This additional layer of security ensures that only legitimate users can gain entry to the DC. Private Access also extends MFA to all on-premises resources, even those that lack built-in MFA support. This means that even legacy applications can benefit from the added security of MFA. With Private Access, the company has also enabled granular app segmentation, which allows them to segment access to specific applications or resources within their on-premises environment. This means that the employee can only interact with the services they’re authorized to access, ensuring the security of critical services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these added security measures, the employee's user experience remains seamless. Only authentication traffic leaves the corporate network, while application traffic remains local within the corporate network. This minimizes latency and ensures that the employee can access the information they need quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Private Access enforces flexible MFA to on-prem resources for on-prem users, strengthening your security posture and minimizing your attack surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key benefits: Elevate network access security to on-premises resources with Private Access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations seeking to enhance the security of their on-premises resources and protect their critical assets, including DCs, against identity threats can benefit from the key capabilities provided by Private Access—in preview. With Private Access, organizations can enable granular segmented access and extend Conditional Access controls to all their private applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access allows for the implementation of MFA for private apps that use DC for authentication, adding an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access and reduce identity-related risks. By enabling granular segmented access policies for individual applications or groups, organizations can ensure that only authorized users interact with critical resources and services. Additionally, Private Access extends Conditional Access controls to all private resources, even those relying on legacy protocols, allowing organizations to consider factors such as application sensitivity, user risk, and network compliance when enforcing modern authentication methods across their entire environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access provides granular access controls on all private applications for any user- on-premises or remote while bridging the gap between legacy applications and modern security practices. The capabilities of Private Access provide new tools to confidently enable secure access to private apps that use DC for authentication and navigate the complex landscape of modern authentication and access controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Navigating the complexities of SOC 2 compliance is daunting. Said more simply: getting SOC 2 certified sucks. It will always suck some, but it won’t suck quite as much if you’re using YeshID.</p>
<p>Certification is important and becoming vital. Certification assures others that your systems are secure, their data will be protected, and your processes align with stringent regulatory standards. More and more companies will refuse to do business with you if you aren’t SOC 2-certified. You may be familiar with companies like <a href="https://www.vanta.com/">Vanta</a>, <a href="https://drata.com/">Drata</a> &amp; <a href="https://secureframe.com/">Secureframe</a> that help with certification. We’ve gotten SOC 2 certified with their help.</p>
<p>SOC 2 certification requires well-defined access management protocols and evidence that the protocols are being followed. The first part is “relatively” easy: anyone can design a protocol. The second part is hard, and it’s where YeshID helps big-time. YeshID simplifies and streamlines identity &amp; access management (instead of cobbling together checklists, spreadsheets, and ticketing systems). And YeshID keeps track of what you do. YeshID helps you get SOC 2 (and stay SOC 2) with more SOCcess.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works.&nbsp;</p>
 CC and SOC 2 
<p>Almost everyone knows that CC stands for the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation and that it’s an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for computer security certification. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Criteria">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/index.cfm">CC website</a>)</p>
<p>Almost everyone knows that SOC 2, or Service Organization Control Type 2, is a cybersecurity framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in 2010.</p>
<p>And almost everyone knows the relationship between SOC 2 and the Common Criteria. But for the one or two readers who don’t know, we’ve spelled out some of the connections and how YeshID helps.</p>
 Logical and Physical Access Controls 
<p>SOC 2 compliance ensures that only authorized personnel can access your systems and data. YeshID excels in managing access controls:</p>
 
 Production Deployment Access Control (CC 6.1): YeshID restricts access to production deployments by controlling who can modify application access. This ensures that only authorized personnel can deploy changes to production environments. 
 Access Reviews (CC 6.2, CC 6.3, CC 6.4): Conducting quarterly access reviews is a crucial part of maintaining SOC 2 compliance. YeshID facilitates these reviews by providing comprehensive information on user access rights, helping you ensure that access is appropriately restricted and any required changes are tracked to completion. 
 Restricted Database and Network Access (CC 6.1): YeshID helps restrict privileged access to production databases and networks to authorized users with a business need. By controlling application-level permissions, YeshID indirectly restricts access to critical systems. 
 Remote Access MFA (CC 6.6): YeshID integrates with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) solutions to enforce MFA for remote access, ensuring that only authorized employees can access production systems remotely. 
 
 Enhancing Processing Integrity and System Operations 
<p>Maintaining the integrity of your data processing and monitoring system operations are vital components of SOC 2 compliance. YeshID supports these areas through:</p>
 
 Change Management (CC 8.1, CC 5.3, CC 7.1): YeshID enforces change management procedures by requiring approvals and tracking changes in access rights. This ensures all changes are authorized, documented, tested, and reviewed before implementation. 
 Log Management (CC 2.1): YeshID generates logs for actions such as account provisioning, deprovisioning, and access modifications, which are essential for auditing and reviewing system changes. 
 
 Supporting Control Environment and Communication 
<p>A robust control environment and effective communication are essential for SOC 2 compliance. YeshID helps in these areas by:</p>
 
 Code of Conduct and Confidentiality Agreements (CC 1.1): YeshID can require employees to acknowledge the company’s code of conduct and sign confidentiality agreements during onboarding, ensuring a commitment to integrity and ethical values. 
 Security Awareness Training (CC 1.4, CC 2.2): YeshID ensures employees complete security awareness training during onboarding and annually thereafter, helping maintain a high level of security awareness across the organization. 
 Roles and Responsibilities (CC 1.3, CC 1.4, CC 1.5): YeshID specifies the roles and responsibilities of employees for various systems and applications, ensuring that everyone is aware of their internal control responsibilities. 
 System Changes Communication (CC 2.2): YeshID logs changes to access rights, effectively communicating system changes to authorized internal users. 
 
 Seamless Onboarding and Offboarding 
<p>Managing employee access throughout their lifecycle is a critical aspect of SOC 2 compliance. YeshID excels in:</p>
 
 Onboarding New Users (CC 6.2): YeshID simplifies the registration and authorization of new internal and external users, ensuring that only authorized users are granted system access. 
 Revoking Access Upon Termination (CC 6.3, CC 6.5): YeshID facilitates the offboarding process by revoking access for terminated employees, ensuring compliance with termination policies and reducing the risk of unauthorized access. 
 Unique Account Authentication (CC 6.1): YeshID integrates with authentication systems to enforce unique account authentication, ensuring each user has a unique username and password or authorized SSH keys. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>With YeshID, you can streamline your IAM processes, enhance security, and ensure compliance. Our robust features help you manage employee access, conduct thorough access reviews, enforce change management procedures, and maintain a secure control environment.</p>
<p>Get SOC 2 certified and stay SOC 2 certified with YeshID. Let us help you simplify the complexities of managing employee access and achieve SOCcess. Try for <a href="https://app.yeshid.com/login?redirect=%2F">free now</a>!</p>

<p>I’ve been speaking and writing a lot recently about the newly legislated Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS).</p>
 
 <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/talking-digital-id-with-nab">Talking Digital ID with NAB </a> 
 <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-ep9-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">Conserving the IDs</a> we are already familiar with instead coming up with new ones 
 The need to <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity">keep Digital ID small</a> (and simple). 
 
 Digital ID caught between the old and the new 
<p>In some ways, AGDIS embodies fresh thinking, such as the pivot away from abstract “digital identity” to the more concrete Digital ID.</p>
<p>On the other hand, AGDIS tries to leverage the federal government’s long-standing “Trusted Digital Identity Framework” (TDIF) which was conceived a decade ago for the purposes of single sign-on to tax and human services. TDIF predates modern digital wallets and verifiable credentials. It is a creature of an earlier era.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there are mixed messages around AGDIS.</p>
<p>Will it furnish Australians with “reusable” proof of identity? Will it come with new ID numbers and a central registry? Or will it simply better protect our many existing IDs in digital form? And what is an “ID” anyway?</p>
<p>Minister Katy Gallagher has assured us that there is no new national ID, and indeed, there is nothing I can see in the Digital ID Bill about new numbers or a central registry.</p>
 The last thing we need is a novel ID 
<p>And according to Lockstep’s research, there is no fundamental need for anything new of that type. You see, proof of identity works reasonably well today using familiar IDs like driver licences, passports, birth certificates and social security cards.</p>
<p>Or I should say, proof of identity works well in real life.</p>
<p>But identification breaks down in cyberspace when these IDs are presented as plaintext to online processes. Web forms and web servers can’t tell if a plaintext ID has been presented by its rightful holder or by a fraudster who’s bought the data on the black market.</p>
<p>Almost all identity fraud now occurs online; very little fraud is attempted in person using counterfeit ID documents. So that tells us that the logic of using government IDs for identification remains sound in the digital age — if only we made the presentation in the digital realm as reliable as it is in the physical world.</p>
 Pivot away from plaintext presentation — again! 
<p>The real problem to solve is not “identity” but identification, and specifically, making the government IDs we use day-to-day more reliable online.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials technology is the solution. We should ‘seal’ existing IDs into digital wallets and then present them digitally, from device-to-server, instead of manually typing ID details into forms.</p>
<p>And the really good news is there’s a precedent for this transition. We’ve done it before! The world shifted from plaintext to digital IDs for handling credit card numbers — when chip cards replaced magnetic stripes.</p>
<p>Now we have smart phone wallets alongside chip cards, with exactly the same cryptographic security that protects cardholder details against theft and cloning.</p>
<p>Consumer acceptance today of digital wallets is high and growing; over one third of all card payments in Australia are now done via a digital wallet (Reference: <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2023/the-evolving-retail-payments-landscape.html">Reserve Bank of Australia</a>). So verifiable credentials are commonplace.</p>
 It’s all about data quality 
<p>What excites me the most is that AGDIS shows a way forward for all data.</p>
<p>The government in its wisdom is making the ACCC the Digital ID regulator. The ACCC currently governs the Consumer Data Right (CDR), Australia regulatory regime for open banking and data sharing. Now, the CDR is not perfect, but it features a strong regulatory model, it sits in the right place with the ACCC, and it is extensible to the protection of Digital IDs.</p>
<p>The CDR is essentially a governance systems for data flows, tracing where certain data has come from, where it’s going, what is it being used for, and above all, carrying consent for the data to be used in defined contexts.</p>
<p>I see CDR and Digital ID boiling down to data and metadata, in the broadest sense of that word.</p>
<p>That is, what are the properties of a data record that really matter when deciding whether to use it for some application? Where did the record come from? What is its intended purpose? If it’s a personal data record, then what consent was granted for its usage?</p>
<p>The same sort of metadata is routinely baked into verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Remember that a verifiable credential is a data record holding one or more assertions about a person or entity (i.e. the credential subject) together with details of the credential issuer and metadata such as when, where, how and why the credential was issued.</p>
<p>So, with the ACCC governing data sharing and verifiable IDs, we could see a uniform new approach to managing data quality. Remember the pattern. In any critical digital transaction, there will be something precise you need to know about the counterparty. So ask yourself:</p>
 
 What do you need to know about the party you’re transacting with? 
 Where will your transaction system get that data when you need it? 
 And how will the system check know that it’s fit for purpose? 
 
<p>If we can govern that pattern consistently across the digital economy, then we will be able to solve a set of problems that are much bigger and much more important than identity. We can take care of the quality of all data.</p>
 Governing all data quality 
<p>The same data quality questions recur everywhere we look.</p>
<p>The wicked problems with deep fakes arise because we consumers can’t tell where the data is coming from. But a governance regime is within sight to provide quality signals (i.e. metadata) about any important data.</p>
<p>Consider an online image or article, or any piece of content online: what if you could be sure where the digital data has really come from, that it’s intact and genuine? We have the technology to authenticate authors and publishers and AI algorithms, anchored in verifiable credentials with certified hardware roots of trust.</p>
<p>If this looks complicated, then let me reiterate that we have already pivoted to digital presentation of payment card data. Banks routinely provision cardholder data in the form of verifiable credentials, a growing proportion of consumers are comfortable with digital wallets, and merchants can readily accept payments from digital devices, with radically reduced incidence of card fraud.</p>
<p>Australians could soon be presenting any Digital ID with the click of a button from a mobile digital wallet, with exactly the same privacy, security and ease of use as a card payment.</p>
<p>Looking to the future of data sharing, with AGDIS and CDR under the same regulatory umbrella, I see us heading towards a united governance regime for all important data. We can be sure where any data has come from, what it is supposed to be used for, and that it’s always been in the right hands.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 1st May to 15th May&nbsp;2024 <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. Here, we will analyze the latest developments in the US and Nigerian cryptocurrency regulations scene and what these changes mean for the&nbsp;users.</p> US Inches Closer to Clear Crypto&nbsp;Rules <p>The US is all set to take a significant step with the FIT21 Act, which is headed for a House vote soon. This act aims to clear up the murky waters of crypto regulation in the US by defining what counts as a commodity and what counts as a security.</p><p>Why is this a big&nbsp;deal?</p><p>Specifically, the bill gives the CFTC more control over digital commodities — a move welcomed by many in the industry who see the CFTC as more friendly to the crypto landscape compared to the&nbsp;SEC.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/999909Frank/status/1789423489843179662">Image Source</a>)<p>The SEC has taken a more aggressive stance, evident in its numerous lawsuits against major players like Coinbase and Ripple&nbsp;Labs.</p><p>This clearer division of oversight could help companies navigate the market more confidently, knowing which regulatory body they will primarily interact&nbsp;with.</p><p>The takeaway: If the proposed bill passes, we may see a boost in crypto investments in the US as the market becomes well-regulated, as Sen. Hill noted in the Friday press&nbsp;release:</p><p>“As the collapse of FTX demonstrated, we need strong consumer protections and a functional regulatory framework to ensure the rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem is safe for investors and consumers while securing America as a leader in blockchain innovation.”</p> Nigeria to Ban Peer-to-Peer Crypto&nbsp;Trading <p>Switching gears to Nigeria, the country’s government is proposing a ban on peer-to-peer crypto trading to stabilize its currency, the&nbsp;naira.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1787853505039904810">Image Source</a>)<p>The Nigerian government believes that its currency has been feeling the heat from unregulated crypto activities.</p><p>Why does this&nbsp;matter?</p><p>P2P platforms are a lifeline for many Nigerians to access cryptocurrencies, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. By banning these, the government hopes to control currency fluctuations but at the risk of pushing crypto trading into the&nbsp;shadows.</p><p>The takeaway: This move could backfire by making crypto transactions in Nigeria less transparent and harder to regulate in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>On the one hand, we have the US, where several ongoing developments aim to provide a clearer regulatory situation for the crypto industry, be it for better or worse. On the other hand, Nigeria is now tightening controls, which might restrict access for everyday users and push trading activities underground. The impact of these differing strategies on their respective markets will be an important development to&nbsp;watch.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-mexico">Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Mexico</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-indonesia">Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Indonesia</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-nigeria">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Nigeria</a></p><p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>In previous resilience blog posts, we’ve shared updates about the continuous improvements we’re making to resilience and reliability, including our most recent update on <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-resilience-update-workload-identity/ba-p/4094704">regionally isolated authentication endpoints</a> and an announcement last year of our industry-leading and first of its kind <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/advances-in-azure-ad-resilience/ba-p/2147048">backup authentication service</a>. These and other innovations behind the scenes enable us to deliver consistently very high rates of availability globally each month. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll outline what we’re doing to help customers see how available and resilient Microsoft Entra really is for them, to not only hold us accountable when issues arise, but also better understand what actions to take within their tenant to improve its health. At the global level, you see it in the form of retrospective <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/reference-sla-performance">SLA reporting</a>, which shows authentication availability exceeding our 4 9s promise (<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/99-99-uptime-for-azure-active-directory/ba-p/1999628">launched in spring 2021</a>) by a wide margin and reaching 5 9s in most months. But it becomes more compelling and actionable at the tenant level: what is the uptime experience of my users on my organization’s apps and devices? Is my tenant handling surges in sign-in demand?  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We often hear from customers about the effect on resilience insights when they move to the cloud. In the on-prem world, identity health monitoring occurred onsite and with tight control; operational awareness happened entirely within a company’s first-party IT department. Now, we need to achieve that same transparency or better in an outsourced, cloud-based identity service and with a federated set of dependencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IT departments and developers are working hard to ensure each of their users maintains seamless, uninterrupted access that doesn’t compromise security. Enabling access for the right users with minimal friction while stopping intrusions and risk is critical to keep the world running. When an organization outsources their identity service to Microsoft, they expect us to acknowledge degradations when they happen, then take accountability to learn and continuously improve from those events. We also recognize that human-driven communication can only take us so far.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To meet these challenges, we’re increasingly embracing granular monitoring and automation. We start from the assumption that the unexpected will find a way of happening in any complex system, no matter how resilient it is. Beyond resilience, we must detect incidents, respond to them effectively, and improve as we go—and help our customers do the same. You see examples of this approach both in our rollout of in-tenant health monitoring and in our investments behind the scenes aimed at fast incident detection and communication. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s start with out-of-the-box automated health monitoring in premium tenants. Tenant-level health monitoring empowers customers to independently understand the quality of their users’ experiences with authentication and access. It also sets the stage to prompt tenant administrators with actions they can take to investigate and reduce disruptions, all from Microsoft Entra admin center or using MS Graph API calls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve taken a step in this direction by introducing a group of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-microsoft-entra-health">precomputed health metric streams</a> that enable our premium customers to watch key authentication scenarios, an early milestone in our investments to enhance transparent visibility into tenant health and service resilience. These new health metrics isolate relevant signals from activity logs and provide pre-computed, low-latency aggregates every 15 minutes for specific high-value observability scenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With their granularity and scenario-specific focus, health metrics go a step beyond the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/increasing-transparency-into-azure-active-directory-s-resilience/ba-p/2147047">monthly tenant-level SLA reporting</a> we released in 2023. Precomputed health metrics also supplement the activity log data that we’ve been providing and continue to improve on. With sign-in logs, customers can build their own computed metrics to monitor, like isolating a specific sign-in method to watch for increases in success and failure. With our new precomputed streams, customers can snap to Microsoft-defined indicators of health, take advantage of features we’re developing at scale, and dive into activity logs for deeper investigations. We encourage customers to make use of both options to get a full picture. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the initial public preview offering, we’re releasing health metric streams related to maintaining highly available:  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Multifactor authentication (MFA) &nbsp; 
 
 
 Sign-ins for devices that are managed under Conditional Access policies &nbsp; 
 
 
 Sign-ins for devices that are compliant with Conditional Access policies &nbsp; 
 
 
 Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) sign-ins  &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re starting with authentication-related scenarios because they are mission critical to all our customers, but other scenarios in areas like entitlement management, directory configuration, and app health will be added in time along with intelligent alerting capabilities in response to anomalous patterns in the data. We’re publishing the health metrics in Microsoft Entra admin center, Azure Portal, and M365 admin center, as well as in Microsoft Graph for programmatic access and integration into other monitoring pipelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about how to access the health monitoring metrics, visit the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-microsoft-entra-health">Microsoft Learn documentation</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure shows the Scenario monitoring landing page &amp; the Sign in with MFA scenario details</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even as in-tenant observability improves, customers will still rely on traditional incident communications when Microsoft-side issues happen. Like all service providers, we push messages about incidents to affected customers and post service health announcements to a website and communications feed in Azure. However, when this approach relies solely on hand-crafted service monitors and human-driven communications, it has limitations. Customers are right to have concerns about the timeliness of communication and the monitoring coverage itself.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address this challenge, we’re building increasingly sophisticated default monitoring packages attached to automated communications. The early results are promising. We’ve been able to bring times to notify customers about incidents down significantly, with service degradations and downtime being communicated within about 10 minutes of auto-detection. We’re also catching service degradations increasingly early by investing in monitoring, the results of which we track by watching customer-reported incident volumes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp; best incidents are the ones that never happen. Our goal is to find and mitigate problems before they impact our customers. So, in addition to advances, we continue to prioritize building systematic resilience measures to prevent service degradations and outages or auto-mitigate them before they affect a customer environment. We will share more on this in a future blog.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To continuously improve our services in partnership with our customers, we’re combining improvements in our service-level safety net with tenant-level monitoring. We’re also expanding our monitored scenarios, boosting our out-of-the-box monitoring intelligence, and speeding up our communication. Plus, integration with Azure, M365, and Microsoft Graph ensures that Microsoft Entra observability can happen wherever it’s needed. Together, we’re making sure everyone can work securely and seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With our already strong foundation of availability and resilience, security-enhancing recommendations, and mature service monitoring and incident communications, we’re excited to see these new capabilities take Entra health transparency to the next level.   &nbsp;</p>

  <p>In the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023">Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023 (MDDR)</a>, we shared that on average, there are 11 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#anomalous-token">token replay</a> detections per 100,000 active users in Microsoft Entra ID each month. In addition, there are approximately 18,000 multifactor authentication (MFA) fatigue attempts observed per month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest developments in Entra ID Protection help you reduce the risks of these attacks by making it easier to deploy risk policies, understand their impact, and protect your organization from emerging threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the highlights:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Deploying Entra ID Protection just became easier with Microsoft-managed policies in your environment and an impact analysis workbook.&nbsp; 
  You can now investigate and remediate compromised users faster with help from Copilot and expansion of self-remediation to hybrid users.&nbsp; 
  You can also fine-tune the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm by providing feedback and identify and block token theft and suspicious actions taken by an attacker within Entra ID with new detections.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep reading to learn more!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Deploy with ease and confidence 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft managed policies and impact analysis workbook</p>
<p>Identity and access management is a huge responsibility requiring diligence and expertise. Between policies across identity, infrastructure, network, devices, apps, and data—and weighing the impact to end users and security—there’s a lot on your plate. To help with this, we have two exciting updates so you can get started with protecting your users faster and easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we announced in November, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/managed-policies">Microsoft-managed Policies</a> will enable some of our most valuable Conditional Access polices by default in select tenants, including requiring end users to perform MFA when we detect high risk to their sign in. This policy blocks attackers and allows your users to self-remediate their risk. We’re enabling Microsoft-managed policies slowly and deliberately to make sure we can incorporate your feedback and maximize value for you. Learn more about our approach to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/managed-policies">managed policies in our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that changes to how your users authenticate into resources require thoughtful consideration, and it’s helpful to know how the changes will affect your unique environment. Our new Impact analysis of risk-based access workbook will help you see the precise impact of turning on risk-based Conditional Access Policies so you can enable a new policy with confidence. The workbook uses historical sign-in data to allow you to immediately see the impact the policy would have had, with no report-only policy required. You can try out the new workbook <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/workbook-risk-based-policy-impact">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New dashboard generally available 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/what-s-new-with-microsoft-entra-id-protection/ba-p/3773132">Entra ID Protection launched a new dashboard</a> that presents risk insights for your tenant at a glance. We’re excited to announce today that this experience is now generally available and is the default landing page of ID Protection. The dashboard will give you a better understanding of your tenant’s security posture through key metrics, graphics, and recommended actions to improve your organization’s security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general availability, the attack counts in the Attacks Graphic are also now clickable, and you can easily navigate to them in the Risk Detections report to further investigate. The Risk Detections report has this new “Attack type” column, showing the primary attack type based on MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques for the detections. This further empowers your admins and SOC teams to understand the risks and take actions accordingly. See the risk detection to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/id-protection-dashboard#risk-detection-type-to-mitre-attack-type-mapping">MIRTE ATT&amp;CK type mapping</a>&nbsp;in our documentation.</p>

 Investigate and remediate efficiently 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On-premises password reset remediates user risk of compromise (general availability)</p>
<p>Our new feature to allow on-premises password changes to reset user risk is now generally available for Entra P1 and P2 customers. This feature allows hybrid customers to include their users in risk-based Conditional Access polices that require user password remediation. If you were waiting for GA to enable this feature, now is the time to do so to make user risk policies easier to manage. Visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock#allow-on-premises-password-reset-to-remediate-user-risks-preview">Remediate risks and unblock users in Entra ID Protection</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User Risk Investigation Copilot in public preview</p>
<p>Learning more about a user’s risk level and recommendations on how to mitigate a user’s risk is easier than ever with the introduction of the User Risk Investigation skill in Microsoft Entra, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-adds-identity-skills-to-copilot-for-security/ba-p/4081857">which is available in public preview as a part of Copilot for Security</a>. This skill summarizes the risk history of the user, how to remediate risk for that user, and how to scale and automate response and remediation to identity threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin notices that a user has been flagged as high risk due to a series of abnormal sign-ins. With Copilot for Security, the admin can quickly investigate and resolve the risk by clicking on the user in question to receive an immediate summary of risk and instructions for remediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved Threat Prevention and Remediation Capabilities 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple new detections have been introduced to Entra ID Protection that protect against new and emerging attack vectors, like anomalous graph usage, token theft, and attacker in the middle (AitM) attacks. In addition, hybrid tenants can now be confident that user risk is resolved when a password is reset on-premises, and all tenants can benefit from our new functionality that takes your feedback into account when determining if an event is risky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suspicious API traffic detection (general availability)</p>
<p>When entering an environment, attackers often search for information about users and tenant configuration to prepare for further exploitation. ID Protection will now change a user’s risk level if we observe them making an abnormally high number of calls to MS Graph and AAD Graph compared to that user’s baseline, which will help identify both compromised users and insider threats scavenging for intel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detecting token theft in real-time and post-breach</p>
<p>With token-based attacks on the rise, you need detections that help you identify and protect against this emerging threat. Two new detections in ID Protection help you do this. Our industry-first Real-time Anomalous Token Detection automatically disrupts token replay attacks in real-time when paired with a risk-based Conditional Access for sign-ins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also built an offline detection that extends coverage of Microsoft 365 Defender’s Attacker in the Middle signals. This detection will flag the impacted user with high risk to prompt the configured Conditional Access user risk policy, allowing customers to confirm or dismiss the risk on the user. The session token is also revoked in cases where Continuous Access Evaluation is enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more about our new detections at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks">What are risk detections?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Admin feedback on detections trains our ML 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hold our detections in Entra ID to a very high standard, but occasionally we do issue a false positive detection. You can now help train our ML models by acting on risky sign-ins. You can confirm a sign-in as risky, safe, or dismiss risk. Each of these will send information back to our ML model and optimize future detections for your organization. You can learn more about giving Entra ID Protection risk feedback <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-risk-feedback#how-does-microsoft-entra-id-use-my-risk-feedback">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope your organization can benefit from these new detections and features and that you will revisit the positive impact that risk-based Conditional Access can have on your organization's security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>Professor William McCarthy teaches accounting and information systems at Michigan State University and is the innovator of a new way of accounting called Resources-Events-Agents (REA).&nbsp;</p><p>In this exclusive interview, Professor McCarthy talks about how traditional accounting systems have a hard time keeping track of value flows and supporting practices that help the environment.&nbsp;</p><p>He says that the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-entry.asp?ref=blog.holochain.org">double-entry bookkeeping method</a>, which started in Venice in the 1400s, makes it harder to understand the real economy and work towards sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>So as companies face challenges with modern supply chains and the need for more sustainable economies, Professor McCarthy's work on REA offers an interesting take on the future of accounting.</p><p>Let’s dive in.&nbsp;</p> Limitations of Traditional Accounting <p>For hundreds of years, accountants have used a method called double-entry bookkeeping. This method was first used by merchants in Venice, Italy, in the 1400s. They used math and wrote things down on paper to keep track of their business deals.</p><p>But Professor McCarthy says this old way of accounting doesn't work well anymore. It doesn't show the whole story of what's really happening in the economy. When something happens, like when two companies trade goods, traditional accounting quickly turns it into simple numbers and accounts, stripping away the context and rich data of the transaction. It doesn't keep all the important details.</p><p>This makes it hard for companies to understand their supply chains and how their actions impact the environment. The old accounting method is like telling a story but leaving out key parts. And Professor McCarthy thinks it’s time for change.&nbsp;</p> The REA Accounting Model <p>Professor McCarthy has a different idea. He calls it Resources-Events-Agents, or REA for short. REA is like a new language for accounting that focuses on telling the whole economic story. "We often characterize REA as economic storytelling," Professor McCarthy explains.</p><p>In REA, instead of just writing down numbers, accountants keep track of all the important stuff. They look at the resources being traded, the events happening, and the people or companies involved. It's like writing a detailed story that doesn't leave anything out. "I found a new way of [telling economic stories] using Entity Relationship modeling, and later other things, that was called R E A, because “R” means the two resources that they were going to swap; “A” means to two agents who are at arm's length with each other; and “E” very simply means the process of sending things across this way." Professor McCarthy explains.</p><p>With REA, it's easier to see how things are connected. For example, if a company sells something, REA would keep track of what was sold, who bought it, and how it affects things like inventory and contracts. This gives a clearer picture of the economy. Imagine a visual story… "You have a customer called Charlie who will make a sale of inventory. And we put an object into the system, and it's described as a sale or shipment," Professor McCarthy elaborates.</p><p>Professor McCarthy says REA is like building a big, detailed map of how a company works. This map can help companies make better decisions and understand their impact on the world around them.</p> Implications for Regeneration and Sustainability <p>REA accounting could be a game-changer for companies trying to be more sustainable and regenerative. By tracking the flow of resources, events, and agents across a supply chain, REA provides a more comprehensive picture of a company’s environmental and social impact. "The best example I've seen of the supply chain example is Lynn Foster's examples for an apple pie," Professor McCarthy says, referring to a <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/assets/ValueFlows-Story.pdf?ref=blog.holochain.org">case study</a> on the Valueflows <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/?ref=blog.holochain.org">website</a>.</p><p>Traditional accounting makes it hard to see how business actions affect the environment, discounting “externalities”. But REA keeps track of important details that show the full impact.</p><p>Additionally, professor McCarthy believes that REA accounting is becoming increasingly important as customers and regulators demand more information about how products are made. People want detailed information about the origin and processing of the products they buy, from the farming and dyeing of cotton to the processing of olive oil. They want assurances about the absence of certain chemicals in the soil and the testing done at various stages of production.</p><p>It’s this demand for transparency driven by a growing awareness of the social and environmental impacts of business that has customers shifting to companies which are optimizing for sustainability rather than profit.</p><p>In response to these concerns, we are seeing changes in regulations, particularly in the EU and North America, that require companies to provide more detailed information about their supply chains. REA accounting is well-suited to meet these requirements because it allows for the flow of contextualized data, not just numbers on ledgers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, changing accounting systems is not easy. "The biggest barrier to all of my work for years has been computational viability," Professor McCarthy admits. But with new technologies and a shift in mindset, REA could help companies tell a richer story of their impact on the world.</p> Innovating for the Future of Accounting <p>Despite the challenges, Professor McCarthy sees hope for the future of accounting innovation. He believes that new technologies, like Holochain, could help make REA accounting more viable.</p><p>In many ways, Holochain is an ideal technology for REA accounting because of how it leverages decentralized data storage — making it affordable and easy for smaller players in a supply chain to participate.</p><p>Professor McCarthy believes that small, innovative groups could lead the way in changing accounting. These nimble, environmentally and socially aware organizations might be able to make a real impact.</p><p>However, he also acknowledges the challenges ahead, particularly from large, established players in the accounting software industry. These companies may be resistant to change and could even try to acquire innovative startups to maintain their dominance.</p><p>As the accounting profession faces a choice between evolution and obsolescence, the work of visionaries like Professor McCarthy and the potential of new technologies like Holochain offer a glimpse of a more regenerative and sustainable future. The path forward may not be easy, but the stakes are too high to cling to the status quo.</p>

			 Adrian Corcoran is Head of Sales UK&nbsp;at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>I love sports and have been active all my life. For the last 15 years, I played rugby but hung-up my boots last year because recovering on Sundays was getting too hard! Now, I play squash most early mornings and do Muay Thai 3 or 4 times a week with my youngest son. Between my girlfriend and I, we have 4 boys, aged between 17 and 23 years old. They certainly keep us busy! </p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked as Head of Institutional Sales for a FinTech, and prior to that, I led Institutional Sales and Partnerships at a decentralized data cloud storage start-up. Before entering the Web3 space, I owned my own headhunting business for over 12 years, focusing on Wealth Management and Private Banking, with a notable crossover into Investment Banking.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Working at Tokeny is both challenging and rewarding. There’s never a dull moment, as our fast-paced environment ensures that there is always something to do. Our industry is very dynamic and innovative, so there are always plenty of opportunities to learn. Being part of Tokeny means being at the forefront of tokenization tech, which I get to explore with a diverse and talented team.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>There are too many to name, but if I had to choose just three, they would be:</p>
 
 Family. My sister and I come from a very close-knit family, and those values have carried over into our own families.

<p>VDA token holders can earn up to 20% APY by participating in Verida’s initial lending pools and incentivized liquidity programs.</p>  Token staking and lending programs represent core long-term elements of the Verida network, offering token holders utility while ensuring access to capital for the network’s storage&nbsp;nodes.  Lending pool rewards will grow inline with growth of the Verida mainnet storage utilization, aligning network utility with participant rewards.  Users can securely participate in VDA pools, monitor status and earn rewards for participation in these programs via the <a href="https://pools.verida.network">Verida Network Pools Dashboard</a>.   Overview <p>The Verida network provides decentralized infrastructure for encrypted, authenticated, self-sovereign database storage for the individual, private data of Verida users. Verida empowers users to direct data storage locations in accordance with geographic preferences and regulatory needs, and to securely manage permissioned, direct sharing, or deletion requests. The protocol puts users firmly in control of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>In an effort to further familiarize the community with the Verida Network’s core mechanisms, the Verida Foundation is delighted to announce V1 of its staking pool program. In connection with the upcoming listing of its VDA Storage Credit Token, Verida is instituting a stake-based liquidity structure that will provide token holders with immediate utility and opportunities to earn additional VDA Storage Credit&nbsp;Tokens.</p><p>The launch of this staking pool program will highlight the critical role that Storage Node Operators play in the Verida Network. Operators must stake VDA to provide storage capacity to the network, secure data, and receive rewards. This program reflects the Verida Foundation’s commitment to allowing all users to participate in core network operations without the need for advanced technical expertise.</p><p>During this initial period the Verida Network will reward VDA Token stakers with bonus rewards while they familiarize themselves with the network’s functionalities and participate in these staking opportunities. Reflecting the long-term importance of these lending pools in supporting Verida Storage Node Operators and the network’s growth and expansion, the Verida Foundation has authorized the use of a portion of the <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-announces-200m-vda-token-long-term-reward-program-9c9ca5d6c280">200 million VDA Token Network Growth Rewards</a> pool to fund these initial staking&nbsp;pools.</p><p>A second program Verida will introduce, as a complement to the above single-sided staking programs, is a liquidity staking program intended to allow users to earn additional VDA while helping support liquidity for the VDA token. This will assist the market to establish a fair price for VDA and allow users to earn bonus VDA rewards on top of the trading fees received for their contribution to the liquidity pools. VDA rewards for the Liquidity Staking Program will be funded from a dedicated allocation of the VDA token supply intended to support token launch activities.</p> Storage Node Lending Pool&nbsp;Program <p>Verida’s Storage Node Lending Pool program will ultimately function as a dedicated lending resource for Verida’s network of decentralized storage nodes that will be operated by a diverse set of institutional and individual operators. This lending pool helps ensure that node operators have access to capital to fund their stake requirements, expansion costs, and operating expenses at attractive rates that will ultimately enable the Verida network’s rapid expansion. The program will also enable Verida token holders to earn a return on their token holdings while supporting the network’s growth. Yield will be dynamic, adjusting with demand and the pace of the network’s expansion.</p><p>During the Verida Network’s initial operations all network nodes will be operated by the Verida Foundation. Verida currently has approximately 20 nodes operating across multiple geographies, and is continuing to expand the number of active nodes. Throughout the second half of 2024 these nodes are expected to be gradually phased out as a decentralized set of node operators comes&nbsp;online.</p><p>While the lending pool is open for deposits and for lenders to earn yield, the borrowing function will not initially be enabled. In this initial phase, this lending pool will work more like a staking pool, where Verida will dedicate the rewards that are intended to be shared with decentralized node operators to pool stakers. This will introduce immediate utility to the Verida token, allow token holders to familiarize themselves with the network’s structures and operations, and earn additional VDA they will be able to use to offset future storage&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Additionally, during this interim period, the Verida Foundation’s continuing expansion of the number of nodes on the Verida network will ensure the network is able to meet the demand for storage along with a sufficient buffer for growth. As the number of nodes on the network grows, so too will the volume of VDA in the staking reward pool, commensurate with the additional nodes on the network. The Verida Foundation plans to double the number of global nodes by Q3&nbsp;2024.</p><p>This mechanism allows users to earn attractive yields while familiarizing themselves with the Verida crypto economic model. This interim pool structure will be replaced by a future V2 lending pool implementation that will be entirely driven by market demand, allowing the Verida Foundation to gradually reduce its nodes as private operators come&nbsp;online.</p><p>Staking will occur via Verida Network’s Staking Interface, which provides users with an easy-to-use staking dashboard. Several lending pools will be created, with each pool having a fixed APY that will vary in association with the pool’s particular lock-up&nbsp;period.</p><p>Additional details on how to access and participate in the Verida Staking program will be provided in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> Liquidity Staking&nbsp;Program <p>Verida’s Liquidity Staking Program offers liquidity providers an opportunity to provide stablecoin and VDA liquidity and stake the LP tokens that result, all while earning regular trading fees as well as VDA rewards from a pool dedicated exclusively to the Liquidity Staking Program. Users will fund the pool with equal amounts of USDT and VDA and agree to lock their deposits for a minimum period of&nbsp;time.</p><p>The Liquidity Staking APY will be 20%, compounded daily. As compared to comparable staking programs across the industry, Verida’s Liquidity Staking Program offers compelling rates of return while also allowing contributors to reinforce liquidity and enable price discovery for Verida’s VDA Token. See the below analysis across key blockchain sectors for additional information.</p><p>The above classifications were performed utilizing CF Benchmark’s Digital Asset Classification System, where applicable. Staking data from <a href="https://stakingrewards.com/">https://stakingrewards.com/</a>, accessed on April 22,&nbsp;2024.</p> User Control and Verida’s Storage Node Network Topography <p>The Verida protocol provides an open source <a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node">Storage Node</a> server that provides encrypted, authenticated database storage for Verida accounts on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>The Storage Node network is global with a region-aware design. It empowers users to control their data storage location in accordance with their geographic preference and regulatory needs.</p><p>By default, the <a href="http://verida.io/">Verida Wallet</a> selects storage nodes in the user’s country or region, ensuring regulatory compliance. Users also have the freedom to change these default nodes, or even host their own, allowing for true data sovereignty.</p><p>Verida’s technology also enables the “right to be forgotten.” Users can delete their data from storage nodes or remove their identity and data entirely from the network.This level of control over data storage and deletion is unprecedented, and vital for the widespread adoption of self-sovereign technology in mature, regulated industries. For instance, social media and health&nbsp;care.</p><p>Storage nodes are currently operated across multiple global regions by the Verida Foundation. Node statistics can be tracked on Verida’s <a href="https://explorer.verida.network/">Network Explorer</a>. This has allowed the Verida team to monitor performance, gather analytics, and rapidly improve reliability on the <a href="https://news.verida.io/the-decentralized-verida-acacia-testnet-is-live-81503c119d9f">Acacia Testnet</a>.

 Verida Announces the global launch of the VDA Storage Credit Token — powering the first private data&nbsp;DePIN <p>The Verida Foundation today announced the upcoming launch of the Verida Storage Credit Token (VDA) on Thursday May&nbsp;16th.</p><p>VDA fuels the Verida Network, an industry-leading system designed to empower users with secure storage, sharing, and control of their private&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Verida Network is the first decentralized database network built specifically for private data. Verida provides users&nbsp;with:</p>  Data ownership: Verida ensures complete user ownership and control over all data stored on the&nbsp;network.  Unparalleled security: Leveraging cutting-edge cryptography and a decentralized infrastructure to guarantee the highest level of data security.  Granular control: Users can choose precisely what data they share and with whom, fostering trust and transparency in data transactions.  Monetization opportunities: VDA unlocks the ability for users to monetize their data by participating in the Verida Data&nbsp;Economy.  <p>“VDA represents a crucial step towards establishing a thriving private data economy,” said Chris Were, CEO of Verida. “By empowering users to control and monetize their data, we’re building a more equitable and secure data ecosystem that benefits everyone.”</p><p>The Verida Storage Credit Token (VDA) will be available through <a href="http://gate.io">Gate.io</a> and leading exchanges on May 16th 12:00&nbsp;UTC</p> VDA: A Closer&nbsp;Look <p>The VDA token functions as a utility token within the Verida Network. It facilitates payments for data storage, retrieval, and a range of other network services.</p><p>VDA serves to coordinate resources in the Verida Network. VDA creates a data economy enabling secure interactions between accounts to facilitate secure data storage, trusted sharing, fast querying and trusted messaging.</p><p>The network rewards storage node operators who supply storage capacity, and secure data and end users who bring their data onto the network. Users can pay for their own storage needs in VDA. Applications may also pay for storage on behalf of their users. This self-sovereign approach gives users control over where their data is stored and fosters a competitive market among storage providers.</p> VDA powers the first private data DePIN for&nbsp;AI <p>A growing <a href="http://verida.network/ecosystem">ecosystem of partners</a> serve as private data oracles, technical integrators and channel partners for the Verida Network. Users can utilise these providers to take control and ownership of their data, then get benefit and reward from that data — all whilst storing it privately on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>The Verida network is designed for storing private, personal data. It is a <a href="https://news.verida.io/revolutionizing-web3-storage-a-deep-dive-into-ipfs-and-verida-dbstore-7a15745dd118">highly performant, low cost, regulatory compliant solution</a> for storing structured database data for any type of application. This makes <a href="https://www.verida.network/">Verida</a>’s infrastructure suitable to underpin the next generation of the privacy preserving AI technology stack.</p><p>Verida’s upcoming API data connector framework will enable users to easily connect to existing API’s of centralized platforms, claim their personal data, and then securely store it on the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>Users on the Verida network will be able to pull health activity data or their private messages from chat platforms. This can then be leveraged to train AI models for exclusive use by the user, or that data can be anonymized and contributed to larger training models. Users may choose to monetize access to their trained models by charging others with crypto tokens for accessing and utilizing the model’s capabilities.</p><p>The launch of VDA launch signifies the start of a new era for personal data ownership. A time where anyone can choose to take control and ownership of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Verida’ tokenized private data DePIN for AI is just one of the many use cases that VDA will power, as users take control of their data, for their&nbsp;benefit.</p> About Verida <p>Verida is a pioneering <a href="http://verida.network/">decentralized data network</a> and <a href="http://verida.io/">self-custody wallet</a> that empowers users with control over their digital identity and data.

<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) refers to the data collection process that financial institutions do to authenticate customer or client identity, assess financial risk, and attempt to avoid fraud. establish</p>
<p>KYC can be broken down into three steps that most financial institutions will take when opening an account or qualifying a customer for a loan.</p>
 
 Customer Identification Program 
 
<p>Financial firms must obtain four pieces of identifying information about a client: name, date of birth, address, and identification number (usually taxpayer identification number).</p>

<p>This is the process where all of a customer’s documents are collected to verify their identity and evaluate their risk profile for suspicious account activity.</p>
 
 Enhanced Due Diligence (optional) 
 
<p>Sometimes additional information is collected for customers that are suspected to be at a higher risk of infiltration, terrorism financing, or money laundering.</p>
<p>KYC is also regulated by several government agencies to reduce money laundering, and is often associated with Anti-Money Laundering policies (AML).</p>
<p>The drawbacks of traditional KYC</p>
<p>KYC’s main drawback is that it is time consuming to do, and becomes even more time consuming when you have to do it multiple times for multiple applications or organizations. For example a bank will need to do KYC to open an account for a customer, and then need to do it again to approve them for a loan. If the bank needs to refer this customer to a partner organization that organization will also need to do their own KYC to verify that customer. This is a lot of documentation for the applicant to collect and repeatedly submit, and takes considerable time, effort, and expense to repeatedly verify.</p>
<p>Each instance of KYC costs a financial institution <a href="https://seon.io/resources/cost-of-kyc/#:~:text=A%20single%20KYC%20verification%20can,bank%20%2460%20million%20per%20year.">between $13 and $130 per customer, with </a>corporate clients costing considerably more —&nbsp;one survey reported between <a href="https://resources.fenergo.com/blogs/the-cost-of-kyc-compliance-in-finance-how-digitalization-helps">$1,501 and $3,500 per review</a>. With banks having thousands of customers, and each customer potentially needing to do KYC multiple times, the average spending on KYC per bank hovers around <a href="https://seon.io/resources/cost-of-kyc/#:~:text=A%20single%20KYC%20verification%20can,bank%20%2460%20million%20per%20year.">60 million dollars annually.</a></p>
<p>The time it takes to do KYC for a customer or client can be anywhere from 31 to 180 days.</p>
<p>Re-usable KYC through Decentralized Identity&nbsp;</p>
<p>KYC is necessary (and regulated by the government) so it’s not going away, but we can make it much more efficient by reducing the amount of duplication.</p>
<p>The key value proposition presented by decentralized identity is that once you have verified the relevant financial data that same data can be verified repeatedly with the same level of assurance. How is this possible?</p>
<p>Once the KYC process has been conducted satisfactorily, a financial institution issues their customer or client with a verifiable credential containing all the details and relevant data from the initial KYC process. This information is digitally signed.</p>
<p>When the customer or client wants to share their KYC data with another party (or even the same financial institution), the authenticity of the credential is verified through cryptography (by checking a record on a distributed ledger) and the digital signatures provide proof that the data presented in the credential hasn’t been altered.</p>
<p>A verifiable credential is like a cryptographic wrapper that can seal any kind of information. Try to change the information and the seal is broken. The nature of decentralized identity is that the source of the wrapper can always be known and cryptographically verified, which means if you trust the source’s KYC process — such as that of a financial institution — you can trust the information presented by the credential holder.</p>
<p>A KYC credential can contain all kinds of information that could be necessary for a financial institution to have, but annoying or time consuming for a customer to acquire, for example: Proof of address, government ID number, proof of employment, proof of annual income, and more.</p>
<p>Once this process is more automated with decentralized identity, this information only needs to be collected one time or if the credential is set to expire. We can remove the need for partner organizations or other departments to re-do work that has already been done, saving customers time and stress, and organizations millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Collect once, verify often.</p>

  <p>Seventy-five percent of cybersecurity professionals say the current threat landscape is the most challenging it has been in the last five years, according to the <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Insights/2023/10/ISC2-Reveals-Workforce-Growth-But-Record-Breaking-Gap-4-Million-Cybersecurity-Professionals">2023 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study</a>. You’re probably on the hook to secure access for your organization – preventing identity attacks and securing least privilege access. And we know it’s intense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the ways we strive to assist you is by providing accurate, reliable, and timely information to monitor and optimize the strength of your identity and network access security posture. This transparency gives you visibility that’s necessary to assess performance, tenant health, and your plan for improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, we’ve released a series of innovations reinforcing our commitment to transparency. This blog recaps these improvements for you in three parts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Transparency in updates: Helping you know what’s new and coming soon for Microsoft Entra;&nbsp; 
  Transparency in adoption: Providing recommendations and license utilization insights; and&nbsp; 
  Transparency in operations: Tailored insights on SLA performance, scenario health, and sign-ins. &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, all features highlighted in this blog are demonstrated in our video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1ruDHdFdWk">Trust via Transparency</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>  <p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope these added capabilities help maximize the value you receive from Microsoft Entra as you consider, deploy, and measure the progress of your Zero Trust approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Transparency in updates 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the world of technology, change is constant. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-s-top-50-features-of-2023/ba-p/3796392">In 2023, we released over 100 Microsoft Entra updates and new capabilities</a> and communicated this information across announcements, quarterly blogs, and multiple docs locations. Our first investment area of transparency aims to streamline this communication, helping you find and filter the product update information most relevant to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s New hub in Microsoft Entra admin center 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>”What’s New” in Microsoft Entra gives a clear and complete view of Entra product innovation so you can stay informed, evaluate the latest innovations, and eliminate the need to manually track updates. Product updates are categorized into Roadmap and Change Announcements. The roadmap includes public previews and recent general availability releases, while Change Announcements detail modifications to existing features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Transparency in adoption 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second investment area, transparency in adoption, focuses on helping you get more value from your Microsoft Entra licenses, giving you visibility to intelligent recommendations for improving configurations and protecting your organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra license utilization insights 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra license utilization insights help you optimize your Entra licenses, as well as stay compliant by getting insights into the current usage. Today, you can see usage and licenses for Entra ID capabilities such as Conditional Access and risk-based Conditional Access. In the future, we will expand the license utilization insights to other products in the Microsoft Entra product line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Transparency in operations 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transparency in operations focuses on what we're doing to help customers see how available and resilient Microsoft Entra really is, to hold us accountable when issues arise so we can keep improving, and to understand when they have actions to take within their tenant to improve its health. Let’s look at recently announced functionality in reporting, health, and monitoring:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant-level SLA reporting 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monthly tenant-level SLA reporting enables you to monitor your tenant's performance against our Entra ID SLA promise of 99.99% availability in authenticating users and issuing tokens within your tenant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Precomputed health metric streams 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new health metrics isolate relevant signals from activity logs and provide pre-computed, low-latency aggregates every 15 minutes for specific high-value observability scenarios. The first scenarios we’ve enabled are multifactor authentication (MFA), sign-ins for managed or compliant devices, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) sign-ins. We're starting with authentication-related scenarios because they are mission-critical to all our customers, but other scenarios in areas like entitlement management, directory configuration, and app health will be added in time, along with intelligent alerting capabilities in response to anomalous patterns in the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Copilot-assisted assessments 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our third example of our commitment to transparency in operations, we can help you understand how users interact with your organization's resources. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/copilot-security-entra">Microsoft Copilot for Security is embedded in Microsoft Entra</a> so you can more efficiently assess identities and access, plus investigate and resolve identity risks and even complete complex tasks. A great example of this assistance is asking Copilot to give you sign-in logs for a specific user for a specific amount of time, saving you the reporting time.</p>

<p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the capacity to create new opportunities, disrupt how we work, and change how we think about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2024/03/ai-regulation-at-a-crossroads/">AI regulation</a>. Some predict it will be as disruptive, if not more so, than the widespread adoption of the internet. But with new opportunities come new challenges and threats. While GenAI continues to dominate the attention of businesses, the media, and regulators, it’s also caught the attention of fraudsters.</p>
<p>Recent technological advances mean it’s never been cheaper or easier to be a fraudster. In this brave new digital-first world, fraudsters have more tools at their fingertips than ever before. And it’s set to cost. Online payment fraud losses are <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/research/fintech-payments/fraud-identity/online-payment-fraud-research-report/">predicted to increase</a> from $38 billion in 2023 to $91 billion in 2028.</p>
 The rise of the GenAI fraudster 
<p>Fraudsters generally fall into two groups: 1. the lone amateur and 2. organized criminal enterprises. Traditionally the latter, with more resources at their disposal, has posed a higher threat to businesses. But GenAI offers even the most amateur fraudsters easy access to more scalable and increasingly sophisticated types of fraud.</p>
<p>The evidence is in the data. Over the last few years, less sophisticated or “easy” fraud dominated. Proprietary data from <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/entrust-completes-acquisition-of-onfido">Onfido, an Entrust company</a>, found that between 2022 and 2023, 80.3% of fraud caught fell into this category. The remainder was classed as “medium” (19.6%) or “hard” (0.1%). But recently there’s been an increase in more sophisticated fraud. Comparing these figures to data from the last six months finds a jump in both medium fraud (accounting for 36.4%) and hard fraud (accounting for 1.4%).</p>
 How fraudsters are using generative AI 
 deepfakes 
<p>GenAI programs have made it easy for anyone to create realistic, fabricated content including audio, photos, and videos. Deepfake videos in particular, sophisticated synthetic media where a person’s likeness is replaced with someone else’s, are becoming increasingly common and convincing. Fraudsters have started using deepfakes to try and bypass biometric verification and authentication methods. These videos can be pre-recorded or generated in real time with a GPU and fake webcam, and typically involve superimposing one person’s face onto another’s.</p>
<p>This type of attack has surged in recent years. Comparing 2023 with 2022, there’s been a <a href="https://go.entrust.com/identity-fraud-report-2024">3,000% increase</a> in deepfake attempts. This is particularly concerning in the realm of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/digital-onboarding">digital onboarding</a> and identity verification, where the integrity of personal identification is paramount.</p>
<p>Currently, a few fraudsters are responsible for creating deepfakes at scale. But the growing popularity of “fraud-as-a-service” offerings (where experienced fraudsters offer their services to others), combined with improvements in deepfake software, suggests their volume and sophistication will increase in 2024.</p>
 Document forgeries 
<p>Many customer due diligence processes involve the authentication of identity documents. But image manipulation software, and the emergence of websites such as OnlyFakes — an online service that sells the ability to create images of identity documents it claims are generated using AI —&nbsp;have made it easier for fraudsters to fake documents.</p>
<p>There are four different ways for fraudsters to create fake documents:</p>
 
 Physical counterfeit: A fake physical document created from scratch 
 Digital counterfeit: A fake digital representation of a document created from scratch (i.e., in Photoshop) 
 Physical forgery: An existing document that is altered or edited 
 Digital forgery: An existing document that is altered or edited using digital tools 
 
<p>Historically, most fake documents were physical counterfeits (fake documents fraudsters created entirely from scratch). In 2023, Onfido identified that 73.2% of all document fraud caught was from physical counterfeits. In the last six months, that’s dropped to 59.56%, with digital forgeries accounting for a larger proportion of document fraud than prior years (34.8%).</p>
<p>This increase in digital forgeries can be attributed to the emergence of websites such as OnlyFakes. Fraudsters have wised up to the fact it’s a faster, cheaper, and more scalable way to create fake documents.</p>
 Synthetic identity fraud 
<p>Synthetic identity fraud is a type of fraud where criminals combine fake and real personal information, such as Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and names, to create a new identity. This new, fake identity is then used to open fake accounts, access credit, or make fraudulent purchases.</p>
<p>Generative AI tools offer a way for fraudsters to generate fake information for synthetic identities at scale. Fraudsters can use AI bots to scrape personal information from online sources, including online databases and social platforms, before using this information to create synthetic identities.</p>
<p>With synthetic identity fraud projected to generate <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions/2023/financial-institutions-synthetic-identity-fraud.html?id=us:2el:3dp:wsjspon:awa:WSJRCJ:2023:WSJFY24%3Fid%3Dus:2el:3dp:wsjspon:awa:WSJRCJ:2023:WSJFY24">$23 billion USD in losses</a> by 2030, businesses are adopting advanced fraud detection and prevention technologies to root out synthetic fraud. Keeping fraudsters from entering in the first place with a reliable identity verification solution at onboarding is the foundational element in this detection framework.</p>
 Phishing 
<p>During phishing attacks, fraudsters reach out to individuals via email or other forms of communication requesting they provide sensitive data or click a link to a malicious website, which may contain malware.</p>
<p>Generative AI tools offer fraudsters an easy way to create more sophisticated and personal social engineering scams at scale. For example, using AI tools to write convincing phishing emails or for card cracking. Research has found that the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/data-breach-identity-fraud-trends-reveal-deepfake-and-generative-ai-threats">top tools used by bad actors</a> in 2023 include the dark web, fraud as a service, and generative AI. This includes the tool wormGPT, which provides a fast method for generating phishing attacks and malicious code.</p>
 Combatting GenAI fraud with… AI 
<p>The advancement in GenAI means we’re entering a new phase of fraud and cyberattacks. But the good news is that any technology fraudsters can access is accessible to those building fraud detection solutions. The best cyber defense systems of tomorrow will need AI to power them to combat the speed and scale of attacks. Think of it as an “AI versus AI showdown.”</p>
<p>With the right training, AI algorithms can recognize the subtle differences between authentic and synthetic images or videos, which are often imperceptible to the human eye. Machine learning, a subset of AI, plays a crucial role in identifying irregularities in digital content. By training on vast datasets of both real and fake media, machine learning models can learn to differentiate between the two with high accuracy.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of using AI to fight deepfakes and other GenAI fraud is its ability to continuously learn and adapt. As deepfake technology evolves, so too do the AI algorithms designed to detect them.</p>

<p>Today’s healthcare relies on digital health ecosystems—a network of interconnected digital services. These ecosystems need to accommodate any type of user to support a variety of digital healthcare use cases and innovation. User types not only include consumers, providers, workforces, and partners, but also connected IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) such as remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices, wearables, and medical equipment. And now in the age of artificial intelligence, users also include AI sessions and agents. Digital health ecosystems also include cloud services and third-party partnerships and application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interoperability is a fundamental pillar within this intricate digital web. As healthcare systems evolve, the seamless exchange of health information across diverse digital ecosystems and stakeholders—such as providers, payers, pharmacies, patients/members—is critical. It’s been proven that shared data exchange improves care by informing clinical decisions that result in better patient outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Healthcare interoperability refers to the ability of different health information technologies to communicate, exchange, and use health information in a coordinated manner, both within and across organizational boundaries, in order to improve healthcare delivery. As discussed below, multiple regulations mandate interoperability. And achieving it is a complex endeavor. For example, interoperability relies on advanced cybersecurity capabilities, a standard called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for data formats and APIs, legal agreements for data sharing, and governance models to manage the data exchange of medical records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interoperable systems are essential to optimize patient care and streamline healthcare delivery. Health information exchange across digital health ecosystems hinges on secure integrations and access management of clinical data, such as electronic health records (EHRs), across various information systems and interfaces. At the heart of this endeavor lies identity and access management (IAM). Healthcare IAM (also known as healthcare identity management) is a crucial component for both achieving healthcare data interoperability and complying with the regulations that mandate it.</p>

   The EU's Digital Identity Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) offers a starting point for digital wallets. It aims to support user control over personal data while meeting legal and cybersecurity requirements. But to get there from here, you need to know what you don't know: the functional and non-functional requirements, along with interfaces and integration points for digital identity wallets

<p>Digital wallets and the credentials they hold are ALL the rage these days. Understanding how to make them work in today’s world is where the EU’s Digital Identity Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) comes in.</p>



<p>If you’ve read my posts about verifiable credentials (<a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/03/verifiable-credentials-and-mdocs-a-tale-of-two-protocols/">this one</a> and <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/15/more-on-the-options-and-diversity-of-verifiable-credentials/">this one</a>), the next logical step is to discuss how those credentials are stored in a digital wallet.</p>



 What’s a Wallet? 



<p>OK, so digital identity wallets may be all the rage, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that people—even techies—have a common understanding of what they are. According to the Open Wallet Foundation:</p>



<p>“A digital wallet is a container where you can store and access digital assets, credentials, and other useful items, such as tickets and keys. Another software component, most often called an agent, can put items into a wallet, take items out of a wallet, or process items in a wallet. While the wallet is the container, the agent is the mover and shaker.” — Gordon Gram, “<a href="https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/LF%20Research/OpenWallet%20Open%20Digital%20Wallet%20-%20Report.pdf?hsLang=en">Why the World Needs an Open Source Digital Wallet Right Now</a>,” Open Wallet Foundation, February 2023.</p>



<p>That’s a good functional definition, though it doesn’t quite help determine the standard technical specifications for the container. But that’s a topic for a future blog post.</p>



 A Framework for Many Moving Parts 



<p>Governments, businesses, and individuals are all concerned with how to give an individual agency over their personal data. This concern is a natural response to the privacy laws that have rolled out worldwide in the last 5+ years. That said, coming up with a structure that supports user agency over their own data while still supporting other legal and cybersecurity-based requirements is a challenge. There are just SO MANY moving parts!</p>



 
 There are the entities that are responsible for the wallets themselves (i.e., the Holders). 



 There are the entities that are responsible for the data that goes into the credentials stored by the wallet (i.e., the Issuers). 



 There are the entities that want to ask for the credential (or some of the data that the credential holds) (i.e., the Verifiers). 
 



<p>But wait, there’s more! There are device manufacturers that have to have equipment capable of managing the cryptography associated with complex digital signatures. Services responsible for building a trusted registry of entities participating in this ecosystem. Entities providing audit services to make sure everything is running securely and according to current legal requirements and best practices. And so on.</p>



<p>With so many moving parts and personal data, is it any wonder the EU decided that further guidance was necessary? How many ways this can go wrong is more than a bit terrifying. And yet, the promises of privacy, security, and agency can’t be ignored. And the ARF is where that work starts.</p>



 Enter the EUDI Architecture Reference Framework 



<p>The ARF is an outline that provides the first blush of a framework for how digital wallets will work in the EU. The European Commission kicked off the work through a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/03/26/european-digital-identity-eid-council-adopts-legal-framework-on-a-secure-and-trustworthy-digital-wallet-for-all-europeans/">Commission Recommendation</a>&nbsp;from June 2021 that urged Member States to develop common standards, technical specifications, and best practices in response to the eIDAS 2.0 regulation. EU Member States sent their experts to join a collaborative process to build the framework.</p>



<p>The work was done very openly via a public&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework">GitHub repository</a>, letting people see and comment on the changes as the work developed.</p>



<p>While using the framework isn’t required to comply with eIDAS 2.0, it’s still the best way to help meet the goal of an interoperable environment for digital wallets. Other countries and companies should see this as a great place to start.&nbsp;</p>



 Highlights 



<p>The ARF isn’t a particularly long document—it’s a comprehensive outline, after all, not the complete guidance— but it is dense with information! Here are a few highlights:</p>



<p>1. Functional Requirements Are A Thing: If your organization is exploring using digital verifiable credentials, then you could do worse than start here. And if you are interested in using digital verifiable credentials AND have a presence in the EU, then you REALLY want to start here. A wallet needs to be able to do a variety of things. From the ability to perform electronic identification, store and manage qualified and non-qualified electronic attestations of attributes, and provide mutual authentication capabilities, this isn’t something you want to get wrong. Given that, the level of detail in the ARF is great kickstarter guide for developers and stakeholders on the technical expectations and capabilities required for the EUDI Wallet. It’s an opportunity to mitigate “you don’t know what you don’t know” when making plans in the digital wallet world.</p>



<p>2. It’s Not All Technical Details: The ARF outline includes space for non-functional requirements, including guidance on security, privacy by design, and user control over personal data. Having a presence in the EU and a reliance on government-issued credentials means playing in the digital wallet and verifiable credential landscape. The ARF puts the framework in a context that will help you comply with the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks while providing a secure and user-friendly experience.</p>



<p>3. But if You Want to Talk about Interfaces and Integration Points: The framework will specify various interfaces and integration points for a digital identity wallet (specifically the EUDI Wallet) with external entities like Member States’ infrastructures, identity cards, and trusted registries. You probably could go a trial-and-error route to figure out how to integrate with this digital ecosystem, but life is too short. Use the guidance to save time; it’s freely available.</p>



 What Happens Next? 



<p>As with any v1.0, you can expect changes. The ARF will evolve from an outline to a complete Architecture and Reference Framework. The authors intend to expand this outline into a comprehensive framework as set out in the Commission Recommendation, and it will be aligned with the outcomes of the legislative negotiations regarding the proposal for a European Digital Identity Framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As noted earlier, the ARF has its own GitHub repository, and you are free to offer feedback if you have ideas and experience that will help improve the framework.</p>



 How Globally Applicable is the ARF? 



<p>If you ask me (and it’s my blog), deployers can and should use the ARF as the basis for large-scale wallet deployments worldwide. But others may not agree. The US, in particular, is much more chaotic regarding wallet deployments as each US State is deciding independently of others whether they will build their own or use ones from Google or Apple. The US Federal Government’s Department of Homeland Security is also <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2023/06/22/st-seeks-solutions-privacy-preserving-digital-credential-wallets-verifiers">doing amazing work</a> in the verifiable credential and digital wallet space. Still, they don’t have the same level of mandate that regulations like eIDAS2, GDPR, etc, provide in the European Union.&nbsp;</p>

 U.S. Agencies Warn of North Korean Spear-Phishing Campaigns Targeting Geopolitical Intelligence 



<p>The U.S. government issued a cybersecurity advisory warning about North Korean hackers’ spear-phishing campaigns. The hackers use spoofed emails to gather sensitive information from their targets. They exploit weak DNS DMARC record policies to send emails that appear to come from valid domains. The group behind these attacks, Kimsuky (or APT43), targets foreign policy experts and uses initial benign interactions to build trust. Organizations are advised to strengthen their DMARC policies and treat suspicious emails more cautiously.</p>

It highlights the necessity of transitioning from legacy systems that are ill-equipped for the demands of cloud computing and diverse user groups, towards more agile, scalable, and integrated IAM solutions. This transition is not merely technical but strategic, ensuring IAM systems can support a wide array of identities, from employees to customers and devices, and play a critical role in securing digital interactions across various platforms and services.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>As I was writing about Oracle’s new <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/oracle-sql-firewall">SQL Firewall</a> some time ago, I had no idea it will be published on the same day the company officially announced the general availability of its flagship database product, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/">Oracle Database 23ai</a>. What a coincidence! And what a twist with the new name!</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about the name, by the way. On the one hand, it appears to be the most unnecessary, marketing-driven change ever. I can vividly imagine thousands of DBAs, developers, consultants, journalists, and other IT professionals rolling their eyes and scratching their heads. Now they must update all their documentation and writings to reflect it, and that time could have been spent on more productive things.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in contrast to many other vendors throwing “AI” into their product names, Oracle does have quite a lot to show for it. Artificial intelligence was, of course, a substantial part of the database for quite some time already. The concept of the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/for-oracle-the-future-is-autonomous">Autonomous Database</a> was introduced back in 2017. Machine learning algorithms have been a part of the database core for years as well. However, in 2024, the only kind of AI everyone is talking about is Generative AI. And so, among over 300 major new features, the new release introduces several new ones crucial for not just enabling GenAI capabilities for business applications, but implementing them in a universal, globally scalable, secure and, last but not least, compliant manner.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most notable addition is <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/ai-vector-search/">AI Vector Search</a>, a set of capabilities to enable native support for generating, storing, indexing, and querying vector data directly in the database. This is, of course, a crucial requirement for implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance the accuracy of large language model responses with additional information from external sources (such as an organization’s own sensitive information that it does not want to share with LLM operators in any other way).</p>
<p>Now Oracle Database 23ai can natively support storing vector embeddings for unstructured content in the same table as existing relational data. This allows for creating complex queries across them, combining traditional SQL with semantic search, as well as geospatial information, graphs, and so on – which is impossible with a standalone vector database. In contrast, Oracle’s converged database approach keeps all data in a single location, where it is uniformly protected by layers of data security controls, including the SQL Firewall.</p>
<p>When running on the Oracle Exadata platform, its underlying smart storage technology will even natively accelerate vector search operations to run AI applications at a massive scale. Curiously, even if you are not yet ready to migrate your application to the 23ai release, it is still possible to replicate existing data from other sources using the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/integration/goldengate/">GoldenGate 23ai</a> service and let Oracle Cloud handle the AI operations for you.</p>
<p>Another major feature introduced in the new release is <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/json-relational-duality/">JSON Relational Duality</a>, a technology that aims to solve the decades-long debate between the fans of the relational and the document data models. Until now, the developers were forced to make an early design decision between the efficiency and consistency of SQL and the simplicity and flexibility of NoSQL, and to resort to additional middleware layers to address the shortcomings of both approaches.</p>
<p>With JSON Relational Duality Views (what a mouthful of a name!), developers no longer need to make this choice. It is now possible to store data in relational format but access it in the form of JSON documents. A view can be declared across multiple tables with a structure described using the familiar GraphQL syntax. The database then takes care of all the rest, including automated table updates when documents are modified, lock-free concurrency control to support stateless operations, and making the data available across a range of APIs, from SQL to REST or even MongoDB.</p>
<p>While the idea might sound somewhat trivial in hindsight, implementing it in a scalable, reliable, and standardized way has required years of research and development. But now the capability is officially available, and developers are encouraged to try it – even the free edition of the database includes the feature, along with the similarly improved Property Graph Views.</p>
<p>I have no intention to mention every of the 300 features introduced in the new release, but one thing that is especially close to me both as an analyst covering data security and compliance solutions and as a citizen of the European Union is Oracle’s <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/distributed-database/">Globally Distributed Database</a>. With the introduction of built-in RAFT-based replication, the new release brings the concept of database sharding to a new level of scalability and performance. A global, hyperscale database that is distributed and replicated across multiple geographical locations in real-time is now a reality – and the data within it can be transparently localized according to complex rules.</p>
<p>For example, all information linked to EU citizens will be stored only in datacenters located in Germany, enforcing the EU data sovereignty regulations, while the data related to Indian citizens will be only kept within the borders of India. And yet, for business applications, the entire customer base will appear as a single table, enabling efficient but still compliant transactions and analytics. With new privacy regulations being introduced constantly, adapting existing applications becomes a matter of just adding new sharding rules to the database – no need to change anything in the business logic.</p>
<p>All these new capabilities are now officially available in the Oracle Cloud, both in their public regions and in the Cloud@Customer private cloud, as well as in Microsoft Azure as a part of Oracle’s and Microsoft’s joint <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/azure/oracle-database-at-azure/">Oracle Database@Azure</a> offering. The on-prem availability is yet to be announced.</p>

<a href="https://yeshid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Onboarding-Template-9-May-2024.mp4">https://yeshid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Onboarding-Template-9-May-2024.mp4</a> 
<p>YeshID’s mission is to deliver identity &amp; access solutions that are simple, secure, and trustworthy. Today, we’re releasing our first AI agent. It’s designed to simplify onboarding and offboarding workflows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why onboarding and offboarding? These workflows are mandatory for SOC2 compliance. Crafting playbooks for specific roles often becomes a major source of IAM admin friction and frustration.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/yeshlist/">YeshList blog post</a>, we discussed how we tackled this problem when we created task templates. The first templates we made were for onboarding and offboarding. Introducing AI takes it a step further and makes it even easier.</p>
<p>Simply describe the type of playbook you need, and our AI will suggest a workflow optimized to meet SOC2 standards. This gives you a solid foundation, making editing and customization faster than starting from scratch.</p>
<p>Why this matters to you:</p>
 
 Save time: Focus on the strategic aspects of IAM, not repetitive tasks. 
 Reduce risk: Get AI-driven help to craft comprehensive playbooks, minimizing errors. 
 Gain confidence: Every action is transparent and auditable, building trust in the process. 
 
<p>Experience YeshID LLM by visiting <a href="https://app.yeshid.com/tasks-templates">task templates in YeshID</a> and learn how it can enhance your employee onboarding workflows. (Coming soon–support for offboarding and the messy middle.)</p>
 The Power of AI, Guided by Our Principles 
<p>We’ve been experimenting with LLMs for a while. We saw their potential to revolutionize identity and access management. Incorporating LLM reasoning capabilities will be a productivity multiplier, resulting in a better, more secure, and seamless experience for IAM managers and employees alike. We have a lot planned, and our plans are rooted in our core principles:</p>
 
 Simple: We believe technology should make your life easier, not harder. 
 Secure: Protecting your data is our utmost priority. 
 Trustworthy: We build on a firm foundation of transparency and reliability. 
 
 Responsible AI: Balancing Innovation with Caution 
<p>AI can reason and use tools to intelligently evaluate and automate access requests, enforce security policies, perform audits, handle employee onboarding and offboarding, resolve integration issues, provide real-time support, optimize spending, and more. Much more. It’s a powerful tool that can work 24/7, reduce human error, and provide invaluable insights.</p>
<p>But, as we have all learned, there are problems. AIs can hallucinate, be tricked, and create disaster at scale. That’s why we will only ship AI-powered features when we’re confident they are secure, reliable, and work as you expect them to.</p>
 AI as Your Trusted Partner 
<p>We believe in a future where AI empowers IAM managers to be more effective and secure. It’s a future where routine tasks are handled seamlessly, and you can focus on what matters most. Our commitment to our principles means we’ll bring you these innovations quickly and responsibly, ensuring your experience with YeshID remains simple, secure, and trustworthy. We move fast, and much more is coming soon.</p>
<p>If you’d like to see how YeshAI can help you make better onboarding decisions, check out the bot on our website <a href="https://yeshid.com/yeshid-copilot/">here</a>. </p>
<p>However, if you are ready to experience the power, security, and compliance of an AI-enhanced IAM, then <a href="https://app.yeshid.com/tasks-templates">signup</a> to get started with YeshID for free.</p>

				  In a new <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/complete-zero-trust-with-decentralized-identity/">White Paper</a> from Indicio, Trevor Butterworth, Chase Cunningham, and Will Groah explain the importance of understanding how identity and security are connected and that a Zero Trust strategy for security can only be fully realized through a decentralized approach to identity.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Zero Trust and Decentralized Identity</p>
<p>The concepts of Zero Trust and Decentralized Identity emerged in the early 2000s as responses to the escalating problems around data breaches and identity theft.</p>
<p>Zero Trust meant what it said: trust no one and continuously verify for narrow access to network resources.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity tackled the underlying reason digital identities couldn’t be trusted: the architecture of identity access and management couldn’t offer the privacy and security protection needed to protect personal data.</p>
<p>Any network defense could be broken if the identity of a user was compromised, and a system of storing user identity in centralized databases and using passwords for access was an endless source of risk.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity completes Zero Trust because it creates a seamless, cryptographic way to verify identity without centralizing personal data or needing logins and passwords, meaning that a network could always be certain of the identity of those trying to access their systems and could manage continuous verification in a maximally frictionless way.</p>
<p>Why then has Zero Trust largely ignored Decentralized Identity? Because security and identity teams often have different organizational responsibilities when a strong security posture means that both are inextricably linked. The authors argue, however, that without decentralized identity, Zero Trust cannot be fully embraced and implemented.</p>
<p>How can you get started?</p>
<p>The first step is to read the latest <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/complete-zero-trust-with-decentralized-identity/">White Paper</a> on this topic. The authors show how zero trust and decentralized identity can work together and the benefits your organization can receive.</p>

<p>The team here at 1Kosmos is excited to announce the release of 1Kosmos 1Key, a phishing-resistant biometric security key that supports authentication for unlimited users per device. The 1Key reduces costs and defeats security vulnerabilities associated with lost, stolen, and shared keys.</p>
<p>Safeguarding sensitive information with passwordless multi-factor authentication is difficult to deliver for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF), manufacturing clean rooms, customer help desks, higher education labs, retail bank branches, healthcare providers, and other restricted environments because access to mobile devices is not permitted and we are addressing these challenges head-on. 1Key is a FIDO-compliant innovative biometric security key designed to revolutionize access control in secure facilities, shared workstations, and kiosks.</p>
<p>The 1Key is the latest 1Kosmos authentication method that organizations can use to address their security challenges. In this instance, we are delivering a FIDO-compliant innovative biometric security key designed to revolutionize access control in secure facilities, shared workstations, and kiosks. The experience is seamless, includes Windows login support, and is compatible with any WebAuthn service or application.</p>
<p>The benefits of the 1Key are significant as security teams no longer need to assign every user a physical key, provide a cost advantage over conventional keys, and eliminate other forms of MFA (multi-factor authentication). Organizations can now easily defeat unauthorized access due to key sharing and improve cycle time for customer-facing business processes, especially where login to multiple systems is required.</p>
<p></p>
 The 1Kosmos Advantage 
<p>1Key is a FIDO2 passkey and CTAP2 compliant, providing interoperability across various systems and delivering the following capabilities:</p>
 
 Users will register their biometrics at the time of onboarding and will then have passwordless access to any supported desktop. The register once-use-anywhere improves onboarding and eliminates passwords for enrolled users. 
 Open, scalable, and interoperable passwordless authentication for organizations whose workers are dynamically assigned a workspace. 
 User/role specific access control policies that improve the authentication experience and allow enrolled employees to use their biometrics to log in to secured desktops without a password. 
 Phishing-resistant passwordless access to any supported desktop, once users have registered their biometrics. 
 Optionally combine NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) 800-63-3 IAL2-certified identity to the authentication experience. 
 
<p></p>
<p>With cybersecurity threats on the rise, it is more important than ever for organizations to prioritize security, no matter the environment. That is where 1Kosmos excels, and 1Key offers a revolutionary approach to authentication, combining the convenience of passwordless access with the security of biometric technology. For organizations looking to enhance their security posture in multi-user and restricted environments, 1Kosmos 1Key is the answer.</p>

 We spoke with Sébastien Marteau, Chief Commercial Officer at <a href="https://european-index.fluctuo.com/">Fluctuo</a>, about the latest trends in carsharing, decarbonization in the transport sector, the future of the industry and the challenges it faces. 



 Are carsharing services becoming increasingly popular? If so, what factors are contributing to their success? 



<p>Yes, certainly. Carsharing is a cost-effective way of ensuring that you only pay for a car when you really need one. The economic benefits are real when you factor in all the costs associated with a car (purchase, maintenance, fuel, insurance, etc.).</p>



<p>In times of inflation, carsharing services represent a real gain for the consumer. They make it possible to share a vehicle. What’s more, carsharing is seen as an inclusive mode of transport, facilitating access to cars for people who don’t always have the means to own one.</p>



<p>Last but not least, carsharing services respond to ecological imperatives that are increasingly resonant in today’s society.</p>



<p>On a European scale, carsharing services saw strong growth in 2023. Data from our latest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/european-shared-mobility-index-2023-flucto/">European Shared Mobility Index 2023</a> on free-floating services, which covers 115 cities in Europe, shows an increase in the size of shared car fleets of 25%, while the number of journeys has risen by 39%, especially with very dynamic countries such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries such as Denmark and Norway.</p>

 How is the carsharing economy shaping up today? 



<p>The carsharing market is a mix of two types of players: private players, often linked to carmakers and positioned on free-floating services; and associations or user groups covering station-based services. The latter are sometimes partly financed by public authorities to enable them to develop.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, costs remain one of the major issues in the carsharing economy, such as those inherent in parking or vandalism.</p>



<p>To <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/whats-propelling-the-mobility-industry/">develop this economy</a>, there is a real need for operators to collaborate and share data, so as to develop the use of carsharing. The aim is to unite in order to give visibility to this emerging industry and contribute to the sector’s economic growth.</p>



 What do you see as the future of green mobility? 



<p>The future of green mobility is linked to the reduction in the number of private cars and the development of a modal shift toward active, low-carbon modes such as walking, cycling and public transport. According to the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), the car still accounts for the majority of home-to-work journeys of less than 2km (52.9%), so we absolutely must accelerate the modal shift to low-carbon modes.</p>



<p>If Europe is to achieve its objectives of climate neutrality by 2050 and a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 levels, emissions from the transport sector will have to fall by almost 80% by 2040.</p>



<p>Decarbonizing road transport, switching to zero-emission vehicles and improving public transport and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">shared mobility</a> will also have a direct impact on air quality and, consequently, on the health of all Europeans. The transition to climate neutrality implies the promotion of sustainable and affordable mobility, thanks to appropriate urban planning, which will be important in enabling more public transport, carsharing, car-pooling and active mobility such as walking and cycling for short-distance journeys. Ensuring <a href="https://northsearegion.eu/share-north/news/translating-shared-mobility-for-rural-areas-the-rosetta-stone-for-car-sharing-in-small-towns/">access for all</a> to affordable and accessible net-zero energy and mobility solutions will be an essential part of the transition. Carsharing will also need to be integrated into public transport plans and develop multimodality if it is to be democratized.</p>



 As more and more cities realize the importance of zero-emission mobility and take steps in this direction, how can carsharing services contribute to green mobility? 



<p>Carsharing is a gas pedal of de-motorization: By offering a simple, accessible solution for journeys requiring a car, carsharing enables its users to replace their personal vehicle. In the case of an individual vehicle, it is estimated that it remains stationary 95% of the time. Taking France as an example, we estimate that a “loop” carsharing vehicle replaces between 5 and 8 private vehicles. In some countries, it can even replace 12-15 cars. So there’s a real need to reduce the number of private vehicles to cut carbon emissions.</p>



<p>Carsharing also accelerates multimodality: carsharing users make greater use of public transport (+18%), trains (+29%), bicycles (+22%) and walking (+38%). The integration of carsharing services in rail and bus stations is very important.</p>



 Do carsharing operators have to comply with any specific regulations today? 



<p>A carsharing operator is often required to obtain a license to operate in a given territory, as well as to pay for the parking of its fleet. From the user’s point of view, the operator is also obliged to check that <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">the user has a valid license</a>, and ultimately to verify the user’s identity.</p>



<p>Cities and transport authorities have found it difficult to regulate carsharing. Regulations have often been too restrictive, limiting the operational capabilities of these services and affecting their business model. They have tended to focus on limiting the impact of the system, rather than working with operators to maximize the overall benefits of the mobility system. In some cases, the limits imposed on zone access and parking have led operators to withdraw.</p>



 What are the main challenges facing carsharing operators today? 



<p>Carsharing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">operators face a number of challenges</a>:</p>



  Vandalism is having a real impact on the profitability of some operators, resulting in very expensive insurance policies. In the UK, for example, it seems that no private insurers are entering this market any more. Detecting incidents is therefore essential, so that the user is reimbursed for any damage caused;  Migration to electric vehicles. Only 11% of cars in stations in France are electric, compared with 79% for free-floating. This migration will involve educating users about their mode of operation;  Profitability. Many have struggled to become profitable due to high operating costs, poor coordination with competitors, narrow scope of action and unfavorable sharing models with municipalities (inadequate parking agreements).  



 What solutions are carsharing operators looking for to facilitate and secure the use of their services? 



<p>With the explosion in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marcel-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/">generative AI</a>, driver’s license fraud and document forgery are on the rise. Given their strong growth, there is a major challenge around the identification and authentication of users in vehicles. It is vital for operators to integrate very strict <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">identity verification solutions</a>, at the risk of undermining the profitability of their business model.</p>

 The CIAM Market (Customer Identity and Access Management) is undergoing significant transformations. As businesses increasingly recognize CIAM’s critical role in securing and managing customer identities on digital platforms, this market is poised for substantial growth—from <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/customer-identity-and-access-management-buyers-guide-2024/">$6.2 billion in 2024 to $10.8 billion by 2028</a>. This growth underscores the evolution of CIAM solutions from basic tools to essential, strategic business solutions. 



 







 



<p>Despite substantial ROI from CIAM—such as operational cost reductions and revenue growth—organizations face challenges with their existing systems. A significant issue is siloed and unauthoritative identity data management, further complicated by data privacy regulations that disrupt identity management across organizational divisions. This challenge is magnified by the need to balance stringent security with a fluid user experience, rendering traditional, inflexible CIAM solutions less effective.</p>



<p>With the market’s maturity, dissatisfaction with standard, non-customizable CIAM solutions is growing. About 49% of respondents, particularly from financial services, are considering switching providers to seek more advanced, customizable solutions that better integrate across applications and manage identities seamlessly. This drive for innovation is fueled by emerging security and compliance challenges and the necessity to support scalable operations and enhance customer engagement and retention effectively.</p>



<p>The CIAM market is shifting towards more flexible, customizable, and integrative solutions. Providers differentiate themselves by incorporating advanced features such as user behavior analytics, adaptive authentication, and API-first capabilities that allow organizations to adapt their CIAM systems without complete overhauls. These “plug-and-play” solutions enable businesses to seamlessly integrate new functionalities into existing systems, catering to specific operational and regional needs.</p>



<p>Additionally, CIAM’s strategic importance is increasingly recognized across business units, fostering more collaborative approaches in implementing and managing these solutions. With 89% of surveyed organizations acknowledging reduced business costs through CIAM and a significant percentage reporting enhanced revenue and customer retention, the strategic value of CIAM is clear.</p>



<p>As the market continues to evolve, organizations are urged to reassess their CIAM strategies, considering solutions that offer the flexibility to adapt to changing legal and technological landscapes, thus ensuring continuous improvement in customer management and operational efficiency.</p>



 What’s Next for Financial Services 



<p>The financial services sector is currently at a significant turning point regarding Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). A recent survey has revealed that almost half of the businesses within this industry are contemplating a shift towards more advanced CIAM solutions. This indicates that the next phase would involve adopting CIAM systems that enhance security and customer experience and provide a unified view of customer identities across all platforms. This shift is crucial for financial institutions that seek to replace legacy systems with more integrated and flexible solutions that can adapt to diverse regulatory environments and complex customer interactions. </p>



<p>As these organizations focus on scalability and compliance, they will likely lead the demand for next-generation CIAM capabilities. These capabilities may include improved identity verification processes and more sophisticated data management technologies. Transitioning to <a href="https://medium.com/@razi_chaudhry/explaining-the-blueprint-for-an-adaptive-ciam-platforms-ciam-part-2-8f35997ce918">next-generation CIAM systems</a> is essential in supporting the financial services sector’s unique needs, such as managing sensitive financial data and complying with stringent global regulations while ensuring a seamless customer journey from onboarding to ongoing engagement. Financial institutions must ensure that they can maintain the trust and confidence of their customers by providing secure and reliable services. As such, adopting next-generation CIAM capabilities will enable these organizations to deliver exceptional customer experiences while ensuring the highest level of data security and privacy.</p>



<p>The shift towards advanced CIAM systems will allow financial institutions to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve overall customer satisfaction. Adopting these systems will also play a critical role in helping financial institutions stay ahead of the competition and meet the evolving needs of their customers.</p>

  The minimum threshold for Nigeria’s Crypto Travel Rule is $1,000 (1,380,680 NGN).  Transactions below this threshold require only the names and wallet addresses of the parties involved.  All crypto transfers must be treated as cross-border and adhere to stringent wire transfer requirements.  <p>Nigeria, grappling with high inflation and unemployment, has one of the highest crypto adoption rates. The crypto ownership in the country is expected to be as high as <a href="https://www.itedgenews.africa/26-crypto-adoption-in-nigeria-statistics-facts-and-usage-trends-2024/">46%</a>, with almost <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-cryptocurrency-crackdown-will-have-consequences-experts-say/7523302.html">13 million</a> cryptocurrency holders, more than any other African&nbsp;country.</p><p>Yet, Nigerian regulators have yet to provide a clear framework. However, authorities have been working on it and have strict <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering (AML), countering the financing of terrorism (CFT)</a>, and counter-proliferation financing (CPF) compliance rules.</p> Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Nigeria <p>In 2022, the Nigerian SEC outlined general requirements for VASPs, covering Know Your Customer (KYC), Customer Due Diligence (CDD), and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p><p>Under the FATF Travel Rule, regulators have issued guidelines for the licensing and registration of VASPs, allowing banks to provide accounts and offer services to these entities in Nigeria. The Central Bank can also impose sanctions such as fines, license suspension, and activity&nbsp;bans.</p><p>To align with international attitudes, the regulator has also created an AML/CFT/CPF framework that requires entities to appoint a compliance officer, maintain a compliance manual, and implement employee education and training programs.</p><p>For CDD, entities must conduct ongoing due diligence, perform Enhanced Customer Due Diligence (ECDD) for higher-risk clients, and verify beneficial ownership at the outset of business relationships or transactions. They must also establish risk management systems to identify Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and monitor and report any suspicious transactions. All transaction records and related information must be retained for at least five&nbsp;years.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>All crypto transfers are to be treated as cross-border transfers and must adhere to the requirements for cross-border wire transfers. These obligations also extend to non-VASP Capital Market Operators (CMOs) handling crypto transfers for customers.</p><p>Originating VASPs are required to obtain, verify, and retain complete originator and beneficiary information. This information must be transmitted securely and immediately to the beneficiary VASP and provided to authorities upon&nbsp;request.</p><p>Beneficiary VASPs must also secure and verify complete originator and beneficiary information, ensuring its accuracy and availability to authorities when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>CMOs must acquire and verify the following originator information:</p>  Full name of the originator  Originator’s wallet&nbsp;address  Physical address, national identity number, incorporation number, or business registration number if the originator is not a natural&nbsp;person  <p>For beneficiaries, CMOs need to&nbsp;collect:</p>  Beneficiary’s name  Beneficiary’s wallet&nbsp;address  These requirements apply to transactions exceeding $1,000 (1,380,680 NGN).  <p>Transactions below this threshold are exempt but must still include the names and wallet addresses of both the originator and the beneficiary.</p><p>CMOs are also required to verify this information if there is any suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing.</p><p>Moreover, VASPs, according to the Nigerian securities regulator, are required to be incorporated and maintain an office within&nbsp;Nigeria.</p><p>In March 2024, the regulator suggested a fivefold increase in the registration fee to be submitted alongside license applications. Moreover, the CEO or managing director of the crypto exchange applying for a license must also reside in&nbsp;Nigeria.</p><p>These proposed rule changes will apply to foreign operators targeting Nigerian users but not to financial portals or tech firms providing supporting infrastructure or software to crypto exchanges.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>Over the past few years, Nigeria has initiated several steps to regulate the crypto space. These measures aim to remove Nigeria from the FATF’s Gray List. The IMF has found that gray-listing can have a “significant negative impact on a country’s capital flows,” with its GDP decreasing by as much as 7.6&nbsp;percent.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/almost-70-of-all-fatf-assessed-countries-have-implemented-the-crypto-travel-rule">latest FATF report on the status of Travel Rule implementation</a> rated Nigeria as ‘partially compliant’ based on its performance in several&nbsp;areas:</p>  Conducting a crypto and VASP risk assessment  Passing a law on VASP registration  Implementing AML/CFT&nbsp;measures  Adopting the travel rule for&nbsp;VASPs   Concluding Thoughts <p>Over the past year, a more than 68% drop in its fiat currency, the Naira, along with foreign exchange shortages, high remittance costs, recessions, and an unstable political situation, have increased the appeal of crypto assets in Africa’s second-largest economy.</p><p>Driven by these factors, the Sub-Saharan African country has taken steps to establish a clear regulatory framework for crypto assets in accordance with international standards. This means that both local and foreign crypto companies must adopt these rules to cater to and thrive in Nigeria’s growing crypto&nbsp;market.</p> FAQs on Crypto Travel Rule&nbsp;Nigeria  Q1: What is the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Nigeria? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule in Nigeria requires that any crypto transaction exceeding $1,000 must include detailed originator and beneficiary information to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.</p> Q2: What are the requirements for crypto transactions under this&nbsp;rule? <p>For transactions above the $1,000 threshold, originating and beneficiary Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must obtain, verify, and retain complete information about the parties involved and ensure it is transmitted securely.</p> Q3: What happens with transactions that do not meet the minimum threshold for the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>Transactions below the $1,000 threshold are exempt from the detailed reporting requirements but must still include the names and wallet addresses of the originator and beneficiary.</p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<a href="https://bit.ly/4b8fwCr"></a>



 



 Why Now 



<p>Deepfake detection technologies are crucial due to the increasing difficulty in distinguishing between authentic and manipulated content, the misuse potential in fraud and identity theft, and the rising accessibility of deepfake creation tools. Here are some considerations:</p>



 Difficulty in Distinguishing Real from Fake 



 
 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/06/14/about-three-quarters-of-americans-favor-steps-to-restrict-altered-videos-and-images/">61% of Americans need help differentiating between real and fabricated videos</a>, indicating a significant challenge in verifying authenticity. 



 A survey by <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.231214#:~:text=We%20find%20participants%20correctly%20select,genuine%20videos%20to%20be%20deepfakes.">Royal Society Publishing</a> showed that only 21.6% of participants could accurately identify a deepfake, underscoring the need for better detection methods. 
 



 Misuse in Fraud and Identity Theft 



 
 The <a href="https://onfido.com/landing/identity-fraud-report/">use of AI for face-swapping</a> has led to increases in biometric fraud, with selfie fraud doubling and biometric fraud quintupling over the past year. 



 A notable incident involved a <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/%EF%BF%BCdeepfakes-and-fake-news-pose-a-growing-threat-to-democracy-experts-warn/">deepfake video of Ukrainian President Zelensky</a>, which could have had severe implications for national security.  
 



 Ease of Access and Creation 



 
 The creation of deepfakes has surged, evidenced by a <a href="https://onfido.com/landing/identity-fraud-report/">30-fold increase in occurrences</a> from 2022 to 2023. 



 Deepfakes are now easier to create, with reports indicating that a <a href="https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/state-of-deepfakes/">convincing deepfake video can be produced in under 25 minutes</a> using just one clear image. 
 



<p>The widespread nature of deepfakes and their potential dangers highlight the growing market for sophisticated deepfake detection technologies to combat misinformation and protect individual and national security.</p>



 A Look Ahead 



<p>Our analysis demonstrates that effectively addressing the risks of deepfake manipulation requires a comprehensive strategy. A practical detection method integrates metadata analysis, facial and voice recognition, and behavioral cues. This approach systematically examines file data and scrutinizes patterns to identify inconsistencies and irregularities, providing a dependable mechanism for detecting deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rise of deepfake technology represents a critical challenge that spans multiple sectors, necessitating a comprehensive approach for effective management and mitigation. The advancement of deepfake detection technologies, underpinned by strong regulatory measures and increased public awareness, is essential to safeguard the integrity of digital media. As we progress into an era where digital authenticity can be easily manipulated, the demand for sophisticated, accessible, and effective detection systems is paramount. By enhancing cooperation among tech industry leaders, improving regulatory frameworks, and educating the public, we can effectively counter the risks associated with deepfakes. Moving forward, the deepfake detection market is poised for significant growth and will play an important role in preserving digital authenticity and protecting both individual and national security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-external-authentication-methods-in-microsoft/ba-p/4078808">Microsoft announced</a> the public preview of external authentication methods (EAM) for Entra ID. As a close partner, HYPR has worked extensively with Microsoft on the new offering and we are excited to be one of the first external authentication method integrations. This means organizations can now choose HYPR phishing-resistant authentication for their Entra ID MFA method, use it in Entra ID Conditional Access policies, Privileged Identity Management, and more.</p>  
<p>Our goal at Microsoft Security is to empower our customers with cutting-edge security solutions. The integration of Entra ID external authentication methods with HYPR reflects this mission, providing our customers with the flexibility to employ their preferred MFA methods, including phishing resistant MFA, to defend their environments against evolving threats."</p> 
<p>– Natee Pretikul, Principal Product Management Lead, Microsoft Security</p> 
 What Are Entra ID External Authentication Methods?  
<p>The external authentication methods feature was developed to replace the current Entra ID custom controls capability. The EAM solution uses industry standards and supports an open model, and provides far greater functionality than custom controls. With EAM, organizations can use their preferred authentication provider to satisfy MFA policy requirements, managing it the same way as Microsoft-native authenticators.</p> 
 Key Benefits of the HYPR and Microsoft External Authentication Methods Integration  
<p>The new integration benefits both HYPR and Microsoft customers on multiple levels.</p> 
<p>How the HYPR Entra ID external authentication method integration works</p> 
 Greater Flexibility and Choice For Your Entra ID Environments&nbsp;  
<p>With the HYPR–EAM integration, organizations can seamlessly use HYPR as an Entra ID authentication method to meet multi-factor authentication requirements, without the need for federation. Unlike federation configurations, the user identity is established and managed in Microsoft Entra ID. Essentially, HYPR’s leading phishing-resistant MFA becomes a like-native authentication option in the Entra ID ecosystem, and can be invoked to satisfy MFA requirements for Conditional Access policies, Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Identity Protection sign-in risk policies.</p> 
 Consolidate and Unify Authentication Processes  
<p>Many enterprises have complex IT environments with multiple identity providers and sign-in processes. These systems operate in silos, creating security blind spots, inefficiencies, and inconsistent user experiences. By choosing a platform-agnostic solution like HYPR, organizations can use the same secure, phishing-resistant authentication across IAM systems and workflows. HYPR already provides tight integrations with Microsoft Entra ID; the new EAM feature expands that connection. It empowers organizations to further consolidate their identity security and create consistent, unified MFA experiences for their users across all Microsoft and non-Microsoft environments.</p> 
 Improve Visibility and Control  
<p>The Microsoft external authentication method integration puts some additional powerful tools into the hands of HYPR customers. Administrators and security teams can view all HYPR authentication events in the Entra ID admin center when HYPR is used as an EAM method.</p> 
<p>Teams also can define highly granular Conditional Access controls, based on the type of authentication factor a user applies as they authenticate with HYPR. For example, access policies can vary depending on whether someone uses a fingerprint, facial recognition or PIN, to add even stronger levels of security assurance for specific use cases or resources.</p> 
 Learn More About HYPR as a Microsoft Entra ID External Authentication Method  
<p>Microsoft Entra ID EAM is now in public preview. Read <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-external-method-manage">Microsoft’s technical documentation</a> for more details about how this feature works. Current HYPR customers looking to join the public preview should contact their customer success representative.

<p>We’ve got a follow-up to Holochain 0.2.6, which was a big one (it was the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-2-is-here/">first recommended release</a> in the 0.2 line). This one brings a new ability to manage clone cells from a coordinator zome (yes, you read that right!), and the Rustdoc is now building again (a blessing to any devs who have needed to read the 0.2 documentation). There are some breaking changes, but only for those who are using the conductor APIs directly rather than through a client.</p><p>I also want to mention The Weave, a project that my colleague Eric and a few close collaborators have been working on in various forms over the years. Originally <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2022_pauldaoust_1866">demoed</a> as a groupware container called We, the <a href="https://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2022/07/26/id-390?ref=blog.holochain.org">philosophy</a> behind it has matured into a full vision for end-user-composable applications. What the heck does that mean? Skip to the bottom of this article to find out.</p> Holochain 0.2.8: Fix WebSocket binding <p>Release date: 30 April 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x (upgrade to 0.2.7 or newer to get the new features)<br>JS client compatibility: 0.16.x<br>Rust client compatibility: 0.4.x</p><p>This is a patch release that fixes the port binding issue in 0.2.7 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/3731?ref=blog.holochain.org">#3731</a>). We now recommend this release for general development.</p> Holochain 0.2.7: Backend clone management, Websocket fixes, documentation <p>NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE<br>Release date: 9 April 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x (upgrade to 0.2.7 to get the new features)<br>JS client compatibility: 0.16.x<br>Rust client compatibility: 0.4.x</p><p>NOTE: We’re not recommending this release for development work or distribution to end-users. We introduced a change to how Holochain binds the conductor API websocket to local interfaces, which caused it to get confused when the local interface supports both IPv4 and IPv6. If you scaffolded a hApp with Holochain 0.2.7, we recommend you run <code>cargo update</code> and <code>nix flake update</code> right away to save yourself some hassle.</p><p>That said, there are some interesting changes in here that you should know about!</p><p>The first big news is that clone management API functions, which were previously only available in the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/?ref=blog.holochain.org">app and admin APIs</a>, are now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/clone/index.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">available as HDK functions</a>. There are a few differences:</p>  <code>create_clone_cell</code> only takes an existing cell ID, not a role ID.  <code>delete_clone_cell</code> was previously only available to the admin API.  <p>The second point probably needs a bit of explaining. Unlike <code>disable_clone_cell</code>, <code>delete_clone_cell</code> is a somewhat destructive operation, because it makes it impossible to bring a clone cell and its data back to life (although the data is still technically recoverable if you know how to open up the database). That’s why it’s never been part of the app API where any old client could access it. These new HDK functions, by contrast, can only operate on the hApp that the calling cell lives in. We’re working on locking down the app API so only clients authorised to access an app can actually access it, which means we could safely make <code>delete_clone_cell</code> available to clients, but in the meantime this gives you a way to securely clean up cells once they’re no longer needed.</p><p>If you think you’d find it useful to manage clones from the back end, we’d like you to try out these new HDK functions and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues?ref=blog.holochain.org">tell us what you think</a>. We may, for instance, change <code>create_clone_cell</code> to match how the corresponding app API function works in 0.3 or 0.4.</p><p>The other big news is that we’ve <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/3372?ref=blog.holochain.org">cleaned up</a> the WebSocket code, so the app and admin APIs should have fewer bugs such as dropped connections (particularly when the conductor hits 100% CPU consumption). This does result in breaking changes, but only if you’re writing a Rust-based app that consumes the <code>holochain_websocket</code> crate directly. Anyone who calls the conductor APIs instead (which is most of you, including those who use the officially supported JavaScript and Rust clients) won’t be affected. If you don’t know whether you should care about the breaking changes, then you’re one of the ones who shouldn’t 🌝</p><p>Lastly, <code>holochain --build-info</code> now tells you the Lair keystore version.</p><p>Read about it all in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.2.7/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">changelog</a>, and make sure you scroll down because all the above updates happened in the two RCs before this release.</p> Holochain 0.1 retiring, 0.3 entering RC phase, 0.4 release cycle started <p>Now that Holochain 0.2.8 is the recommended release, the 0.1.x series won’t receive any more updates, and we’ll eventually shut down the centralised infrastructure that supports 0.1. We don’t have a specific time for shutting it down, but it should be considered end-of-life. We’re recommending that all developers still using Holochain 0.1 update their hApps to Holochain 0.2.8 now and distribute the update to their users as soon as possible.</p><p>Now, on to Holochain 0.3. Most hApp devs are already using a weekly release of Holochain 0.3 in their work, for instance Moss (see below). It contains a lot of stability and performance improvements that will be a welcome upgrade for devs and users.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve decided it’s time to acknowledge this reality and put an API freeze on Holochain 0.3.x. The first release candidate should be out soon. The <code>develop</code> branch of the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>holochain/holochain</code> repo</a>, and the weekly channel of Holonix, are now tracking the 0.4.x release series. If you’re already on 0.3, you’ll want to change the channel from <code>weekly</code> to <code>0_3_rc</code> so you don’t get bumped accidentally to 0.4 on your next nix flake update:</p> <code>// ...&nbsp; inputs = {
	versions.url&nbsp; = "github:holochain/holochain?dir=versions/0_3_rc";
// ...</code> <p>Once the first 0.3 release is recommended for general use, 0.2.x will go into maintenance mode, only receiving critical bug fixes as needed.</p><p>Note: Some devs may have seen a 0.3.0 release on crates.io or GitHub. This was an automation error, and we’ve removed it from crates.io, so the first official version of Holochain 0.3 will be 0.3.1 or higher.</p> The Weave: growing thrivable social fabric <p>I’m a big fan of tools. That’s why I like using my computer: it’s an infinite box of tools that I can use to get work done, communicate with friends and colleagues, create art, organise family memories, etc. And I like tools that feel like tools — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy?ref=blog.holochain.org">small programs that do one thing</a>, do it well, work well with each other, and use common data formats. This is brilliant, if you ask me, and it makes me feel like I have superpowers whenever I need to do something complicated.</p><p>I am not a big fan of silos. It frustrates me that my colleagues and I have to log into six or seven different cloud platforms just to get a Dev Pulse published. And each of them has its own separate content organisation system, discussion system, etc, etc. We end up having to recreate the same structures in multiple places. (And so do the developers — if you’re creating a kanban app, you can’t just drop Slack into it and get commenting for free; you have to write your own commenting feature from scratch.)</p><p>As far as I can tell, this silo thing isn’t designed to serve my colleagues and me. Perhaps it isn’t even designed. It’s probably just an accidental outcome of companies working with what they know. Or maybe it’s some business folks deciding they can only make money if they hold their customers tight. But whatever the reason, it’s wasteful and annoying.</p><p>That’s why, when my colleague Eric showed me what he and the <a href="https://lightningrodlabs.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Lightningrod Labs</a> team were doing with <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we?ref=blog.holochain.org">We (now called Moss)</a> in February, it was like he’d opened the door in a stuffy room. This was exactly how I’d wished my applications worked for at least fifteen years. Sure, it was a little rough around the edges — Eric acknowledged that — but I could see the potential lying just beyond the bugs and unimplemented features.</p> The vision of The Weave: a protocol for social spaces <p>I won’t get too deep into the philosophy — I’ll let <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Weave’s new website</a> do that — but I’ll give you a little teaser: what HTTP did for information, Holochain is trying to do for social spaces. But HTTP alone wasn’t enough. It needed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make an experience that people would want to use. In a similar way, the Weave is a formal specification that overlays a set of design principles to make Holochain more accessible for devs building social tools.</p><p>HTML introduced pages and, most importantly, hyperlinks as a way to connect them together. This made the Web make sense. It was just enough structure for developers to run with, and it resulted in an explosion of creativity that gave us the web of today. But neither HTTP nor HTML gave us open standard for social spaces, so these concepts got enclosed by big players like Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Holochain gives us open standards for permissionless social spaces. And what HTML et al did for HTTP, the Weave does for Holochain: assets that belong to your group can be linked together with ease.</p><p>How does this work?</p>  A tool is something that a group can install, and it gives them the power to work with assets of a certain type (chat threads, images, files, folders, kanban cards, calendar entries, etc).  Wherever it makes sense, an asset can have links on it that connect to other assets provided by the same tool — or some other completely different tool.  <p>And that second point is what changes everything. Now I can add a conversation thread to a calendar entry if I like. I can drop links on my kanban card that point to cells in a table (there’s already an Airtable clone available). We can drop cards, boards, emails, messages, conversations, and drawings into a folder hierarchy that’s shared across all our tools. Or three or four independent folder hierarchies, if we like.</p> Why do I care about this? <p>I get excited about this as both a user and a developer. As a user, I’m not constrained by the walls that others have created for me — I can stitch together tools in ways that make sense for me. As a practical example, my team can gather all the stuff pertaining to one Dev Pulse into one place. (Or will be able to, once someone comes up with a replacement for Canva.) I expect this will smooth out a lot of the bumps we face when we’re working on a written piece.</p><p>As a developer, it means I won’t have to reinvent everything when I eventually make my <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/scaffolding-my-first-happ-in-10-minutes/">seed swapping hApp</a> into an awesome working product. I won’t have to re-create messaging, reputation, user profile, or categorisation features — I can just focus on the core thing that matters, a way to let people find each other’s seed packet offerings.</p><p>Eric believes this sort of easy composability means that developers will feel empowered to create that little tool they’ve always wished existed. When you only have to focus on your core thing, the task seems much less frightening.</p><p>I think that part of the reason more great tools don’t get built is that people think you have to have a full-featured app, a team of devs to handle feature requests, and a business model in place for when your user base (and your cloud hosting costs) scale 100×.</p><p>But what would you create if you only had to think about one little thing, the thing you care about most? What is that thing for you?</p><p>I’d love it if you shared your little tool ideas in the <a href="https://discord.gg/jNCtnNVVGC?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Weave channel on our Discord</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://theweave.social/moss?ref=blog.holochain.org">download Moss, the first ‘frame’ implementing The Weave</a>, try some of the early stage tools, and <a href="https://theweave.social/?ref=blog.holochain.org">read the spec</a> to get an understanding of how tools in The Weave are made for composability.</p><p>(Fun fact: the equivalent of a ‘browser’ in The Weave is called a ‘frame’, a word that my lovely bride — a weaver — contributed! A frame loom is a special kind of weaving loom used for making tapestries. Kinda fitting for a program for groups weaving a shared story, don’t you think?)</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alandelacruz4?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">ALAN DE LA CRUZ</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-white-sweater-lying-on-bed-3irPFKfB0o0?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Here we go again.....</p><p>Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group, the largest health insurer in the U.S., just revealed to a congressional committee that a significant data breach had occurred. The intrusion was traced back to a subsidiary, Change Health Systems, which was compromised by the notorious Russian hacker group, BlackCat. This breach underscores the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional security measures, which often rely on single-factor authentication mechanisms and centralized data storage.</p><p>Two months ago, the hackers exploited a stolen password to infiltrate Change Health Systems, gaining access to an extensive array of sensitive patient data. During the testimony, Witty estimated that the personal data of potentially a third of all Americans could have been exposed, highlighting the enormous impact of the breach.</p><p>The incident spiraled when BlackCat, having seized control of Change Healthcare’s systems, demanded a $22 million ransom. Witty confirmed the payment of the ransom, a move made independently in a desperate bid to mitigate the damage. The breach not only affected UnitedHealth's customers but also reached non-customers due to Change Healthcare’s role in processing over 15 billion transactions annually.</p><p>UnitedHealth is now committed to a rigorous data review and is taking proactive steps to support those affected. This includes establishing a dedicated website for information dissemination and offering two years of free credit monitoring services. The company has expressed its determination to bolster defenses and provide necessary aid to both consumers and providers shaken by this event.</p> How Bloom Could Have Helped <p>This incident once again brings to light the critical need for robust, resilient security solutions like those provided by <a>Bloom</a>. Bloom’s cutting-edge self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials solutions are designed to prevent such breaches.</p><p>At <a>Bloom</a>, we advocate for the implementation of decentralized identity solutions that eliminate single points of failure, such as those exploited in the UnitedHealth incident.</p> The Broader Impact of Ransomware <p>The rise in ransomware attacks is a growing concern globally, with payments to hackers in 2023 reaching a record $1.1 billion. These attacks are increasingly sophisticated and are carried out by a diverse array of actors, from large criminal networks to solo perpetrators. The trend underscores the urgent need for comprehensive security strategies that include advanced technological defenses and proactive risk management practices.</p><p>In response to these challenges, Bloom encourages a shift towards more secure, decentralized frameworks that not only protect against such threats but also provide individuals with the tools they need to manage their own digital identities safely and effectively. By prioritizing security and privacy, we can better safeguard our digital ecosystems against the escalating wave of cybercrime.</p>

Airdrop 2 continues this series of airdrops to early Verida participants, adding another 2.2 million VDA Tokens to the campaign and increasing the cumulative allocated award amount to 3.2 million VDA Tokens. This airdrop rewards those who participated in Verida’s Galxe and Zealy campaigns in 2023 and early&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Note that while these initial Zealy and Galxe campaigns are completed and stakeholders can no longer earn rewards for their participation, Verida does have an <a href="https://app.galxe.com/verida">ongoing campaigns operating on Galxe</a> that remains open for participation.</p><p>More details on checking your Airdrop 2 eligibility and claiming rewards will be shared in the coming week, so stay&nbsp;tuned.</p> 2,200,000 VDA Token Airdrop&nbsp;Details <p>Participants in Verida’s initial Zealy and Galxe campaigns will be eligible for rewards for actions completed during these campaigns. Participants who engaged with campaigns on both platforms will also be eligible for a reward boost for their early committed efforts.</p><p>On Galxe, users engaged with Verida’s Acacia and Mainnet launch campaigns and were able to earn limited edition Galxe OATs after undertaking a range of activities. More than 11,000 unique wallets participated in these campaigns and will be eligible for airdrop&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>In addition, Verida conducted a campaign on Zealy, where nearly 20,000 wallets participated, with roughly 10,000 individual wallets earning more than 450 Zealy Points during this campaign. Of this group, the approximately 3,600 wallets in the 60th percentile and above, effectively those wallets earning at least 1,485 Zealy Points, will be eligible for VDA airdrop&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>All of these users, pending eligibility checks based on residency and other compliance obligations, will be eligible for VDA Storage Credit Token&nbsp;rewards.</p> Zealy Points&nbsp;Campaign <p>A total of 9,991 wallets earned more than 24 million Zealy points during the Zealy campaign. Verida expects to award 1,000,000 VDA tokens to members of this group who earned at least 1,485 Zealy&nbsp;Points.</p><p>Participating wallets in this campaign were grouped by Zealy points, with over 1,000 wallets earning nearly 12 million Zealy points, or almost half the total amount earned, and will be rewarded with 400 VDA tokens per wallet. The remainder of the rewards dedicated to this Zealy campaign will be distributed proportionally between the two lower tiers of wallets, as illustrated in the table&nbsp;below.</p> Galxe Testnet and Mainet Launch Campaigns <p>Additional campaigns on Galxe, where users received Galxe OATs for completing tasks on both the Verida mainnet and testnet, received equally impressive participation. More than 9,000 wallets completed tasks on the Verida testnet enabling them to earn a Galxe OAT, and another 2,000 wallets completed similar tasks following Verida’s transition to&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Of the above two groups, 475 wallets completed the steps to earn a Galxe OAT on both mainnet and testnet, and will receive 200 VDA Tokens. Both mainnet and testnet OATs will earn participants 100 VDA Tokens, and the overall reward amount is over 1.1 million VDA Tokens, as illustrated below.</p> Bonus Allocation for Participants in Both Zealy and Galxe Campaigns <p>In addition to the above reward allocations, Verida has included a bonus reward for participants in both campaigns.</p><p>As seen below, three bonus reward tiers were established, based on a combination of Zealy campaign participation as well as earning a Galxe OAT for either testnet, mainnet, or both stages of the campaign.</p> Combined Airdrop Award&nbsp;Amounts <p>Collectively, airdrop awards for these two campaigns, in addition to the bonus award for wallets participating in both campaigns, bring the total for Verida’s Airdrop 2 to over 2.2 million VDA&nbsp;Tokens.</p><p>These awards bring the total announced airdrop reward amount, when combined with airdrop 1, to more than 3.2 million VDA Tokens across Verida’s two initial airdrops. Verida intends to announce the details of additional airdrop and reward programs prior to its upcoming token&nbsp;listing.</p> The Airdrop 2 VDA Reward&nbsp;Pool <p>2.2 million VDA Storage Credit Tokens have been allocated to this airdrop, and will be distributed between all qualified wallets based on verified activities and after a final analysis of all completed records has concluded and points tallied, after which reward amounts will be finalized. Airdrop tokens will be claimable 60 days after the&nbsp;TGE.</p><p>After claiming the tokens, holders will be able to use their VDA within the network to <a href="https://community.verida.io/verida-token-vda/vda-token-utility">pay for data storage and to access other ecosystem initiatives</a>.

<p>Historically, the insurance industry hasn’t had a reputation for being quick to adopt new technologies. However, ongoing regulatory pressures, rising competition, and changing policyholder demands have created new challenges for insurers, which digital transformation can help to address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, leading insurance companies have become much more policyholder-centric, catering to the unique needs, behaviors, and preferences of consumers rather than offering a one-size-fits-all approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These high-touch, personalized customer experiences have driven better policyholder satisfaction, loyalty, and retention, all of which support insurers’ bottom line. However, adopting a digital insurance model generates new concerns around policyholder data protection and online account security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog will explore the ongoing digital transformation of the insurance market, how the customer experience has been impacted, and what traditional insurers can do to deal with market headwinds and orchestrate a seamless experience for policyholders. </p>

<p>In the past year, Bluesky has grown from 40K users to 5.6M users. We’ve made it possible to create custom algorithms, introduced community-driven moderation, and opened up federation. This has laid the foundation for a social protocol that can exist long after Bluesky the app does.</p>
<p>What’s coming next? Over the next few months, we’ll be putting more of our energy into the application. This includes a lot of “Quality of Life” improvements and some long-requested features. The biggest changes will be:</p>
 
 DMs 
 Video 
 Improved Custom Feeds 
 Improved anti-harassment features 
 OAuth 
 
<p>We’re very excited to deliver these features you’ve been asking for. We don’t have exact timelines, but you can expect to see all of these in the next few months.</p>
 DMs (direct messages) 
<p>Historically, all bluesky posts have been public. But there’s a world of interactions that are opened up when users can directly message each other. Making personal connections, finding job opportunities, organizing events, workshopping posts – there’s a lot of reasons to slide into the DMs.</p>
<p>We’re currently working on a DM service that will integrate into the Bluesky app. This service will be “off protocol” at first so we can develop iteratively. We’ll use what we learn to land protocol-driven DMs in the future. For an update on what’s next for the protocol, <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2024-protocol-roadmap">see our protocol roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>The v1 of DMs will be one-to-one. You’ll be able to restrict who can DM you (open, followed users only, and disabled). If you’ve used DMs on other social networks, it should feel familiar.</p>
 Video 
<p>Our devs keep getting told about cute animal videos which our users can’t share. The guilt is terrible.</p>
<p>We’re still finalizing the details, but it’s looking like the v1 of video integration on Bluesky will be 90-second clips that you can share on your posts.</p>
 Improved Custom Feeds 
<p>“Custom Feeds” are one of the best features of Bluesky, allowing users to completely customize their timeline, but they’re still pretty tough to work with. Our community has done an incredible job filling in the gaps, but we want to finally invest some more energy into making Feeds better.</p>
<p>Here’s the list of ideas in the works:</p>
 
 In-app feed creation. 
 The ability to submit posts to feeds, curate the submissions, and manually moderate what’s included. 
 Better feed discovery, and a way to see trending feeds. 
 New feedback mechanisms which the algorithmic feeds can request, such as “show more” and “show less” buttons, and a way to track which posts have been seen to stop duplicates from showing so often. 
 The ability to move “Following” out of the leftmost tab of your homepage. 
 Feed “following” to drive superfeeds which show what’s happening in each of your communities. 
 Better caching strategies to improve performance. 
 
<p><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">Algorithmic choice</a> has been a key goal of Bluesky from the start, and we can’t wait to move Custom Feeds forward. It’s incredible how much our community has done with them already, and we think a little extra love will enable you to go even further.</p>
<p>What you see on social media is mostly determined by algorithms, and giving you the power to control your algorithms like this is one of the most important things we do.</p>
 Improved Anti-harassment Features 
<p>Public social networks unfortunately all have to deal with the problem of users who want to troll, harass, and just make other people’s lives miserable. Over the past year, we’ve <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/6-23-2023-moderation-proposals">implemented tooling</a> like reply controls for threads, user lists, and community-driven moderation through labeling, but there is still more work to be done.</p>
<p>In the months to come, we’ll be doing another pass over moderation tooling, with a focus on anti-harassment mechanisms. We’ll be publishing more on this soon.</p>
 OAuth 
<p>You know those “Log in with Facebook” or “Log in with Google” buttons you see in apps? What if there was a “Log in with Bluesky” button? We think there should be! OAuth is the internet standard that makes that possible, and we’re bringing it to Bluesky and atproto.</p>
<p>OAuth is especially important for third-party clients – it’ll make signing in easier and safer for users. You never share your password with other clients, and “App Passwords” will no longer be required.</p>
<p>Once OAuth lands, we’ll expand on our 2FA model to enable more factors than email (which landed last week).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0004-oauth">read about our technical design here</a>.</p>
 See you on Bluesky! 
<p>If you haven't tried Bluesky yet, <a href="https://bsky.app/">sign up here</a> and give it a spin. We'll see you there!</p>

  <p>Today we’re announcing that Platform SSO for macOS is available in public preview with Microsoft Entra ID. Platform SSO is an enhancement to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin">Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices</a> that makes usage and management of Mac devices more seamless and secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the start of public preview, Platform SSO will work with Microsoft Intune. Additional mobile device management (MDM) providers will be added during the public preview. Please contact your MDM provider for more information on support and availability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this release, we’re introducing Microsoft Entra Join for macOS. This feature uses the Enterprise SSO plug-in to create a hardware-bound device record in Entra ID. Entra Join requires the use of an Entra ID organizational account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we’re making three new ways to authenticate available, all configurable with MDM and available as part of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">Microsoft Entra ID Free</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Passwordless authentication with Secure Enclave: Like Windows Hello for Business, this method allows the user to interactively sign in to the desktop with their local account and password. Once the user signs in, a hardware-bound cryptographic key stored in the device’s Secure Enclave can be used as a trusted credential with Entra ID, giving the user SSO across applications that use Entra ID for authentication. This method allows users to go passwordless with Touch ID to unlock their device and be signed into Entra ID under the hood using a device-bound key. It can save organizations money by removing the need to purchase security keys, card readers, or other hardware. For information on our security and compliance standards, please see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/standards/nist-authenticator-types">this guide</a>.  
 Passwordless authentication with smart cards: With this method, the user signs into the Mac using an external smart card (or smart-card-compatible hard token like Yubikey). Once the device is unlocked, the smart card is further used with Entra ID to grant SSO across apps that use Entra ID for authentication.  
 Password synchronization with the local account: This method enables the user to interactively sign into the local machine account with their Entra ID password, granting SSO across apps that use Entra ID. The user no longer needs to remember separate passwords, and any changes to the Entra ID password are synchronized to the local machine.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting today, you’ll find updated documentation and tutorials for Platform SSO for macOS on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/macos-psso">Microsoft Learn</a> to guide you through setup, deployment, usage, and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, you’ll want to take the following steps to help your organization prepare:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-company-portal-macos">Update devices to use Company Portal 5.2404.0 or newer.</a> 
 Deploy the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin">Enterprise SSO plug-in</a>. 
 Ensure users are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-mfa-policy">registered for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication</a>. For the best experience, we recommend using Microsoft Authenticator.  
 For Google Chrome users, install the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/windows-accounts/ppnbnpeolgkicgegkbkbjmhlideopiji?pli=1">Microsoft Single Sign On extension</a>. 
 Update macOS devices to macOS 13** (Ventura) or later. macOS 14 (Sonoma) is recommended for the best user experience and feature set.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>** Note that migration from non-shared keys on macOS 13 to shared keys (supported on macOS 14+) requires user re-registration of the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Even more capabilities on the way 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through incremental releases over public preview, we’ll gradually introduce additional controls, reports, audit, and sign–in logging capabilities, plus APIs in Microsoft Graph to configure, query, and manage them. Please note that like Windows Hello for Business, some features may require a premium Entra ID license. </p>

 Universal Basic Nutrient Income — Institutional Infrastructure for 2040 Food Preparedness <p>This blog post marks the starting point of our work on the Universal Basic Nutrient Income (UBNI) policy instrument in Sweden. This speculative design project is part of our ongoing efforts within DM Food Systems Mission to deliver <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darkmatterlabs_%3F%3F%3F%3F-%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F-%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F-activity-7180940750669381635-WpnX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">real-world options for the new life-ennobling economy</a>, and the umbrella “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/102411013/admin/feed/posts/">9 out of 10” Protein Shift Innovation Platform</a> sponsored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Vinnova</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/102411013/admin/feed/posts/">.</a> It continues our work from the <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab">Rapid Transition Lab</a> on food system resilience, and <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/the-dark-matter-of-food-farmacy-374436f092fe">food repricing in Sweden</a>. We will collaborate on this with local partners <a href="https://miljomatematik.se/">MiljöMatematik</a>.</p><p>The project proposes the introduction of Universal Basic Nutrient Income as a model for alleviating barriers to a large-scale shift towards more sustainable and healthy diets, as well as for preparing Sweden for an increasingly uncertain future through stimulating resilient local production. The realisation of such a system will be explored through a radical repricing mechanism based on true cost accounting. Furthermore, the new institutional infrastructure around such instrument needs to be aided by an increased, and coordinated ecosystem investment capacity in adequate portfolios of system interventions that can respond to different futures (e.g. 2 deg., 8 deg., supply chain collapse futures).</p><p>The prototyping phase will be carried out in Malmö where we aim to engage in food environment mapping to address affordability, accessibility, barriers and enablers to local sustainable consumption. We will test the role of UBNI under multiple future risk scenarios, and live-demonstration with citizens which will further inform dietary recommendations, policy design and municipal food system preparedness levels.</p> Consider the following scenario <p>The year is 2040. Sweden is now faced with the consequences of planetary ecological collapse due to the collective failure of transforming vital systems to meet the urgent demands of sustainability in the speed and scale required. The nation is now standing at a critical societal tipping point where the self-sufficiency agendas and local food systems’ sustainability intersect with the welfare of the citizens.</p>Fig 1. “Angry birds” escaped from a flooded peri-urban farm due to an abrupt rain event in 2035 (Image by the authors — Midjourney)Fig 1b. Heavy rain events flood agricultural fields in southern Sweden in 2040 (Image by the authors — Midjourney)<p>The new reality of constantly increasing volatility in global markets, unstable pricing, scarce resources and extreme weather conditions has put immense pressure on the reliability of global food systems and societal functions. Seasonal food shortages, export bans and disruptions in global supply chains have caused Sweden to rapidly reassess its own food system. Inspired by some of the tests from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income_pilots">previous decades</a>, the Swedish government has introduced a Universal Basic Nutrient Income model (UBNI) and adjusted the taxation system in an attempt to safeguard the food system and ensure equitable access to healthy and sustainable food within planetary boundaries.</p>Fig 2. Food prices linked to true cost accounting of environmental, health, societal, and resilience impacts (Image by the authors — Midjourney)<p>An elaborate <a href="https://www.wwf.de/fileadmin/fm-wwf/Publikationen-PDF/Landwirtschaft/studie-true-cost-accounting-englisch.pdf">true cost accounting</a> model relating to dietary patterns enabled the creation of a mechanism where food pricing is linked to capacity of ecological restoration, carbon storage, multi-scalar crisis resilience, as well as <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/more-than-calories-a-deep-code-transformation-of-our-food-systems-1e8c2e0ff5d3">healthcare cost savings</a>, promoting <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/building-mental-wealth-34441f638e3b">mental wealth and preventive healthcare through nutrition</a> (see the blog post - <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/more-than-calories-a-deep-code-transformation-of-our-food-systems-1e8c2e0ff5d3">“More than calories: a deep code transformation of our food systems”, 2022</a>) Building on principles of regenerative economy, Swedes are now paying a dynamically changing Universal Basic Nutrition tax, composed through multiple instruments including increased VAT rates on foods with high costs to nature and environment. Through implementing this new taxation system, every Swedish citizen is now entitled to a provision of “free food” making the basic human right of equal access to sustainable and healthy foods a vital part of the new Swedish welfare&nbsp;system.</p>Fig 3.

The available products and recipes are based on seasonal occurrence, local availability, current global markets, or resilience. In order for foods to be UBNI-eligible, they need to have high nutritional value and be sourced in a sustainable manner with low climate impact while ensuring both human and animal welfare. Furthermore, the FoodBank’s sensing function is responsible for addressing changing supply conditions, crisis preparedness and adequate adaptation of its food composition.</p>Fig 4.

The illusion of choice is maintained and prevents the scheme to be labeled as governmental food rationing.

UBNI instrument and its Tranformation Fund resulting in new primary production territories (Image by the authors — Midjourney) System demonstrator — Purpose, Vision, and&nbsp;Goals <p>The purpose of Universal Basic Nutrient Income demonstrator is tofurther utilize the strong Swedish welfare infrastructure as a driver for large-scale dietary change, and societal resilience. Through perceiving equal access to sustainable and healthy foods as basic human rights and a vital part of the welfare system, barriers such as financial constraints, socio-economic context and attitudes might become less impactful in restricting the desired, society-wide dietary&nbsp;shifts.</p><p>The Universal Basic Nutrient Income model enables a rapid inclusion of less affluent socio-economic groups into healthy and sustainable dietary habits. By reducing the financial burden for citizens of accessing sustainable foods, it addresses a critical aspect of social&nbsp;equity.</p><p>Furthermore, recognizing the uncertain 2040 future, and continuous shrinking of actionable and safe operating space for humanity, the UBNI instrument with its FoodBank needs to be seen through the lens of preparedness. Supply side changes, global market disruptions, or an ecological collapse may alter the Bank’s composition. In the context of increasing volatilities, the dynamically changing base recommendation on what foods are considered resilient, sustainable and healthy will need to be supported by an institutionalized sensing and citizen support infrastructure informing what foods should be subsidized and which taxed, and in collapse scenarios, which ones rapidly produced or imported for resilience.</p><p>Hence, the vision behind this demonstrator is to shift the mindset from consumers being the main agents of change towards acknowledging the potential which lies in strong civic incentive mechanisms and multi-actor coordination infrastructure as means for achieving large-scale transformation and food sovereignty for all within multiple future possible scenarios.</p><p>Recognizing the power of <a href="https://www.ipes-food.org/_img/upload/files/PlatetoPlanetEN.pdf">local actor levels and governments</a> in spearheading action towards promoting healthy and sustainable diets, the FoodBank will deal not only as a base for UBNI but also as an organization for transparent and decentralized coordination (<a href="https://dao.biggreen.org/home">see: DAO</a>) between private, public and civic actors to co-curate and decide (e.g. through <a href="https://www.citydao.io/news/the-citydao-journal-3-how-could-citydao-use-quadratic-voting">quadratic voting</a>) on societal-scale portfolios of investments for preparedness, moving beyond short-return cycles, or grant making. In return, the institutionalized food programme will not be seen as a food rationing governmental initiative but a <a href="https://www.ipes-food.org/_img/upload/files/tippingthescales.pdf">democratization of “who decides what we&nbsp;eat?”</a></p><p>The main goal is to co-design and test the possibility of the Universal Basic Nutrient Income model. This will entail design incl. food-related true cost accounting models (TMG &amp; WWF, 2021), taxation and subsidies targeting dietary patterns (Röös et al, 2021), as well as foresight methodologies concerning the spectrum of future changes to dietary recommendations and food system risks endangering nutritional needs.</p> Prototype <p>The idea behind the prototype is to collaboratively develop a Universal Basic Nutrient Income Framework — an incentivising system that sees equal access to sustainable foods as a fundamental human right while addressing future uncertainties in the food&nbsp;system.</p><p>Refinement of the concept will be done through a collaborative foresight workshop with local food system actors based on Malmö municipality as test bed. Testing, and the tangible live demonstration will be done through an experiment with engagement of four local citizens scouting their local food environment in search for FoodBank sustainable foods and following a nutritional recommendation according to four future scenarios.</p>Fig 8.

Let’s work together towards a healthier, greener&nbsp;future!</p><p>A bit about us and our first seminar with sustainable consumption stewards</p><p>Innovation platforms for sustainable food&nbsp;future</p><p>The current Swedish food system places immense pressure on the environment, contributing to climate change by greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and biogeochemical flows. It is evident that a transformation is crucial in order for the food system to become more sustainable for both people and the environment. This transformation requires a systems approach. To accelerate this transformation, Vinnova is financing eight innovation platforms to drive innovation at the system level for a sustainable and competitive food system. The work is based on eight bold and inspiring missions, for a sustainable food system. Based on the missions, coordinating actors must mobilise resources and commitment from across the Swedish food system and its actors to identify levers for&nbsp;change.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rise-research-institutes-of-sweden/">RISE Research Institutes of Sweden</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/darkmatterlabs/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sisp---swedish-incubators-&amp;-science-parks/">SISP — Swedish Incubators &amp; Science Parks</a>, makes up one of the eight platforms, aiming towards a 2040 future where the Swedish food system is sustainable and within a safe operating space for both humans and the planet. We call ourselves.</p><blockquote>9outof10 — Powering the shift towards sustainable Swedish protein production and consumption.</blockquote> Seminar I — Foresight seminar with Swedish food system actors working with sustainable consumption frameworks. <p>Being in an explorative phase, we have so far consulted some of the most knowledgeable actors on climate assessment frameworks in Sweden to help us map and make sense of the complex landscape of the Swedish food system. Furthermore, to get a better understanding of the vast number of dietary guidelines available, and the level of alignment within this space, we organised an introduction seminar with researchers and representatives of the different guidelines developed to meet both climate and nutritional goals.</p><p>In addition to discussing the frameworks, we consulted the seminar participants on our mission that “ 9/10 meals in Sweden should be within planetary boundaries by 2040”, with a specific focus on shifting our protein consumption. Using foresight exercises and with this in mind, we discussed enablers and barriers to get closer to our mission statement. Through our conversations, we quickly discovered some issues with this mission, one being the difficulty to measure where we currently sit and how to measure future&nbsp;success.</p> Lack of standardisation in climate assessment guidelines <p>One of the main reasons behind this is the lack of standardisation within climate assessment frameworks that applies to all food products, produce and services. Part of the reason for this seems to be the difficulty, and/or inability, to properly measure the actual impact of certain products. Another large contributing factor to this is the large share of imported foods. Here, the environmental impact of production has been ‘outsourced’ to other places in the world, which additionally makes it difficult to assess and collect data for both the local and the wider environmental impacts.</p> Inaccessibility to&nbsp;data <p>Prominent research institutions like RISE as well as actors such as CarbonCloud and Coop, have conducted thorough analyses on the diverse impacts of food on climate change. These databases are comprehensive and valuable. However, due to the high cost of creating such data sets, access to data is not readily available, nor free of charge. This prevents smaller organisations and SMEs from assessing the climate impact of their products and services. The participants therefore highlighted the need for open access data in order to enable equal access to ensure comparative standards, to reach a common&nbsp;mission.</p> Primary production as part of the&nbsp;solution <p>It is clear that there is insufficient focus on how to make the transition for primary production a viable business model — finding these models is key to enable the transition. The demands on primary production to transition to sustainable practices do not currently seem to level with the amount of support given to producers. It therefore carries a lot of risk particularly for smaller producers. Furthermore, the great potential our arable land holds is not sufficiently recognised. Not only is it important in terms of food production capacity, but it is also important in terms of enabling crucial ecosystem services. Updated policies, business models and impact investments are needed to enable this change. The food system today accounts for 20–30% of the GHG emissions but attracts only 7% of the impact investments.</p> Consumer behaviour <p>Although much of the responsibility lies with politicians to ensure that primary production and food producers stay within planetary boundaries, the power of consumer behaviour should not be ignored. The role of food, being both culturally contingent, traditional and habitual, plays an enormous role for what is being produced, and what we expect to see produced. Changing this behaviour, be it through nudging, hard policies or soft incentives, is crucial to enable a system change. Figuring out how to approach consumers will be paramount to reaching the&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Based on these conversations, it is evident that the main impetus is on policy makers, primary production and consumer behaviour for enabling our mission statement. By collecting knowledge and input from various parts of the value chain, we hope to garner enough information to tease out a path towards a more sustainable Swedish food system. The work now proceeds by bringing these main issues into a conversation with actors and industry organisations from the primary production side, as well as representatives from the consumer side, to further understand where innovation and restructuring must happen in order to achieve a sustainable and inclusive transition.</p><p>Sweden has significant potential to enhance its innovation capacity so that the food system contributes to preserving both the environment and human health, while also providing us with food, jobs, and quality of life. How to do this will be part of our upcoming workshop series exploring different key questions: How do we ensure that primary protein production is within planetary boundaries by 2040? How do we ensure that protein consumption is both socially, economically and environmentally just, while also healthy and good for the planet? Can we get key actors to unstick their minds from their daily work and contribute to this process by exploring future pathways towards reaching a sustainable food system by 2040, using foresight and scenario building exercises?</p><p>Intrigued yet? Good. Let’s keep in touch. Follow our page to see how our story unfolds while we explore different ways of using scenarios for unlocking the potential of Swedish future&nbsp;foods.</p><p>We’d also love your input, so feel free to comment, share, and engage with our posts now and in the&nbsp;future!</p> Contact <p>This blog post was written by Alex Hansten (Dark Matter Labs) and Mari W.

<p>Authors: Kriskanin Hengniran &amp; Nuttawut Kongsuwan, Finema Co.,&nbsp;Ltd.</p><blockquote>Note: This tutorial is heavily inspired by “KERI Tutorial Series — KLI: Sign and Verify with Heartnet” by Kent&nbsp;Bull</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://kentbull.com/2023/01/27/keri-tutorial-series-kli-sign-and-verify-with-heartnet/">https://kentbull.com/2023/01/27/keri-tutorial-series-kli-sign-and-verify-with-heartnet/</a></blockquote><p>This blog presents an introductory guide for implementing the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol using the Signify and KERIA agents. The guide starts with installation and running the agents using Docker containers. The guide then provides a script to showcase the use of Signify and KERIA agents, including procedures for creating autonomic identifiers (AIDs), signing messages, and verifying signatures.</p> Signify &amp;&nbsp;KERIA <p>Signify &amp; KERIA are open-source projects developed for building client-side identity-wallet applications using the KERI protocol. Signify-KERIA identity wallet utilizes the hybrid edge-cloud wallet architecture where Signify provides a lightweight edge wallet component whereas KERIA provides a heavier cloud wallet component. Signify and KERIA were designed based on the principle of “key at the edge (KATE)”. That is, essential cryptographic operations are performed at edge&nbsp;devices.</p><p>Some resources for Signify &amp; KERIA can be found&nbsp;here</p>  The Signify-KERIA protocol by Philip Feairheller: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/blob/main/docs/protocol.md">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/blob/main/docs/protocol.md</a>  KERI API (KAPI): <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/kapi/blob/main/kapi.md">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/kapi/blob/main/kapi.md</a>   Signify Edge&nbsp;Agent <p>Signify provides an edge agent for a KERI identity wallet and is used primarily for essential cryptographic operations including key pair generation and digital signature creation. Signify utilizes the hierarchical deterministic (HD) key algorithm. For example, a Signify application could safeguard a single master seed which is used to generate and manage any number of AIDs. Signify is designed to be lightweight so as to support devices with limited capabilities.</p><p>Signify is currently available in Typescript and&nbsp;Python</p>  SignifyPy (Python) <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signifypy">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signifypy</a>  Signify-TS (Typescript) <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts</a>   KERIA Cloud&nbsp;Agent <p>KERI Agent (KERIA) provides a cloud agent for a KERI identity wallet and is used for, e.g., data storage, agent-to-agent communications, and verification of KERI key event logs (KELs). KERIA is engineered to handle the heavy lifting for users, allowing their edge devices to stay lightweight while maintaining high security by performing all essential cryptographic operations at the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>A KERIA agent is cryptographically delegated by a Signify agent using the KERI delegation protocol. All instructions from a user are signed at the edge by a Signify agent and subsequently verified by a KERIA cloud agent. KERIA is currently available in Python: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria</a></p> Installation Guide for Node and&nbsp;NVM <p>In this guide, we will be using Node.js to run Signify-TS (Typescript) with a KERIA server running on a Docker container.</p> Install Node.js <p>Visit the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> website to download&nbsp;Node.js.</p> Install NVM on Linux or&nbsp;MacOS <p>To easily switch between different versions of Node.js, you could use Node Version Manager (NVM). NVM on Linux and macOS may be installed using&nbsp;curl</p> curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash <p>Alternatively, we could use&nbsp;wget</p> wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash  Install NVM on&nbsp;Windows <p>On Windows, NVM may be installed from the <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases">GitHub releases&nbsp;page.</a></p><p>Note: After installing NVM, do not forget to restart your terminal. Alternatively, you can refresh the available commands in your system path by executing source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh</p> Using NVM <p>To ensure that NVM is correctly installed, you can check its version&nbsp;with:</p> nvm ls <p>To install Node.js version 18.18.2,&nbsp;run:</p> nvm install v18.18.2 <p>Here, we use v18.18.2 in this guide. This is not a requirement and other versions of Node.js should work with Signify-TS.</p> Install Dependencies and Run a KERIA&nbsp;Server <p>To install dependencies for the tutorial, you could clone this repository <a href="https://github.com/enauthn/tutorial-signify-keria">https://github.com/enauthn/tutorial-signify-keria</a> and run the following script</p> git clone https://github.com/enauthn/tutorial-signify-keria<br>cd tutorial-signify-keria<br>npm install<br>docker-compose up -d <p>where docker-compose up -d runs a KERIA server in a Docker container. Alternatively, you could get a Docker image for running a KERIA server from Docker Hub <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/weboftrust/keria">https://hub.docker.com/r/weboftrust/keria</a>.</p> Running Signify-TS Scripts <p>Here, we demonstrate Signify-TS Scripts for signing and verifying an arbitrary message. Here, a signer, called Allie, signs a message “Hello Brett” and sends it to a verifier, called Brett. Brett subsequently obtains Allie’s key event log (KEL) and uses it to verify the signature on the&nbsp;message.</p> Connecting Signify clients to the KERIA&nbsp;server <p>First, Allie and Brett must boot and then connect to a KERIA server with their Signify (edge) clients. Each boot command creates a separate agent and a database in the KERIA server. see <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>Typically, Allie’s and Brett’s Signify scripts should run on separate devices, but here we put them in the same Typescript file for simplicity. Allie’s and Brett’s Signify clients may also connect to different KERI servers at different service endpoints. In this tutorial, both clients connect to a KERIA server running on the local host for simplicity.</p> await signify.ready();<br><br>const url = 'http://127.0.0.1:3901';<br>const bootUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:3903';<br>const bran1 = signify.randomPasscode();<br>const bran2 = signify.randomPasscode();<br><br>const allieClient = new signify.SignifyClient(<br>    url,<br>    bran1,<br>    signify.Tier.low,<br>    bootUrl<br>);<br>await allieClient.boot();<br>await allieClient.connect();<br><br>const brettClient = new signify.SignifyClient(<br>    url,<br>    bran2,<br>    signify.Tier.low,<br>    bootUrl<br>);<br>await brettClient.boot();<br>await brettClient.connect(); <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  signify.randomPasscode() generates a random string with 126-bit entropy using libsodium  new signify.SignifyClient(…) creates a new Signify instance, initialized with the newly generated passcode  allieClient.boot() creates a KERIA agent and a corresponding database at the KERIA server via port&nbsp;3903  allieClient.connect() connects a Signify agent to the corresponding KERIA agent that has been&nbsp;booted.  <p>Signify uses a passcode to generate cryptographic keys using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function (KDF)</a> where signify.Tier specifies how much the passcode is stretched.</p> Allie creates an&nbsp;AID <p>Before Allie can sign a message with the KERI protocol, she must first create an <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">autonomic identifier (AID)</a> with a key inception event in a <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7c43">Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL)</a>.</p> const icpResult1 = await allieClient<br>    .identifiers()<br>    .create('aid1', {});<br>await waitOperation(allieClient, await icpResult1.op());<br><br>const rpyResult1 = await allieClient<br>    .identifiers()<br>    .addEndRole('aid1', 'agent', allieClient!.agent!.pre);<br>await waitOperation(allieClient, await rpyResult1.op()); <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  allieClient.identifiers().create('aid1', {}) creates an AID where the Signify agent signs the inception event and sends the event along with its signature to the KERIA agent. Here, the AID is given an alias&nbsp;'aid1'.  allieClient.identifiers().addEndRole(...) cryptographically authorizes the KERIA agent to operate on behalf of the AID’s controller.  waitOperation(...) waits for the KERIA agent to complete its operation.  <p>addEndRole stands for “adding endpoint role authorization”. This is a mechanism in the KERI protocol where the controller of an AID cryptographically authorizes—by signing with a private key associated with the AID—a service endpoint of a KERIA agent to operate on the AID’s behalf. Another agent that needs to communicate with the authorized KERIA agent can then verify the authorization signature.</p> Brett resolves Allie’s&nbsp;AID <p>Allie and Brett may exchange their KELs using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-3-oobi-and-ipex-2e6b222f4b87">Out-Of-Band Introduction (OOBI)</a> protocol. Allie may generate her OOBI URL that points to her KERIA agent’s service endpoint (which has been authorized in the previous step) as&nbsp;follows:</p> const oobi1 = await allieClient.oobis().get('aid1', 'agent'); <p>The generated OOBI URL could be sent to Brett via an out-of-band channel such as email, messaging apps, or scanning QR code. Subsequently, Brett may ask his KERIA agent to resolve Allie’s OOBI to obtain the AID’s KEL from Allie’s KERIA&nbsp;agent:</p> const oobiOp = await brettClient.oobis().resolve(oobi1.oobis[0], 'aid1');<br>await waitOperation(brettClient, oobiOp);  Allie signs the&nbsp;Message <p>To sign a message, Allie may use the Signify<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/keeping.ts"> </a><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/keeping.ts">KeyManager class</a> as&nbsp;follows:</p> const aid1 = await allieClient.identifiers().get('aid1');<br>const keeper1 = await allieClient.manager!.get(aid1);<br>const message = "Test message";<br>const signature = await keeper1.sign(signify.b(message))[0];<br>console.log('signature', signature); <p>which generates the following <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR-encoded</a> signature:</p> signature AAAnBe-VPfBU9-3eb7aM5GNwr_NBuoJzA8vm9AFPmgj3I4LIv1mup2bwPDlbIQ6gAgtaEZg5rwE1_fTVVTmPo0oI <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  allieClient.identifiers().get('aid1') retrieves the information about the AID with alias 'aid1' from the KERIA&nbsp;agent  allieClient.manager!.get(aid1) creates an instance from the KeyManager class called a keeper that signs an arbitrary byte string with keeper.sign()  signify.b() turns a text string into a byte&nbsp;string.  <p>When a Signify agent creates an AID, it uses a salt together with its passcode to generates cryptographic keys associated with the AID. The salt is then encrypted and sent to the KERIA agent. allieClient.identifiers().get('aid1') also retrieves and decrypts the salt where the KeyManager could use the salt to regenerate the key for signing the&nbsp;message.</p> Brett verifies Allie’s signature <p>After Allie sends the message to Brett, Brett wants to make sure the message is really from Allie by verifying the signature on the message. Brett may retrieve Allie’s KEL and the corresponding <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">key state</a> of her AID to verify the signature as&nbsp;follows:</p> const aid1StateBybrettClient = await brettClient.keyStates().get(aid1.prefix);<br>const siger = new signify.Siger({qb64: signature});<br>const verfer = new signify.Verfer({<br>    qb64: aid1StateBybrettClient[0].k[0]<br>});<br>const verificationResult = verfer.verify(siger.raw, signify.b(message));<br>console.log('verificationResult', verificationResult); <p>which gives the following output:</p> verificationResult true <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  brettClient.keyStates().get(aid1.prefix) retrieves the key state of the Allie’s&nbsp;AID  signify.Siger({qb64: signature}) is a signature-wrapper instance of the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/siger.ts">Siger class</a>, initialized with the Allies’ signature on the&nbsp;message.  signify.Verfer(...) is a verifier-wrapper instance of the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/verfer.ts">Verfer class</a>, initialized by the Allie’s public&nbsp;key  verfer.verify(...) then verifies the message and its signature using Allie’s public&nbsp;key  <p>The verification of the signature against the message indicates that the signature is valid. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the message that Brett received from&nbsp;Allie.</p> Conclusion <p>This tutorial gives a brief introduction for using the KERI protocol with the Signify and KERIA agents, which provide a footing for building client-side KERI-based applications. Signify provides libraries for building KERI edge agents whereas KERIA provides libraries for building companion cloud agents. These agents follow the principle of “key at the edge (KATE)” where essential cryptographic operations are performed at edge&nbsp;devices.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is still the early days for these two projects, and there are not many educational materials around as of May 2024. To dive deeper into these two projects, I recommend studying their integration scripts at <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/tree/main/examples/integration-scripts">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/tree/main/examples/integration-scripts</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-tutorial-sign-and-verify-with-signify-keria-833dabfd356b">KERI Tutorial: Sign and Verify with Signify &amp; Keria</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The Microsoft Entra team is looking forward to connecting with you next week at <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/usa">RSA Conference 2024</a> (RSAC) from May 6 to 9, 2024, in San Francisco! As we enter the age of AI and there are more identities and access points to protect, identity security has never been more paramount. From protecting workforce and external identities to non-human identities—that outnumber human identities 10 to 1—the task of securing access and the interactions between them requires taking a more comprehensive approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help customers protect every identity and every access point, I’d like to highlight recent innovations that we’ll be showcasing at this upcoming event:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Expanded passkey support for Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra ID external authentication methods&nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra External ID general availability&nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra Permissions Management and Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration general availability&nbsp; 
 Our vision for cloud access management to strengthen multicloud security&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be demonstrating these new innovations and sharing more about how to take a holistic approach to identity and access at RSA Conference 2024 (see the table at the end of this blog for more information).&nbsp;Now, let’s take a closer look at Microsoft Entra innovations that we’ll be showcasing at RSAC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Expanded passkey support for Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to supporting sign-ins via a passkey hosted on a hardware security key, Microsoft Entra ID now includes additional support for device-bound passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS and Android. This will bring strong and convenient authentication to mobile devices for customers with the strictest security requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A passkey is a strong, phishing-resistant authentication method you can use to sign in to any internet resource that supports the W3C WebAuthN standard. Passkeys represent the continuing evolution of the FIDO2 standard aimed at creating a secure and user friendly passwordless experience for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about using passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app, <a href="https://aka.ms/AuthappPasskey">check out this blog.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra ID external authentication methods&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While organizations increasingly choose to unify their multifactor authentication and access management solutions, thus, simplifying their identity architectures, some organizations have already deployed MFA and want to use their pre-existing MFA provider with Microsoft Entra ID. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-external-authentication-methods-in-microsoft/ba-p/4078808">External authentication methods</a> allow organizations to&nbsp; leverage any MFA solution to meet the MFA requirement with Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At launch, external authentication methods integrations will be available with the following identity providers: Cisco, ENTRUST, HYPR, Ping, RSA, SILVERFORT, Symantec, THALES, and TrustBuilder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-external-method-manage">documentation</a> to learn more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra External ID general availability&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our next-generation, developer friendly customer identity access management (CIAM) solution, <a href="https://aka.ms/External_ID">Microsoft Entra External ID</a> will become generally available on May 15, 2024. Whether you're building applications for partners, business customers, or consumers, External ID makes secure and customizable CIAM simple. External ID enables you to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure all identities with a single platform&nbsp; 
 Streamline secure collaboration&nbsp; 
 Create frictionless end user experiences&nbsp; 
 Accelerate the development of secure applications&nbsp; 
 
<p>Learn more about External ID by reading our <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDGABlog">announcement blog!</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Permissions Management and Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration general availability&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploying applications and infrastructure across multiple clouds has become the norm. Ensuring the security of cloud applications and infrastructure requires integrating identity and permission insights into the overall security strategy. This objective is achieved through the integration of Microsoft Entra Permissions Management with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC), which will soon be generally available in May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integration streamlines access and permission insights into other cloud postures through a unified interface. Customers benefit from recommendations on mitigating risks within the MDC dashboard, including unused identities, overprivileged permissions, and unused super identities. This facilitates the enforcement of least privilege access for cloud resources across Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Our vision for cloud access management to strengthen multicloud security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploying applications and infrastructure across multiple clouds has become common in today’s business landscape. At Microsoft, we have long prioritized the protection of customers’ environments, regardless of the number of clouds they use or the providers they choose. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent <a href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/2024-State-of-Multicloud-Security-Risk-Report.pdf">2024 State of Multicloud Security Risk Report</a> reconfirms the importance of securing access in multicloud and presents valuable findings based on one year of actual usage data to enhance organizations’ understanding of their risks and facilitate the development of effective mitigation strategies. Key findings related to access and permissions include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Only 2% of the 51,000 permissions granted to human and workload identities in 2023 were utilized, with 50% of these permissions classified as high-risk.&nbsp; 
 More than 50% of identities are identified as super identities, indicating they have access to all permissions and resources within the multicloud environment.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above all, this report confirms that the complexity of multicloud risk continues to grow. Coupled with the increase in cyberattacks targeting identities, especially those assigned to non-human entities, security teams are overwhelmed. Consequently, organizations are shifting priorities from infrastructure protection to actively monitoring and securing interactions between human and workload identities accessing corporate cloud resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe Microsoft can help address these challenges with our new vision for cloud access management, offering visibility into all identities and permissions in use, along with proactive risk detection to enhance protection and management of your environment. We will continue our journey to secure access to resources anywhere by developing a new converged platform that encompasses four key solution areas critical for organizations, based on our continuous engagements with customers:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)&nbsp; 
 Privileged Access Management (PAM)&nbsp; 
 Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)&nbsp; 
 Workload Identity and Access Management (IAM)&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned to learn more about our vision in the coming weeks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Key Insights: 
 
 Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) are gaining momentum as governments seek to improve service quality, combat fraud, and streamline identity verification processes. 
 Organizations like AAMVA and NIST play crucial roles in setting standards and governance for mDL implementation. 
 Interoperability is a key challenge, with the ISO standard for mDLs emerging as a widely adopted solution. 
 Governments must decide between issuing mDLs through their own wallets or leveraging third-party wallets like those from Apple, Google, and Samsung. 
 mDLs could enable seamless online identity verification for industries like banking, notary services, and access management, reducing transaction abandonment rates. 
 Potential monetization models for issuers and verifiers are being explored, as the value of mDLs lies primarily in the verification side. 
 
 Strategies: 
 
 Governments are implementing legislation to allow for the acceptance of digital forms of state-issued identities, including mDLs. 
 AAMVA’s Digital Trust Service aims to facilitate cross-state verifications by providing the necessary public keys to read mDLs. 
 Facial biometrics and liveness detection are expected to become more prevalent in conjunction with mDL verification for enhanced security. 
 Governments and industry stakeholders are exploring ways to vet and register verifiers to ensure responsible use of mDL data.

<p>Today’s consumers’ expectations for their financial interactions are changing. They require a digitally native, seamless, consistent, instantaneous experience with their financial provider right from the get-go. No longer are they willing to wait several days for identity verifications or for microdeposits to clear to start using their account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, we know that everyday bad actors are finding new ways to break the system. As more people and businesses enter the digital economy, it’s critical that we keep them secure across all touchpoints with their accounts and beyond. Financial Institutions must protect their customers’ accounts from fraud to ultimately drive primacy, grow deposits and encourage top of wallet behaviors, thus helping them recoup the estimated <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/news/bank-onboarding/the-importance-of-primacy-in-banking-176198/">$450 average cost of acquisition</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking is the thread connecting the ecosystem to make account opening faster, secure, and more frictionless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a common scenario that financial institutions deal with on a daily basis:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 ‘John Doe’ opened a new checking account with ‘AcmeBank’ and is ready to fund it with another existing account he has with ‘Partnerbank’&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 How does AcmeBank know that John is the actual owner of the account at Partnerbank? Should Acmebank proceed with posting the ACH file to the Nacha (ACH) network, letting the transaction go through? If John Doe were a bad actor, and Acme bank allowed the payment to go through without doing appropriate checks, John Doe could move that money elsewhere and AcmeBank could get an unauthorized payment return from ‘Partnerbank’, resulting in fraud losses.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Similarly, some insurance companies simply ask for account and routing number verification before disbursing funds, not verifying the identity of the receiver. Here, John Doe can impersonate another person, and use his own personal details to re-direct an insurance payout or a payroll disbursement to his account. &nbsp; 
 



 What is the ecosystem doing about it?&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/fighting-credit-push-fraud#:~:text=Under%20these%20new%20Rules%2C%20all,in%20monitoring%20transactions%20for%20fraud.">New rules and guidelines are being published by Nacha</a> – operator of ACH payments – that introduce additional risk management frameworks for ACH senders, as well as recipients. Ecosystem participants such as merchants, ecommerce platforms, lenders, and insurance providers may be required to include account verification and identity verification, multi-factor authentication, velocity tracking and KYC/KYB improvements. <a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/mastercard">Mastercard</a> is a Nacha Preferred Partner for Compliance and Risk and Fraud Prevention with a focus on account validation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to more thorough fraud checks being conducted by originators, receivers now also must participate in fraud monitoring and flagging to reduce risk. In the above example, Acmebank, the receiving financial institution, will also need to perform additional fraud checks. &nbsp;</p>



 What can you do?&nbsp; 



<p>Mastercard Open Banking helps financial institutions identify, manage and tackle fraud risk on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; Examples of our solutions include instant account details verification, device and identity verification. When used in conjunction with other customer fraud solutions, they help secure interactions that consumers have with their financial provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Mastercard debuted Open Banking Identity Verification for the U.S. market and continues to invest in additional functionality that leverage our extensive fraud and identity networks. Before initiating a transaction, financial institutions can verify a number of factors, including:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Confirming account ownership information, including name, address, phone and email, in real-time&nbsp; 



 Validating identity profiles and quantifying identity risk&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Examining the risk level of user activity patterns and associations to detect fraudulent behavior&nbsp; 



 Verifying device authenticity and capturing signals of device fraud&nbsp; 
 



<p>Beyond Open Banking Identity Verification, Mastercard offers services to streamline account funding, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Account Owner Verification: A one-time API request that returns the account owner(s) name, address, email and phone number for a select account. This verifies that the bank account being linked is owned by the person opening a new account and complements KYC risk mitigation in real time.&nbsp; 



 Account Detail Verification: Instantly authenticates and verifies account details, including account and routing numbers, to help mitigate fraud, reduce manual entry errors and maximize confidence in payment transactions.&nbsp; 



 Account Balance Check: Easily determines account balance before moving funds to a new account. This ensures that the amount being moved to the new account is available with an accurate, real-time balance snapshot, and reduces costly NSF returns.&nbsp; 



 Payment Success Indicator: A score that predicts a transaction’s likelihood to settle for a specific consumer “today” and up to nine days in the future. &nbsp; 
 



<p>Now let’s look the journey again with our solutions:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Consumer has opened a new checking account with ‘Acme Bank’ and is ready to fund it using existing bank account at ‘Partnerbank’&nbsp; 



 Consumer agrees to T&amp;Cs and gives permission through Mastercard’s Connect widget for their bank data to be accessed and shared with Acme bank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Consumer selects their Partnerbank account and enters banking login credentials (or biometrics where applicable)&nbsp; 



 Consumer selects funding account and amount&nbsp; 



 Acme bank calls our above APIs in the background to check account and identity details in real-time and proceeds with the processing the payment&nbsp;

  <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I’m thrilled to share that the public preview of external authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID is scheduled for release in the first half of May. This feature will allow you to use your preferred multifactor authentication (MFA) solution with Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploying MFA is the single most important step to securing user identities. A <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/how-effective-is-multifactor-authentication-at-deterring-cyberattacks/">Microsoft Research study of MFA effectiveness</a> showed that the use of MFA reduced the risk of compromise by more than 99.2%! Some organizations have already deployed MFA and want to reuse that MFA solution with Entra ID. External authentication methods allows organizations to reuse any MFA solution to meet the MFA requirement with Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of you might be familiar with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/controls">custom controls</a>. External authentication methods are the replacement of <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/upcoming-changes-to-custom-controls/ba-p/1144696">custom controls</a>, and they provide several benefits over the custom controls approach. These include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 External authentication method integration, which uses industry standards and supports an open model&nbsp; 
 External authentication methods are managed the same way as Entra methods&nbsp; 
 External authentication methods are supported for a wide range of Entra ID use cases (including PIM activation) 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've invited Greg Kinasewitz, Product Manager for Microsoft Entra ID, to tell you more about this new capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and as always, let us know what you think!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nitika Gupta</p>
<p>Group Product Manager</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greg here. I’m super excited to walk you through some of the key capabilities of external authentication methods and readiness from partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve heard from some of you about wanting to use another MFA solution along with the power of Entra ID functionality like the rich features of Conditional Access, Identity Protection, and more.&nbsp; Customers using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) with a deployment of another MFA solution have been vocal in wanting this functionality so they can migrate from AD FS to Entra ID. Organizations that are using the Conditional Access custom controls preview have given feedback on needing a solution that enables more functionality. External authentication methods enable your users to authenticate with an external provider as part of satisfying MFA requirements in Entra ID to fill these needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are external authentication methods, and how do you use them? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>External authentication methods can be used to satisfy MFA requirements from Conditional Access Policies, Privileged Identity Management role activation, Identity Protection risk-based polices and Microsoft Intune device registration. They’re created and managed as part of the Entra ID authentication methods policy.&nbsp; This gives consistent manageability and experience with the built-in methods. You’ll add an external authentication method with the new “Add external method” button in the Entra Admin Center authentication methods management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: External authentication methods are added from and listed in authentication methods policies admin experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user is choosing a method to satisfy MFA, external authentication methods are listed alongside built-in methods that the user can use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: External authentication methods are shown next to the built-in methods during sign-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more, check out our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-external-method-manage">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What providers will support external authentication methods? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At launch, external authentication methods integrations will be available with the following identity providers. Please check with your identity provider to find out more about availability:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the providers that now have integrations in place, external authentication methods is a standards-based open model where any authentication provider that wants to build an integration can do so by following the <a href="https://aka.ms/EAM-Integration-Docs">integration documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re super excited for you to be able to start using external authentication methods to help secure your users, and we’re looking forward to your feedback!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about these integrations, please visit the Microsoft booth at the RSA Conference next week. There will also be an RSA Conference session hosted by Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA) where Duo will showcase their external authentication methods integration.</p>

  <p>We really, really want to eliminate passwords. There’s really <a href="https://aka.ms/yourpassword">nothing anyone can do</a> to make them better. As more users have adopted multifactor authentication (MFA), attackers have increased their use of Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) phishing and social engineering attacks, which trick people into revealing their credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we defeat these attacks while making safe sign-in even easier? Passkeys!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A passkey is a strong, phishing-resistant authentication method you can use to sign in to any internet resource that supports the W3C WebAuthN standard. Passkeys represent the continuing evolution of the FIDO2 standard, which should be familiar to anyone who’s followed or joined the passwordless movement. We already support signing into Entra ID using a passkey hosted on a hardware security key and today, we’re delighted to announce additional support for passkeys. Specifically, we’re adding support for device-bound passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS and Android for customers with the strictest security requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we describe the new capabilities we’re adding to Microsoft Authenticator, let’s review the basics of passkeys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passkeys neutralize phishing attempts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passkeys provide high security assurance by applying <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccertenroll/public-key-infrastructure">public-private key cryptography</a> and requiring direct interaction with the user. As I detailed in a <a href="https://aka.ms/allyourcreds">previous blog</a>, passkeys benefit from “Verifier Impersonation Resistance":&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 URL-specific. The provisioning process for passkeys records the relying party’s URL, so the passkey will only work for sites with that same URL.&nbsp; 
  Device-specific. The relying party will only grant access to the user if the passkey is synched, stored, or connected to the device from which they’re requesting access.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  User-specific. The user must prove they’re physically present during authentication, usually by performing a gesture on the device from which they’re requesting access.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, these characteristics make passkeys almost impossible to phish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 You can host passkeys on dedicated hardware security keys, phones, tablets, and laptops 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can host their passkeys on dedicated hardware security keys (such as FIDO2 security keys) or on user devices such as phones, tablets, or PCs. Windows 10/11, iOS 17, and Android 14 are examples of user device platforms that support passkeys. Each supports signing in with a passkey hosted directly on the user device itself or by connecting to a nearby user device or security key that hosts the passkey, such as a mobile device within Bluetooth range, an NFC-enabled security key, or a USB security key plugged into the user device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your organization issues dedicated hardware security keys, you sign-in by inserting your key into the USB port or tapping it to the NFC scanner and perform the PIN or biometric verification it requires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sign-in using a passkey on a user device, simply scan your face or fingerprint with your device or enter your device PIN. It’s also simple to sign-in to an application on a separate device, such as a new phone or a PC. Point the camera of the device hosting your passkey at the QR code displayed on the separate device and use your passkey along with your biometric or PIN to sign in. You may have already followed this process by using an Android or iPhone to sign into services such as Amazon.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passkeys may be device-bound or syncable 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the scenario, you may prefer a device-bound passkey or a syncable passkey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A device-bound passkey, as the name suggests, never leaves the device to which it’s issued. If you sign-in using a security key or Windows Hello, you’re using a device-bound passkey. By definition, you can’t back up or restore a device-bound passkey because during these operations the passkey would leave the hardware element. This restriction is important for organizations that must, sometimes by law, protect passkeys from any security vulnerabilities that could arise during synchronization and recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While they offer strong security, dedicated hardware keys can be expensive to issue and manage. If you lose, replace, or destroy the dedicated device, you must provision a brand-new passkey on a new device. And since device-bound passkeys aren’t portable or recoverable, they increase friction for people trying to move away from passwords. To simplify the experience for users who don’t operate in highly regulated environments, the industry introduced support for syncable passkeys. You can back up and recover a syncable passkey, which makes it possible to share the same passkey between devices or to restore it if you lose or upgrade your device—there’s no need to provision a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Syncable passkeys on user client devices are easy to use, easy to manage, and offer high security 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Syncable passkeys on user devices are exciting because they address many of the toughest usability and recoverability challenges that have confronted organizations trying to move to passwordless, phishing-resistant authentication. Hosting the passkey on the user’s device means organizations don’t have to issue or manage a separate device, and syncing it among the user’s client devices and the cloud massively reduces the expense of recovering and reissuing device-bound keys. And on top of all this, replacing passwords with passkeys thwarts more than 99% of identity attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect this combination of benefits will make syncable passkeys the best option for the vast majority of users and organizations. Android and iOS devices can host syncable passkeys today, and we’re working to add support in Windows by this fall. Our roadmap for 2024 includes support for both device-bound and syncable passkeys in Microsoft Entra ID and <a href="https://aka.ms/VasuJoyWPD2024">Microsoft consumer accounts</a>. Stay tuned for further announcements later this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Device-bound passkeys in Microsoft Authenticator 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry or governmental regulation, or other highly strict security policies, require that some enterprises and government agencies use device-bound passkeys for signing in to Microsoft Entra. This small fraction of organizations has strict requirements governing the recovery of lost credentials and for preventing employees from sharing credentials with anyone else. Nonetheless, these organizations also want the usability, manageability, and deployment benefits of storing passkeys on user-client devices such as mobile phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Advantages of hosting passkeys on a user device:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Organizations don’t have to provision dedicated hardware.&nbsp; 
  Users are less likely to lose track of their daily computing device.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  It’s easy to sign in with a passkey hosted on a user device. 
 




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that device-bound keys are a must-have for many of our largest, most regulated and most security conscious customers. That’s why we’ve been collaborating with these customers, along with the broader FIDO community, to provide additional options. As part of this work, we’re adding support for device-bound passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS and Android. Instead of provisioning separate devices, high-security organizations can now configure Entra ID to let employees sign-in using their existing phone and their device-bound passkey. Users get a familiar phone interface, including biometrics or local lockscreen PIN or password, while their organizations meet strict security requirements because users can’t sync, share, or recover any device-bound passkey hosted in Microsoft Authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations that use device-bound passkeys trade the benefit of large investments that vendors such as Google (<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/10/SecurityofPasskeysintheGooglePasswordManager.html">see related article</a>) and Apple (<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-icloud-keychain-recovery-secdeb202947/web">see related article</a>) have made in creating high-security, self-service passkey recovery models for the benefit of meeting strict regulatory or security requirements. They become responsible for sharing and recovering device-bound passkeys, including those hosted in Microsoft Authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For detailed guidance on how to get started with device-bound passkeys hosted in Microsoft Authenticator, please refer to our <a href="https://aka.ms/PasskeyInAuthenticator">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft’s commitment to passwordless authentication 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is continuing to enhance our support for passkey in products such as Entra, Windows, and Microsoft accounts. Please continue to send us feedback, so we can help you eliminate passwords from your environment forever.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Joerg Resch</a></p><p>As eIDAS2 prepares to go live, its implications extend far beyond the borders of the European Union, setting a new global standard for digital identity management. Organizations worldwide need to understand and prepare for these changes, ensuring they can operate effectively in a new era of digital identity. The 2024 European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) provides a unique opportunity to gain insights, share knowledge, and prepare for the future of digital identity, where security, privacy, and user control are at the forefront of digital transactions.</p>
<p>In a digital era characterized by an increasing reliance on online services and transactions, the security and reliability of digital identities has never been more critical. The European Union has taken a groundbreaking step with the publication of EU Regulation 2024/1183, officially known as eIDAS2. This new regulation, set to come into force on May 20, 2024, not only strengthens the framework for digital identities within the EU but also sets a global precedent for how digital identity services can be managed and utilized. Its implementation, which coincides with EIC 2024, could reshape organizational strategies worldwide.</p>
 What is eIDAS2? 
<p>eIDAS2 builds on the original electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) regulation aimed at enhancing trust in electronic transactions across the EU. The revision introduces several pivotal elements, most notably the European Digital Identity Wallets (EDIW). These wallets serve as secure digital tools that allow EU citizens and businesses to store, manage, and utilize personal identification data and electronic attestations of attributes seamlessly across borders. This framework ensures that every natural and legal person in the EU can access public and private services online without sacrificing control over their personal data.</p>
 The Significance of eIDAS2 for Organizations Globally 
<p>eIDAS2 is not just a regulatory framework for Europe; it is a beacon for global digital identity management. Organizations around the world should pay attention to these developments for several reasons:</p>
 
 Standard Setting in Digital Identity: eIDAS2 sets a high standard for privacy, security, and interoperability that could become a global benchmark. Non-EU organizations dealing with European partners will need to understand these standards to ensure compliance and smooth interactions. 
 Enhanced Security and Trust: With the introduction of <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/compliance/conformity-assessment/index_en.htm#:~:text=Conformity%20assessment%20organisations%20These%20notified%20bodies%20are%20organisations,NANDO%20website%20%28New%20Approach%20Notified%20and%20Designated%20Organisations%29.">conformity assessment bodies</a> and certification mechanisms, eIDAS2 ensures that digital identity tools and services are reliable and secure. This level of trustworthiness is something organizations worldwide might emulate to enhance their digital identity solutions. 
 Innovation in Identity Management: The EDIW promotes innovation in how identities and attributes are managed and utilized. Organizations can use this model to develop similar solutions, improving customer experiences and operational efficiencies. 
 
 Implications for Accessing Services 
<p>A key component of eIDAS2 is its inclusivity. The regulation mandates that the use of the EDIW is voluntary and that services cannot discriminate against those who choose not to use digital wallets. This principle may influence global service delivery models, emphasizing the need for flexibility in how services and identities are managed digitally.</p>
 Relevance to the Global Digital Economy 
<p>The digital economy is inherently borderless, where services and goods traverse national boundaries in milliseconds. The eIDAS2 framework facilitates this movement in the EU, potentially creating a ripple effect worldwide as other regions seek to ensure their digital identity systems are interoperable with Europe's. This alignment could lead to smoother transactions, enhanced security, and a more connected global digital economy.</p>
 European Digital Identity Wallets: A Closer Look 
<p>EDIWs are at the heart of eIDAS2. They allow users to control their identity data fully, choosing when and how much information to share when accessing services. This user-centric approach not only enhances privacy but also empowers individuals, fostering a more trustful digital environment. For organizations, understanding how these wallets work and integrating compatible systems will be crucial.</p>
 OpenID4VC: Enhancing the European Digital Identity Wallet 
<p>One of the core elements of the EDIW is OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC), a protocol that stands to revolutionize the way verifiable credentials are exchanged and managed within the eIDAS2 framework. OpenID4VC facilitates the secure and seamless exchange of credentials between issuers, holders, and verifiers, making it a pivotal component in the implementation of the EDIW.</p>
<p>This protocol not only simplifies the process of verifying credentials in real time but also ensures that all transactions adhere to the highest standards of security and privacy mandated by eIDAS2. By integrating OpenID4VC, the EDIW allows users to assert personal data or attributes stored in their wallets without revealing any more information than necessary. This capability is crucial for maintaining user privacy and control over personal information. For organizations globally, understanding and implementing OpenID4VC will be essential to interact efficiently with European entities under the new regulations. The protocol's adoption could also set a precedent for similar initiatives worldwide, promoting a more interconnected and interoperable digital identity landscape. The integration of OpenID4VC into the EDIW exemplifies the EU’s commitment to pioneering advanced, user-centric digital identity solutions that could influence future developments in global digital identity frameworks.</p>
 eIDAS 2 is the Key Topic at EIC 
<p>The fact that EIC, Europe's leading conference on Digital ID coincides with the enforcement of eIDAS2 is serendipitous for all stakeholders. This convergence will provide a platform for immediate feedback, discussions, and strategy development among policymakers, industry leaders, and technology developers. For attendees, it offers a firsthand look at the regulation's rollout and immediate implications, making it an essential event for anyone involved in digital identity, cybersecurity, or European market operations.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>It might be just my pet peeve, but I never really liked the term “Firewall”. Of course, the history of IT is full of words that have completely changed their meaning over the decades yet still occasionally cause discussions among experts. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/antivirus-is-dead-so-what">Is antivirus dead</a>, for example, considering that they stopped making real viruses years ago?</p>
<p>Firewall, however, stands out even more. The original brick-and-mortar one had one purpose only: to limit the spread of fire between buildings. A real firewall does not have any holes, and surely, it cannot apply any logic to different kinds of fire… A network firewall, however, could. That was its primary purpose – to filter network traffic based on defined rules, letting “good” traffic in, and keeping malicious stuff out. Over the following decades, the concept has evolved significantly, with next-generation firewalls adding capabilities like deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, and even identity management.</p>
<p>Multiple ranges of specialized products have emerged, like Web Application Firewalls specializing on protecting web apps and APIs or even Database Firewalls designed to prevent SQL-specific attacks on relational databases. A modern firewall is thus a sophisticated solution that combines multiple layers of security, often powered by behavior analytics and artificial intelligence – a far cry from the original rules-based one. Is it even fair to continue referring to them as brick walls?</p>
<p>I can see you asking me already: why have I even brought this pet peeve of mine up? Well, recently I was looking at a new security tool — <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/sql-firewall-now-built-into-oracle-database-23c">Oracle SQL Firewall</a> — which the company has built into its upcoming Oracle Database 23ai release. And while I wholeheartedly agree with the product’s vision, surely, calling it just a firewall is a bit odd.</p>
<p>You see, all past and current firewalls (even Oracle’s own specialized Database Firewall) are operating on the network level, forming a perimeter around a resource that requires protection and filtering traffic between it and its clients. The problem is that in the modern hyperconnected world, there are so many potential network paths between sensitive data and potentially malicious actors that protecting them all appears to be impossible.</p>
<p>This is why the concept of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-centric-security">data-centric security</a> has emerged years ago, focusing on protecting data itself throughout its entire lifecycle instead of constantly plugging holes in existing networks, servers, and applications. Oracle Database’s “killer feature” has always been the ability to keep all kinds of information (relational, document- and graph-based, spatial, and even vector) in one place and run complex workloads like AI training directly within the database. Integrating an additional security layer to prevent SQL-level attacks directly into the DB core is therefore a major step towards data-centric security.</p>
<p>The new Oracle Database 23ai adds multiple new capabilities that can also create new attack vectors. For example, using Select AI to generate SQL queries from natural language prompts is a great tool for data analysts and business application developers. But to enable it, a database must communicate with an external large language model, and conventional firewalls simply cannot protect it from potential abuse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: High-level overview of SQL Firewall’s architecture</p>
<p>Oracle SQL Firewall, on the other hand, operates directly in the database core, making sure that it cannot be bypassed, regardless of the SQL execution path – whether coming from an external client, a local privileged user, or a generative AI solution. Residing directly in the database also provides it with the necessary insight into all the activities happening there.</p>
<p>Over time, it learns how various clients work with the data, establishing their behavior profiles and creating policies based on actions that are allowed for specific data. These allow-lists explicitly define what SQL statements a specific database user is supposed to perform. Everything else – suspicious anomalies, zero-day attacks, and, of course, SQL injection attacks – is blocked. However, it is possible to run SQL Firewall in a permissive mode as well, just generating audit records and alerts.</p>
<p>This protection is not only ubiquitous and impossible to bypass, but also completely transparent to any client applications, local or remote. There is no need to change existing network settings, introduce a proxy service or give a third-party vendor access to your sensitive data for monitoring. As an added benefit, SQL Firewall incorporates mandatory identity checks through session context, making credential theft or abuse much more difficult.</p>
<p>Of course, Oracle already had several security tools with similar coverage for years, including Audit Vault and Database Firewall – and they are even more capable in a way, providing coverage for non-Oracle databases as well. However, SQL Firewall is a core function of the new 23ai release, not an additional product. It is currently available in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition and requires either Oracle Database Vault or Oracle Audit Vault and Database Firewall.</p>
<p>Its configuration can be managed in several ways: either using the Oracle Cloud’s UI (exposed through <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/database-security/data-safe/">Oracle Data Safe</a>) or by utilizing command line tools or APIs. Needless to say, it is available at no extra cost and has negligible performance overhead. This way, it not only implements data-centric security, but also helps enforce the “security by design” principle and facilitates the adoption of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Zero Trust architectures</a>.</p>
<p>So, is SQL Firewall supposed to replace all the other data security tools? Not at all, its goal is to add another layer of protection into an existing defense-in-depth stack. Often, it will, in fact, be the last line of defense, positioned directly in front of your sensitive data. Should it be called a firewall? Again, while I, personally, don’t like the term, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet… As KuppingerCole Analysts always stress – you should not look at the labels and always check the actual capabilities offered by a product.</p>
<p>With Oracle’s new solution, you can address two major problems at the same time: protecting databases from SQL-based attacks and implementing 100% audit coverage of database activities. Not bad for a firewall, I think…</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 16th April to 30th April&nbsp;2024 <p>Welcome to our latest edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we will break down recent developments in cryptocurrency regulations across Europe and the&nbsp;UK.</p> Europe Strengthens Crypto Oversight with New Regulations <p>The European Parliament recently passed a new set of rules aimed at making cryptocurrency transactions safer and more transparent.</p><p>These rules are part of the Anti-Money Laundering Regulations (AMLR) and mainly affect companies that handle crypto transactions, such as exchanges.</p><p>Under these new regulations, companies must now do more thorough checks on their customers and monitor any suspicious activities. They’ll report these to a new regulatory body called the Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLA).</p><p>According to the authorities, this step will prevent crimes such as money laundering and terrorism financing through crypto transactions.</p><p>Central to these regulations is the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)</a> framework, which will be fully enforced by the end of this&nbsp;year.</p> UK Plans New Framework for Crypto and Stablecoins <p>Over in the UK, the government is working on new guidelines for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, expected to be introduced by July. Their reported aim is to foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection.</p><p>Bim Afolami, the economic secretary to the Treasury, highlighted this at the Innovate Finance Global Summit 2024, stressing the importance of the UK staying competitive in financial technology. The upcoming regulations will cover various aspects of crypto operations, including trading and managing digital&nbsp;assets.</p><blockquote>“Once it goes live, a whole host of crypto asset activities, including operating in exchange, taking custody of customer assets and other things, will come within the regulator perimeter for the first&nbsp;time.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Bim Afolami, economic secretary to the&nbsp;Treasury</blockquote><p>This move comes as part of a <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-regulations-in-the-united-kingdom-a-comprehensive-analysis">broader effort to modernize the UK’s financial system</a>.

  <p>I'm thrilled to announce that Microsoft Entra External ID, our next-generation, developer-friendly customer identity access management (CIAM) solution will be generally available starting May 15th. Whether you're building applications for partners, business customers or consumers, External ID makes secure and customizable CIAM simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra External ID&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure and customize external identities’ access to applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra External ID enables you to: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure all identities with a single solution&nbsp; 
 Streamline secure collaboration&nbsp; 
 Create frictionless end user experiences&nbsp; 
 Accelerate the development of secure applications&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Secure all identities with a single solution &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing external identities, including customers, partners, business customers, and their access policies can be complex and costly for admins, especially when managing multiple applications with a growing number of users and evolving security requirements. With External ID, you can consolidate all identity management under the security and reliability of Microsoft Entra. Microsoft Entra provides a unified and consistent experience for managing all identity types, simplifying identity management while reducing costs and complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building External ID on the same stack as Entra ID allows us to innovate quickly and enables admins to extend the Microsoft Entra capabilities they use to external identities, including our industry-leading adaptive access policies, fraud protection, verifiable credentials, and built-in identity governance. Our launch customers have chosen External ID as their CIAM solution as it allows them to manage all identity types from a single platform:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Komatsu will be using Entra External ID for all external-facing applications. This will help us deliver a great experience to our customers and ensure we're a trusted partner that is easy to do business with." </p>
<p>- Michael McClanahan, Vice President, Transformation and CIO&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry-leading identity security provides end-to-end access to applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Streamline secure collaboration &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boundaries between consumers and business customers are blurring, as are the boundaries between partners and employees. Collaborating with external users like business customers and partners can be challenging; they need access to the right internal resources to do their work, but that access must be removed when it's no longer needed to reduce security risks and safeguard internal data. In this changing world, even trusted collaboration needs least-privilege safeguards, strong governance, and pervasive branding. With <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/manage-guest-access-with-access-reviews">ID Governance for External ID</a>, the same lifecycle management and access management capabilities for employees can be leveraged for business guests as well. Guest governance capabilities complement <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b">External ID B2B collaboration</a> that’s already widely used by Entra customers worldwide to&nbsp; make collaboration secure and seamless.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you may want to collaborate with an external marketing agency on a new campaign. With B2B collaboration, you can invite the agency staff to join your tenant as guests and assign them access to the relevant resources, such as a Teams channel for communication, a SharePoint site for project management, and a OneDrive folder for file sharing.&nbsp; <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview">Cross-tenant access settings</a> allow you to have granular controls over which users from specific external organizations get access to your resources, as well as control which external organizations your users access.&nbsp; <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-business-guests/ba-p/3575579">ID Governance for External ID</a> will automatically review and revoke their access after a period of inactivity or when the project is completed. This way, you can seamlessly collaborate while ensuring only authorized external users have access to internal resources and data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control what resources external collaborators can access with cross-tenant access settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Create frictionless end user experiences&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personalized and flexible user experiences are critical to drive customer adoption and retention. External ID lets you reduce end-user friction at sign in by natively integrating secure authentication experiences into your web and mobile apps. You can leverage a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/identity-providers">variety of authentication</a> options, such as social identities like Google, Facebook, local or federated accounts, and even verifiable credentials to make it easy for your end users to sign-up/sign-in. External ID enables you to immerse end-users in your brand and create engaging user-centric experiences with progressive profiling, increasing end-user satisfaction and driving brand love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design secure, intuitive, and frictionless sign-up and sign-in user journeys that immerse external identities in your brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>External ID allows you to further personalize and optimize end-user experiences by collecting and analyzing end-user data, improving their user journey while complying with privacy regulations. Our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-user-insights">user insight dashboards</a> help monitor user activities and sign-up/sign-in trends, so that you can assess and improve your end-user experience strategy with data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Accelerate the development of secure applications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity is a foundational building block of any modern application, but many developers may have little experience integrating identity and security into their apps. External ID turns your developers into identity pros by making it easy to integrate identity into web and mobile applications with a few clicks. Developers can get started creating their first application in minutes either directly from the Microsoft Entra portal or within their developer tools such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/visual-studio-code-extension">Visual Studio Code.</a> We recently announced that our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/concept-native-authentication">Native Authentication</a> now supports Android and iOS, allowing developers to build pixel-perfect sign-up and sign-in journeys into mobile apps using either our API or the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL):&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A mobile app sign in journey could have taken us months to design and build, but with Microsoft Entra External ID Native Auth, it took the team just one week to build a functionally comparable and even more secure solution.” </p>
<p>– Gary McLellan, Head of Engineering Frameworks and Core Mobile Apps, Virgin Money&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Developer Center is a great starting point for developer to find quick start guides, demos, blogs and more showcasing how to build secure user flows into apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backed by the reliability and resilience of Microsoft Entra, developers can launch from a globally distributed architecture designed to accommodate the needs of growing user bases; ensuring their external-facing apps can handle millions of users during peak periods, without disrupting end-user experiences or compromising security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Customer loyalty is won – and lost – at login. <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/misc/3743-2023-consumer-survey-brand-loyalty-digital-economy.html">60% of customers admit to abandoning an account forever when they have trouble signing in</a>. Convenience and ease of use are key, and as customer expectations become ever more exacting, organizations looking to retain customers and grow loyalty need to prioritize removing unnecessary barriers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the point of login can be such a cause for session and cart abandonment, many websites offer a convenient "Keep Me Signed In" or "Stay Signed In" checkbox on their sign-in screen, allowing consumers to keep their sessions active longer. This functionality can significantly improve customer experience and boost revenue, and has become a familiar feature across numerous applications and online platforms. However, longer-lasting sessions bring with them an elevated risk of session hijacking, which can lead to companies shouldering higher fraud resolution costs, or possibly hesitating to implement “Keep Me Signed In” at all, to the detriment of customer experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge, therefore, lies in finding a way to properly secure long-lived sessions to satisfy customers while protecting your business. Whether your organization has already implemented “Keep Me Signed In” or you’re still considering whether it may be a good fit for your business, read on for an overview of the benefits of this customer-pleasing functionality and the role of advanced <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/capabilities/threat-protection.html">threat protection</a> in decreasing the risk of session compromise.</p>

<p>Editor’s note: Thanks to Software Engineer, Kevin Chiang, for this week’s post.</p>
<p>Any time you sign up for a service, you start receiving emails from them; it’s basically a law. If your inbox looks like mine, it’s bombarded with marketing emails, weekly digests, or notifications like “You’re nearing your spending limit in GCP” (some of these might be more important than others). Email works well as the first place to send notifications since people usually sign up with their email. But with everything going to your inbox nowadays, it’s easy to miss that onboarding reminder for Sarah, who starts next Monday and still needs her Github and Zoom accounts provisioned.</p>
<p>So what is the solution? These days, every workplace has an all-instant messaging/chat service. That’s usually where people are most responsive. So why not receive your notifications there as well?</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to YeshBot – our Slack notification service.</p>
<p>Combined with the rest of the YeshID platform, it removes the need for you to go through your checklist and manually slack/nag task owners to finish their work. But instead, with a click of a button, all folks who are involved with onboarding or offboarding are notified of the work that needs to get done!</p>
 Connect YeshBot to your account 
<p>Connecting the bot is easy! Simply log in to your YeshID admin account and find the “Add to Slack” button under Settings &gt; YeshID Slack Bot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the button to complete the OAuth flow and you are ready to go.&nbsp; For details on how to do this see our <a href="https://yeshid.notion.site/How-To-Use-the-YeshID-Slack-Integration-2be3726bb82c422fb3fd0dac3b8c862f">docs</a>.</p>
<p>Once the bot has connected successfully you’ll get a notification&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, the YeshBot is set up to send messages for the YeshList feature that we wrote about in a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/yeshlist/">previous post</a>. So when you onboard a user through YeshID, for example, you will receive a notification:</p>
<p></p>
<p>YeshBot will send two types of notifications:</p>
 
 General notifications (onboarding/offboarding tasklist created or automated tasks failed) 
 Reminders to specific users when they have tasks to do. 
 
<p>General notifications are sent to all YeshID admins. You might want to have other team members stay in the loop for certain playbooks–for example (e.g. IT, HR, Finance for onboarding and offboarding). You can configure YeshID to send certain notifications to other channels.</p>
<p>How? Read on.</p>
 Set up notification channels in YeshID (optional) 
<p>To set up notifications to a channel, we need to add the YeshBot to the channel and then configure it in YeshID</p>
 
 Type in @YeshID in your desired notification channels.<br>
 
 Click “Add to Channel”<br>
<br>
 
 Set your notification channel in YeshID<br>
<br>
 
 
<p>YeshBot is now set up to send to your channel</p>
<p>A few tidbits to keep in mind when configuring the notification channels:</p>
 
 YeshBot may be added to any slack channel, but will not send any notifications unless configured to do so in the YeshID console.&nbsp; 
 YeshBot will broadcast the same notifications to every configured channel 
 Onboarding/offboarding information can be sensitive, so YeshBot can also be added to private channels to limit who sees the messages (Note: any user assigned a task will still be notified directly). 
 
 Deleting the integration 
<p>Under the same section (Settings &gt; YeshID Slack Bot), clicking on disconnect will remove the Bot from your Slack environment.</p>
<p></p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Integrating YeshBot with your Slack workspace lets you ditch the email overload and streamline your onboarding and offboarding processes. YeshBot delivers crucial notifications directly to your team, ensuring everyone stays informed, and tasks get completed on time.</p>

<p>In September of 2023, a Moody’s report aired concerns about Aadhaar, the pioneering government digital ID service used by over one billion Indian citizens. Though it has mitigated fraud and helped countless Indians access services more easily, Moody’s argued Aadhaar posed major privacy and security risks, in large part thanks to its centralization.</p><p>India rebutted the concerns, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/most-trusted-digital-id-in-the-world-india-refutes-moodys-concerns-about-aadhaar/articleshow/103940681.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst">stating in part</a> that “to date no breach has been reported from Aadhaar database.”</p><p>Just months later, Aadhaar suffered an immense data theft.</p><p>The extremely sensitive personal data of nearly 800 million Indians appeared <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/11/the-worlds-largest-biometric-digital-id-program-indias-aadhaar-just-suffered-its-biggest-ever-data-leak.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">for sale on black-market forums for a mere $80,000</a>. This included not only their Aadhaar numbers, but their addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and more – and despite the government’s protestations, known thefts of Aadhaar data go all the way back to 2012. This doesn’t just expose Indians to payments, benefits, and banking fraud; it is also a vector for <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/153421/data-breach/aadhaar-data-leaks-india.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">national security risk</a>. Some might even argue these harms outweigh the benefits of the system.</p><p>Other pioneering digital ID systems worldwide, including China’s RealDID, verification providers relying on data brokers, and digital services that aggregate user data, have also shown centralization risks. These include not just lax cybersecurity but misuse by controlling authorities themselves. The trend of transitioning to digitally native identification systems is clear. Still, the next generation of these systems must learn from the flaws and failures of pioneers – above all, by shifting away from centralized models that turn governments or corporations into ripe targets for criminals.</p> The Curse of the Innovator <p>Aadhaar was a hugely forward-thinking project when it launched in 2010, and it’s now the largest digital ID system in the world. There is no doubt that it provides immense utility to its user base of over a billion enrolled Indians. However, early projects in any realm can fall victim to the so-called “curse of the innovator” by failing to adopt new ideas following their creation. Several specific innovations, if they’re adopted by future digital ID projects, could help prevent breaches like the 2023 Aadhaar attack and other kinds of centralization risks.</p> Decentralization <p>As Moody’s pointed out, Aadhaar’s biggest flaw may be its centralization, with data and authorizations controlled by the Unique Identity Authority of India, or UIDAI. Centralization of digital identity credentials creates three related problems.</p><p>First, Aadhaar has a single point of failure – there have been many cases of benefits denial because the UIDAI couldn’t confirm a user’s identity. Second, centralization makes systems vulnerable to exploitation because all confirmations come from the same authority. For instance, Indian gangs have learned how to exploit the Aadhaar system to <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/uidai-says-its-system-detected-attempts-by-kanpur-gang-to-generate-fake-aadhaar-cards-4036627.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">generate fake identities</a> – and UIDAI has refused to disclose how many fake identities may be in the wild.</p><p>Third and most concerning, the centralization of Aadhaar’s identity data makes it an irresistible honeypot for cybercriminals. Particularly scary is that biometric data, including thousands of fingerprints, has been <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/watch-out-aadhar-biometrics-are-an-easy-target-for-hackers/articleshow/61183055.cms?ref=blog.spruceid.com">repeatedly stolen</a> and for use in fraud schemes. This data would allow an attacker to create targeted biometric spoofing attacks, which could defeat both remote and physical identity verification systems. The theft of biometric data is particularly damaging because it is essentially irreversible – unlike a password, you can’t “reset” your fingerprints.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, we have seen significant progress on models that prevent single points of failure or mass, single-target data theft. In these architectures, data can be distributed to the edges instead of accumulating in a central government database. Under this type of distributed scheme, far less data is stored by any one authority, with identity instead affirmed by various authorities, such as schools, utility companies, and government agencies. This approach is far more aligned with “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">zero-trust</a>” approaches to security, and as a result, there’s no “one-stop shop” where hackers can steal or fabricate credentials.</p> Zero-Knowledge Attestation <p>According to <a href="https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/pii-belonging-to-indian-citizens-including-their-aadhaar-ids-offered-for-sale-on-the-dark-web?ref=blog.spruceid.com">analysis by the firm Resecurity</a>, Aadhaar leaks have been caused in part by security breaches at third parties, such as utilities, which had downloaded sensitive data from Aadhaar servers and stored them. Until <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">software supply chains</a> are secured-by-default, these common utilities are likely to suffer ongoing compromises, as seen in the recent high-impact “<a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/04/02/a-stealth-attack-came-close-to-compromising-the-worlds-computers?ref=blog.spruceid.com">xz Utils</a>” and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/moveit-mass-hack-by-the-numbers?ref=blog.spruceid.com">MOVEit</a> exploits. Innovations in cryptography, including a technique known as “zero-knowledge proofs,” now make it possible to affirm certain data without revealing it to the requester, thereby reducing (or even eliminating) the need for data transfers and the use of intermediate tools that can mishandle sensitive data.</p><p>For instance, a third party could confirm the match of a person’s biometric data without actually accessing a raw fingerprint or iris scan. Worldcoin, the Sam Altman-founded global ID startup, uses cryptographic “hashes” of users’ iris scans, rather than the raw data, to establish unique identity. This should prevent the theft of iris data – though this particular technique must be combined with several additional components and precautions to become a complete system that can combat disincentives and misuse.</p> Robust Data Siloing <p>Third parties that store sensitive data also often add more data of their own, violating the principle of “data siloing.” For instance, the 2023 Aadhaar hack included full packages combining ID numbers with biometrics, passport numbers, addresses, and phone numbers.</p><p>This unfolded largely because over time, Aadhaar identity numbers became required for more and more services. As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/08/09/aadhaar/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">one critic wrote back in 2018</a>, “This turns Aadhaar into a dangerous bridge between these previously isolated silos. With each new data silo that gets linked, an important protection against 360-degree profiling gets weakened, leaving Indians vulnerable to data mining and identity theft.”</p><p>In addition to cryptographic methods that prevent third parties from reading raw identity data, the use of hardware security components can keep identity data from circulating while keeping attestations trustworthy.</p> Distributed Authority <p>One of the most disturbing uses of a digital identity system was reported by the New York Times, which covered a Chinese authority’s use of COVID-19 health codes to control the movement of citizens <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/business/china-code-protesters.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">protesting the freezing of their bank accounts</a>. While details remain unclear, it appears that authorities may have matched the identities of the owners of frozen accounts to their health registration accounts, allowing them to flag potential protestors as COVID risks.</p><p>This represents a kind of security breach where a system is used to accomplish unrelated (and potentially illegitimate) goals. As Chinese critics pointed out, this isn’t simply a one-time abuse, but undermines long-term faith and public trust in the identity system. Broadly, this is more evidence in favor of decentralized identity systems – not only separating data across authorities, but separating command and control functions from data entirely. With carefully designed digital identity architecture, “should not be abused” can become “cannot be abused.”</p><p>Instead of having one central IT department control all of a society’s digital identity and credentials, it is possible to build decentralized architectures that allow multiple authorities with additional checks and balances, transparency requirements, and improved individual control. This clear separation of powers can ensure that powerful financial, healthcare, and security systems cannot collude against an individual.</p> Distributed Identity For a Safer, Freer Digital Future <p>The mixed track record of digital identity services so far demonstrates how important it is to design them from the ground up with the right priorities: privacy, security, and individual control. These overriding goals have become more obvious thanks to the experimentation of early adopters, and technological solutions for achieving them have also emerged over time.</p><p>With identity systems, it’s not enough to say that systems won’t be compromised, relying on the expertise or ethics of human authorities. Instead, the systems must be built from the ground up with many layers of protection so they can’t be compromised. While there are still details to fill in, ID systems that are architected to use distributed data storage, advanced cryptography, and information minimization are the way to reach that goal. While these services have their flaws, they also have immense potential to provide public utility and fight fraud.</p><p>We must learn from programs that have paved the way, such as Aadhar, and ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of digital identity without compromising security or individual freedoms such as free speech, privacy, and user choice.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hello everybody, this is Michael Cichon. I’m the Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos, here with Vikram Subramaniam, our VP of Solutions, to talk about deepfakes. Vik, it’s great to have you, and welcome to the vlog. Deepfakes are in the news lately. Frightening news. One case recently, they were used to con a company out of $25 million, several payments totaling 25 million in Asia Pacific. Closer to home, we’ve heard stories of deepfakes, dialing the phone, calling people, folks answer the phone, and their friends, family, loved ones appear to be in distress and asking to be rescued. Some are claiming to have kidnapped people and asking for ransom. Quite devastating for anybody to receive these types of things. So this phenomenon of deepfakes, how did we get here? What are they?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, imagine that, Mission Impossible is becoming real. We are experiencing it in our everyday lives. I’ve only seen it in the movies, where you’ve got large command centers, where they’re taking small voice clips of different things and then, playing and tricking the bad guys into thinking that it’s one of their own. Regular people are facing it. And essentially, with AI and just freely available software these days, that takes advantage of the chips that we have in our computers and even generally available cloud and internet, you can produce video, you can produce voice, you can produce anything that looks or feels real to the person on the other side of a virtual line. So I’m thinking of form line, I’m thinking of a laptop, but yeah, this is where sometimes I just need to shake your hand to know if you are real, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Do you know I’m real right now? Is this not a deepfake? Is this somebody pretending to be me?</p>
<p>Exactly. Exactly right. I think so that’s where the world is going to, but these are essentially deepfakes, the same things that we have seen in the movies. So people wearing masks, you creating videos of or morphing someone’s face on top. And then, yeah, it just sounding like someone else. It’s crazy what’s out there with deepfakes.</p>
<p>Yeah, the evolution has been stunning. We’ve talked generally about artificial intelligence, but over the last 20 years, we’ve seen this evolution of artificial intelligence being the ability to recognize patterns very deeply in data somehow to get into a predictive science and now, to even approach what looks like thinking, when computers can draw inferences without being told to do so. The deepfake, the lineage, how we got here, essentially, what we have is two chess players, if you will, two adversarial networks creating a likeness and presenting it to another adversarial engine to be graded for similarity to a sample. And then, for this, basically, this iteration of synthetic media, at the speed of light, whether that’s a voice, whether that’s a video, even texting patterns, the way that somebody might text a friend or chat with somebody, that can also be deepfaked. Training, well, first, before I get into training deepfake attack, this technology now, five years ago, you had to be one of the world’s leading data scientists.</p>
<p>Yeah, data scientists, researcher, videographer, one of those special effects companies, right? Yeah.</p>
<p>Right. Now, I just did a simple Google Search the other day using ChatGTP, and this thing brings me a half a dozen tools that I can, within probably an hour, create a deepfake video. Deepfakes trained on humans are one issue. We saw that with the $25 million that was taking. And certainly to the human eye, these deepfakes are very hard to detect. So in terms of humans, of humans, we’ve got to train people. We start to move millions of dollars around. We have to have policies, procedures, and oversight to prevent fraud at that scale. But I think, more on the sinister side, over the past, what, six, seven years, the authentication using live biometrics has set in. This is a step up from what we used to do. A thumb print or a face ID on a phone, we’re now logging in with essentially a live selfie, and that’s a step up in security.</p>
<p>But talk a little bit, if you will, about the way that deepfakes can be used to attack biometric authentication. Because before you start that, companies move into biometric authentication to get rid of passwords, and a live selfie had been pretty hard to fake. A live selfie can also be verified against a driver’s license. So you could have that direct connection of the live selfie to an offline credential and prove identity, but now, deepfakes are attacking. So can you talk a little bit about how deepfakes are being trained on authentication in cyber attacks?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. Right. So you mentioned it correctly, right? So we want convenience. We want to look at something, and then, it needs to open. So we have that happening on our phones. We have that happening at the immigration gates, and now, we obviously want it with our enterprise systems. So until now, obviously, hey, if you needed to fool something, if you needed to fool a face detection software, you would come and present a picture. You would come and present a video of the person that you wanted to impersonate. And in the early days, of course, you couldn’t find it. But I think technology has improved over multiple decades that technology now can prevent presentation attacks, where you’re actually presenting something to the camera, where you’re capturing like a picture, and if it’s a picture of a picture, from a screen, from a video, all of those things, you know that it’s not a live person. And it’s only then that the face is getting to match.</p>
<p>So the presentation attacks, yes, are evolving a little bit, but you know what? For the most part, I think a lot of companies and our solution basically can help prevent those presentation attacks. But because more and more companies are moving towards facial recognition and people are remote, now, impersonation has become big. And like you mentioned, there’s technology available out there to create videos and create stuff about things or videos or pictures that look like you, and from just freely available content. You’ve got public content. This vlog is going to be public. People can take small snippets from you, take your voice, take your face and create a short video and very likely try and fool the system. The problem there is, till now, you have to have another device to show it to the camera, and the moment you did that, the camera and generally having the picture and different objects out there, people could detect that it’s not a live person and it’s something that someone’s trying to attack.</p>
<p>But with deepfakes, the thing is that they are utilizing what we call as injection attacks. Injection is basically fooling the entire piece of software, because there is dependency on capturing a picture from the camera. And there is trust that pictures are coming from the camera, and we can depend on all of the things of the features of the camera to capture the picture, that trust is gone. So injection attacks are coming directly into the stream of the video, that comes in from the camera and goes out to the server. So it could very well be, we’ve got different kinds of attacks.</p>
<p>We’ve got JavaScript attacks, we’ve got the multiple cams or the substitute cams attacks, anything that really can inject itself into the stream, with the advent of technology, different scripts of being available, different pieces of technology, like mini cams. So they allow you to have multiple cameras and then, inject a video out there. And the software is no smarter and thinks that it is actually a person doing it. So now, that’s where deepfakes are there, but obviously, there is a way to prevent them. But Michael, I know you’ve been doing some research on deepfakes. Are there other things that you have noticed that people are doing out there?</p>
<p>Okay, well, let’s talk about this a little bit. You talk about presentation attacks. What are the defenses against presentation attacks?</p>
<p>Sure. So this is why, when we are doing a login at 1Kosmos, we verify multiple things. We verify the liveness of a user and also, do a face match of the user. And we are doing a one-to-one match. We’re not doing a one-to-many match. So which means that we are exactly verifying if the user is who they say they are. And along with that, before we do anything of that, we are verifying that the user is a live person. A couple of ways to do that. One is where we have the user follow specific instructions on the screen, like, “Turn left, turn right, smile.”</p>
<p>You know what I mean? I used to say, and I think it’s still valid, we’re the happiest MFA out there. We make people smile. So essentially, when people smile, we know that it is an actual human who’s able to follow instructions and then, do it. And along with that, we are able to go ahead and verify all of the other parameters of the picture that we captured of the person. At a random interval, we are able to capture the picture and then say that this is a live person or not.</p>
<p>Okay, awesome. So what you’re describing there, it’s the active liveness detection?</p>
<p>Correct, it’s the active liveness detection. And along with that, now, technology has evolved and we have evolved, where we have brought out the passive liveness. Passive liveness, we can determine the liveness of a person just by means of taking a selfie. There are a couple of attributes about the picture that we can utilize to go ahead and determine that the person is indeed who they say they are. And the very fact that they’re even coming in to take a selfie and just look, once they look at the screen, we are able to go ahead and determine that they are who they say they are. We are not waiting for them to upload a picture or something like that. We’re substituting or we’re actually doing active liveness, without the need of spoiling the user experience.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. All right. So then, on the injection side, we’re monitoring for what? Virtual cameras? External cameras?</p>
<p>So see the thing is, injection side, you’re injecting into the stream, which means that something needs to sit on the client or something needs to sit on at the place where the picture is getting captured or where the video is getting captured to determine liveness. Because that’s exactly where all of these other pieces of software are sitting. Now, that means that this piece of code or this SDK that sits at the browser layer or at the client is able to determine, “Do you have multiple cameras out there? Are you using something that is plugged into the USB? Or is it using something that is virtual?”</p>
<p>And also preventing something from injecting random pieces of information in the stream that is going out to our server. So what that means is that, yes, cracking that in is going to be highly improbable, and we’ll see, obviously, there are different avenues to go ahead and improve the technology. But right now, we are able to go ahead and determine, at the point where the picture is getting captured that, “Hey, is there an injection attack that’s happening?” And this could be done even on the mobile device, right? So no problem.</p>
<p>Okay, all right. All right. So when we talk about identity verification, at the very highest levels of assurance, we’re essentially talking about an enrollment process, where somebody presents themselves to a camera, and that likeness is verified against an offline credential, something like a state-issued ID, driver’s license, a passport. So for this to happen, at the point of enrollments, we’re doing several things, correct? We’re doing a passive likeness, we’re doing an active likeness, we’re checking for injection attacks, then somebody presents a credential, and we’re also inspecting that credential for signs of manipulation. “Has the photograph been manipulated? Is it a valid credential, with,” for example, “the databases that contain the driver’s license information from the states?” Only when it passes that, all those tests, all those inspections, has somebody then successfully registered. Once that process, the enrollment process, is completed, now folks are using this biometric to log in. So again, at the point where a access request is being made, we’re again inspecting for signs of manipulation, being liveness, passive, active, and then, the injection attacks.</p>
<p>This is where authentication is changing for the enterprise, constantly changing for the customers. We are definitely, the entire space is evolving, because now earlier enrollment used to be, hey, you have a username, password, and then, get in. Max, you do an MFA. Now, enrollment can happen really quick, self-service, just by utilizing your credential, that’s powerful. You’ve already gotten a credential, you can do this remotely. And the consuming, either company, it’s an enterprise, or whether it’s a customer piece of software, can trust what is happening. Then on, as a customer, now, like you mentioned, I have the ability to authenticate using my face, and we are able to go ahead and say confidently, “Know what, you’re a live person, I know who you are, Vikram. Welcome.” Wouldn’t you like that experience?</p>
<p>I certainly would. So at 1Kosmos, we talk and we have talked a long time about certifications, and for some, that’s a snoozer topic, “Why are we talking about certifications?” So what’s the role of certifications in this? It’s one thing for any number of companies to claim that, “We do this stuff,” but what proves that we do this stuff?</p>
<p>Right, yeah, I think you’re right. So certifications, even the clients where we have implemented, they’ve said, “Okay, you know what? I really want to test out your software. I want to bring a picture in there. I want to put a mask on me. I want to put a video out there, and I’ll test it.” And we say, “All right, go test it. But that’s exactly why we do the certifications.” We’re doing this, because there are third parties who go through and try and break the system. We do pen testing. So it’s very important. It’s something that our clients can utilize and take it to their auditors and go, “Hey, I’ve gotten a certified system, which has been through the ringer, and now, I can just cut my timeline short, implement it, and get my users to actually use it and focus on what’s important for improving the business.”</p>
<p>Got it. So in terms of these certifications, just real briefly, ISO has a set of presentation attack defense specifications. So that’s a set of certifications where the system has to be rigorously tested, that it cannot be fooled, for example, by a 3D mask or by a mask with the eyes cut out. There are, with the NIST certifications, the 800-63 certification, this what certifies the biometric. Talk a little bit about NIST.</p>
<p>Yeah, the NIST has the FRVT certification, and essentially, now, they’re calling it FRTE. And of course, this the organization iBeta, which actually is dedicated towards testing biometrics. So we go through all of these agencies to make sure that we are not only complying with their tests, but also, standards and regulations that rule the use of biometrics. It’s one thing to be able to capture it and do it correctly, but can you do it in a privacy preserving way? I think that differentiates us.</p>
<p>All right. That’s bringing up another thing. Okay. But real briefly, what the UK version, the UK…</p>
<p>DIATF.</p>
<p>Right? So that’s there. FIDO2 is there. I know I’m forgetting a couple, but you mentioned privacy. So biometric, now that’s a pretty personal piece of information, along with my birthday and social security number, everything, right? So talk about privacy. What’s the big deal?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know we’re on the topic of trying to figure out liveness, are you live person and everything. But yeah, once you capture it, where are you storing it? How are you storing it? So this is where the 1Kosmos’ architecture comes into play wherein we have the key for the private key that is always in possession of the user. Now, this could be a pin or this could be a private key that is there that is stored within their device. Or really, what we are able to do is to calculate a key right at the edge by using your face. Your face is your key. That is what opens the door. So it is really amazing, that amazing technology that we’re able to do, wherein we are able to do that, manage your wallet for you, and think about what a wallet is.</p>
<p>It is just like your physical wallet, where you put different things, and you can put in your face, you can put in your fingerprint, you can put in all the other biometrics that are in there, along with your FIDO credential and your smart car credential. If you want to put your legacy password, you can put it in there. It’s simply a wallet that is in your possession, that can be opened up only by using certain keys.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that. Vik, that means two things to me. It means that, as a consumer, I control the data. I want to delete the data, I delete it. I want to use it, I determine, at the point of use, exactly what information I’m going to share, I feel comfortable sharing. The other thing it means is for the IT and security people, it’s not introducing another vulnerability, because you’ve introduced a better way to authenticate. And that point of vulnerability is this honeypot of customer information. Why have it when you don’t have to have it? So eliminating that honeypot to me is important, and I think it should be important to IT and security people. Have we left anything out? This feels like a pretty good conversation. One thing, we do have a new white paper coming out. It’s called Biometric Authentication Versus the Threat of Deepfakes. It’ll be on our website here shortly, so look out for that. Any parting shots, Vik, any stone unturned on deepfakes?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would just say, look out for them. And just be sure, just like, earlier, it was with the phishing emails, now it’s with deepfakes, make sure that you’re doing something real. Do your due diligence, and yeah, if you need help, talk to 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Yeah. I see deepfakes is kind of the latest salvo from the cybercrime community to attack one of the creators of value on the digital side, that creators of value is getting workers quick access to systems, plugging the holes, so that account takeover doesn’t lead to data breach or ransomware. A lot of news about ransomware recently. So yeah, some really interesting developments. And once again, here at 1Kosmos, we’re trying to stay ahead of that with our innovative solutions. So Vik, thanks for spending time with me today. Very much appreciate your time.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Thanks, Michael. That was great.</p>

 Armin Bauer, Co-Founder &amp; Chief Technology and Security Officer at IDnow, explains all about the German Federal Ministry of Finance’s new draft bill on the Money Laundering Video Identification Ordinance (GwVideoIdentV), what the amendments would mean for banks and financial service providers, and why IDnow has been driving these developments for years and welcomes the revisions. 



<p>Germany is lagging behind in its digital transformation efforts compared to the rest of Europe, despite its technological expertise. For example, as the first country to accept video identification procedures, Germany took on a pioneering role, but has subsequently lost this position due to &nbsp;its inactivity and inability to approve successor solutions at national level. </p>



<p>The current basis for video identification in the banking sector continues to be rules contained in the Circular (“Rundschreiben”), which was issued by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin) in 2017.</p>



<p>There have been few updates to video identification procedures in the German financial sector in recent years, with automation, modernization and user-friendliness all seemingly often in competition with security concerns. There were also inklings from Berlin that coordination on the GwVideoIdent regulation was tough.</p>



<p>However, an exciting breakthrough came in mid-April 2024: the Federal Ministry of Finance published the <a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Gesetzestexte/Gesetze_Gesetzesvorhaben/Abteilungen/Abteilung_VII/20_Legislaturperiode/2024-04-18-GwVideoIdentV/0-Gesetz.html">draft bill for the ordinance on money laundering identification by video identification</a>.</p>



 What changes does the draft envisage? 



  Classic VideoIdent procedures are now to be regulated by ordinance, and no longer just by the <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Rundschreiben/2017/rs_1703_gw_videoident_en.html">BaFin Circular from 2017</a>.  Companies whose services and products fall under the Money Laundering Act (GWG) and which use the existing VideoIdent procedure must offer mandatory identification using the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">German online ID function</a> (German ID card with activated online function and NFC-enabled smartphone, eID for short) in addition to other solutions. According to the draft, this must be equivalent to other procedures: “In particular, providers must not deliberately mislead the person to be identified into preferring the video identification procedure via the user interface design”. The draft will create more use cases for the electronic ID card (eID) in the financial sector. The spread of the online ID function among the population is expected to increase. According to a PwC study, only seven percent of Germans would decide against using eID, while 70 percent are prepared to use the online ID card for transactions with banks and in legal matters.  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/experten-gefuehrte-identitaetsueberpruefung/">Partially automated procedures for identity verification</a> are to be permitted. Partially automated means that parts of the identification process can in the future be automated, but there are still parts that may not. In addition, a direct (not downstream) check by a human must be part of the verification process. IDnow’s &nbsp;“VideoIdent Flex” solution offers a clever combination of AI-supported, expert-led identity verification.  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/automatisierte-identitaetspruefung/">Fully automated solutions for identity verification</a> could also be approved for up to two years, subject to certain requirements (equivalence to a human check) – after a maximum six-month registration phase for testing under the supervision of the BSI (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, Federal Office for Information Security). The BSI retains the final decision power regarding approval.  



 How IDnow became a pioneer for secure and intuitive identification processes in the financial sector. 



<p>IDnow presented the idea of partially and fully automated video identification to the Ministry of Finance back in 2020. We therefore welcome the fact that legislation is now to follow the existing technical possibilities and that further identification procedures are to be approved. IDnow’s fully automated process has been setting industry standards for a long time, is certified in accordance with various industry standards (e.g. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-among-first-etsi-ts-119-461-certification/">ETSI TS 119 461</a>) and is already used for money laundering-compliant identification in other European countries.</p>



<p>Since IDnow was founded, the Munich-based IT company has worked closely with regulatory authorities and other market participants to drive progress and always ensure the highest level of security for identity verification. We believe that security does not have to come at the expense of intuitive design and user-friendliness. Our solutions provide customers with secure, reliable and straightforward identity verification processes.</p>



 Security, innovation and trust in digital identity management. 



<p>IDnow is a leading platform provider for identity verification and a German pioneer in digital applications and innovations – both in sensitive parts of the administration and in highly regulated areas, such as the financial sector.</p>



<p>We offer users a reliable, secure and seamless solution from a single source that meets the relevant regulatory requirements and security levels and protects against misuse, such as fraud, identity theft or forged signatures.</p>



 Creating a high level of security and sovereignty in the digital space. 



<p>In our view, clear rules and standards for digital identification procedures are the basis for ensuring trust, security and privacy. In fact, secure forms of digital identification can strengthen the sovereignty of citizens in the digital space and in the financial sector.</p>



<p>We have the expertise to meet the diverse range of security requirements, which vary depending on the industry and sensitivity of the use case. Germany must always strive to provide its citizens with the most secure, innovative and usable solutions and play a pioneering role in digitalization – this is what IDnow stands for with its broad portfolio of solutions.</p>



<p>We offer secure and powerful identity verification and fraud prevention solutions, including:</p>



  Automated identity verification (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, AI-supported and GwG-compliant),  Video verification solutions (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a>, a GwG-compliant verification with high security requirements via video chat, supported by AI technology; and VideoIdent Flex, a customizable version),  Chip-based identity verification, utilizing the German electronic ID card (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">eID</a>) and NFC-enabled smartphones.

				  Indicio Proven® offers a simple three-step process for integrating its decentralized identity solution into existing systems, ensuring efficient data sharing and security with support from the Indicio team.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Aashi Srivastava</p>
<p>In today’s fast-changing digital world, the demand for fast data you can trust has never been more pressing. Indicio Proven® is a reliable decentralized identity solution that can help organizations create more efficiency around the complexities of data sharing and security. Let’s explore how you can easily incorporate Indicio Proven into your existing systems.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven is not a rip-and-replace solution. Instead, it’s designed to seamlessly complement your existing systems, offering a flexible approach to enhance data security. By integrating Proven into your infrastructure, you retain control of your data while gaining the benefits of decentralized identity solutions, allowing you to implement verifiable credentials. This flexibility enables you to use the power of Proven without disrupting your current operations, enabling you to adapt and evolve your data management practices to meet the demands of today’s digital landscape.</p>
<p>You don’t need a platform. You want control, making existing investments better.</p>
<p>Integrating Indicio Proven into your existing systems might seem daunting, but it can be broken down into a simple three-step process. Every step of this integration process can be done on your own or in collaboration with the Indicio team to ensure a hassle-free experience.</p>
<p>Step 1: Installation of Proven Issuer Software Agent</p>
<p>The process begins with installing the Proven Issuer software agent on your server. This software agent is the backbone of your credential issuance process and connects seamlessly to your data source or service via standard REST APIs.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven is designed to meet your comprehensive data security needs while ensuring regulatory compliance, offering a robust solution that covers all essential aspects of decentralized identity management. It prioritizes compliance with industry regulations, providing peace of mind and confidence in navigating the complex landscape of data governance.</p>
<p>Step 2: Connection and Issuance of Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>Once the Proven Issuer software agent is installed, API integration allows for a seamless system connection from your server to the Issuer agent. The next step is to connect the Issuer agent to the data’s intended recipients or holders, including customers, employees, employers, and partner organizations. You can start issuing verifiable credentials to the recipients using an invitation URL (often in a QR code) to connect to the holder’s agent. The holder agent is a software app downloaded by the holder to their mobile device (Indicio Proven has a Mobile SDK for incorporating agent functionality into existing mobile applications). Your Issuer agent is connected to the Holder agent with a secure encrypted channel, ensuring the smooth transmission of credentials. These credentials contain encrypted data securely stored in a wallet under the holder’s control and typically on their mobile device.</p>
<p>Step 3: Verification and Transmission of Data</p>
<p>When connecting the Indicio Proven Verifier application to the holder via an invitation URL, holders can consent to share their data securely and selectively. The application generates a presentation of the data for their credentials, allowing the verifier application to receive and verify the data. The verifier application can also be connected via APIs to other services or systems to transmit the verified data and share the trust established by the systems, protocols, and cryptography.</p>
<p>Through the integration process, Indicio’s team of industry veterans will be by your side, ready to provide support. There are several options for assistance, including onsite, personalized training, virtual office hours, or collaborative coding sessions. Indicio ensures that integration is not a barrier but an opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>Integrating Proven into your existing systems does not have to be an intimidating task. It’s a step towards greater data efficiency, security, and trust.</p>

 We sit down with the owner of a UK fraud consultancy firm to discuss how fraud has changed over the years, why fraud has become so pervasive in the UK, and the role of organizations in protecting their customers from fraud attacks. 



 



 Despite very quickly reaching the rank of CID officer, you were with the police for a comparatively short time – just shy of eight years; what were the main reasons for you moving to the private sector?&nbsp; 



<p>My police career was short but busy. I became a CID officer within about three years, which is unusual, and worked in a very dynamic and young CID office. Fraud had always been my passion and the police were increasingly turning their back on it to focus on other priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was apparent at that time that people were disposing of their own cars and then making fraudulent insurance claims, and unfortunately, in many cases, it didn’t lead to prosecution, as the insurance companies were unable to detect it. I decided to take a risk and set up my own specialist fraud investigation business Taylor &amp; Moore Investigations. At the time it was the first of its kind and within 18 months we had 22 people working for us and half the top 10 UK insurance companies as clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What specific experience from your years in the police best prepared you for the transition to work as a fraud investigator for insurance companies?&nbsp; 



<p>The business I set up was based on a good CID office. I began by intelligence gathering to understand how insurance fraud worked. I then produced a cost-effective system to detect and investigate insurance fraud. I built a whole training system based around what was needed, including criminal and insurance law. I also made great use of the intelligence we uncovered about those frauds. So, even back then we took a strategic approach of prevention, detection, containment, and analysis that is still used today by most of the industry. &nbsp;</p>



 Obviously, fraud investigation techniques have changed dramatically since you started in the ‘80s, but what were some of the major differences in how you approached fraud investigation in the police and in the private sector?&nbsp; 



<p>There are of course advantages in having a warrant card, a power of arrest, and the huge resources police have available. </p>



<blockquote><p>However, there are also advantages to not being a police officer. I have never seen this mentioned by anyone else, but people were more willing to speak and tell me things than they had been when I was a police officer. </p>Peter Taylor, owner of fraud consultancy firm.</blockquote>



<p>As my specialism was interviewing that made my life much easier. I am not sure folks realise the extent to which suspects and witnesses clam up when talking to figures of authority like the police.</p>



 What about fraud investigation techniques in general, how have they changed over the years?&nbsp; 



<p>Interviews, data, and forensics in that order were the core of investigations at the time I left the police. Our business model was based on the same principles. The evolution of fraud and counter fraud has seen development in all three areas but particularly in data and forensics. A simple view is that the order in which they are relied upon has changed now to be data, forensics, and then interviews last.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gathering intelligence is much easier nowadays because of the widespread use of the internet and the volume of data now routinely available to investigators. In some cases, the interview is still very much part of gathering evidence but can often just be there to make sure we are not making a mistake by giving the people involved the opportunity to explain things that look suspicious.</p>



 Fraud and fraud prevention has always been a hotly contested game of cat and mouse. Was there any period of history where the ‘game’ was more one-sided?&nbsp; 



<p>The numbers tell the story. When I started out, fraud was around 1% of all crime and we were definitely the cats and the criminals, the mice. That slowly changed around the year 2000. I believe the web enabling criminals to easily communicate with each other and reach targets within a much wider circle has been the main catalyst.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another factor that fuelled the fire was policing in the UK and other countries had massive funding cuts whilst having to focus on other especially important stuff like terrorism, domestic violence, and grooming. Fraud is now running at 40% of all crime, much of it does not get reported so it is hard to claim anything other than that the criminals now have the upper hand. That will change but not any time soon.</p>



 
   
     
                     The future of fraud and digital identity verification in the UK. 
                     Our experts explore the current situation around fraud in the UK, how fraudsters are carrying out their nefarious activities at scale, and how technology can both help and hinder the fight against fraud. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/fraud-digital-identity-verification-uk/">Watch now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


 Technology is often regarded as a double-edged sword when it comes to fraud. What impact has the proliferation of technology had on the fraud landscape in the UK, and wider market? Is there a danger of ceding too much control, and outsourcing too much of the process to artificial intelligence?&nbsp; 



<p>When we introduce new technology, there tends to be three stages of adoption:&nbsp;</p>



  Stage one: What can we do with this?<br>  Stage two: Can we make it safe?<br>  Stage three: Can we make sure it is legal?&nbsp;  



<p>Then it becomes a cycle of constant development and fixing things that we never quite catch up on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You cannot efficiently deal with any volume of crime without technology. For example, you would not try to run a bank or any other business without it, and countering fraud is no exception. AI in some ways is just the latest standard, albeit like adding a turbo charger to an already fast car.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Routine process should go through automation wherever practical, and we should use all the tools available. The dangers come from ignoring people who can see it is not working properly, and we have to be objective enough to actually listen to accused people who say it was not working properly too. Hence the Post Office Scandal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest worry I have right now though is complacency around data accuracy. If the data is inaccurate or the AI poorly trained, then it will get things wrong. For me technology must be supervised rather than supervise important decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The UK is often referred to as the fraud capital of Europe, why do you think this is? What changes do you think need to be implemented to address this?&nbsp; 



<p>In many ways illicit trade follows the same paths as legitimate trade. Although we are no longer part of the EU, the UK has for many decades been a hub and gateway to the EU for the US and other countries and vice versa. As the English language is also used across so many nations as a primary or secondary language, it is therefore familiar and a sort of lingua franca to many of those who commit crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also important to recognize that as the UK was present in many other nations through trading, colonialism, and military conflict for hundreds of years, there is also a perception abroad that we are all wealthy as individuals and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This all makes the UK a target for overseas fraudsters, but we cannot ignore the reality that many fraudsters are based in the UK too. I often hear of us referred to as the butler to the world because of our involvement in laundering foreign wealth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organized fraud sits within three areas: white collar crime, organized cybercrime, and organized crime. The UK criminals are prolific in all three areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The changes needed are wholesale and we do at last seem to be making progress, but it will take time. What we need are:&nbsp;</p>



  Consequences for committing fraud i.e. arrests and convictions.<br>  A long-term strategy ideally within education that encourages young people to stay away from cybercrime, and to know how to protect themselves from financial crime and risk.<br>  A focus on ethics and not just profit across government, public services, education, and the private sector.&nbsp;  



  A way of confirming who people are and what age they are without having to submit documents like passports and driving licences.&nbsp;  



 What part does consumer awareness play in the fight against fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>Educating consumers as to the risks they face and how to protect themselves from fraud is a vital element of fraud prevention. Making people aware of what may happen and giving them clear advice helps. I am not convinced we do enough across the board to provide a remedy for them when an attempt is made, or a successful fraud occurs. However, this is only one side of the coin, organizations must also use technology to protect the consumer too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many attacks can be stopped through good anti-virus software, as well as good standards of multi-factor authentication. I foresee the day when all this functionality will automatically be included on every device sold. Look at cars for example. They all now have transponders, dead locks, and alarms built in. Car thefts are rising again right now but until recently they were reducing year on year having hit around a million thefts per annum in the 1990s.&nbsp;</p>



 How can organizations educate their customers on the dangers of fraud more effectively?&nbsp; 



<p>I would like to see some sort of reward system for those who thwart serious fraud attempts, such as authorised push payment. It could be monetary, or it could be some other benefit but to acknowledge that the consumer has done the right thing could go a long way to prevent fraud. With the banks being expected to compensate customers who lose money to fraud then the banks benefit from fraudsters not getting away with it rather than the consumer. No good deed, however, goes unpunished and there would inevitably be attempts to cheat any such system.&nbsp;</p>



 You deliver training in fraud prevention across a wide range of verticals, including insurance, banking, lending, online retail, workplace fraud, and organised cyber fraud, are there any similarities in fraud attacks across the industries, and conversely, what are the main differences?&nbsp; 



<p>The UK Fraud Act 2006 clearly sets out the main fraud offences and the way frauds can be committed happen across all industries. People like to give names to different types of fraud based on the method and the target. I understand that and do it too and it can help with statistics, data, and analysis. Despite there being hundred of categories of fraud, the reality is there are a only handful of ways that fraud is committed e.g. false representation, not disclosing information, obtaining services by deception, abuse of position, and making or supplying articles for use in fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are other financial crimes that come into play, such as bribery and corruption, money laundering, and theft, but most, if not all, frauds involve the above. The similarities far outweigh any specifics for different industries, which is why around 80% of the training I deliver is generic with the remainder being specific to the delegates taking part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From my experience of working with prolific career fraudsters they commit fraud across the board. One person I interviewed about his life of crime committed card fraud, insurance fraud, bank fraud, benefits fraud, and tax fraud. That surely shows that the same methods are adapted across different sectors and that it is the same fraudsters targeting different sectors too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How can organizations better protect themselves and their customers from the threat of fraud? 



<p>I have found that much like charity, protection from fraud and cybercrime starts at home. I have just worked with a client who has allowed me to train and educate all their staff on how fraud and cybercrime works, how they are at risk, and how to protect themselves from it. Get that done first and then they will automatically protect their organization and their customers in the same way. Feedback and engagement with the delegates has been tremendous. They were not just trained they changed what they do.</p>

The Verida Network provides private storage, sources of personal data and expandable infrastructure to make this future a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Let’s dive into each of these areas in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Private storage for personal AI&nbsp;models <p>The Verida network is designed for storing private, personal data. It is a <a href="https://news.verida.io/revolutionizing-web3-storage-a-deep-dive-into-ipfs-and-verida-dbstore-7a15745dd118">highly performant, low cost, regulatory compliant solution</a> for storing structured database data for any type of application.</p><p>Data stored on the network is protected with a user’s private key, ensuring they are the only account that can request access to, and encrypt their data (unless they provide permission to another account).</p><p>This makes the Verida Network ideal for storing private AI models for end users. The network’s high performance (leveraging P2P web socket connections), makes it suitable for high speed read / write applications such as training&nbsp;LLMs.</p> Source of data for training AI&nbsp;models <p>We’ve all heard the saying “garbage in, garbage out” when it comes to data. This also applies to training AI models. They are only as good as the data they are fed for training purposes.</p><p>The Verida ecosystem provides a broad range of capabilities that make it ideally suited to being a primary source of highly valuable data for training AI&nbsp;models.</p><p>Verida has been developing an API data connector framework that enables users to easily connect to existing API’s of centralized platforms and claim their personal data, that they can securely store on the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>Users on the Verida network will be able to pull health activity data from the likes of Strava and Fitbit. They can pull their private messages from chat platforms, their data from Google and Apple accounts. This can all then be leveraged to train AI models for exclusive use by the user, or that data can be anonymized and contributed to larger training&nbsp;models.</p><p>Establishing a data-driven token economy offers a promising avenue for fostering fairness among all stakeholders. Eventually, major tech and data corporations may introduce a token system for service payments, thereby incentivizing users to share their&nbsp;data.</p><p>For an example; individuals could leverage their anonymous health data to train AI models for healthcare research and receive token rewards in return. These rewards could then be utilized for subscribing to the service or unlocking premium features, establishing a self-sustaining cycle where data sharing leads to increased service access as a reward. This model fosters a secure and equitable relationship between data contribution and enhanced service access, ensuring that those who contribute more to the ecosystem reap greater benefits in&nbsp;return.</p><p>Users could also use their personal data to train AI models designed just for them. Imagine a digital AI assistant guiding you through your life. Suggesting meetup events to attend to improve your career, suggesting a cheaper greener electricity retailer based on your usage, suggesting a better phone plan or simply reminding you of an event you forgot to add to your calendar.</p> Expandable infrastructure <p>As touched on in “<a href="https://www.chriswere.com/p/how-web3-and-depin-solves-ais-data">How web3 and DePIN solves AI’s data privacy problems</a>”, privacy preserving AI will need access to privacy preserving computation to train AI models and respond to user&nbsp;prompts.</p><p>Verida is not in the business of providing private decentralized computation, however the Verida identity framework (based on the DID-Core W3C standard) is expandable to connect to this type of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN).</p><p>Identities on the Verida network can currently be linked to three types of DePIN; Database storage, Private inbox messages, Private notifications. This architecture can easily be extended to support new use cases such as “Private compute” or “Personal AI prompt&nbsp;API”.</p><p>With the appropriate partners who support decentralized private compute, there is a very clear pathway to enable personalized, privacy preserving AI leveraging a 100% DePIN technology stack.</p><p>This is incredibly exciting, as it will provide a more secure, privacy preserving solution as an alternative to giving all our data to large centralized technology companies.</p> About Chris <p>Chris Were is the CEO of <a href="http://verida.io/">Verida</a>, a decentralized, self-sovereign data network that empowers individuals to control their digital identity and personal data.
