 Comparing Lasso (L1) vs Ridge Regression (L2) vs ElasticNet (L1-L2), and Calibration of Classifier Probabilities  Summary <p>This post describes benchmarks on Ocean Predictoor simulations across various approaches to (a) linear regularization, and to (b) calibrating the models’ output probabilities.</p><p>It then proceeds to do a walk-through of each of the benchmarks for predictoor/trader profit, and comparison plots for the models &amp; their calibrations.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 What is Classification? <p>Classification models (“classifiers”) predict the category or class label of an input. For example, in email spam detection, a classifier might predict whether an email is Spam or Not Spam. Since it has just two possible categories, this makes it a binary-valued classification model (True or&nbsp;False).</p><p>To compare, regression models (“regressors”) predict a continuous-valued output. In an email spam application, a regressor might predict the number of spam messages per&nbsp;day.</p> 1.2 What is Regularization? <p>“Regularization” is a technique in fitting models that aims to reduce the uncertainty of future predictions. (“Minimize volume of future predictions confidence ellipsoid.) There are many approaches to regularization. When learning linear models, they occupy a spectrum&nbsp;from:</p>  L1 / Lasso: Try to get sparse models with few parameters  L2 / Ridge Regression: Allow each variable to have a weight, however&nbsp;small  ElasticNet: Shades of gray between L1 &amp;&nbsp;L2  <p>The appendix holds details of&nbsp;each.</p> 1.3 What’s Calibration of Classifier Probabilities? <p>Beyond just predicting True or False, classification models can also output their estimated probability of True or False (or more general category).</p><p>Probabilities fall out naturally with some classifier formulations, such as logistic regression. Here we are using logistic regression.</p><p>We can “calibrate” output probabilities by warping the model’s estimated probability to a training set. This means its probability estimates can be more trustworthy. Some techniques include: None, Isotonic, and&nbsp;Sigmoid.</p>  None calibration: uses the model’s raw, uncalibrated probabilities.  Isotonic calibration: maps predicted probabilities to calibrated probabilities by dividing the probabilities into classes using a fitted piecewise constant, non-decreasing function.  Sigmoid calibration: maps predicted probabilities to calibrated probabilities by transforming the raw scores using a sigmoid function, which has an S-shaped curve, squeezing the input values into the range [0,&nbsp;1].   1.4 Ocean Predictoor, Classification and Benchmarks <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn&nbsp;$.</p><p>Classification models are used predict whether the next BTC/USDT close value will go UP or DOWN. (Or ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, etc.)</p><p>We developed a simulation tool (“pdr sim”) for data scientists to run simulations of their predictoor &amp; trader bots to benchmark which modeling strategy, trading strategy, parameters, etc on $ made by predicting or trading. The simulator also outputs classifier accuracy, f1 / recall / precision, and other classifier performance metrics.</p> 1.5 Benchmarks Outline <p>To help users in setting parameters, we ran benchmarks using the “pdr multisim” tool, which invokes the simulator in a loop across various parameter settings. This blog post describes the results of those benchmarks.</p><p>We run benchmarks on each of the regularization approaches</p>  ClassifLinearLasso — L1 regularization  ClassifLinearRidge — L2 regularization  ClassifLinearElasticNet models — spectrum between L1 &amp;&nbsp;L2.  <p>And for each of those approaches, we run the three calibration approaches (None, Isotonic, Sigmoid).</p> 1.6 Experimental setup <p>These parameters were defined in our my_ppss.yaml file, a customized version of the ppss.yaml file of the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> repo:</p>  ClassifLinearRidge, ClassifLinearLasso, and ClassifLinearElasticNet ML models were tested with None, Isotonic, and Sigmoid calibrations.  Models predicted 5min candle UP/DOWN feeds for BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT for 5000&nbsp;epochs.  Models were trained on historical Binance 5min close candle data using either a BTC-USDT training set or both BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT training set from January 1, 2024 to June 30,&nbsp;2024.  The # of training samples (max_n_train) tested were 1000, 2000,&nbsp;5000.  Autoregressive n = 1 and 2 were tested. (Number of candles in the past to build models&nbsp;from.)  Trading fees were set to&nbsp;0%.  The predictoor bot stake was set to 100 OCEAN per&nbsp;epoch.  Other predictoors’ accuracy was set to 50.001% (barely better than&nbsp;random).   2. ClassifLinearLasso <p>Ocean Predictoor’s ClassifLinearLasso model is a Python scikit-learn logistic regression model implemented with Lasso regularization (L1).</p> 2.1 ClassifLinearLasso Benchmarks  2.1.1 Predictoor Profitability Predictoor Profits using ClassifLinearLasso Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataPredictoor Profits using ClassifLinearLasso Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>Sigmoid calibration of ClassifLinearLasso generated the best results for the Predictoor bot’s profitability at 5000 training samples using either of the training sets. However, None calibration outperformed Sigmoid &amp; Isotonic at only 1000 training samples of BTC-USDT, demonstrating that the calibrations are most effective when generalizing patterns over larger datasets.</p> 2.1.2 Trader Profitability Trader Profits using ClassifLinearLasso Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataTrader Profits using ClassifLinearLasso Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>While Sigmoid calibration generated the highest Predictoor profits, indicating accurate predictions, Isotonic calibration improved trader profits better than both Sigmoid and None. This suggests that an Isotonic calibration fits a confidence-based trading model better. High accuracy is great — but it’s not enough to reliably make $ because high accuracy with low confidence can still yield trading&nbsp;losses.</p><p>Why can trading losses occur even when prediction accuracy is&nbsp;&gt;50%?</p><p>Losses occur when the magnitude of the losses for DOWN candles is greater than the gains for the UP candles. Calibrations can differ in how they conserve losses better or net bigger gains, but adding confidence intervals to the models can help increase returns regardless of fixed or variable trade&nbsp;sizes.</p> 3. ClassifLinearRidge <p>Ocean Predictoor’s ClassifLinearRidge model is a Python scikit-learn logistic regression model implemented with Ridge regression (L2).</p> 3.1 ClassifLinearRidge Benchmarks  3.1.1 Predictoor Profitability Predictoor Profits using ClassifLinearRidge Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataPredictoor Profits using ClassifLinearRidge Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>Sigmoid calibration of the ClassifLinearRidge model generated the greatest profits and even outperformed the ClassifLinearLasso model’s max profit. None calibration at 1000 training samples also demonstrated good profitability when trained on BTC-USDT data, as was seen in the ClassifLinearLasso benchmark, but this one was significantly more profitable.</p> 3.1.2 Trader Profitability Trader Profits using ClassifLinearRidge Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataTrader Profits using ClassifLinearRidge Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>Sigmoid &amp; Isotonic calibrations of ClassifLinearRidge performed similarly in generating trader profits - both calibrations achieved trader profits above $200 USD training on either of the data sets. Isotonic calibration, however, generated the max profit of all the benchmarks when the ClassifLinearRidge model was trained using BTC-USDT data&nbsp;only.</p> 4. ClassifLinearElasticNet <p>Ocean Predictoor’s ClassifLinearElasticNet model is a Python scikit-learn logistic regression model implemented with Elastic Net classification.</p> 4.1 ClassifLinearElasticNet Benchmarks  4.1.1 Predictoor Profitability Predictoor Profits using ClassifLinearElasticNet Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataPredictoor Profits using ClassifLinearElasticNet Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>The Predictoor profit benchmark for ClassifLinearElasticNet has a very similar behavior as the ClassifLinearLasso &amp; ClassifLinearRidge benchmarks, including the Sigmoid as the best performing calibration &amp; the None calibration performing well at 1000 training samples of BTC-USDT data. This is somewhat to be expected because ClassifLinearElasticNet includes both L1 &amp; L2 penalties from the Lasso &amp; Ridge models in its&nbsp;formula.</p> 4.1.2 Trader Profitability Trader Profits using ClassifLinearElasticNet Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataTrader Profits using ClassifLinearElasticNet Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>Isotonic calibration, as in the previous two trader profit benchmarks, generated the best profits. The consistently profitable Isotonic calibration should be benchmarked with other logistic regression models — SVC, Gaussian, Xgboost, etc. to see if it continues to generate good profits &amp; can be a natural fit for pairing with confidence intervals in a trading optimized model.</p> 5. Comparison Analysis  5.1 Highest Predictoor Profits Similar Performance Among All Three Models With Sigmoid Classification Using BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataClassifLinearLasso Model Beats Both ClassifLinearRidge &amp; ClassifLinearElasticNet When Training on BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data 5.1.1 The Winning Combination for Predictoor Profit <p>The max Predictoor profit was 4,937.0429 OCEAN and was generated by the ClassifLinearRidge model. The model was tuned with a Sigmoid calibration, a lookback of 1 (autoregressive_n=1), and 5000 training samples (max_n_train=5000) from a data including both BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT.</p><p>In all the Predictoor profit benchmarks, Sigmoid calibration resulted in the best accuracy &amp; Predictoor profits. The inclusion of ETH-USDT data to the training set improved profits for ClassifLinearRidge and ClassifLinearElasticNet too.</p> 5.2 Highest Trader&nbsp;Profits  5.2.1 The Winning Combination for Trader&nbsp;Profit <p>The highest trading profit was $268.49 USD and was gained by the ClassifLinearLasso model. Tuning included Isotonic calibration, a lookback of 1, and 5000 training samples of only BTC-USDT data. In five of the six most profitable results, Isotonic calibration was used, so this calibration should be tested in future logistic regression benchmarks that optimize trader profit. The 6 most profitable models &amp; tunings all clustered around $250&nbsp;USD.</p> 6. Conclusion <p>The ClassifLinearRidge model with Sigmoid calibration emerged as the top performer for maximizing Predictoor profits (4,937.0429 OCEAN profit) by having the highest accuracy predictions of all the models &amp; tunings. Including ETH-USDT data in the training set further boosted profits for both ClassifLinearRidge and ClassifLinearElasticNet models, highlighting the importance of diversifying the data to improve model performance.</p><p>In contrast, the ClassifLinearLasso model with Isotonic calibration achieved the highest trader profits ($268.49 USD profit), showing that while accuracy is crucial to making $, the confidence in predictions plays an important role in trading success. Isotonic calibration provided the highest trader profits across all three models, suggesting that Isotonic calibration might be a natural fit for confidence-based trading strategies.</p><p>In sum, while Sigmoid calibration optimizes for predictive accuracy and Predictoor profits, Isotonic calibration enhances trader profits by offering better-calibrated probabilities, making it suitable for confidence-based trading models. These results encourage more Predictoor benchmarking tests of logistic regression models, especially with more iterations, to see how to make the most&nbsp;$.</p> 7. Appendix: Tables  7.1 ClassifLinearLasso Data&nbsp;Table <p>The data for ClassifLinearLasso evidences that Sigmoid calibration generates the highest Predictoor profits consistently. Notably, the table also includes the maximum trader profit of $268.4489 USD in the row with Isotonic calibration, autoregressive_n = 1, and max_n_train = 5000 trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;data.</p> 7.2 ClassifLinearRidge Data&nbsp;Table <p>The data for ClassifLinearRidge also shows consistently high Predictoor profits for Sigmoid calibration, especially around 5000 training samples. The data contains the maximum Predictoor profit of 4937.0429 OCEAN in the row containing Sigmoid calibration with autoregressive_n = 1, and 5000 training samples on BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT data. Notice that this row also demonstrated a strong trading&nbsp;profit.</p> 7.3 ClassifLinearElasticNet Data&nbsp;Table <p>The ClassifLinearElasticNet table demonstrates similar patterns seen in the previous two tables, but has the notable difference of generating all the 2nd best Predictoor &amp; trader profits regardless of the training set. This is congruent with the model being balanced between both L1 &amp; L2 penalization. The 2nd best Predictoor profit is 4,808.649 OCEAN in the row with Sigmoid calibration, autoregressive_n = 1, and 5000 training samples of BTC-USDT &amp; USDT data. The 2nd best trader profit is $246.8255 USD in the row for Isotonic calibration, with autoregressive_n = 1, and 5000 training samples of BTC-USDT&nbsp;data.</p> 8. Appendix: Details on Regularization Approaches  8.1 Lasso Regularization <p>Lasso is an optimization formulation to learn the parameters of a linear model. It has two parts. The first part minimizes sum-squared errors. The second part is the “L1” regularization” part. The absolute-value term has the effect of driving small weights to zero. Therefore</p><p>drives out weights of zero or near-zero. It does this by mathematically applying a penalty (L1) explained below. This helps in identifying the most relevant features and often enhancing predictive performance on new&nbsp;data.</p> 8.2 Ridge Regression <p>Ridge regression is an optimization formulation to learn the parameters of a linear model, just as Lasso is. However, whereas Lasso drives negligible parameter values to zero, ridge regression lets most variables stick around with some weight. Ridge regression’s formulation is called L2 regularization.</p><p>The penalty is equivalent to the sum of the squared values of the coefficients, does not exclude features (as Lasso does) but shrinks all coefficients, maintaining all features in the model with smaller weights for less important ones. This approach encourages the model to prioritize features that contribute the most to the prediction, leading to better performance on unseen data. Below is the mathematical explanation for the L2&nbsp;penalty.</p> 8.3 ElasticNet <p>Elastic Net is an optimization formulation to learn the parameters of a linear model. Just like Lasso and Ridge Regression, its first term is to minimize least-squares error. Then its second term combines both the Lasso term (absolute values of weights) and the Ridge Regression term (square of weights). The “lambda” parameter weights the latter against the former; this means one can choose something closer to Lasso, or to Ridge Regression, or in&nbsp;between.</p><p>The Elastic Net penalty is defined&nbsp;as:</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  New technologies and architectures from Ping Identity are now available to counter traditional fraud vectors and frustrate generative and adversarial AI.

<p>Banking fraud becomes costlier each year, and the threat of generative and adversarial AI technologies being misused adds additional approaches and sophistication of attack vectors never experienced before. Identity fraud is a major contributor to the rise in overall bank fraud, driven by many factors including an explosion in identity theft, with experts believing there is a new victim of identity theft every 22 seconds, and total fraud and identity theft cases up 47% from the previous year to $10.2 billion according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Meanwhile, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has released a Financial Trend Analysis in January 2024 that reveals approximately 1.6 million, or 42% of around 3.8 million total Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reports, equivalent to $212 billion in suspicious activity, were related to identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These government agencies are sounding the alarm because banks and other financial institutions are increasingly challenged by sophisticated, motivated cybercriminals who are constantly finding new and creative ways to commit fraud. At the same time, customer demands mean that financial institutions are under significant pressure to provide Open Banking APIs and other new federated connections with business partners, despite the fact that this significantly increases their attack surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, new technologies and architectures are now available that can help banks counter the traditional attacks and future-proof against new and enhanced AI-based attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Compromised Identity Is Central to Banking Fraud 
<p>Identity crimes often precede the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/bank-fraud.html">many types of fraud common in banking</a>. Whether fraudsters are aiming to open new accounts or apply for loans or new credit cards under a stolen or synthetic identity, or are seeking to gain access to existing accounts in order to make fraudulent transfers or harvest sensitive information, they must commit identity fraud first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is unsurprising, then, that the cost of identity fraud in banking as well as the volume of fraud cases related to identity continues to go up. Andrea Gacki, Director of FinCEN revealed in June 2024 some preliminary results of an early assessment of the Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) from 2022 and 2023. Director Gacki revealed that in just two years, the percentage of the 4.7 million reported SARs tied to some impersonation, circumvention or compromise of identity has jumped from 42% (2021 assessment) to 75%. Director Gacki said, “Based on initial indications, by 2023, identity-related SARs accounted for around half of value and almost three quarters of volume.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 AI Has Created New Threat Vectors 
<p>The development in artificial intelligence technologies has been a book to fraudsters, who can now use generative AI to <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9491/612251">commit fraud more effectively and at scale</a>. As just one example of how this might play out, many European banks and regulators have instituted remote video interviews as a requirement to opening a bank account. However, what our eyes see and our ears hear can no longer be relied upon thanks to generative and other AI technologies being exploited by adversaries. Rapid implementation and usage tools now available as layers on top of the AI core tech enables video and audio deep fakes to be created and injected into a digital interaction with little effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud departments already struggle to keep up with the number of cases that need their attention, and AI is likely to make this problem much worse. Ping recently surveyed 700 IT decision makers from around the world about the topics of AI, fraud, and decentralized identity, and found that only 52% of respondents felt fully confident that they could detect a deepfake of their CEO. Meanwhile, AI emerged as the top area of significant concern among the professionals surveyed, and 54% of organizations admitted to being extremely concerned that AI technology would increase identity fraud.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Digital and Open Banking Increases Attack Surface 
<p>Digital and online banking continues to increase at a rapid pace with customer demand to execute routine financial transactions driving adoption. 81% of users in the US surveyed say they have linked their bank account to third parties online. Regulation from governing authorities demanding Open Banking so as to not lock customers into one bank and enabling them to move between banks has added additional pressure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling access using traditional methods like server-side APIs and federation (such as OIDC) does not lend itself to increasing security. Every time account access APIs are published for consumption by third parties or federated integrations are created between the bank and a third party, the attack surface of the bank increases, making it more vulnerable and statistically more likely to experience an attack that must be mitigated. As sophistication increases with generative and adversarial AI, securing these connections and mitigating attacks will become increasingly expensive with a higher probability of failure to mitigate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New Technologies and Architectures Open Up New Protective Fronts to Fight Fraud 
<p>Fortunately, new technologies and architectures are now available that can help banks counter the traditional attacks and future-proof for the fast-approaching AI-based attacks. One such solution is the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/lp/ac/pingone-neo.html">PingOne Neo product suite</a>, which includes identity verification with liveness and data injection detection (deep fake protection), verifiable credentials, and decentralized identity and integration.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see how these technologies can help, let’s examine some of the functional areas requiring protection in banking and how these new technologies can help.</p>

 A Focus on the Trust Triangle for Digital Identity 



<p>In a previous article, <a href="https://medium.com/@ancestral_alien/functional-analysis-for-implementing-self-sovereign-identity-ssi-in-your-business-ff102c47c015">Functional Analysis for Implementing Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in Your Business</a>, we discussed how decentralized identity is transforming digital identity management. It offers users complete control over their personal data and emphasizes the importance of a detailed functional analysis for successful implementation. In this article, we will focus on the main use cases within an SSI ecosystem, exploring the interactions and roles between the key players.</p>



 What is the SSI Trust Triangle? 



<p>The trust triangle is a fundamental concept describing the trust relationship among three actors in the SSI ecosystem: the issuer, the holder, and the verifier. This trust triangle ensures that digital credentials are issued, managed, and verified securely and reliably.</p>



Trust Triangle decentralized identity and reputation_web3_Extrimian and QuarkID



 Roles and Responsibilities: 



 
 Issuer: The entity that issues digital credentials based on certain attributes or information of the holder and digitally signs them. Examples include universities issuing digital diplomas, governments issuing digital IDs, or companies issuing employment certificates. 



 Holder: The person or entity that receives and possesses the digital credential. The holder stores these credentials in their identity wallet and presents them when needed. They have full control over who can view and verify their credentials, ensuring privacy and control over their identity. 



 Verifier: The entity that verifies the authenticity and validity of the digital credential presented by the holder. They ensure that the credential was issued by a trusted issuer and that the information contained in the credential is valid. Examples include employers verifying employment certificates, airlines verifying digital passports, or financial institutions verifying customer information. 
 



 Credential Issuance 



<p>Credential issuance involves the issuer and the holder and can be initiated in two ways:</p>



 1. User-Initiated Request 



<p>The holder initiates the action by requesting the issuer to generate a credential. This process can be done through an application provided by the issuer. Once the request is approved, the credential is sent to the user’s identity wallet.</p>



 2. Automatic Issuance 



<p>Automatic issuance occurs without an explicit request from the user. It happens when a specific action within a system triggers the issuance of a credential, which is then sent automatically to the holder’s identity wallet without requiring additional confirmation.</p>



 Credential Reception 



<p>The holder receives credentials either through mobile applications or web applications.</p>



 Mobile Identity Wallet 



<p>If the holder initiates the credential issuance request, the issuer’s site or application generates a credential embedded in a QR code or a deeplink.</p>



 
 QR Code: The holder scans the QR code with their phone’s camera or the wallet’s integrated camera. This initiates the Wallet and Credential Interactions (WACI) flow, involving a message exchange with the SSI backend. The user accepts and saves the generated credential in their wallet. 



 Deeplink: The holder accesses the deeplink received from the issuer, automatically initiating the WACI flow. The user accepts and saves the generated credential in their wallet. 
 



 Web Identity Wallet 



<p>For web wallets, the reception can be automatic. The generated credential appears directly in the wallet without needing user confirmation. This process also involves the WACI protocol.</p>



 Credential Presentation and Verification 



<p>Credential presentation involves both the holder and the verifier. The verifier can be a web or mobile application, adapting to the user’s and verification context’s needs.</p>



 Presentation Methods: 



 1. QR Code Scan 



<p>The verifier presents a QR code that the user scans with their device. The user selects the credential they wish to present and can choose to use Selective Disclosure, showing only the necessary data from the credential or presenting the entire credential.</p>



 2. Automatic Presentation 



<p>The user can select the credential they wish to present from their web wallet and choose the verifier to whom they wish to present it.</p>



 Verifier Validations 



<p>The verifier validates the credential, ensuring it is current, valid, and issued by an authorized issuer. After validating the credential, specific business rules of the verifier are applied. The validation results are shown to both the user and the verifier.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>These use cases highlight the flexibility and control that decentralized identity offers, allowing users to manage their credentials securely and efficiently. Understanding these flows and the information exchange between SSI ecosystem actors is crucial to appreciating the benefits and innovation brought by this system.</p>

 In the rapidly transforming digital landscape, ensuring secure and seamless customer authentication has become a critical priority for businesses across various sectors. Customer authentication is essential for optimizing user experience (UX) and security. Companies striving to implement robust customer authentication encounter significant challenges that can impact their bottom line. Outdated account recovery methods, persistent reliance on passwords, and the growing threat of phishing and fraud present considerable obstacles. However, integrating advanced customer authentication solutions offers promising avenues for mitigating these issues and achieving substantial cost savings. 



 







 



 The Importance of Customer Authentication 



<p>Customer authentication solutions are integral to regulating user access to online applications, digital resources, and transaction flows. Historically dependent on passwords and knowledge-based methods, contemporary solutions now employ various passive and active authentication techniques to confirm identities and secure login attempts. Businesses invest in these solutions to protect against account takeover attacks and to ensure that only authorized users can access their digital platforms. Furthermore, regulatory influences like the second Payment Services Directive for online transactions drive the adoption of these advanced authentication methods.</p>



 Challenges in Implementing Customer Authentication 



<p>Despite the availability of sophisticated authentication technology, businesses continue to rely on legacy solutions. Though familiar to consumers, these solutions create challenges in implementation and efficacy. Traditional account recovery methods remain costly, friction-filled, and vulnerable to phishing attacks. According to recent surveys, 59% of authentication practitioners are dissatisfied with their current account recovery capabilities, which heavily rely on passwords. This dissatisfaction leads to higher operational costs, increased call center volumes, and elevated fraud risks. Additionally, educational gaps and legacy systems hinder the widespread adoption of passwordless solutions, with 41% of businesses acknowledging these barriers.</p>



<p>Another significant issue is balancing user experience and security in authentication flows. While 49% of businesses prioritize enabling convenient user experiences, 51% place greater emphasis on preventing unauthorized access. This delicate balance often results in trade-offs that frustrate users and compromise security.</p>



<p>The complexity of the customer authentication landscape further complicates the situation. The market is crowded with over 50 companies offering various solutions, from global tech giants like Google and Microsoft to specialized vendors like 1Kosmos and Curity. Each vendor presents unique capabilities and approaches, making it challenging for businesses to select the most suitable solution. For instance, while some companies provide end-to-end authentication platforms, others focus on niche areas like passkeys, OTPs, or biometrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, manual risk decisioning, idiosyncratic authorization methods, and unprotected one-time passwords (OTPs) prevent current authentication solutions from realizing their full potential. Although 93% of practitioners seek AI-based adaptive or continuous authentication capabilities, few vendors leverage AI and machine learning to produce real-time automated recommendations based on context and risk levels. Similarly, without standard protocols and frameworks, deploying customized access control policies is complex, limiting the effectiveness of fine-grain authorization capabilities.</p>



 The Cost of Inadequate Customer Authentication 



<p>Businesses also struggle with the high costs associated with not successfully authenticating customers. The average cost per successful phishing attack is $5,285, and the cost per successful telephone fraud attack is $792. Additionally, 29% of call center volumes relate to account recovery, contributing to significant operational expenses. These factors underscore the need for more robust and efficient authentication solutions.</p>



 Advanced Customer Authentication: A Path Forward 



<p>Leading customer authentication solutions offer a path forward by addressing these challenges and providing substantial benefits. By adopting advanced authentication methods like FIDO2 passkeys, standardized protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, and expanding native capabilities, businesses can enhance security and user experience.</p>



<p>FIDO2 Passkeys: Emerging as a phishing-resistant replacement for passwords and OTPs, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO2 Passkeys </a>address account recovery challenges by ensuring the authentication process remains entirely on the user’s device. This hardware-based authentication method uses strong cryptography and biometrics, reducing the need for easily compromised static credentials.</p>



<p>Standardized Protocols: Standardizing authentication and authorization protocols through <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/">OpenID Connect</a> promotes interoperability among customer authentication solutions. OAuth 2.0 provides secure delegated access, allowing third-party services to request resources on behalf of users without exposing credentials. OpenID Connect adds an authentication layer to verify user identity, ensuring secure and compatible integrations between service providers, identity providers, and authentication providers.</p>



<p>Expanding Native Capabilities: Vendors are broadening their capabilities beyond managing daily customer access by integrating fraud detection, prevention, and identity verification into their platforms. Emerging orchestration capabilities enable businesses to customize authentication flows with pre-integrated partners, starting with basic MFA and adding third-party authenticators as needed to optimize user flows.</p>



<p>Cost Savings and Efficiency: Businesses adopting leading customer authentication solutions can achieve significant cost savings. For instance, prevention of account resets directed to call centers can reduce call center volumes by 38%. Intuitive passwordless authentication and self-service account recovery can decrease call center labor requirements by 60%. Additionally, these solutions can reduce customer churn by 13% and successful phishing attacks by 12%.</p>



<p>Integrating advanced customer authentication solutions enhances security and user experience and drives substantial cost savings and operational efficiencies. As businesses navigate the complexities of the authentication landscape, embracing these innovative solutions will be crucial for staying ahead of evolving threats and maintaining competitive advantage.</p>

<p></p>  Name: Scotty Matthewman<br>Team: Design<br>Based in: New York City   About Scotty <p>Applying my industrial design background to tech products, I have worked in the startup and agency worlds and, most recently, in corporate innovation. After finding my way into Blockchain tech and innovative tech in general, decentralized and digital identity became a very interesting area to explore.</p><p>I was excited to join SpruceID because I’d have the opportunity to design things that have never been designed before, and both the company and industry's values align with the impact I’d like to have: improving accessibility and inclusion through experience optimization.</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>I am the Senior Designer on the team, so I work on product design, website design, brand and marketing materials, demo prototypes and videos, and communication artifacts. In addition to design work, my role involves product strategy discussions and user research.</p> What advice would you give to a designer who is early in their career? <p>I would say that being genuinely curious is necessary. You have to seek out how things work or why things are the way they are if you want to make educated decisions in your designs; otherwise, you’re just shooting in the dark.</p><p>I think the life of a professional designer is a lot different than that of a design student. Nothing is as simple as it is when you receive an assignment, so you will always have to go out and proactively understand the constraints, capabilities, business value, etc., of anything you’re working on.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, it’s way easier to spend a lot of time on something when it’s interesting to you, so find what’s interesting, and you’re more likely to find a great path. In my opinion, every other skill in design stems from curiosity and wanting to learn. </p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>The obvious answer is all the tech behind our product. I’m not an engineer, but understanding the moving parts, at least at a high level, helps me make more educated decisions in the designs.</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>Our team offsite in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil was an awesome experience. I had just recently joined SpruceID, and because we had the majority of the team in one place, I got to know many people early on. I think in-person experiences like this can help build rapport and chemistry in a team, which can enable them to work quickly and effectively.</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>Success in my role is taking abstract problems and delivering the most intuitive, effective solutions. </p><p>These may not be official measurements, but it’s a big win when someone says, “Oh! Yeah, that would work!” because you bring a new, creative way of designing something.</p><p>You feel like you solved the puzzle. It’s very gratifying and promising when your chosen solution feels like the obvious choice.</p> What is your favorite part about working at SpruceID? <p>I have really enjoyed being on a team made up of very smart people who are all trying to make ambitious strides. It is clear how great everyone is at what they do, so I am humbled to be included in this group.</p> Fun Facts <p>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?: I like to play basketball, walk through NYC, spend time with friends, go to comedy shows, surf when I can, and take singing classes, which have been such a fun part of living in New York.</p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: I would be a maple tree. I used to make furniture, and I always loved using maple. The color and grain are so pretty and clean, and it gives very clean, Nordic and Japanese vibes</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p>Want to work with us?

<p></p> 
<p>Identity verification has traditionally played an important but limited role in the world of identity and access management (IAM). To establish someone’s identity, you need to prove that they are who they say they are, linking&nbsp; their digital identity to their real-world identity. For employees, this verification typically occurs during onboarding; for customers, it happens when they open a new account. Once validated, they receive credentials, are granted appropriate authorizations, and enter the vast identity access flow universe — with identity verification rarely called upon again.</p>  
<p>This system is fundamentally flawed.</p> 
<p>Help desk social engineering, synthetic identities and AI-powered attacks are exploiting inadequate identity verification systems to completely circumvent IAM security. The $100 million attack on <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">MGM resorts</a> occurred when attackers impersonated an employee, convinced the IT help desk to reset credentials, and then escalated privileges until gaining control of the entire system. Just a few months later, a finance worker at a multinational firm was tricked into wiring out $25 million when cybercriminals posed as senior executives using video and audio deepfakes. In fact, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/2024-state-of-passwordless-identity-assurance-report-recap">78% of organizations</a> were targeted by identity-related attacks last year.</p> 
 Unmasking Social Deception  
<p>The industry urgently needs to evolve its approach to combat these modern threats. Multi-factor verification (MFV) offers the answer. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-have-entered-era-multi-factor-verification-mfv-susan-morrow-1ibse/">A recent article</a> by Susan Morrow makes the case&nbsp; eloquently — I highly recommend the read. Multi-factor verification moves beyond relying on authentication as the primary gatekeeper, making identity verification that uses multiple verification factors and risk assessment, an intrinsic part of daily access flows.</p> 
<p>This transformation is the next step in identity security maturation, similar to authentication’s progression from passwords, to multi-factor authentication, to phishing-resistant MFA and passkeys. Authentication had to adapt to combat escalating phishing and password-related attacks. Multi-factor verification is essential to stem the onslaught of sophisticated social engineering threats.</p> 
<p></p>

 The Current State of Authentication vs. Verification  
<p>To understand what makes multi-factor verification such a powerful tool, it’s helpful to go back to IAM basics.</p> 
 What Is Authentication?  
<p>In the digital world, authentication is the process of confirming the identity of a user before allowing them to access a device or account. Note that I say user, not person, because that’s what they are in this process — a user in the system. Common authentication factors are something the user knows (like a password), something the user owns (like a mobile phone or hardware security key) or something the user is (biometric data like a fingerprint). Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requires two or more factors from different categories to confirm identity.</p> 
 What Is Identity Verification?  
<p>Also referred to as identity proofing, identity verification makes sure a person is who they claim to be, and that the identity is genuine. Verification can be done in person or digitally, using various methods, depending on the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">level of identity assurance</a> required. Methods include location checks, comparing user-supplied person information against official databases, examining government issue documents, matching a selfie against an official ID and personal interactions, among others.</p> 
 Authentication vs. Verification  
<p>In a nutshell, verification involves establishing a legitimate, proven user identity in a system. Authentication is about keeping unauthorized users out of the system.</p> 
 What Is Multi-Factor Verification (MFV)?  
<p>Today, access to an organization’s systems and resources is primarily controlled by the authentication process. Yes, there are variations and layers — adaptive authentication, risk-based authentication, access controls like RBAC and PAM — but essentially the act of providing the right combination of credentials gets you through the door. Multi-factor verification (MFV) brings deeper identity verification checks and risk assessment into this daily access process.</p> 
<p>Multi-factor verification integrates multiple verification factors dynamically and contextually throughout the user session. This approach combines continuous verification with authentication mechanisms so that you are not just validating the user, you are validating the human.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Multi-factor authentication vs. multi-factor verification</p> 
 How MFV Works  
<p>Today, comprehensive identity verification checks are generally performed only at specific points in time, such as when opening a new account or beginning a job. At other critical moments, such as resetting a credential or registering a new phone, most organizations rely on knowledge-based answers or calling the helpdesk, which are notoriously vulnerable to social engineering.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Anatomy of the Help Desk Social Engineering Attack on MGM Resorts</p> 
<p>By contrast, MFV continuously verifies the person's identity based on a combination of factors such as behavior, context, and biometrics. This dynamic verification adapts in response to behavior anomalies, device telemetry, environment and other risk signals, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit. By integrating these factors in real-time, MFV offers a secure, fast and less intrusive verification process.</p> 
 Benefits of Multi-Factor Verification  
<p>Nearly 4 in 10 organizations name identity verification as a top identity security challenge. MFV addresses their pain points on multiple fronts.</p> 
<p>Stop Social Engineering and other Identity Threats: &nbsp;Last year saw a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">71% increase in attacks abusing valid accounts</a>. MFV's continuous verification significantly reduces the risk of ATO, session hijacking and other attacks. By continuously adapting to the user's behavior and context, multi-factor verification provides greater resistance to sophisticated threats, ensuring that only legitimate users can maintain access.</p> 
<p>Improved User Experience: Most organizations struggle with real-time verification, spending more than <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/report-recap-workplace-identity-security-trends-in-2024">two hours verifying identity</a> during employee onboarding, when replacing a device, recovering an account or during other high-risk scenarios. MFV provides a seamless and less intrusive verification process, with basic checks conducted behind the scenes. Additional forms of proof are only required at times of increased risk, creating a smoother and more personalized experience.</p> 
<p>Scalability and Flexibility: MFV is easily adaptable to different industries and use cases. Its flexibility allows integration with existing identity stacks, making it a scalable solution for organizations of all sizes.</p> 
 How HYPR Uses Multi-Factor Verification  
<p>Multi-factor verification is core to HYPR’s Identity Assurance Platform. The HYPR Platform unifies&nbsp; phishing-resistant passwordless authentication, adaptive risk mitigation and automated identity verification into a seamless, user-centric access flow. Organizations can easily choose and configure the identity verification processes that suit their environment and use cases. For example, secure self-service options at times of low risk, with additional steps such as live video chat in higher risk scenarios or when security anomalies are detected. They can also enforce a range of phishing-resistant authenticators including device-bound <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">Enterprise Passkeys</a>, hardware keys and smart cards.</p> 
<p>Example Multi-Factor Verification Flow With HYPR</p> 
 Toward Identity-Centric Security With MFV  
<p>Organizations worldwide have an identity problem. The vast majority of breaches today are related to identity issue. As Gartner’s Cybersecurity Chief of Research, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4v4cA6OG14g3GSZF0Ld4d8">Mary Ruddy, pointed out</a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4v4cA6OG14g3GSZF0Ld4d8?si=28033054b3824035">,</a> “Digital security is reliant on identity whether we want it to be or not. In a world where users can be anywhere and applications are increasingly distributed across datacenters in the multi-cloud, identity IS the control plane.</p> 
<p>Current access processes are no match against attackers’ nimble and incessant tactics. Initiatives like FIDO’s recently announced <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/">identity verification certification</a> program bring critical advancement, but are just part of the answer. Multi-Factor Verification (MFV) marks a major leap forward in identity security, offering stronger protection and a better user experience. As organizations plan to build a more identity-centric security approach, it’s imperative they include MFV in their identity security protocols. Emerging technologies like decentralized identity systems hold promise for even more secure and efficient verification methods. Continuous innovation will drive MFV’s evolution, ensuring it remains a strong defense against emerging threats.</p>

Italian authorities confiscated nearly €900,000 worth of fake extra virgin olive oil – that’s about 42 ton – highlighting the pervasive issue of olive oil fraud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some of the 42 tons of oil was already packaged ready for sale. Authorities confiscated 71 tons of what was referred to as an “oily substance” in plastic tanks, as well as 623 liters of chlorophyll, a component of extra virgin olive oil that was being added to oil of a lesser value.</p>
<p>They found packaging equipment, labels purporting that the oil was “extra virgin” when it was clearly not, and commercial documentation including 1,145 customs excise duty stamps that are being studied for forgery, the statement said.<br>
– Barbie Nadeau – CNN”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This fraudulent activity not only undermines consumer trust but also poses serious health risks. UNISOT’s Asset Traceability Platform can play a crucial role in preventing such fraudulent activities.</p>

<p>“AgriOnChain’s innovative traceability solutions have enabled me to share the story of my premium Italian olive oil with the world. With Digital Product Passports and Smart QR-codes, I can highlight the authenticity, quality, and sustainability of my products to customers everywhere. Through this partnership, I have not only expanded my market reach but also deepened the connection with my customers, creating a community that values the traditions and principles I hold dear. UNISOT’s AgriOnChain technology empowers me to focus on what I do best – producing exceptional olive oil – while they handle the technology seamlessly behind the scenes.” – Francesco Pepe, Az. Agricola Francesco Pepe</p>
</blockquote>
               How UNISOT’s Asset Traceability Platform can help   <p>COMPREHENSIVE TRACEABILITY</p>
<p>UNISOT’s Platform ensures complete traceability of olive oil from the grove to the consumer. Every step of the production process, including harvesting, pressing and bottling, is securely recorded, digitally signed and timestamped on the blockchain. This transparency ensures that every bottle of olive oil is traceable back to its origin, making it extremely difficult for counterfeit products to infiltrate the supply chain.</p>
<p>PRODUCT AUTHENTICATION</p>
<p>Utilizing unique digital identities and QR codes, UNISOT allows consumers to verify the authenticity of Agricola Francesco Pepe’s olive oil instantly. By scanning the QR code on the bottle, consumers can access detailed information about the product’s origin, production process and quality certifications.</p>
<p>SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRITY</p>
<p>Our platform enhances the integrity of the supply chain by enabling real-time monitoring and alerts for any anomalies. This capability helps in early detection of potential fraud and ensures that only high-quality olive oil reaches the market.</p>
<p>CONSUMER CONFIDENCE</p>
<p>With increasing incidents of food fraud, consumer trust is paramount. AgriOnChain not only protects the reputation of premium producers like Agricola Francesco Pepe but also assures consumers of the product’s authenticity and superior quality. This trust is vital for sustaining and growing market share in a highly competitive industry.</p>
<p>COMBATING DOCUMENTATION FRAUD</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring product authenticity, AgriOnChain can also help prevent fraud related to commercial documentation. The recent case involving 1,145 customs excise duty stamps suspected of forgery underscores the need for secure and verifiable documentation. By leveraging UNISOT’s <a href="https://unisot.com/sdc-secure-document-collaboration/">Secure Document Collaboration</a> solution, every document related to the production, distribution and sale of olive oil can be securely recorded and verified. This reduces the risk of forgery and ensures that all commercial documents, including excise duty stamps, are legitimate and traceable.</p>
            <p>The recent olive oil fraud cases underscore the urgent need for effective measures to safeguard the authenticity of olive oil. UNISOT’s <a href="https://unisot.com/truth-transparency-trust-and-olive-oil/">AgriOnChain</a> provides a comprehensive solution to combat fraud, enhance traceability and build consumer trust. As we continue to support high-quality producers like Francesco Pepe, we are committed to ensuring that consumers receive genuine, high-quality olive oil.</p>
<p>We can turn the tide against olive oil fraud and ensure a future where consumers can enjoy genuine, high-quality olive oil with confidence. For more information on how UNISOT can help protect your olive oil brand, visit our website or contact our sales team.</p>

<p>Elliptic has conducted <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/resources/ai-enabled-crime-in-the-cryptoasset-ecosystem">separate research</a> into deepfakes and their role in the crypto romance scams that such groups are notorious for facilitating. The good news is that, despite their experimentation with AI, the actual use thereof currently appears to be low. Elliptic has not identified the use of AI tools to enhance on-chain obfuscation of pig butchering proceeds, although there is a small but growing indication of AI-generated content being used to initiate these scams.</p>

<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>For those who missed the AMA on July 15th with Nick Lambert (CEO) and Elina Cadouri (COO), here are the key highlights:</p><p>1. Nick and Elina expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the community for their support, especially during the recent challenges with the Binance delisting. They emphasized how much the community's loyalty means to them.</p><p>2. Binance Delisting: What happened with the Binance delisting?</p>  DOCK was delisted from Binance without any prior warnings and only 7 days after being added to the Monitoring List.  Even though Binance did not provide one specific reason for adding DOCK to the Monitoring List, the team believes it could have been due to trading volume or liquidity given that all of the other reasons do not apply to the project. Dock had already been in the process of hiring a&nbsp; Market Maker to improve the liquidity aspect who began working on this immediately. But Binance, without warning, delisted DOCK after only a week whereas projects are typically given months or even a year to work on removing the monitoring tag  Despite this setback, the fundamentals of DOCK remain strong, and the team is committed to moving forward.  <p>3. How is the team ensuring the stability and growth of the project?</p>  We increased validator rewards to support and encourage network stability.  Engaged a regulated Market Maker to ensure liquidity for the DOCK token.  We are exploring additional exchange listings to broaden DOCK’s availability and reach.  Dock’s platform currently serves enterprise clients and client acquisition remains a top priority.  <p>4. Strategy and Goals: What are the main goals and strategies for the next year?</p>  Continuing to execute the published roadmap with exciting new developments.  Filed a patent for "Verifier Pay Issuer", a feature that enables issuers to charge for the verification of a credential, showcasing DOCK’s innovative approach to decentralized identity.  Several partnership announcements are anticipated, which will drive adoption and demand for the DOCK token.  <p>5. Community: How can the community help support DOCK?</p>  Community members can share and amplify DOCK’s social media content to create awareness.  It is important to keep positive engagement and constructive feedback.  Dock remains transparent and accessible for any concerns or questions from the community.  <p>6. Roadmap for 2024: What can we look forward to in the second half of 2024?</p>  Dock will develop the ability to verify eIDAS 2.0 and mDL credentials, launch a Cloud Wallet Beta, integrate Biometric-bound credentials, launch an Embeddable Wallet SDK, and roll out support for the OpenID4VC standard.  <p>7. Adoption and Token Demand: Why is client acquisition important for DOCK?</p>  Every transaction on the DOCK network uses DOCK tokens, driving demand as more companies adopt the technology.  DOCK is working to ensure that even companies without technical expertise can easily integrate and benefit from their innovative solutions.  <p>8. Audience questions: Are team members personally invested in DOCK?</p>  Yes, several team members hold DOCK in their personal portfolios and has received tokens as part of their compensation.  <p>9. When will DOCK Wallet staking be available?</p>  DOCK Wallet staking will be launched soon, with ongoing efforts to integrate with Nova Wallet.  <p>10. Is there a chance of being relisted on Binance?</p>  The likelihood of being relisted on Binance is low. The team is focusing on other growth opportunities and new exchange listings.  <p>Thank you all for your continued support. We are excited about the future and look forward to sharing more updates soon!</p><p>You can watch the entire AMA here: <a href="https://youtu.be/mfn6jVKaN60?ref=blog.dock.io">https://youtu.be/mfn6jVKaN60</a></p>

 We sit down with the Director of Strategic Solutions at Cifas – the UK’s largest not-for-profit fraud prevention service – to discuss what changes the company would make to the UK’s fraud strategy, the importance of a whole-of-system solution to a whole-of-system problem and much more. 



 



 Beginning on a personal note, you seemed to have spent most of your career in fraud prevention in some capacity. What was it that first attracted you to the industry?&nbsp; 



<p>What attracted me to the fraud prevention community initially was the rewarding nature of keeping people safe and, more importantly, trying to stay one step ahead of an adversary that has no moral boundaries. Feeling like you have really made a difference to people’s lives at the end of each working day is what gets me out of bed in the mornings too.&nbsp;</p>



 Perhaps a good place to get into this is with the UK’s fraud strategy, released in 2023. Do you think the earmarked £100 million and 400 new specialist fraud officers is enough to help reduce fraud by 10% by 2025? How likely do you think it will be to achieve?&nbsp; 



<p>Fraud represents almost 40% of all crime in England and Wales and has more than doubled in Scotland over the past nine years. It’s the most prevalent crime in the UK that devastates individuals financially and emotionally, damages business reputations, and targets the public purse meaning wider communities miss out on critical resources and support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the publication of the government’s Fraud Strategy in 2023 was a positive first step, we must do more to turn the tide on the fraud epidemic sweeping the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want a future without fraud so welcome the additional investment and extra resources. However, we also recognize we can’t arrest our way out of the problem. The focus needs to be on prevention – that means clear focus on intelligence-led responses that go beyond traditional policing and builds on the premise of organizations working together.&nbsp;</p>



 What would you say are the most common forms of fraud (e.g. money mules, social engineering fraud) in the UK?&nbsp; 



<p>The latest data recorded by our 750-plus membership to the Cifas National Fraud Database (NFD) revealed that account takeover – where a criminal utilizes compromised personal data to hijack an existing account or product – rose by 13% in 2023 compared to 2022. Additionally, we saw a 5% increase in account abuse (often referred to as ‘misuse of facility’). Identity fraud also remained our most dominant case type, accounting for 64% of all 374,000-plus NFD cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Filings to the Cifas Insider Threat Database continued to increase and was up 14% in 2023 compared to the year before. Just under half of these (49%) related to dishonest action by employees.</p>

 On May 15, Cifas delivered its ‘Fraud Pledges 2024’ to Number 10 Downing Street. What areas of the government’s approach to tackling fraud do you think need to be improved? What was the reaction and have any next steps been agreed?&nbsp; 



<p>As our <a href="https://www.cifas.org.uk/insight/public-affairs-policy">Cifas Fraud Pledges</a> make clear, there is no silver bullet for tackling fraud. It is a whole-of-system problem requiring a whole-of-system solution. However, we think a good starting point for the next government would be to appoint a Minister for Economic Crime to drive proper cross-system leadership on this issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond this, it is essential we invest properly in fraud policing and the criminal justice response as well as harness the capabilities of the private sector, through enhanced data-sharing, to disrupt fraud and financial crime and act as the first line of defense.&nbsp;</p>



 Cifas is advocating for social media companies to collaborate more to combat fraud. As social media fraud is such a huge arena, spanning almost every platform, from job search platforms to dating platforms, which parties do you think should be collaborating? And, as many platforms offer a very light-touch identity verification process, how important is it to ensure all users are required to undergo a thorough customer onboarding process?&nbsp; 



<p>No one sector can single-handedly tackle fraud. It is an issue which cuts through industries and across the public and private sectors. The only way we can tackle the problem is by breaking down cross-sector barriers, finding meaningful ways to collaborate, and sharing data and intelligence to ensure there is no weak link in the chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, it is essential that the biggest online platforms and services most abused by criminals join the counter-fraud community and multi-sector data-sharing initiatives, and including where appropriate, to ensure robust customer screening.&nbsp;</p>



 With most fraud in the UK happening online, across every medium and industry, how can people and companies best protect themselves?&nbsp; 



<p>At Cifas, our whole purpose is to eradicate fraud in the UK. To do so, we must build products and services that help organizations, and their customers fight economic crime and protect themselves against fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re rolling out several preventative solutions to help businesses scale their counter-fraud efforts and keep people safe. One currently being developed is a consumer-based app that proactively protects consumers from identity fraud and puts them in complete control of their personal information, effectively making stolen data worthless. It’s in beta testing and on track to launch in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More generally, people and companies must work collaboratively to gain maximum protection against the threats of fraud because criminals will always find new ways to exploit weaknesses, particularly when they’re able to hide in relative anonymity online. We would always urge individuals and companies to stay vigilant and think if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>



 What dangers does AI pose to UK’s fraud landscape? What steps can business, government and the local public take to weather the storm?&nbsp; 



<p>Technology and AI are going to be critical in how we deal with the threat posed by criminals’ use of AI and other technologies – it presents both opportunities and challenges to the UK’s fraud landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, criminals exploit weaknesses and rely on panic and urgency to get personal information and/or financial details. Both businesses and consumers should take a moment and challenge where a piece of communication has come from. Where possible, getting a second opinion is incredibly important and if something doesn’t look right, report it at the earliest opportunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, eradicating fraud is not down to one individual, industry, the government or law enforcement – it’s a collective effort. Our mission at Cifas is to create the largest counter-fraud community that shares data, intelligence and knowledge – all of which can be used to create products and services that protect everyone. To do so, we want to be a central component of a new and more effective UK-wide, data-sharing architecture that unlocks cross-sector collaboration across the public, private and law enforcement domains.&nbsp;</p>



 How have fraud attacks changed over the last 20 years and how do you envision it changing in the next 20?&nbsp; 



<p>Today, you no longer need a complex piece of malware to trick a consumer into handing over key personal data. All that’s required is a mobile phone, a few vague details about an individual and some social engineering for an attack to be successful time and time again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I feel that fraud will evolve with AI over the next 20 years in such that the AI component, whatever that may be, will automate a lot of the attack vectors we see today and make them even more scalable and lucrative for criminals to execute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, it comes back to cross-sector collaboration – if we create the right data flows, safeguards, and frameworks to share real-time risk data, we can defeat fraud.</p>

				  The ability to seamlessly share and trust information is the key to a new era of safe, secure travel.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>Technology transformations start slowly and then seem to go so fast that they rapidly become just how things are done almost without noticing. When friction dissipates, we rapidly cross into a new normal. This is the case with decentralized identity. For years, people talked about what could be done with the technology, now companies are implementing it to drive digital transformation, with <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-and-indicio-announce-a-co-innovation-agreement-to-accelerate-the-development-of-digital-identities/">air travel leading the way</a>.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks, our partner <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a> — the world’s leading specialist in air transport communications and information technology — will explain how decentralized identity is driving this transformation in digital travel, from border crossing to passenger loyalty programs to baggage and beyond.</p>
<p>Here, I’d like to give a brief overview of the technology. Most people have no idea what decentralized identity means let alone what it can do and why it will transform how we share data, prove our identities, enable privacy, do business, and — of course —&nbsp;travel.</p>
<p>Much like our physical landscape of roads, rail lines and rivers, we connect, digitally, through an infrastructure of APIs, databases, emails, SMS, and webpages. To share information, we need a way to travel from one point to another and an identity, like a passport, to prove who we are when we get there.</p>
<p>But our digital journeys are filled with friction and danger. Digital identity is easily faked, passwords are guessed, access credentials are stolen, databases are plundered, connections between disparate systems are complex and costly to create, you can’t be sure that information hasn’t been altered, and you don’t know who is tracking you or what they’re doing with your information. Security solutions like multifactor authentication and privacy solutions like GDPR just add more complexity, cost, and friction — and they don’t actually solve the underlying problems.</p>
<p>Our current system relies on checking in with a source to establish proof of identity or the veracity of data. You have multiple digital identities held as accounts accessed and verified by logins and passwords: multiple accounts for airlines, booking sites, hotels, event ticketing —&nbsp;in addition to employment, school, social services, utilities, ecommerce, and social media. The assumption is that when you need to use these services, you can prove you created your account. Sometimes, you can use one account for several services (as in social media logins), but all these accounts store personal data about you, making identity theft and fraud a constant risk and making data tracking a challenging privacy issue.</p>
<p>What if we could declutter this mess without having to rip it up and start over? What if we could take our digital landscape of roads and borders and identities and streamline it so that we can go from anywhere to anywhere — any system to any system — and prove that we are who we say we are and that the data we present hasn’t been altered?</p>
<p>This is what decentralized identity does.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity uses decentralized identifiers — a new global standard for identity — cryptography, and verifiable digital credentials to prove that you and only you are at one end of a secure communication and that the person or organization or device at the other end — your airline, bank, hotel, — can only be who they claim to be. A verifiable credential is like a digital container that can seal any kind of digital information. You always know the source of the container. You can’t alter the contents of the container without breaking the seal. If you trust the source of the container, you can trust the contents.</p>
<p>In practice, this means no more logins, passwords, third-party identity providers, multifactor authentication, or direct integrations. It means we can hold and share our data in a secure, consent-based way to anyone or any system with the software to verify it. It means our mobile devices can have the functionality of APIs but with a significantly better security profile.</p>
<p>Removing the key sources of data insecurity and identity fraud —&nbsp;centralized databases, user accounts and passwords— makes it a game changer. But there’s a bigger picture: The more easily information can be shared and the more it can be trusted, the faster and more efficient market decisions can be. This decluttering is a significant cost and time saver. Once information is issued in a verifiable format, it can be confidently reused over and over again.</p>
<p>At a certain point in this digital transformation, the combination of decreased friction and increased speed and scale will spark innovation. Think about how the telegraph went in a few decades from wiring messages over a few miles to enabling rail networks, expanding markets, and to wiring money.</p>
<p>This is the rapidly changing landscape we’re seeing as decentralized identity accelerates. <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-and-aruba-demonstrate-how-physical-passports-can-be-held-as-a-digital-identity-on-your-mobile-device/">Companies like SITA</a> see how a digital identity that can be trusted by governments everywhere can be used in myriad ways to simplify operations for airlines, airports, and passengers. As the technology can be easily integrated with any existing system, there’s no need for costly infrastructure upgrades. And, because data authentication, sharing, and consent is now technically easy, airlines and airports can integrate new partners to provide new services to passengers.</p>
<p>Because the technology frees airlines and airports from having to store and manage huge amounts of passenger personal data, it also makes compliance with emerging data protection and privacy policies like eIDAS, GDPR, CCPA, vastly simpler: companies don’t have to hold people’s personal data for verification. There is a genuine mechanism for people to consent to share their data.</p>
<p>We also see decentralized identity as essential to the successful deployment of AI (combating deepfakes) and, in the longer term, something that will have just as much, if not more, impact. This is because the ability to instantly and seamlessly trust identity and data simplifies markets and allows for much more complex interactions at minimal cost. Whenever, in history, people can trust each other to share information that can be trusted, we see rapid innovation and increasing prosperity.</p>
<p>In an age of fragmentation, mistrust, fraud, and friction, decentralized identity is both the solution we knew we urgently needed and the path to opportunities. Some of those opportunities are quickly coming into view: seamless digital travel will reshape the air travel, the tourist sector, and passenger experience, as SITA will explain.</p>
<p>But behind the absence of friction, the simplicity of authentication, the capacity to consent, and the respect for privacy, there’s a transformation in the way our data and our identities move, connect, and interact across digital infrastructure. That’s the hidden travel story, and it will change everything.</p>

<p>This week in the Boston Globe, Mike Orcutt writes about how old arguments over coding as free speech are being revisited.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/11/opinion/code-is-speech-tornado-cash/?s_campaign=8315">A First Amendment fight for the future of the internet: </a>Is computer code a form of speech? A case emerging from the wreckage of a cryptocurrency heist is putting that question to the test.</p>
<p>“[For] nearly three decades US courts have recognized software code as protected speech”,</p>
<p>The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">crypto wars</a>” were raging in 1995 when I started in <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/library/pki/">PKI</a> (and “crypto” didn’t mean cryptocurrency at that time!).</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/about/">Bruce Schneier</a> first published his classic textbook “<a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/applied-cryptography/">Applied Cryptography</a>” in 1993, he was prohibited from including a floppy disk containing executable encryption programs. But the First Amendment enabled him to include the C code for the algorithms as appendices in the printed work. As a middle finger to the NSA, the publishers included extra indicia marks to make the pages easier for OCR.</p>
<p>The court ruling that printed human readable code could be distributed but executables could not became known as the “Terrorists Can’t Type” interpretation.</p>
<p>I can see the free speech nuance.</p>
<p>Some high-level programming is highly creative. There can be non-obvious ways to write a program; recursive solutions can be quite sublime for their elegance and the strange intuition needed to draft them. I suspect there might be an infinite number of possible programs to implement most given specifications, so it’s certainly plausible to see programming as a form of expression. [I’m using “program” here to mean code written in a high-level language such as Python, C++ or Lisp].</p>
<p>But OTOH at the machine level, code is literally just a matter of throwing switches. Compiled software in memory connected to a processor looks a lot like a machine; indeed, at that level, there is little or no difference between programmed and wired logic.</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer but as I understand the right to free speech, I am largely free to write a book that describes bomb making for example, but I may not be allowed to make the bomb. So there are differences between text (and thought) and action. We can regulate actions but not thoughts.</p>
<p>Similarly, maybe the action of throwing switches is not protected. That is, compiled machine code is not speech. It’s certainly not the sort of speech that humans freely produce!</p>
<p>Both books and high-level computer programs are capable of being translated into actions.</p>
<p>Books can be read in different ways; a book about making a bomb doesn’t necessarily lead to the bomb being made let alone used. But there is only one intended reader of a computer program — the computer. And it’s only going to read the program one way.</p>

<p>Like most other global regions, European countries have strict guidelines and compliance standards regulating the activities of banks and financial service providers. Specifically in today’s digital world, the European Union (EU) has been at the forefront of enacting cybersecurity and data privacy regulations, more so than the rest of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, regulatory bodies like the EBA, ESMA, ESRB, EIOPA, and the European Commission have supported, proposed, and implemented Identity-centric legislation. This legislation helps to protect consumers’ digital identities while securing financial transactions and ensuring fairness and transparency throughout the markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll provide an overview of identity-centric regulations impacting the finance industry in Europe and the regulatory bodies that influence and oversee their implementation.</p>

   I have thoughts on FedCM and the challenges of creating a good technical specification. It's not that easy! 
 The post FedCM: The Tightrope Walk of Developing a Specification appeared first on Spherical Cow Consulting. 
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist
   - todo/fix: check why summary can be nil/null
   note: content goes first; than try summary
 -->
<div class='wrap'>

<p>The <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">Federated Credential Management API</a> (FedCM), a specification currently under development through the W3C’s standardization process, was originally scoped to make sure federated authentication would still function in a world where third-party cookies didn’t exist. The problem statement as defined during a workshop in 2021 stated it this way:</p>



<blockquote><p>Non-transparent, uncontrollable tracking of users across the web needs to be addressed and prevented.<br>Many applications and services need to work through the browser to support SSO/federated login, and yet federated login and tracking tools use the same features and are indistinguishable from the browser’s perspective.</p></blockquote>



<p>One of the ongoing challenges, however, is that people who implement and design federated authentication services don’t think of those services just in terms of cookies. As soon as you start talking about federated authentication, those people also think about all the different web primitives like website redirects and long URLs.</p>



 Balancing a Specification: Focus vs Practicality 



<p>Let’s step back for a moment and think about creating a technical specification. If you ask me (and it’s my blog, so I get to say) a good specification is focused on a very specific problem. If you try to solve too many things in one spec, you’re going to limit innovation, miss important use cases, or create something too complicated to implement.</p>



<p>That said, if you don’t consider how a spec will actually be implemented, it probably won’t be of any practical use. Solving for one piece of the larger architecture without any idea as to how the other pieces will be treated is as bad as creating too broad a spec.</p>



<p>A spec can and should allow for extensions as people find new use cases that need a solution, or profiles that tighten the spec down where required. But at its core, the problem being solved should be clear and specific.</p>



<p>That’s the challenge facing FedCM right now: staying within the scope of a very specific problem when people are Very Concerned about what else will need to change to prevent non-transparent, uncontrollable tracking of users across the web.</p>



 The FedCM Specification 



<p>Coming back to FedCM, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">Federated Identity Community Group</a> in the W3C just published a <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/2024/07/12/navigating-federated-authentication-the-scope-of-fedcm/">blog post</a> that talked about some of the problems FedCM doesn’t solve. (Full disclosure: I held the pen on that post as one of the co-chairs, with input from several members of the group.) FedCM originated from the need to preserve the functionality of third-party cookies when used in a federated authentication scenario. But there are more web primitives than cookies used for federated authentication. Should the specification consider those as well? Is it worth implementing at all if it doesn’t solve (or at least offer some direction) on how to handle the other web primitives (like redirects) that are also used for tracking on the web?</p>



<p>I think it comes down to a subtle lack of alignment and/or understanding of the problem being solved. Is FedCM supposed to solve for the deprecation of third-party cookies or is it supposed to solve for tracking across the web? When we first started, it was clearly just solving for the third-party cookie problem. Over time, however, there is confusion even within the groups working on the spec whether they are aiming for the larger problem.</p>



 Implementation Decisions 



<p>So, what are implementers to do? They could implement the specification (which, to be clear, is NOT a standard and does NOT have consensus yet in the groups working on it) to get ahead of what the browser vendors are doing, but have to deal with breaking changes as the spec evolves. They could wait and suddenly find out that their federated authentication infrastructure is breaking because they missed the latest changes as the specification gets closer to standardization.</p>



 Adapting to an Evolving Web 



<p>If there was an easy answer, we wouldn’t be talking about standards and tech. There are too many competing use cases, threat models, business considerations, and architectures to take into consideration. My only advice is to get involved in the standards process if you can or pay attention to developer sites (like <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fedcm-developer-newsletter">this one</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/">this one</a>) and the people involved. The way the Internet and the web works is always evolving; designing your business or service to adapt to change is the only way to be successful.</p>



<p>I want to help you go from overwhelmed at the rapid pace of change in identity-related standards to prepared to strategically invest in the critical standards for your business.

  <p>Today, we <a href="https://aka.ms/ZeroTrustBlog-July2024">announced</a> the general availability of the Microsoft Entra Suite which brings together identity and network access controls to secure access to any cloud or on-premises application or resource from any location. It consistently enforces least privilege access to achieve your governance requirements while improving your employee experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies today have good reason to focus on security. On one hand, we’re reaping the advantages of increased scalability, efficiency, and cost reductions, including all the benefits gained from generative AI’s large language models. However, these advantages also make it possible for malicious actors to exploit advanced technologies to create malware, target network vulnerabilities, and generate phishing attacks that put organizations’ data and reputations at higher risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When identity and network access solutions operate in isolation and not in tandem, they can lead to increased complexity, inconsistent policies, and a lack of unified context across standalone solutions. This can unintentionally result in a fragmented security posture and vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit, potentially disrupting business continuity and compromising the user experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither identity nor network security controls alone can protect all your access scenarios, highlighting the need for you to adopt a holistic strategy to counteract evolving threats and protect your critical assets—no matter where the users and resources are located.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The case for unified security: A strategic imperative 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the Microsoft Entra Suite general availability, we also <a href="https://aka.ms/ZeroTrustBlog-July2024">announced</a> Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution general availability, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a>. These two products coupled with our SaaS security-focused CASB—<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-cloud-apps">Microsoft Defender for Cloud apps</a>—comprise Microsoft's Security Service Edge solution, a cloud-delivered, identity-centric networking model that transforms the way you secure access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s SSE solution is all about helping you eliminate security gaps in your defenses, extending Conditional Access and continuous access evaluation to all your applications and resources, whether they’re on-premises or in any cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Secure access to any app or resource, from anywhere, with an identity-centric Security Service Edge (SSE) solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, in more detail, are the key advantages of Microsoft’s SSE solution to your organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eliminate security loopholes caused by identity and network access silos</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s SSE Solution ensures that your <a href="https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/article/microsoft-security/Time-to-Break-the-Silos-Between-Identity-and-Network-Security">identity and network access solutions work together</a>. By unifying these separate elements, your security teams can bolster your organization’s security stance in the face of emerging threats. No more deciding which tool works for each app or how to bridge the policies your identity and network teams created. Now you can secure access with an easy-to-manage, unified, identity-centric approach to any application, resource, or destination—and not sacrifice user productivity due to complex, disjointed security controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simplify access and improve end user experience at a global scale</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s SSE solution is delivered from one of the largest global private networks: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft’s Global Wide Area Network</a>. The network connects Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/">data centers</a> across 61 Azure regions with more than <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/global-network/#features">185 global network POPs</a> and a vast array of growing SSE edge locations strategically placed around the world. This helps you optimally connect your users and devices to public and private resources seamlessly and securely, improving performance and boosting productivity by offering your people a fast, consistent, hybrid work experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Activate side-by-side, flexible deployment options with other SSE and networking solutions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access and Microsoft Entra Internet Access can be deployed standalone or side-by-side with other SSE solutions. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/concept-clients">Global Secure Access client</a> allows control over network traffic at the user endpoint device, giving you the ability to route specific <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/concept-traffic-forwarding">traffic profiles</a> through Microsoft’s SSE solution. The client for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-windows-client">Windows</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-android-client?tabs=device-administrator">Android</a> operating systems are now in general availability, and for iOS and Mac operating systems, in public preview. With flexible deployment options, the Global Secure Access client could acquire traffic based on the traffic forwarding profiles you configure for Private Access, Internet Access, and Microsoft traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you can configure Private Access profiles anywhere you replace your third-party legacy VPNs—with an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution. You can also configure your Microsoft profile to enable improved performance for Microsoft applications, while you keep your private and internet traffic protected with the SSE solution of your choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A closer look at Microsoft Entra Private Access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access is an identity-centric ZTNA solution that helps you secure access to all private apps and resources for your users—located anywhere.

  <p>Today we <a href="https://aka.ms/ZeroTrustBlog-July2024">announced</a> the general availability of Microsoft Entra Suite - the industry’s most comprehensive secure access solution for the workforce. The Microsoft Entra Suite delivers the most comprehensive Zero Trust user access solution and enables organizations to converge access policy engine across identities, endpoints, and private and public networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Microsoft Entra Suite?&nbsp; 
<p>The Microsoft Entra Suite delivers a complete cloud-based solution for workforce access. It brings together identity and network access that secures employee access to any cloud or on-premises application and resource from any location, consistently enforces least privilege access, and improves the employee experience.​&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This new offering advances our vision for the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/05/31/secure-access-for-a-connected-worldmeet-microsoft-entra/">Microsoft Entra</a> product line that can serve as a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/08/how-implementing-a-trust-fabric-strengthens-identity-and-network/">universal trust fabric</a> for the era of AI, securely connecting any trustworthy identity with anything, from anywhere. In a recent blog post we also shared the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/06/04/the-four-stages-of-creating-a-trust-fabric-with-identity-and-network-security/">four stages</a> of creating such trust fabric for your organization, starting with foundational Zero Trust controls, and extending it to protecting access for your workforce, protecting access for your customers and partners, and protecting access in any cloud. The Microsoft Entra Suite delivers the complete toolset for the second stage of this journey – secure access for your workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra Suite includes the following products:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> – an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access that secures access to private apps and resources and reduces operational complexity and cost by replacing legacy VPNs.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a> – an identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG) for SaaS apps and internet traffic that protects against malicious internet traffic, unsafe or non-compliant content, and other threats from the open internet.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-governance">Microsoft Entra ID Governance</a> – a complete identity governance and administration solution that automates identity and access lifecycle to&nbsp;ensure that the right people have the right access to the right apps and services at the right time.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-protection">Microsoft Entra ID Protection</a> – an advanced identity solution that blocks identity compromise in real time using high-assurance authentication methods, automated risk and threat assessment, and adaptive access policies powered by advanced machine learning (also included in Microsoft Entra ID P2).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id">Microsoft Entra Verified ID</a> - a managed verifiable credentials service based on open standards that enables real-time identity verification in a secure and privacy respecting way. Included in the Microsoft Entra Suite are premium Verified ID capabilities, starting with Face Check.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra Suite enables you to:&nbsp; 
 
 Unify Conditional Access policies for identities and networks.&nbsp; 
 Ensure least privilege access for all users accessing all resources and apps.&nbsp; 
 Improve the user experience for both in-office and remote workers.&nbsp; 
 Reduce the complexity and cost of managing security tools from multiple vendors.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out the Microsoft Entra Suite introductory video below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unify Conditional Access policies for identities and networks&nbsp;</p>
<p>You only have to manage one set of policies in one portal to configure access controls for both identities and networks. Conditional Access evaluates any access request, no matter where it’s coming from, performing real-time risk assessment to strengthen protection against unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure least privilege access for all users accessing all resources and apps&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can automate the access lifecycle from the day a new employee joins your organization, through all their role changes, until the time of their exit. No matter how long or multifaceted an employee’s journey, Microsoft Entra ID Governance ensures that your employees have the right access to just the applications and resources they need, helping prevent an adversary’s lateral movement in case of a breach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Improve the user experience for both in-office and remote workers&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can ensure that employees enjoy a faster and easier onboarding experience, faster and more secure sign-in via passwordless authentication, single sign-on for all applications, and superior performance. Using a self-service portal, your employees can request access to relevant packages, manage approvals and access reviews, and view request and approval history. Face Check with Microsoft Entra Verified ID enables real-time verification of your employee's identity, which streamlines remote onboarding and self-service recovery of passwordless accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reduce the complexity and cost of managing security tools from multiple vendors&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since traditional on-premises security solutions don’t scale to the needs of modern cloud-first, AI-first environments, organizations are seeking ways to secure and manage their assets from the cloud. With the Microsoft Entra Suite, you can retire multiple on-premises security tools, such as traditional Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), on-premises Secure Web Gateways (SWGs), and on-premises identity governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Suite is currently priced at $12 per user per month. Microsoft Entra P1 is a licensing and technical prerequisite. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">Microsoft Entra Suite pricing page</a> for more detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, the cybersecurity world was rocked by another <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/snowflake-breach-exposes-165-customers.html">significant breach</a>, this time involving Snowflake, a major player in the data storage and analysis industry. The breach, orchestrated by the hacking group Shiny Hunters, exploited a weakness in customer account security, bypassing the need for a direct vulnerability within Snowflake’s platform itself.</p>
 What Happened? 
<p>The hackers managed to gain access by exploiting unencrypted usernames and passwords stored on a worker’s machine and in a project management tool called JIRA. These credentials were used to access several Snowflake customer accounts, including those of Ticketmaster and Santander. Shockingly, none of these accounts had multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled, making it easier for the hackers to infiltrate.</p>
 The Data Compromised 
 
 The breach resulted in the theft of extensive customer data: 
 Over 30 million bank account details, including 6 million account numbers and balances. 
 28 million credit card numbers. 
 Personally identifiable information about staff. 
 
<p>Other potential victims mentioned by the hackers include LendingTree and Advanced Auto Parts, indicating the broad scope of this data theft.</p>
 Lessons Learned 
 
 Enable MFA: This breach underscores the critical importance of multi-factor authentication. Despite its limitations, MFA adds a crucial layer of security that can deter many unauthorized access attempts. 
 Secure Third-Party Access: The initial compromise occurred through a third-party contracting firm, emphasizing the need for robust security measures extending beyond your organization. Ensure that all third parties adhere to stringent security protocols. 
 Encrypt Sensitive Data: Unencrypted usernames and passwords were a key vulnerability. Encrypting sensitive data can prevent it from being easily exploited if accessed. 
 Awareness and Training: Regularly train and remind employees about security best practices, such as the importance of not storing unencrypted sensitive information on personal devices or project management tools. 
 
 Looking Forward 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we continually strive to enhance security and protect our clients from such breaches. While no system can be completely immune, implementing comprehensive security measures, including MFA and strong data encryption, can significantly mitigate risks.</p>
<p>As we navigate through the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, staying informed and proactive is crucial. The Snowflake breach serves as a reminder of the continuous need for vigilance in protecting sensitive data.</p>

  <p>The established players have vast resources and tend to leverage their global footprint to deliver projects in the North American market. These vendors support all known service offerings and IAM technologies along with a vast network of strong partnership with leading technology vendors. However, large firms come with their own set of challenges.</p>
<p>Boutique firms, on the other hand, are focused on specialized offerings as per their capacity. They have limited resources but are agile for that same reason. These firms can be very quick off the line to understand the project scope and provide initial support. Despite having these advantages over big firms, the boutique firms have their own set of challenges. However, there are certain vendors in North America that have limited resources compared to big firms, but they are successfully managing millions of identities and supporting most of the major IAM technologies.</p>
<p>Nitish Deshpande, Research Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts will discuss the types of IAM systems integrators vendors in the north American market space. Additionally, Nitish will also address the role of systems integrators and some of their core capabilities. &nbsp;In his recent research, Nitish conducted a thorough analysis of the current vendor landscape and identifies industry leaders based on their commitment to innovation, market presence, and overall service capabilities.</p>

				  Biometrics are a powerful solution to identity authentication: but they also escalate the risks of data breaches into the realm of catastrophe: here’s how to solve the problem with decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>You can’t reset a person. That is, cosmetic surgery aside, you can’t reset the physically distinguishing and unique characteristics that make us who we are.</p>
<p>Which isn’t a problem, unless you create an identity system based on using these characteristics — aka biometrics — to authenticate access to high value information&nbsp; like bank accounts.</p>
<p>And, of course, that’s just what we’ve done. To address the inherent weaknesses of passwords, we’ve turned to deeper, probabilistically unique, identifiers like facial recognition, fingerprint scans, iris scans, and behavioral and vocal recognition.</p>
<p>In one important way, these are much better ways of authenticating access than passwords and pin codes simply because they are unique to the person seeking authentication. They provide confidence that a person is who they say they are in a way that passwords never could. They are also fast and approach the seamless interaction that people desire and systems require.</p>
<p>The way biometric data is stored should scare you</p>
<p>But in one critical respect,biometrics are much worse than passwords: they can’t be reset.</p>
<p>The way biometric data is used requires comparing a real-time scan of a particular biometric characteristic against stored data for that characteristic.</p>
<p>Therein lies the first of two problems: if the biometric data is stored in a centralized database, the risk of a data breach will never be zero. And if there is a data breach, it’s a privacy and security catastrophe. Fraudsters have access to your unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Now guess where biometric data are conventionally stored.</p>
<p>“Bring your own biometrics”</p>
<p>Verifiable credential technology provides a simple fix: it removes the need for centrally storing biometric data in order to facilitate authentication.</p>
<p>Instead, during onboarding, a person’s biometric data is captured by a relevant authority (e.g., a bank)&nbsp; in a biometric template. This biometric template is then issued as a verifiable credential, which the person holds in a digital wallet.</p>
<p>The credential is a unique cryptographic proof that their biometric data has been authenticated by the given authority. As the biometric data recorded in the template is digitally signed, any attempt to alter it will render the credential non-functional.</p>
<p>When the person performs a biometric scan, they also present their biometric template credential. Because of the way these presentations are made, only the person issued with the credential can present their credential. The biometric template in the credential is cryptographically verified as authentic and compared to the biometric scan.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>In this way, a person “brings their own biometrics” for authentication. The source of the credential is verified by the relying party —&nbsp;e.g., a bank can cryptographically verify that it had issued you and only you with this biometric credential, while digital signatures show that the biometric data has not been tampered with.</p>
<p>With no more than a couple of screen swipes, the problem of centralized biometric data disappears, and with it the nightmare of data privacy and protection and compliance.</p>
<p>In our next piece, we’ll look at the second problem with biometrics and authentication: how verifiable credentials can defend against the challenge of generative AI deepfakes.</p>

<p><br>In recent years, blockchain technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation with the potential to revolutionize various industries, particularly finance. One of the most promising applications of blockchain in the financial sector is asset tokenization. Asset tokenization refers to the process of representing ownership of real-world assets, such as real estate, stocks, bonds, or commodities, as digital tokens on a blockchain. This transformative approach not only enhances liquidity and accessibility but also introduces new opportunities for investment and innovation in global capital markets.</p>



<p>This post delves deep into the essence of asset tokenization, exploring its mechanisms, benefits, challenges, and future potential. By examining real-world examples and case studies, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how asset tokenization is reshaping the financial landscape and what it means for investors, institutions, and regulators.</p>



<p><br></p>



 Understanding Asset Tokenization 



 <br>What is Asset Tokenization? 



<p>Asset tokenization involves creating a digital representation of an asset on a blockchain. This process typically entails the issuance of digital tokens that represent ownership or a stake in the underlying asset. These tokens can be traded, transferred, and managed on blockchain platforms, enabling a more efficient and transparent way of handling assets.</p>



<p><br></p>



 How Does Asset Tokenization Work? 



<p>1. Identification of the Asset: The first step in asset tokenization is identifying the asset to be tokenized. This can include physical assets like real estate, precious metals, and artworks, as well as financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and derivatives.</p>



<p>2. Valuation and Structuring: Once the asset is identified, it is valued and structured for tokenization. This involves determining the total value of the asset and dividing it into smaller units or tokens. Each token represents a fraction of the total asset value.</p>



<p>3. Issuance of Tokens: The next step is issuing the tokens on a blockchain platform. These tokens are typically created using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.</p>



<p>4. Trading and Transfer: After issuance, the tokens can be traded and transferred on blockchain-based exchanges or platforms. This allows for seamless and instantaneous transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries and minimizing transaction costs.</p>



<p>5. Ownership and Governance: The ownership of the tokens is recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable record of all transactions. Token holders may also have certain governance rights, such as voting on decisions related to the underlying asset.<br></p>







 <br>Benefits of Asset Tokenization 



 <br>Increased Liquidity 



<p>One of the primary benefits of asset tokenization is increased liquidity. Traditional assets, such as real estate or fine art, are often illiquid, meaning they cannot be easily bought or sold without significantly impacting their price. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy and sell smaller portions of an asset. This fractionalization makes it easier to match buyers and sellers, enhancing market liquidity.</p>



 <br>Fractional Ownership and Accessibility 



<p>Tokenization democratizes access to high-value assets by enabling fractional ownership. Investors can purchase tokens representing a fraction of an asset, lowering the barrier to entry and allowing more individuals to participate in the market. This increased accessibility can attract a broader range of investors, including those who may not have the financial resources to acquire entire assets.</p>



 <br>Transparency and Security 



<p>Blockchain technology provides a transparent and immutable ledger of all transactions, enhancing trust and security in the market. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing a clear and verifiable record of ownership and transfer. This transparency reduces the risk of fraud and ensures that all parties have access to consistent and up-to-date information.</p>



 <br>Efficiency and Cost Reduction 



<p>By eliminating intermediaries and automating processes, asset tokenization can significantly reduce transaction costs and improve efficiency. Traditional asset transactions often involve multiple intermediaries, such as brokers, custodians, and clearinghouses, each adding costs and delays to the process. Tokenization streamlines these processes by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions and automated settlement through smart contracts.</p>



 <br>Enhanced Regulatory Compliance 



<p>Blockchain’s transparent and immutable ledger facilitates enhanced regulatory compliance. Regulators can have real-time access to transaction data, enabling better oversight and quicker response to suspicious activities. Additionally, blockchain can simplify the compliance process by providing a single source of truth for all transactions, reducing the costs and complexities associated with regulatory reporting.</p>



 <br><br>Applications of Asset Tokenization 



 <br>Real Estate 



<p>Real estate is one of the most promising sectors for asset tokenization. Traditional real estate investments often involve significant capital outlay and lengthy transaction processes. Tokenization enables fractional ownership of real estate properties, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares of properties and enhancing liquidity in the market.</p>



<p>For example, a real estate developer can tokenize a commercial property, issuing digital tokens that represent ownership shares. Investors can purchase these tokens, gaining exposure to the property and earning a share of the rental income. The tokens can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, allowing for seamless and instantaneous transactions.</p>



 <br>Art and Collectibles 



<p>The art and collectibles market is another sector that can benefit from asset tokenization. High-value artworks and collectibles are often illiquid, with few opportunities for investors to buy and sell shares. Tokenization enables fractional ownership of these assets, providing greater liquidity and accessibility.</p>



<p>For instance, a rare painting can be tokenized, with each token representing a fraction of the painting’s value. Investors can purchase tokens, gaining exposure to the artwork and participating in its potential appreciation. The tokens can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, allowing for greater flexibility and liquidity in the market.</p>



 <br>Stocks and Bonds 



<p>Tokenization can also be applied to traditional financial assets, such as stocks and bonds. By representing these assets as digital tokens on a blockchain, investors can benefit from increased liquidity, transparency, and efficiency.</p>



<p>For example, a company can issue digital tokens representing shares of its stock. Investors can purchase these tokens, gaining exposure to the company’s equity and participating in its potential growth. The tokens can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, enabling seamless and instantaneous transactions.</p>



<p>Similarly, bonds can be tokenized, with each token representing a fraction of the bond’s value. Investors can purchase tokens, earning interest payments and participating in the bond’s potential appreciation. The tokens can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, providing greater liquidity and flexibility in the market.</p>



 <br>Commodities 



<p>Commodities, such as gold, silver, and oil, can also be tokenized, providing greater liquidity and accessibility for investors. Tokenization enables fractional ownership of commodities, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares and participate in the market.</p>



<p>For instance, a gold producer can tokenize a portion of its gold reserves, issuing digital tokens that represent ownership shares. Investors can purchase these tokens, gaining exposure to the gold and participating in its potential appreciation. The tokens can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, allowing for seamless and instantaneous transactions.</p>



 <br>Future Outlook and Potential Developments 



 <br>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) 



<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging sector that leverages blockchain technology to create decentralized and open financial systems. DeFi platforms enable a wide range of financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, without the need for traditional intermediaries.</p>



<p>Asset tokenization plays a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem by enabling the creation of digital assets that can be seamlessly integrated into DeFi platforms. Tokenized assets can be used as collateral for loans, traded on decentralized exchanges, and integrated into various DeFi protocols, enhancing liquidity and accessibility in the financial system.</p>



 <br>Security Tokens and STOs 



<p>Security tokens and security token offerings (STOs) represent a new paradigm in fundraising and investment. Security tokens are digital representations of traditional securities, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, issued and traded on a blockchain. STOs provide a regulated and compliant framework for issuing and trading security tokens, combining the benefits of blockchain technology with the regulatory compliance of traditional securities.</p>



<p>The proliferation of security tokens and STOs has the potential to transform capital markets by enhancing liquidity, reducing transaction costs, and democratizing access to investment opportunities. As regulatory frameworks evolve and market participants embrace innovation, security tokens are poised to play a significant role in the future of finance.</p>



 <br>Integration with Emerging Technologies 



<p>Blockchain technology can be integrated with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data, to create innovative solutions for asset management and trading. For example, AI can be used to analyze blockchain data and identify patterns and trends, providing valuable insights for investment strategies. IoT devices can generate real-time data that can be recorded on a blockchain, enhancing transparency and traceability in supply chain finance.</p>



 <br>Global Adoption and Collaboration 



<p>The future of asset tokenization depends on global adoption and collaboration among market participants, regulators, and technology providers. Building a standardized and interoperable framework for asset tokenization requires international cooperation and alignment of regulatory and technical standards.</p>



<p>Collaborative efforts can drive innovation, reduce fragmentation, and ensure the seamless integration of tokenized assets into the global financial system. As more countries and institutions recognize the potential of asset tokenization, the financial landscape is poised for significant transformation.</p>



 <br>Conclusion 



<p>Asset tokenization represents a revolutionary shift in how assets are managed, traded, and owned. By leveraging blockchain technology, asset tokenization enhances liquidity, accessibility, transparency, and efficiency in global capital markets. This transformative approach democratizes access to high-value assets, reduces transaction costs, and provides new opportunities for investment and innovation.</p>



<p>While challenges remain, such as regulatory compliance, technical infrastructure, and market adoption, the potential benefits of asset tokenization are significant. Real-world examples and case studies demonstrate the viability and advantages of tokenization across various asset classes, including real estate, art, stocks, bonds, and commodities.</p>



<p>As technology continues to evolve and market participants embrace innovation, asset tokenization is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of finance. The journey towards widespread adoption is ongoing, and the future holds exciting possibilities for the financial industry.</p>



<p>In the long term, asset tokenization has the potential to fundamentally alter the structure and operation of capital markets. By providing a more transparent, efficient, and secure framework, tokenization can enhance market integrity, reduce systemic risks, and create new opportunities for growth and development. As we move forward, the financial industry must navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by this transformative technology.</p>

<p>The Virtual Asset User Protection Act began its legislative journey in July 2023 and is set to take effect on the 19th of this month. As interest in this new law grows, we will delve into the background, detailed provisions, impact on Metadium, and future challenges of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act.</p><p>What is the Virtual Asset User Protection Act?</p><p>The primary aim of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act is to safeguard the assets of virtual asset users and systematically regulate unfair trading practices to enhance the transparency and stability of the virtual asset market. Over the past few years, virtual assets, or cryptocurrencies, have experienced rapid growth, attracting a surge of investors. However, this growth has been accompanied by an increase in hacking, fraud, and other illegal activities in virtual asset exchanges, leading to significant investor losses. The Virtual Asset User Protection Act was introduced to address these issues and protect&nbsp;users.</p><p>Detailed Provisions of the&nbsp;Act</p>  Protection of Customer&nbsp;Assets  <p>One of the most notable aspects of the Act is the requirement for domestic virtual asset exchanges, wallets, and custodians registered with the financial authorities to separate and safeguard customer deposits. These deposits, which investors entrust to exchanges for coin purchases, must be held separately in a bank. This ensures that even in the event of an exchange’s bankruptcy or business closure, the deposits can be safely returned to the investors via the bank. It is important to note that virtual assets held by exchanges are not protected in the same manner as deposits. In the case of exchange bankruptcy, investors’ virtual assets may still be subject to creditor claims and potential losses.</p><p>2. Enhanced Security and Prohibition of Unfair Trading Practices</p><p>The Act also targets unfair trading practices, such as market manipulation. Exchanges must establish systems for continuously monitoring abnormal transactions and report any suspicious activities to the financial authorities. Should the Financial Supervisory Service confirm illegal activities during investigations, the exchanges could face criminal charges and&nbsp;fines.</p><p>3. Information Disclosure and Reporting Obligations</p><p>Virtual asset businesses are required to disclose key management information periodically and report suspicious transactions to the authorities regularly. Exchanges must build systems for continuous monitoring and report any abnormal transactions to the financial authorities. Confirmed illegal activities will lead to criminal prosecution and&nbsp;fines.</p><p>Future Challenges</p><p>While the Virtual Asset User Protection Act represents a significant step towards a healthy market development, several challenges remain.</p>  Strengthening International Cooperation  <p>Given that virtual asset transactions frequently cross borders, international cooperation is essential. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has announced plans to incorporate global standards into regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi) services, like Solana (SOL). Establishing and effectively enforcing regulations that align with global standards is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>2. Adapting to Technological Advancements</p><p>Virtual asset technology is rapidly evolving. Regulatory authorities must continuously update regulations to keep pace with technological advancements and flexibly respond to market&nbsp;changes.</p><p>3. Investor Education</p><p>Strengthening education programs to ensure investors properly understand virtual assets is vital. This will further enhance investor protection.</p><p>4. Continuous Monitoring</p><p>The dynamic nature of the virtual asset market necessitates ongoing monitoring. Regulatory authorities should regularly assess market conditions and take appropriate measures as&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Impact on Metadium: Positive or Negative?</p><p>Metadium is committed to diligently disclosing key information such as circulating supply, as mentioned in the Act, and is not involved in unfair trading practices or market manipulation. Therefore, it is likely to avoid immediate drastic impacts. However, implementing the Act is expected to reduce illegal or unfair activities, thereby enhancing the transparency and stability of the virtual asset market. This can positively contribute to the long-term value and growth of the Metadium Community.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The Virtual Asset User Protection Act, taking effect on July 19, will play a crucial role in enhancing the transparency and safety of the virtual asset market and protecting investors. Ultimately, the introduction of this legislation is expected to contribute to the healthy development of the virtual asset market. It is important to remain vigilant about ongoing trends and adapt to changes flexibly. As always, Metadium will strive to protect user assets and foster a healthy and stable market. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>가상자산이용자보호법 알아보기</p><p>가상자산이용자보호법이 2023년 7월부터 제정되기 시작해 이달 19일 부터 시행될 예정입니다. 이를 둘러싸고 많은 관심이 모아지고 있는데, 오늘은 가상자산이용자보호법의 도입 배경과 세부 내용, 메타디움에 미칠 영향, 그리고 앞으로의 과제에 대해 자세히&nbsp;살펴보겠습니다.</p><p>가상자산이용자보호법이란?</p><p>가상자산 이용자의 자산을 보호하고 불공정 거래행위를 체계적으로 규제하여, 가상자산 시장의 투명성과 안정성을 제고하는데 그 목적을 둡니다. 가상자산, 즉 암호화폐는 지난 몇 년간 급격한 성장을 이루었으며 이에 따라 투자자들도 폭발적으로 늘어났습니다. 그러나 이러한 성장과 함께 가상자산 거래소의 해킹, 사기 및 기타 불법행위도 함께 증가하면서 투자자들이 많은 피해를 입기도 했습니다. 이러한 문제를 해결하고 이용자들을 보호하고자 가상자산이용자보호법을 도입하게&nbsp;되었습니다.</p><p>시행령 세부&nbsp;내용</p>  고객 자산&nbsp;보호    가장 눈에 띄는 점 중 하나는 금융 당국에 신고한 국내 가상자산 거래소와 지갑 및 보관업체 등에 예치금 분리 보관 의무가 생긴다는 점입니다. 투자자가 코인 구매 등을 위해 거래소에 맡긴 예치금을 은행에 별도로 보관하고, 거래소 파산 또는 사업자 말소 시에도 은행을 통해 예치금을 안전하게 돌려받을 수 있습니다. <br>주의할 점은 거래소가 보관하는 투자자들의 가상자산은 예치금과 달리 거래소 파산 시 보호대상이 아니라는 점입니다. 코인의 경우 거래소 자체 재산과 분리해 보관해야 하는 의무만 질 뿐, 거래소가 문 닫으면 채권자의 압류 등으로 손실을 입을 수도&nbsp;있습니다.  <p>2. 보안 강화 및 불공정 거래 행위&nbsp;금지</p>  코인 시세 조종(Market Making) 등 불공정 거래 행위를 겨냥한 것도 특징입니다. 거래소는 앞으로 코인 이상거래를 상시 감시하는 시스템을 구축 하여 이상거래 발생시 금융 당국에 통보해야 합니다. 또한 금감원 조사에서 불법 혐의가 확인되면 검찰 수사 등을 거쳐 형사 처벌과 과징금 부과 등 제재를&nbsp;받습니다.  <p>3. 정보 공개 및 보고&nbsp;의무</p>  가상자산 사업자는 주요 경영 정보를 정기적으로 공개하고 의심스러운 거래를 당국에 보고해야 합니다. 거래소는 앞으로 코인 이상거래를 상시 감시하는 시스템을 구축 하여 이상거래 발생시 금융 당국에 통보해야 합니다. 또한 금감원 조사에서 불법 혐의가 확인되면 검찰 수사 등을 거쳐 형사 처벌과 과징금 부과 등 제재를&nbsp;받습니다.  <p>앞으로의 과제</p><p>지금까지 가상자산보호법의 주요 내용을 살펴보았습니다. 가장자산이용자보호법의 시행은 건전한 시장 발전을 위해 중요한 첫걸음이지만 여전히 과제가&nbsp;남아있습니다.</p>  국제협력 강화    가상자산은 국경을 초월한 거래가 일상적이고, 따라서 국제적인 협력이 필수적입니다. 금융위는 솔라나(SOL) 등으로 대표되는 디파이(DeFi, 탈중앙화된금융) 서비스도 글로벌 스탠다드를 반영해 규율 방안을 마련할 계획이라고 밝혔습니다. 글로벌 기준에 맞는 규제를 마련하고 이를 효과적으로 집행해야하는 필요성이&nbsp;남아있습니다.  <p>2. 기술발전&nbsp;대응</p>  가상자산 기술은 빠르게 발전하고 있습니다. 규제 당국은 이러한 기술 발전에 발맞춰 규제를 지속적으로 업데이트하고, 시장의 변화에 유연하게 대응해야&nbsp;합니다.  <p>3. 투자자&nbsp;교육</p>  투자자들이 가상자산에 대해 올바른 이해를 가지고 투자할 수 있도록 교육 프로그램을 강화해야 합니다. 이를 통해 투자자 보호를 더욱 강화할 수&nbsp;있습니다.  <p>4. 지속적인&nbsp;모니터링</p>  가상자산 시장은 매우 역동적이기 때문에 지속적인 모니터링이 필요합니다. 규제 당국은 시장 상황을 주기적으로 점검하고, 필요시 적절한 조치를 취해야&nbsp;합니다.  <p>메타디움에는 어떤 영향을 미칠까? 긍정적일까,&nbsp;부정적일까?</p>  메타디움은 시행령에서 언급하고 있는 유통량 등 중요 정보를 성실하게 고시하고 있으며, 시행령에서 주요하게 다루고 있는 불공정 거래 혹은 시세조종과도 관련이 없으므로 당장 급격한 영향을 받지는 않을 것으로 보입니다. 다만 법안의 시행으로 인해 불법적이거나 불공정한 행위가 감소하면 가상자산 시장의 투명성과 안정성이 높아지게 됩니다. 이는 메타디움 코인의 장기적 가치 상승 및 성장에 도움이 될 수 있을 것으로&nbsp;보입니다.   결론 <p>7월 19일부터 발효되는 가상자산이용자보호법은 가상자산 시장의 투명성과 안전성을 높이고, 투자자를 보호하는 데 중요한 역할을 할 것입니다. 그러나 궁극적으로는 법안의 도입이 가상자산 시장의 건전한 발전에 기여할 것으로 보입니다. 앞으로도 관련 동향을 주의 깊게 살피며, 변화에 유연하게 대응하는 것이 중요합니다. 지금까지 그래왔던 것 처럼 메타디움 또한 이용자의 자산을 안전하게 보호하고 건전하고 안정적인 시장 형성을 위해 최선을&nbsp;다하겠습니다.</p><p>- 메타디움&nbsp;팀</p><p>Website | <a href="https://metadium.com/">https://metadium.com</a></p><p>Discord | <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2</a></p><p>Telegram(EN) | <a href="http://t.me/metadiumofficial?fbclid=IwAR3MeXsYSQbBpKEuxTMdtNKMBDGnBpniwKrmLAoNCvGL80qVdXjpS65O0t0">http://t.me/metadiumofficial</a></p><p>Twitter | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a></p><p>Medium | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">https://medium.com/metadium</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/understanding-the-virtual-asset-user-protection-act-545065b4b785">Understanding the Virtual Asset User Protection Act</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Howdy, folks! Today I'm excited to share the latest enhancements for Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA).&nbsp;CBA is a phishing-resistant, password less, and convenient way to authenticate users with X.509 certificates, such as PIV/CAC cards, without relying on on-premises federation infrastructure, such as Active Directory Federated Service (AD FS). CBA is particularly critical for federal government organizations that are already using PIV/CAC cards and are looking to comply with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/standards/memo-22-09-meet-identity-requirements">Executive Order 14028</a>, which requires phishing-resistant authentication. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we're announcing the general availability of many improvements we&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/introducing-more-granular-certificate-based-authentication/ba-p/2365668">introduced earlier this year</a> – username bindings, affinity bindings, policy rules, and advanced CBA options in Conditional Access are all GA! I am also excited to announce the public preview of an exciting new capability - issuer hints. The issuer hints feature greatly improves user experience by helping users to easily identify the right certificate for authentication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vimala Ranganathan, Principal Product Manager on Microsoft Entra, will now walk you through these new features that will help you in your journey toward phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA).    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!    </p>
<p>Alex Weinert   </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m Vimala from the Microsoft Entra PM team, and I’m excited to walk you through the new issuer hints feature, as well as the features that will go into general availability.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issuer hints feature improves user experience by helping users to easily identify the right certificate for authentication. When enabled by tenant admin, Entra will send back <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6066#page-12">Trusted CA Indication</a> as part of the TLS handshake. The trusted Certificate Authority (CA) list will be set to subject of the Certificate Authorities (CAs) uploaded by the tenant in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-1-configure-the-certification-authorities">Entra trust store</a>. The client or native application client will use the hints sent back by server to filter the certificates shown in certificate picker and will show only the client authentication certificates issued by the CAs in the trust store. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Enhanced certificate Picker with issuer hints enabled</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also thrilled to announce the features below are going to be in general availability. You can read more about each of the features in detail in our public preview blog: <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/enhancements-to-microsoft-entra-certificate-based-authentication/ba-p/1061417">Enhancements to Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication - Microsoft Community Hub</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA username bindings, which CBA added support for three remaining username bindings and is now at parity with on-premises Active Directory. The three bindings that are being added are: IssuerAndSerialNumber, IssuerAndSubject, and Subject. More at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-4-configure-username-binding-policy">Configure Username binding policy</a>.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Affinity Binding allows admins to set affinity binding at the tenant level, as well as create custom rules to use high affinity or low affinity mapping for covering many potential scenarios our customers have in use today. More at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive#understanding-the-username-binding-policy">CBA Affinity Bindings</a>.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Authentication policy rules help determine the strength of authentication as either single-factor or multifactor. Multiple custom authentication binding rules can be created to assign default protection level for certificates based on the certificate attributes (Issuer or Policy Object Identifiers (OID) or by combining the Issuer and OID). More at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-3-configure-authentication-binding-policy">Configure authentication binding policy</a>.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced CBA options in Conditional Access allow access to specific resources based on the certificate Issuer or Policy OIDs properties. More at <a href="https://aka.ms/authstrengthadvanceddocs">authentication strength advanced options</a>.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more about Microsoft Entra CBA <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication">here</a> and Microsoft’s commitment to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/federal/CyberEO.aspx">Executive Order 14028</a>.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last year, we’ve seen many federal and regulated industry customers migrate off AD FS to Microsoft Entra ID seamlessly by leveraging staged migration and providing end users a familiar sign-in experience with CBA. In fact, in the last 12 months, we’ve seen an over 1400% increase in phishing-resistant authentication for United States government customers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep your feedback coming at <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra/bd-p/Azure-Active-Directory">Microsoft Entra Community</a>! We’re working diligently to bring more enhancements like the removal of limits on Certificate Revocation List (CRL), new certificate authority trust store, CBA support on the resource tenant for B2B external guest users, and iOS UX enhancements, to name just a few! </p>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of Elliptic Ecosystem Monitoring, a first-of-its-kind solution that enables stablecoin and token issuers to screen their ecosystems for financial crime risk in real-time. Leveraging a suite of proactive monitoring and asset analytics capabilities, issuers will be able to obtain a comprehensive view of licit and illicit activity in their cryptoasset’s ecosystem for the first time.</p> 
<p>It has become more important than ever for stablecoin and token issuers to ensure they’re adopting appropriate risk detection and mitigation strategies within their ecosystems. With the stablecoin market expected to grow to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/09/stablecoin-market-to-grow-to-almost-3t-in-next-5-years-bernstein/">$2.8 trillion in the next five years</a> (up from $125 billion), along with new and proposed regulatory regimes emerging around the globe, issuers must be able to demonstrate to regulators that they understand who is utilizing their token or stablecoin and where financial crimes risks are stemming from.<br><br>This need is underscored by the increasing use of stablecoins by illicit actors. Stablecoins can prove attractive to illicit actors owing to a variety of factors&nbsp; such as the price stability they afford, transaction processing speeds, and their deep liquidity across multiple blockchains. Consequently, it is more important than ever for participants in the cryptoasset ecosystem to work to ensure that illicit actors aren’t exploiting stablecoin or token ecosystems.</p>

 IDnow InstantSign and eID eSign reduce the cost and complexity of contract signing 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, July 9, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, has launched two new <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">e-signature solutions</a> to the market. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/instantsign/">InstantSign</a> empowers financial businesses to innovate friction-heavy and lengthy signing processes, such as loan contracts, by way of a reusable identity, while eID eSign enables users to verify their identity and digitally sign contracts with the help of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.</p>



 AML compliance redefined: QES without reverification 



<p>Existing solutions traditionally either require a new identity verification before a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> can be issued or the identification needs to be handled by the financial institution. IDnow’s latest signing solution InstantSign removes these obligations, allowing users who have already performed Anti-Money-Laundering (AML)-compliant identity verification at onboarding to digitally sign contracts at a qualified level, with no additional integrations required and in accordance with European eIDAS regulations.</p>



<p>“Eliminating the requirement for reverification by reusing an existing identification significantly streamlines the process of issuing a QES in an AML-compliant e-signing journey. InstantSign has been proven to reduce drop-offs and accelerate contract completion. With physical signing processes sometimes taking days, our customers can now cut this to mere seconds with InstantSign, by foregoing the printing, signing and return process of a hard copy contract”, explains Vikas Seth, Chief Product Officer at IDnow. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Additionally, if reverification is needed due to an expired identity document, InstantSign works seamlessly with IDnow’s entire range of identity verification solutions from automated and hybrid, to video, thus keeping identity data up-to-date, and providing a compliant solution for financial services organizations.”</p>



 eID eSign – Fast verification and secure signing thanks to NFC technology &nbsp; 



<p>eID eSign allows end customers to quickly verify their identity and digitally sign contracts remotely. In less than a minute, users can verify themselves by utilizing compliant and secure NFC technology, for a QES that is the legal equivalent to a wet-ink signature on the Level of Assurance (LoA) High. IDnow’s eID eSign solution currently works with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">German ID card</a>, residence permit or EU citizen card, using a secure, compliant NFC chip readout of these documents. It expands IDnow’s existing signing solution portfolio and complements the available identity verification methods for various types of signatures with solutions like VideoIdent, AutoIdent and IDCheck.io.</p>



<p>“With eID eSign, our customers can future-proof their offering according to the German AML laws (GwG) and the European eIDAS regulations. The use of the NFC chip reduces the risk of identity theft and unauthorized access while cutting costs associated with printing, storage and manual handling of documents. Both solutions propel us and our customers into the next stage of compliance digitalization,” concludes Seth. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>We’ve written a lot about how attackers try to break passwords. The solution to password attacks—still the most common attack vector for compromising identities—is to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa">turn on multifactor authentication (MFA)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as more customers do the right thing with MFA, actors are going beyond password-only attacks. So, we’re going to publish a series of articles on how to defeat more advanced attacks, starting with token theft. In this article, we’ll start with some basics on how tokens work, describe a token theft attack, and then explain what you can do to prevent and mitigate token theft now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tokens 101&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we get too deep into the token theft conversation, let’s quickly review the mechanics of tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A token is an authentication artifact that grants you access to resources. You get a token by signing into an identity provider (IDP), such as Microsoft Entra ID, using a set of credentials. The IDP responds to a successful sign-in by issuing a token that describes who you are and what you have permission to do. When you want to access an application or service (we’ll just say app from here), you get permission to talk to that resource by presenting a token that’s correctly signed by an issuer it trusts. The software on the client device you’re using takes care of all token handling behind the scenes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Basic token flow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first token you get, called a session token, shows that you successfully signed into the IDP, and how you signed in. When you sign into an app, it can exchange that session token for an access token, which gives you access to a specific resource for a certain amount of time without having to reauthenticate. To use an analogy, think of an amusement park. The IDP is the ticket office, which issues a park pass that provides credits for different rides. If you want to go on the roller coaster, you go to the ticket office, show your season park pass, and receive a ticket for that ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as you might be able to buy a day pass, season pass, or lifetime pass to the park, each token has a lifetime, usually between one and 24 hours. And just as a 12-month season pass may get you a one-day pass to a specific ride, session tokens can have different—and usually much longer—lifetimes than access tokens. Moreover, access token lifetimes can differ, so the roller coaster pass may last an hour while the Ferris wheel pass is good for an entire day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditionally, longer lifetimes are more convenient for users and more resilient against potential IDP outages (they save round trips to the IDP and associated latency) but riskier, while shorter lifetimes are safer (the IDP checks the integrity of the request more often). Technologies such as continuous access evaluation provide continuous assessment, so a shorter token lifetime isn’t a benefit when these are in place. When a token expires or continuous access evaluation reports heightened risk, the client goes back to the IDP and requests a refresh. This process is typically invisible to users, but if a risk condition has changed, and your organization policy requires it, then you may have to reauthenticate and get a new token. One last thing to note: while it’s a bummer to lose your roller coaster ticket, it’s really bad to lose your season park pass. An attacker can use your roller coaster ticket to get on a single ride for a short while, but with your season park pass, they can get on any ride for as long as they want. It’s similar with which, if stolen, give an actor a lasting ability to get access tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How token theft works 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attackers steal tokens so they can impersonate you and access your data for as long as that stolen token lives. To do this, they get access to where a token is stored (on the client, in proxy servers, or in some cases in application or network logs) to acquire it and replay it from somewhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Token theft cyberattack</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Identity provider</p>


<p>Ticket office</p>




<p>Session token</p>


<p>Season park pass</p>




<p>Access token</p>


<p>Individual ride ticket</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When an attacker steals your session token, it’s like picking your pocket after you’ve purchased your all-access season park pass at the fair’s ticket office. Because a token is digital, token theft is like stealing the pass from your pocket, making a photocopy, and then putting the original back in your pocket. The attacker can use their copy of your session token to get unlimited new access tokens to keep stealing your data, just as they can show a copy of a valid park pass to keep getting on rides without paying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An attacker stealing your access token is comparable to someone stealing your ride ticket as you stand in line. They do the same copy-and-replace trick, using their copy of your token to access the resource, just as they could show a copy of a valid ticket to get on an individual ride without paying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because in both cases the attacker puts the original pass or ticket back in your pocket, you don’t even know an attacker is riding the rides in your name. Your token seems fine, even though an attacker is using an illegitimate copy of it, and it may take a while to determine that anything is amiss—if you ever do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contoso stores all their documents in a secure cloud storage service and requires all employees to verify their identity using MFA before accessing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, after starting their workday by signing into Contoso's cloud storage service, a user inadvertently installed malware on their device by clicking on a malicious 'phishing' link sent to them via email. The malicious code copied the user's session token and sent it to the attacker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacker then used the stolen and MFA-validated session token, now copied to their machine, to gain access to Contoso's environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacker then downloaded as many documents as they could access, including a bunch of confidential reports, and leaked them on the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use of malware on the client to acquire the token is one common, easy method for attackers. Other tactics used to steal tokens include:</p>
 
 Copying tokens from the network as they pass through a proxy or router that the attacker controls. 
 Extracting tokens from unsecured server logs of the relying party. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While token theft still constitutes fewer than 5% of all identity compromises, incidents are growing. alone, we detected 147,000 token replay attacks, a 111% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Protecting tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IDPs and clients should handle tokens as securely as possible by only transmitting them over encrypted channels and not storing them in the open. But if an attacker infiltrates the device or network channel as in the example above, they can steal tokens and use them until they expire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, a token would only work when used from the device to which it was issued. That is, if replayed from a different device, such as one an attacker controls, they would be rejected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key part of Microsoft’s protections against token theft is the use of tokens that are cryptographically tied to the device they own. This is often called token binding, but may also be called sender constrained tokens, or token proof of possession. Token protection makes it harder to execute the main types of attacks designed to steal tokens, including network-based attacks and those using malware on the device by restricting use of the stolen token from devices they weren't issued to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Microsoft Entra, token protection binds tokens to cryptographic keys specific to the device and ties them to the device registration. Once developers enable their applications to use protected tokens, you can enforce an Entra Conditional Access policy that requires client applications to use protected tokens to access a service. This policy rejects tokens which are not cryptographically tied to the device they were issued to. In the theme park analogy, this is like the ticket office taking your picture and printing it on your ride ticket and requiring ride operators to match the picture to your face before letting you ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Token protection in Microsoft Entra</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a large project, spanning operating system platforms, native and web applications, all our cloud services, and the full range of different tokens in use for each case. It will be released in stages for specific scenarios. The first stage, in public preview now, protects the sign-in session tokens that native applications on Windows devices use when accessing Exchange, SharePoint and Teams services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token protection policy is available for Windows clients today. We’ll support Azure management scenarios and web applications that access Microsoft 365 resources and extend our cross-platform capabilities to Mac, iOS, Android, and other clients over the next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Practical steps for countering token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token protection will offer the strongest protection against token theft; however, it will take the industry time to update all applications to use bound tokens. The good news is that Microsoft offers compelling countermeasures against attacks involving token theft that you can use today to reduce their risk and impact. We recommend a systematic defense-in-depth approach:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Reduce the risk of successful token theft. 
 Prevent malicious use of stolen tokens. 
 Be prepared to detect and investigate attacks that use stolen tokens. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reduce the risk of successful token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first line of defense is to reduce the chances of attackers stealing tokens in the first place, and below are some well-established techniques for building it. It’s the equivalent of keeping your ride tickets and park passes safe from pickpockets while you’re in the theme park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Require managed and compliant devices. Use device management and define Conditional Access policies to require that users access resources from a compliant device. Compliance policies we recommend to reduce the risk of successful token theft from devices include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 To help prevent accidental infection with token-stealing malware, require users running on Windows to run as standard users rather than with device admin rights and require that all devices run up to date anti-malware and virus tools. 
 Use storage encryption to protect device content, including tokens, in case someone steals the device itself. 
 Enable Local Security Authority (LSA) protection to help protect Entra ID tokens in LSA memory. LSA protection is on by default for new devices and can be enabled for other devices via Intune. 
 Use jailbreak or rooting detection for mobile devices. Jailbroken devices are more likely to expose tokens and cryptographic secrets to potential attacks.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn on Credential Guard for your Windows users. If your users are running Windows 10 or later, you can prevent theft of Active Directory credentials by configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/?source=recommendations">Credential Guard</a>, which uses virtualization-based security (VBS) to isolate local and cached credentials so that only privileged system software—and not malware—can access them. Starting in Windows 11, version 22H2, Credential Guard is on by default for devices that meet requirements. This also helps protect cloud applications and resources when hybrid-joined devices using Active Directory authentication initiate a session to access cloud applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for enabling credential guard in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/configure?tabs=intune#enable-credential-guard">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Prevent malicious use of stolen tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While device management and strong credentials certainly reduce the risk of token theft, not everyone has them, and they’re still not completely foolproof. The next layer of defense is to prevent attackers from using stolen tokens for ongoing access by configuring policies to reject them wherever possible, and by detecting attempted use and responding automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Require token protection in Conditional Access, and where possible, choose apps and services that use token protection. Microsoft is updating our apps, identity provider, and operating systems to support token protection, so if you’re using our apps and platforms, be sure to use the latest versions. Then configure Conditional Access to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-token-protection-for-sign-in-sessions/ba-p/3815756">require token protection for sign-in sessions</a> so only applications and devices using bound sign in session tokens, which can’t be used if they’ve been stolen and moved to another device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for creating a Conditional Access policy that requires token binding in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-token-protection#create-a-conditional-access-policy">our documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a risk policy to disrupt token theft in your environment automatically. When a user initiates a session or attempts to access an application, ID Protection will examine user and session risk factors to see if any have changed. Configure Conditional Access policies to protect both medium and high-risk sessions by either challenging users with MFA or by <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/prompt-users-for-reauthentication-on-sensitive-apps-and-high/ba-p/4062703">requiring reauthentication</a>. This will make it difficult or impossible for an attacker to initiate a session using a stolen session token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever available, <a href="https://aka.ms/CAE">Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)</a> can automatically invalidate tokens when ID Protection raises the risk for a user or a service principal. This triggers the risk-based Conditional Access policies to mitigate in real-time, requiring re-authentication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for creating risk-based Conditional Access policies in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reduce the risk of token reuse by restricting sessions for use within network boundaries. Most attackers use stolen tokens from untrusted IP addresses. You can establish network boundaries with policies that prevent users from accessing your resources if they’re coming from unknown locations or from known bad locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restrict networks with Entra Conditional Access:&nbsp;Conditional Access includes controls that will block requests from outside a network compliance boundary that you define. This will prevent an attacker from refreshing a stolen Entra token, restricting its use to the lifetime of the token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for defining a network compliance boundary with Conditional Access in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-location">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhance network controls with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access">Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution</a>: To prevent the attacker from using a token outside of a trusted network at all, Entra Internet Access and Entra Private access use agents installed on endpoints and a compliant network check (enforced in real-time via CAE) to verify whether a user is connecting from a trusted network. Find step-by-step instructions for enabling compliant network check with Conditional Access in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-compliant-network">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAE-capable applications and services such as Teams, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online will continuously enforce the IP-based named location Conditional Access policies and compliant network policies to ensure that tokens can be used only from trusted networks to access services. CAE offers a strict location enforcement mode to maximize protection. Find the step-by-step instructions for enabling this in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation-strict-enforcement">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revoke tokens using Continuous Access Evaluation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring that the supported services can only be accessed from trusted locations, <a href="http://aka.ms/cae">CAE</a> can revoke tokens when admins (or users themselves) take action in response to detecting an account compromise or token theft. These include disabling accounts, changing passwords, and revoking refresh tokens. Learn more about Continuous Access Evaluation in <a href="https://aka.ms/CAE">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Be prepared to detect and investigate attacks that use stolen tokens

<p>Use Entra ID Protection and Microsoft Defender to monitor for token theft. When a threat actor replays a token, their sign-in event can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#risk-types-and-detection">trigger detections</a>&nbsp;such as ‘anomalous token’ and ‘unfamiliar sign-in properties’ from both Entra ID Protection and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#premium-detections">Premium detections</a> recognize abnormal characteristics such as an unusual token lifetime, a token played from an unfamiliar location, or token attributes that are unusual or match known attacker patterns. Signals from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) can indicate a possible attempt to access the Primary Refresh Token.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pull all your data into one Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), such as Microsoft Sentinel, to investigate potential token theft. If you receive an alert for an event that may indicate token theft, you can investigate it in the Microsoft Sentinel portal or in another SIEM. Microsoft Sentinel gives you important details about a specific incident, such as its severity, when it occurred, how many entities were involved, which events triggered it, and whether it reflects any MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics or techniques. You can then view the investigation map to understand the scope and root cause of the potential security threat.</p>

  <p>In the past few weeks, we’ve announced the general availability of Microsoft Entra External ID and Microsoft Entra ID multi-tenant collaboration. We’ve received requests for more detail from some of you regarding licensing, so I’d like to provide additional clarity for both of these scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 One person, one license 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Included in the first announcement of more multi-tenant organization (MTO) features to enhance collaboration between users, we stated that only one Microsoft Entra ID P1 license is required per employee per multi-tenant organization. Expanding on that, the term “multi-tenant organization” has two descriptions: an organization that owns and operates more than one tenant; and a set of features that enhance the collaboration experience for users between these tenants. However, your organization doesn’t have to deploy those capabilities to take advantage of the one person, one license philosophy. An organization that owns and operates multiple tenants only needs one Entra ID license per employee across those tenants. The same philosophy applies to Entra ID Governance: the organization only needs one license per person to govern the identities of these users across these tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that this philosophy includes administrative accounts. In some organizations, administrators use standard user accounts for day to day tasks, and separate administrator accounts for privileged access. A person with a standard user account and an administrator account only needs one Entra ID Governance license for both identities to be governed. Of course, they could also leverage Entra ID Governance’s Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to temporarily elevate the access rights of a single account, instead of maintaining two accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate this scenario, let’s consider an organization called Contoso, which owns ZT Tires and Tailspin Toys. Mallory is hired by Contoso, which uses Lifecycle Workflows in Entra ID Governance to onboard her user account and grant her access to the resources she needs for her job. Her account receives an access package with an entitlement to ZT Tires’ ERP app, and she requests access to Tailspin Toys inventory management app. Because Mallory has an Entra ID Governance license in the Contoso tenant, her identity can be governed in the ZT Tires and Tailspin Toys tenants with no additional governance licenses – one person, one license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diego is an identity administrator whose user account is in the ZT Tires tenant. He uses a separate administrator account for privileged access tasks in Contoso, Tailspin Toys, and ZT Tires tenants. Because Diego has an Entra ID Governance license in the ZT Tires tenant, both his user and administrator identities can be governed in all three tenants with no additional governance licenses – again, one person, one license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Entra ID Governance in Microsoft Entra External ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other announcement covered Entra External ID, Microsoft’s solution to secure customer and business collaborator access to applications. In November, I&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-business-guests/ba-p/3575579">blogged</a> about the licensing model to govern the identities of business guests in the B2B scenario for Entra External ID and shared that pricing would be $0.75 per actively governed identity per month. Because metered, usage-based pricing to govern the identities of business guests is a different model than the existing, licensed-based pricing model to govern the identities of employees, I’d like to share more detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A business guest identity in Entra External ID will accrue a single $0.75 charge in any month in which that identity is actively governed, no matter how many governance actions are taken on that identity. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Contoso employee named Gerhart collaborates with Pradeep of Woodgrove Bank to produce Contoso’s quarterly financial statements. Contoso has deployed Entra External ID for its business partners such as Woodgrove Bank. In April, Pradeep accesses Contoso’s Microsoft Teams where Gerhart stores his quarterly reporting documents, but his Entra External ID has no identity governance actions taken on them, so it doesn’t accrue any charges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May, Pradeep receives an access package with an entitlement to Contoso’s accounting system, and Gerhart reviews Pradeep’s existing access to Contoso’s inventory management database, as well as to the Teams with the quarterly reporting documents. Because Pradeep’s identity in Entra External ID had identity governance actions taken on it, Contoso will accrue a $0.75 charge. Note that the charge is applied once, even though there were three identity governance actions taken during the month. Once that Entra External ID identity was governed in May, additional identity governance actions do not generate additional charges for that identity in May.</p>

<p>Offer a new <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/digital-identity-standards-development-services/">service</a> for digital identity standards development, and suddenly, everyone has questions! (This makes me so happy! I love questions!) So, let’s look at why I think offering a service to inform executives about what’s happening in the digital identity standards space is a good idea.</p>



<p>I’m making a few assumptions as to why this service is valuable:</p>



 
 Executives aren’t opposed to conforming to standards, but they need a more structured way to understand when and how to assign resources to make the standards work for their products. 



 The standards process needs more input to ensure that the standards in question serve the critical use cases worldwide. 



 Engineers and standards architects are brilliant, but they can either engage in or facilitate the process, and they (usually) can’t do both. 
 



<p>Basically, whether it’s due to resource constraints, a lack of specific expertise, or simply the rapid pace at which changes occur, many organizations are unsure of how to engage effectively without overcommitting valuable resources. I want to help with that.</p>



 Let’s Talk Inspiration 



<p>Throughout my nearly 15 years working closely with Internet standards development efforts, I’ve seen brilliant engineers and busy executives struggle to juggle (heh, rhymes!) their day-to-day responsibilities with the necessity of staying aware of and (when necessary) influencing Internet standards. As much as the people who live and breathe standards development would prefer it otherwise, not every organization is ready, willing, or able to engage in standards development fully. Yet, staying on the sidelines isn’t a viable option either if you want to ensure that emerging standards will work for, and not against, your business interests.</p>



<p>If I were the queen of the universe, resources would magically appear; enough people with the right skills would be engaged in developing standards. I am not, however, queen of the universe (give me time). So, is there any part of this problem that I can solve? What if I could summarize what’s going on for people who need information that will let them decide when they need to engage? At the same time, can I act as a neutral party to help facilitate the process so that it runs as smoothly as possible while still including outreach to encourage participation and consensus?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



 Why A Digital Identity Standards Development Service Helps 



<p>My area of interest is in the digital identity space. I am actively engaged in the APIs under development in the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">Federated Identity Community</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/">Working Groups</a>. I’m also kicking off as co-chair of the IETF’s Secure Patterns for Internet Credentials (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/spice/about/">spice</a>) working group. Those are the areas I can immediately help an executive learn more about. If your organization has services that use federated authentication via a web browser or if they are interested in potential work on credentials to be used by both human and non-human identities, then these topics should be of interest.</p>



<p>And let’s be clear: I’m not here to push any specific solutions or architectures. Instead, I focus on providing the information your team needs to make decisions that align with your business goals.</p>



<p>There are undoubtedly other digital identity-related standards out there that may also be of interest. Adding more to my plate would involve a conversation.</p>



 Making the Case 



<p>If you need language to make the case internally for the services I’m building, this might help.</p>



<p>My Digital Identity Standards Development Service will help you:</p>



 
 Stay Informed by keeping track of critical developments without needing to sift through every detail of the standards discussion. 



 Save Resources by concentrating your efforts and resources on areas that impact your business the most without spreading your team too thin. 



 Make Strategic Decisions by applying insights and expert analysis. This will enable you to decide when and how to engage effectively, ensuring you’re always a step ahead. 
 



 Wrap Up 



<p>If you’ve read this far and haven’t clicked on the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/digital-identity-standards-development-services/">direct link</a> to the page describing this new service in detail, now’s a good time for that! If you and your organization feel overwhelmed by the prospect of keeping up with Internet standards, or if you’ve struggled to figure out how to engage without overcommitting resources, this service is designed for you. It’s about strategic engagement and ensuring that you do so with the maximum impact and minimum fuss when you choose to engage.</p>

			 What is the Electronic Seal and What Function Does It Serve? 		 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is the Electronic Seal? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>The electronic seal is a digital technology that confirms the authenticity, integrity, and origin of the digital documents to which it is attached. It is regulated by the EU eIDAS Regulation (910/2014), which describes it as a set of data in electronic form, logically associated with other digital data to guarantee the origin and integrity of the document. Considered the digital equivalent of a physical stamp, the electronic seal provides certification of provenance and protection against unauthorized alterations.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Qualified Electronic Seal (QeSeal) 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>The qualified electronic seal represents the most secure and reliable form of seal available according to the eIDAS regulation. This type of seal is particularly suitable for organizations that need to ensure the integrity and authenticity of their digital documents at a high level of security. A qualified electronic seal is generated using a Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD). These devices are designed to be highly secure and resistant to tampering attempts, ensuring that the seals created are robust and secure.<br>• Certification and Compliance:<br>Each qualified electronic seal is supported by a qualified certificate, issued by a recognized certification authority. The certificate contains the identifying information of the legal entity responsible for the seal, ensuring transparency and traceability. Compliance with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation ensures that these seals are recognized and accepted in all EU member states.<br>• Practical Applications:<br>The qualified electronic seal is used in a variety of business contexts, ensuring the security of important documents such as contracts, statements, and administrative documentation. It is frequently used in regulated sectors such as banking, insurance, healthcare, and the public sector, where the need to protect sensitive information is particularly critical.<br>• Strategic Advantages:<br>Adopting the qualified electronic seal allows companies to improve operational efficiency, reduce the risk of document fraud, and enhance trust in electronic transactions. Its implementation can significantly reduce operational costs associated with managing paper documents, contributing to the digital transformation of the company.</p>   						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How to Obtain It 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>To obtain an electronic seal, an organization must undergo a rigorous verification process by a certification authority recognized by AgID. InfoCert is one of the leading providers recognized in Europe for the qualified validation of electronic seals, enabling German companies to use such seals for various applications, including registration with the European EPREL database for product energy classification.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>We’ve been hearing about Zero Trust and that “identity is the new perimeter” for years. Maybe it’s time to say, “identity is a perimeter”, because even though network perimeters are porous, they still exist. There is a growing awareness of the centrality of identity and access management in the larger field of IT security. This is because so many cyber-attacks leverage digital identities. This has led to increased emphasis and spending on IAM, beyond just the full IAM suite solutions. For example, we see higher quality and more user-friendly modular solutions for multi-factor (and passwordless) authentication, fine-grained authorization, privileged access management, and identity governance and lifecycle management, often delivered as cloud-hosted services.</p>
<p>The need for identity security was evidenced at our recent European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference, where <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/mtracks/173">our track on identity security</a> was well attended. We had speakers addressing Zero Trust implementations, Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response (ITDR), fraud techniques, the use of generative AI for perpetrating account takeovers (ATOs), gamification of cybersecurity and identity defenses to improve security postures, API security, and the role of identity in cloud security.</p>
<p>ITDR garnered much attention from both attendees and vendors. Vendors have developed solutions that are targeted at reducing threats and risks from enterprise ATOs that lead to asset compromise, data loss, and ransomware attacks. Sophisticated attackers today sometimes do not even use malware to attack victims. They simply take over legitimate accounts, often those that are not properly secured against remote attacks. In other cases, they buy access to real corporate accounts on the dark web. ITDR solutions primarily integrate with identity repositories and other security tools to understand normal activities in order to be able to identify abnormal activities that may be signs of malicious intent.</p>
<p>Some ITDR solutions leverage user behavioral analytics from endpoints, and some have identity deception capabilities, whereby fake accounts, credentials, and other lures are used to draw in would-be attackers to learn about their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). The ITDR market is relatively new and there is a lot of variety in how the products are implemented. We at KuppingerCole expect that the ITDR field will grow, mature, and standardize on more inclusive feature sets. For our latest research on ITDR, see the recently published <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80828/identity-threat-detection-and-response-itdr-iam-meets-the-soc">Leadership Compass on the subject</a>.</p>
<p>Fraud prevention is a desired outcome for identity security, especially within consumer and customer IAM. Fraudsters are constantly innovating on their techniques and finding new targets. Organizations must strive to keep up with mechanisms and services to detect fraud and prevent losses. Fortunately, numerous Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms (FRIPs) are available to help organizations of all kinds prevent ATOs, new account fraud, synthetic fraud, and ecommerce abuse. FRIP solutions typically have multiple capabilities to detect and stop fraud attempts, including identity verification, compromised credential intelligence, device intelligence, user behavioral analysis, behavioral biometrics, and bot detection and management. KuppingerCole will be updating <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81108/fraud-reduction-intelligence-platforms-frip">our research on FRIPs</a> later this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024">cyberevolution conference</a>, we will continue our focus on identity security. We will have speakers addressing ITDR and fraud prevention, as well as practical sessions on the implementation of Zero Trust to bolster identity security. cyberevolution will take place in Frankfurt, Germany on December 3-5, 2024. &nbsp;To register, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024/tickets">click here</a>.</p>

				 <p>検証可能な認証情報は、改ざん防止のデジタル情報をパッケージ化して共有する方法であり、これにより、元の情報源を常に認証できます。このテクノロジーが強力なのは、誰でも暗号を使用して認証情報の発行者を検証できることと、認証情報の作成以降にデータが変更されていないことが保証されるため、内部の情報が信頼でき、すぐに対応できる点です。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>ティム・スプリング 記</p>
<p>簡潔に説明すると、検証可能な認証情報とは、発行組織または当事者によって分散ネットワークで作成され、データ所有者によってデジタル ウォレットにローカルに保存されるデータのパッケージです。</p>
<p>作成されると、これらのパッケージを発行する当事者は、適切なソフトウェアを持っていれば誰でも検証できます。認証情報が作成されると、発行当事者は内部の情報にデジタル署名します。署名されると、データを変更しようとする試みはネットワーク上で表示され、認証情報を「破壊」します。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>検証可能な資格情報は何を表すことができるのでしょうか?</p>
<p>検証可能な資格情報の使用範囲は非常に広く、身元やアイデンティティに関連するあらゆる情報をカバーすることができます。個人、車両、建物、組織、接続されたデバイスなど、さまざまなエンティティとそれに付随する情報を、デジタル形式で安全かつ信頼性を持って表現することが可能です。</p>
<p>たとえば、大学は卒業証書や成績証明書を検証可能な認証情報として学生に発行できます。これにより、卒業生はこれらの証明書を就職先や他の教育機関など、検証を必要とする人々と簡単に共有できます。認証は瞬時に行われるため、従来のように大学に戻って手動で証明書を再発行してもらう手間が省け、全ての関係者にとって効率的な体験が提供されます。</p>
<p>こちらから<a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">Open Badges 3.0</a>に関する最新の記事をお読みください。</p>
<p>ペーパーワークと手動プロセスの終焉 </p>
<p>現代社会では、資格情報は至る所に存在します。運転免許証、パスポート、社員証など、私たちは日常的にさまざまな形で個人を証明する文書を使用しています。</p>
<p>しかし、これらの紙の文書にはいくつかの重大な欠点があります。</p>
<p>まず、紙の文書は盗まれたり、コピーされたり、偽造されたりするリスクがあります。</p>
<p>紙の文書を取得するには、発行元に直接出向かなければならない場合が多く、これが手間と時間のコストを生みます。</p>
<p>さらに、これらの文書は安全に保管する必要があり、そのためのスペースと管理も必要です。</p>
<p>紙の文書を使用する際には、意図しないデータの過剰共有や、手動で情報を入力する必要が生じることがあります。これにより、プライバシーのリスクが高まり、作業が煩雑になることがあります。</p>
<p>これらの課題を克服するために、検証可能な資格情報は、同じ情報をデジタル形式で保持し、より安全で簡単に管理できる方法を提供します。このデジタル資格情報は、ユーザーが自分の情報を好きな方法で、必要な範囲で共有できるようにします。これにより、情報の過剰共有を避け、必要な情報だけを正確に伝えることができます。</p>
<p>組織の観点から見ると、検証可能な認証情報は、複雑な直接統合を必要とせずに、さまざまなシステム間で情報をすばやく共有する方法を提供します。</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>簡単な例を見てみましょう。</p>
<p>現在、DMV (米国陸運局)で発行される運転免許証には、生年月日、目の色、身長、体重、氏名、免許証番号、住所などの個人情報が記載されています。年齢制限のある商品を購入しようとすると、業者はしばしば免許証を確認し、あなたの年齢とその商品を合法的に購入できるかどうかを確認します。身分証明書を渡すということは、生年月日だけでなく、全ての情報を渡すということであり、その情報は簡単に悪用される可能性があります。</p>
<p>同じシナリオで、検証可能な資格情報は依然として DMV によって発行され、すべての個人データが含まれていますが、重要なのは、データを選択的に分離して共有できることです。さらに一歩進んで、資格を共有するだけで済みます。店は実際の生年月日を知る必要はなく、特定の年齢を超えているかどうかを知るだけで済みます。これは、単純な「はい」または「いいえ」の形で共有できます。</p>
<p>検証可能な資格情報を使用して店舗で購入する方法の詳細については、<a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-digitally-transform-banking-finance-and-payments/">金融と支払い</a>がどのように変化するかについての記事をお読みください。</p>
<p>なぜ分散化が重要なのでしょうか?</p>
<p>これは独自のブログを作成するに値する大きなトピックですが、いくつかのポイントを簡単に説明します。</p>
<p>モバイル運転免許証など、他のデジタル識別方法が普及し始めているため、文書をデジタル化するだけでは安全ではないことを覚えておくことが重要です。重要なのは、その文書がどのように保存および共有されるかです。</p>
<p>検証可能な資格情報をエンド ユーザーのモバイル デバイスにローカルに保存することで、エンド ユーザーがそのデータを確実に管理し、選択した相手とのみ共有できるようになります。</p>
<p>モバイル運転免許証が分散化されていない場合、個人の身元を確認するためにシステムに連絡する必要があることを意味します。これにより、検証プロセスが遅くなり、データベースにアクセスできない場合に問題が発生する可能性があり、悪意のある攻撃者にとって大きな標的となります。</p>

<p>RECLAIM scans your email subject lines and senders to identify which companies have your personal details, such as phone, address, and credit card details, and then gives you instructions for either switching out your personal information for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a> information or asking the company to delete your data altogether. <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a> are secure digital profiles with <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email</a>, and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">payment cards</a> to <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">use instead of your own</a>. You create your <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a> in the <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo all-in-one privacy app</a>, part of the same app family as RECLAIM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just released in beta, RECLAIM is a great place to start reducing the online exposure of your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private/">personally identifiable information</a> and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital footprint</a>, and boosting your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/11/9-reasons-why-data-privacy-matters/">data privacy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 RECLAIM has 6 handy tools built in&nbsp; 



 
 Dashboard – Start here. See your email scan and a first look at who has your data.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Footprint – Get the complete list of companies that have your data based on your email, and where your information might have been exposed in a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-caught-in-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Key insights – Dive into the nitty gritty of what information each company has on you and what they might be doing with it based on their privacy policy and terms of service, which RECLAIM extracts and summarizes using AI.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Protection Manager – Take the wheel by opting to either protect your data with <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a> or delete it altogether.&nbsp; 
 



 
 MySudo Protection – If you decide to protect your information with MySudo, follow the steps to switch out your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private/">personal details</a> for your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">Sudo</a> secure digital profile details.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Deletion – If you opt to ask the company to delete your information, you’d do that here.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>When you start with RECLAIM, head to your dashboard to see your footprint scan and then start reclaiming control. It’s quick and easy, and definitely worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>



 Sign in with Google to reclaim your Gmail account&nbsp; 



<p>The beta version of RECLAIM only scans Gmail accounts. If you don’t have Gmail, there’s an option to share with us which email service you’d like our next release to support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you log in with Google, RECLAIM will read the metadata of your Gmail messages. Email metadata includes date and time, sender and recipient email addresses, and email subject. RECLAIM does not have access to the attachments or body of your Gmail inbox messages&nbsp;</p>



 RECLAIM works best with MySudo&nbsp; 



<p>Once you’ve regained control of your personal information with RECLAIM, keep up the good work by using <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">Sudos</a> to proactively protect your online presence. Sudos are secure digital profiles with <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email</a>, and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">payment cards</a> to <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">use instead of your own</a>. You can sign up for new accounts and services with your Sudo information, not your personal information. You’d simply give companies your Sudo nickname, phone number, email address and payment card details instead of your own. Then, if that Sudo information is hit in a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-caught-in-a-data-breach/">data breach</a> or the company sells it to <a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a> for profit, your own information is safe because it’s masked.

  <p>Last month <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDGABlog">we announced the general availability</a> of our next generation customer identity and access management solution, <a href="https://aka.ms/External_ID">Microsoft Entra External ID.</a> External ID makes Customer Identity &amp; Access Management (CIAM) secure and simple by enabling you to: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure all external identities: Managing several disparate solutions can overcomplicate your security strategy. By adopting External ID as your CIAM solution, you can secure all identity types within your Microsoft Entra admin center, safeguarding all external identities with industry-leading security, including our own conditional access engine, verifiable credentials, and built-in identity governance.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Create frictionless user experiences: The rise of fraud, GenAI, and identity attacks has increased end-user fear when it comes to security risks online. With External ID, you can build frictionless, branded, user centric interfaces into your web and mobile applications to increase brand awareness, build user trust and drive user engagement. Check out an example in the <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDWoodgroveDemo">WoodGrove Groceries demo!</a>&nbsp; 
 
 
 Streamline secure collaboration: Collaborating with external users and ensuring they have the right access at the right time is complex. Simplify collaboration by inviting business guests with External ID and defining what internal resources they can access across SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Accelerate the development of secure applications: Integrating robust and extensive user flows into apps can take developers months. Shorten development time to minutes by leveraging External ID’s rich set of APIs, SDKs, and integrations with developer tools, such as Visual Studio Code, to build secure and branded identity experiences into external-facing web and mobile apps.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Best in class value at scale: Managing several security stacks can be costly. External ID brings innovative CIAM features at a cost-effective value for any growing customer without compromising on scalable, end-to-end security. For example, this approach helps us bring best-in-class identity verification like Face Check with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/02/06/microsoft-entra-verified-id-introduces-face-check-in-preview/">Verified ID</a> to reduce help desk costs for combatting fraud. <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDPricing">Learn more about External ID pricing here.</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide best in class protection from bot attacks, sign in and signup fraud and ability to audit every step of external user’s journeys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Powered by open standards, External ID is built to be interoperable with any Identity solution to provide enterprise-grade security without sacrificing end user experiences. <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDFAQ">Learn more.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Azure AD B2C is powerful in the flexibility of experiences it enables, External ID is designed for ease of adoption and speed of innovation as it’s converged into the Entra ID technical stack and organically benefits from all Entra ID innovation, extending Microsoft Entra industry-leading security and governance to external users.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will there be any changes in Azure AD B2C support and how can I migrate my existing Azure AD B2C applications to Microsoft Entra External ID?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current Azure AD B2C customers can continue using the Azure AD B2C with no service disruptions, including creating new tenants. You can continue to operate your existing B2C applications with confidence and we'll continue supporting you until at least May 2030.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently using Azure AD B2B collaboration and B2B direct connect, have these experiences changed?&nbsp;</p>

				  Managing age-restricted purchases using decentralized identity and verifiable credentials is a simple, reliable way to provide a faster checkout experience while preventing illegal transactions.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>All around the United States this week people will be gathering to celebrate the national July 4th holiday with (hopefully) contained explosions.</p>
<p>The purchase of fireworks is controlled at the state level, meaning that it can vary from state to state, but generally requires the customer to be 18 years or older. Which is why many teenagers looking to celebrate with their friends will be trying to work around these restrictions, and some will resort to fraudulent IDs.</p>
<p>This gives us a great framework to explore how to manage age verification with verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale age verification is something that most people experience throughout their lifetime; usually, it takes a few seconds and requires a driver’s license and an interaction with a clerk or salesperson to purchase the requested item. This can be time consuming if a clerk is not readily available or even if the clerk is and there’s a long line. If fake IDs were always easy to spot at a glance, this wouldn’t be a problem; but they aren’t, and people are fallible, especially under pressure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A verifiable credential is a digital credential held in a wallet app on a mobile device. The information in the credential can be verified as to its source and its integrity —&nbsp;whether it has been altered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any verifiable credential that contains a claim about age, such as a date of birth, can be instantly checked for its source —&nbsp;is it a valid student ID, a driver’s license or a passport — and its integrity.&nbsp; Some credentials will be able to present age in the form of a zero-knowledge proof, meaning that age can be verified without revealing the actual age. The result is seamless, instant, and reliable age verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the age of self-checkout, being able to present a secure credential that a machine can verify removes the annoyance of waiting for an employee to be available to help you. It also allows you to share only your age with the verifying party, rather than other information on your driver’s license such as address, full name, height, weight, etc.</p>
<p>As the world moves more digital customers expect fast, convenient interactions. Decentralized identity and verifiable credentials provide the perfect way to both speed up these mundane processes — providing a better experience for your customers, while allowing you to see more of them — and also reduce your liability of mistakenly letting a fraudulent ID make a purchase.</p>
<p>Happy holidays from all of us at Indicio! We hope everyone is safe on the 4th, and if you have any questions about how decentralized identity can improve efficiency for your organization please don’t hesitate to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact our team.</a></p>

 Change announcements 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security update to Entra ID affecting clients which are running old, unpatched builds of Windows</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're making a security update to Entra ID such that use of older unpatched version of Windows which still use the less secure Key Derivation Function v1 (KDFv1) will no longer be supported.&nbsp; Once the update is rolled out, unsupported and unpatched Windows 10 and 11 clients will no longer be able to sign in to Entra ID. Globally, more than 99% of Windows clients signing in to Entra ID have the required security patches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Action required:</p>
<p>If your Windows devices have Security Patches after July 2021 no action is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Windows devices do not have security updates after July 2021, update Windows to the latest build of your currently supported Windows version to maintain access to Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All currently supported versions of Windows have the required patch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you keep Windows up to date with Security Updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Security Update to Windows <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-33781">CVE-2021-337</a>81 was issued in July 2021 to address a vulnerability where Primary Refresh Tokens were not stored sufficiently securely in the client.&nbsp; Once patched, Windows clients used the stronger KDFv2 algorithm.&nbsp; All versions of Windows released since that time have the update and handle the token securely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A small percentage of Windows devices have not yet been updated and are still using the older v1 key derivation function. To improve security of the system, unpatched devices using the KDFv1 algorithm will no longer be able to sign in to Entra ID using Primary Refresh Tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the user experience on unsupported Windows devices when this change is rolled out?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users of Windows devices which haven’t been updated with patches since July 2021 may experience sign in failures with their Entra ID user accounts on joined or hybrid joined Windows device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I diagnose this situation?</p>
<p>The error code, which will show in sign in logs, is 'AADSTS5000611: Symmetric Key Derivation Function version 'KDFV1' is invalid. Update the device for the latest updates.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhancing the security of Apple devices in the enterprise with hardware bound device identity&nbsp;– 2-year notice</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device identity is one of the fundamental Entra ID concepts that enables multiple Entra ID and MDM/MAM security features like&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmem%2Fintune%2Fprotect%2Fdevice-compliance-get-started%23device-compliance-policies-work-with-azure-ad&amp;data=05%7C02%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C595884c953e941b8523108dc818f290c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638527699124648064%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=7r2JuXfC%2BEXqG7nxuV3waCYUOHO4T6HoU31IyPh%2Frlg%3D&amp;reserved=0">device compliance policies</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmem%2Fintune%2Fapps%2Fapp-protection-policy&amp;data=05%7C02%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C595884c953e941b8523108dc818f290c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638527699124660325%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=jbkp61z2vmMO2vdlXhPcNBVZWSRXhvdNQdUAIEGBobs%3D&amp;reserved=0">app protection policies</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fentra%2Fidentity%2Fdevices%2Fconcept-primary-refresh-token&amp;data=05%7C02%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C595884c953e941b8523108dc818f290c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638527699124665092%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ZKd9F6qvdNmZ4Lae1DJnv2mHa%2FLt9fIygJxAwQXVImg%3D&amp;reserved=0">PRT-based SSO</a>.&nbsp; To enhance security, Entra ID has now done work to support the binding of device identity keys to Apple’s Secure Enclave hardware, which will replace previous Keychain-based mechanism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting&nbsp;in June 2026,&nbsp;all new Entra ID registrations will be bound&nbsp;to the Secure Enclave.&nbsp;As a result, all customers will need to adopt the&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fentra%2Fidentity-platform%2Fapple-sso-plugin&amp;data=05%7C02%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C595884c953e941b8523108dc818f290c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638527699124669553%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=NKM%2FVimgj8HFHioHG75FozDmJ4oDEnanjXV%2FvmKJ5lc%3D&amp;reserved=0">Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in</a>&nbsp;and some of the apps may need to make code changes to adopt the new Secure Enclave based device identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opt-in, provide feedback</p>
<p>Before Entra enables Secure Enclave by default for all new registrations, we encourage tenants to perform early testing using the documentation provided on&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fentra%2Fidentity-platform%2Fapple-sso-plugin%23upcoming-changes-to-device-identity-key-storage&amp;data=05%7C02%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C595884c953e941b8523108dc818f290c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638527699124673955%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=InL8RAKOx38RtEMv%2FXfY0w709iSWUQ5lioRe3VWrKzE%3D&amp;reserved=0">learn.microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;This will help to identify any compatibility issues, where you may need to request code changes from app or MDM vendors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Important Update: Azure AD Graph Retirement</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">June 2023</a>, the Azure AD Graph API service is in a retirement cycle and will be retired (shut down) in incremental stages. In the first stage of this retirement cycle, newly created applications will receive an error (HTTP 403) for any requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net">https://graph.windows.net</a>). We are revising the da20te for this first stage from June 30 to August 31, so only applications created after August 31, 2024, will be impacted. The second stage of the Azure AD Graph service retirement cycle will begin after January 31, 2025. At this point, all applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs will receive an error when making requests to the AAD Graph service. Azure AD Graph will be completely retired (and stop working) after June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph. We are providing an optional configuration (through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors">authenticationBehaviors</a> setting) that will allow an application to continue use of Azure AD Graph APIs through March 30, 2025.&nbsp; If you develop or distribute software that still uses Azure AD Graph APIs, you must act now to avoid interruption. You will either need to migrate your applications to Microsoft Graph (highly recommended) or configure the application for an extension, and ensure that your customers are prepared for the change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To identify applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs, we have provided two <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Entra recommendations</a> with information about applications and service principals that are actively using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important Update: AzureAD and MSOnline PowerShell retirement&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, the legacy Azure AD PowerShell, Azure AD PowerShell Preview, and MS Online modules <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-update-deprecation-of-azure-ad-powershell-and-msonline/ba-p/4094536">are deprecated</a>. These modules will continue to function through March 30, 2025, when they are retired and stop functioning. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview?view=graph-powershell-1.0">Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK</a> is the replacement for these modules and you should migrate your scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK as soon as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: as indicated in our April update, MS Online with “Legacy Auth” will stop functioning in the weeks after June 30, 2024. Legacy Auth is typically associated with versions before 1.1.166.0, and involves use of MS Online PowerShell with the Microsoft Online Sign-In Assistant package installed. If you are using MS Online versions before 1.1.166.0 or MS Online with Legacy Auth, you should immediately migrate to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK or update the MS Online version to the latest version (<a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MSOnline/1.1.183.81">1.1.183.81</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you identify usage of Azure AD PowerShell in your tenant, you can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Entra Recommendation</a> titled Migrate Service Principals from the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs to Microsoft Graph. This recommendation will show vendor applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant, including AzureAD PowerShell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are making substantial new and future investments in the PowerShell experience for managing Entra, with the recent Public Preview launch of the <a href="https://aka.ms/EntraPSPreview">Microsoft</a> Entra PowerShell module. This new module builds upon and is part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. It’s fully interoperable with all cmdlets in the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, enabling you to perform complex operations with simple, well documented commands. The module also offers a backward compatibility option to simplify migraiton from the deprecated AzureAD Module. Additionally, we are aware that some of our customers were unable to fully migrate to scripts that managed Per-user MFA from MSOnline to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Microsoft Graph APIs were <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/changelog?search=e22b3741-9f9a-4d25-af9d-e935018a8b68">recently made available</a> to read and configure Per-user MFA settings for users, and availability in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK cmdlets is soon to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Preview – QR code sign-in, a new authentication method for Frontline Workers</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are introducing a new simple way for Frontline Workers to authenticate in Microsoft Entra ID with a QR code and PIN, eliminating the need to enter long UPNs and alphanumeric passwords multiple times during their shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the private preview release of this feature in August 2024, all users in your tenant will see a new link ‘Sign in with QR code’ on navigating to <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/">https://login.microsoftonline.com</a> &gt; ‘Sign-in options’ &gt; ‘Sign in to an organization’ page. This new link, ‘Sign in with QR code’, will be visible only on mobile devices (Android/iOS/iPadOS). If you are not participating in the private preview, users from your tenant will not be able to sign-in through this method while we are still in private preview. They will receive an error message if they try to sign-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feature will have a ‘preview’ tag until it is generally available. Your organization needs to be enabled to test this feature. Broad testing will be available in public preview, which we will announce later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the feature is in private preview, no technical support will be provided. Please learn more about support during previews here <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/licensing-preview-info">Microsoft Entra ID preview program information - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to phone call settings: custom greetings and caller ID</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting September 2024, phone call settings (custom greetings and caller ID) under Entra's multifactor authentication blade will be moved under the voice authentication method in the authentication method policy. Instead of accessing these settings through the Entra ID or Azure portal, they will be accessible through MS Graph API.&nbsp;If your organization is using custom greetings and/or caller ID, please make sure to check the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings#phone-call-settings">public documentation</a> once we release the new experience to learn how to manage these settings through MS Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS Graph API support for per-user MFA</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting June 2024, we are releasing the capability to manage user status (Enforced, Enabled, Disabled) for per-user MFA through MS Graph API. This will replace the legacy MS Online PowerShell module that is being retired. Please be aware that the recommended approach to protect users with Microsoft Entra MFA is Conditional Access (for licensed organizations) and security defaults (for unlicensed organizations).&nbsp;The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates">public documentation</a> will be updated once we release the new experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server&nbsp;- 3-month notice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p><br>Beginning September 30, 2024, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server deployments will no longer service MFA requests, which could cause authentications to fail for your organization. MFA Server will have limited SLA and MFA Activity Report in the Azure Portal will no longer be available. To ensure uninterrupted authentication services and to remain in a supported state, organizations should <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-migrate-mfa-server-to-azure-mfa-user-authentication">migrate their users’ authentication data</a> to the cloud-based Azure MFA service using the latest Migration Utility included in the most recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55849">Azure MFA Server update</a>.

<p>Decommissioning of Group Writeback V2 (Public Preview) in Entra Connect Sync - Reminder</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public preview of Group Writeback V2 (GWB) in Entra Connect Sync is no longer available and Connect Sync will no longer support provisioning cloud security groups to Active Directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another similar functionality is offered in Entra Cloud Sync, called “Group Provision to AD”, that maybe used instead of GWB V2 for provisioning cloud security groups to AD. Enhanced functionality in Cloud Sync, along with other new features, are being developed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers who use this preview feature in Connect Sync should&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/migrate-group-writeback">switch their configuration from Connect Sync to Cloud Sync</a>. Customers can choose to move all their hybrid sync to Cloud Sync (if it supports their needs) or Cloud Sync can be run side-by-side and move only cloud security group provisioning to AD onto Cloud Sync. Customers who provision Microsoft 365 groups to AD can continue using GWB V1 for this capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visual enhancements to the per-user MFA admin configuration experience</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of ongoing service improvements, we are making updates to the per-user MFA admin configuration experience to align with the look and feel of Entra ID. This change does not include any changes to the core functionality and will only include visual improvements. Starting in August 2024, you will be redirected to the new experience both from the Entra admin center and Azure portal. There will be a banner presented for the first 30 days to switch back to the old experience, after which you can only use the new experience. The<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates"> public documentation</a> will be updated once we release the new experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updates to “Target resources” in Microsoft Entra Conditional Access</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in September 2024, the Microsoft Entra Conditional Access 'Target resources' assignment will consolidate the "Cloud apps" and "Global Secure Access" options under a new name "Resources". &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers will be able to target "All internet resources with Global Secure Access", "All resources (formerly 'all cloud apps') or select specific resources (formerly "select apps"). Some of the Global Secure Access attributes in the Conditional Access API will be deprecated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upcoming Improvements to Entra ID device code flow</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to security, we are announcing upcoming enhancements to the Entra ID device code flow. These improvements aim to provide a more secure and efficient authentication experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've refined the messaging and included app details within the device code flow to ensure a more secure and precise user experience. Specifically, we've adjusted headers and calls to action to help your users recognize and respond to security threats more effectively. These changes are designed to help your users make more informed decisions and prevent phishing attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes will be gradually introduced starting in July 2024 and are expected to be fully implemented by August 30, 2024. No action required from you.</p>

  <p>One year ago, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> on the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will occur in incremental stages. In the first stage of this retirement cycle, newly created applications will receive an error (HTTP 403) for any requests to Azure AD Graph APIs. We’re revising the date for this first stage from June 30 to August 31, and only applications created after August 31, 2024 will be impacted. After January 31, 2025, all applications – both new and existing – will receive an error when making requests to Azure AD Graph APIs, unless they’re configured to allow extended Azure AD Graph access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph. We’re providing an optional configuration through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors">the authenticationBehaviors property,</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;will allow an application to use Azure AD Graph APIs through June 30, 2025. Azure AD Graph will be fully retired after June 30, 2025, and no API requests will function at this point, regardless of the application’s configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you develop or distribute software that still uses Azure AD Graph APIs, you must act now to avoid interruption. You’ll either need to migrate your applications to Microsoft Graph (highly recommended) or configure the application for an extension, as described below, and ensure that your customers are prepared for the change. If you’re using applications supplied by a vendor that use Azure AD Graph APIs, work with the software vendor to update to a version that has migrated to Microsoft Graph APIs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How do I find Applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Microsoft Entra recommendations</a> feature provides recommendations to ensure your tenant is in a secure and healthy state, while also helping you maximize the value of the features available in Entra ID. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve provided two Entra recommendations that show information about applications and service principals that are actively using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant. These new recommendations can support your efforts to identify and migrate the impacted applications and service principals to Microsoft Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra Recommendations for Azure AD Graph migration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, reference <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/recommendation-migrate-to-microsoft-graph-api">Recommendation to migrate to Microsoft Graph API</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Configuring an application for an extension of Azure AD Graph access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To allow an application created to have an extension for access to Azure AD Graph APIs through June 30, 2025, you must make a configuration change on the application after it’s created. This configuration change is done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface. By setting the blockAzureADGraphAccess flag to false, the newly created application will be able to continue to use Azure AD Graph APIs until further in the retirement cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: In this first stage, only Applications created after August 31, 2024 will be impacted. Existing applications will be able to continue to use Azure AD Graph APIs even if the authenticationBehaviors property is not configured. Once this change is rolled out, you may also choose to set blockAzureADGraphAccess to true for testing or to prevent an existing application from using Azure AD Graph APIs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens to applications using Azure AD Graph after August 31, 2024? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Any existing applications that use Azure AD Graph APIs and were created before this date will not be impacted at this stage of the retirement cycle. 
 Any applications created after August 31, 2024 will encounter errors when making requests to Azure AD Graph APIs, unless the blockAzureADGraphAccess attribute has been set to false in the authenticationBehaviors configuration for the application.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens to applications using Azure AD Graph after January 31, 2025? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 After January 31, 2025, all applications – new and existing - will encounter errors when making requests to Azure AD Graph APIs, unless the blockAzureADGraphAccess attribute has been set to false in the authenticationBehaviors property for the application. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens to applications using Azure AD Graph after June 30, 2025? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Azure AD Graph APIs will no longer be available to any applications after this point, and any requests to Azure AD Graph APIs will receive an error, regardless of the authenticationBehaviors configuration for the application.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current support for Azure AD Graph</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph APIs are in the retirement cycle and have no SLA or maintenance commitment beyond security-related fixes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Microsoft Graph 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph represents our best-in-breed API surface. It offers a single unified endpoint to access Entra and Microsoft 365 services such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Intune. All new functionalities will only be available through Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph is also more secure and resilient than Azure AD Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph has all the capabilities that have been available in Azure AD Graph and new APIs like identity protection and authentication methods. Its client libraries offer built-in support for features like retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication, and payload compression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What about Azure AD and Microsoft Online PowerShell modules? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, AzureAD, AzureAD-Preview, and Microsoft Online (MSOL) PowerShell modules are deprecated and will only be supported for security fixes. These modules will be retired and stop working after March 30, 2025. You should migrate these to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Please reference this <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-update-deprecation-of-azure-ad-powershell-and-msonline/ba-p/4094536">update</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p>

  The CIAM market continues to grow and change. There have been major acquisitions in this space, and new vendors are launching products and services. Security is always a driver, but deploying organizations want useful data to improve marketing effectiveness and increase revenues. New privacy regulations put more requirements for information collection and handling on customer organizations. CIAM systems must also be able to integrate with other IT, security, and enterprise IAM solutions. To capture market share, CIAM vendors have to be innovative. Fraud prevention and integrations with marketing tools are differentiators that many companies are looking for in CIAM.

<p></p>
<p>Following the successful <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/tbdex-v1">launch of tbDEX 1.0</a> in Rio de Janeiro, TBD embarked on a roadshow across Africa, visiting Accra, Nairobi, and Cape Town.
Our mission was to engage with local developers and share tbDEX, an open source protocol for global payments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recognizing that many African countries face significant barriers to participating in the global economy, we aimed to support the vibrant and growing developer communities in these regions.
These communities are already tackling these challenges head-on, and we wanted to contribute by providing open source tools to build robust payment applications.</p>
<p>The roadshow featured full-day, hands-on workshops in Accra and Nairobi, where hundreds of developers gathered to learn how to utilize tbDEX.
The excitement was palpable as participants built wallet applications using the tbDEX SDK.
The enthusiasm and curiosity among the developers were evident, and the success of these workshops was widely shared across <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7199777112713486337/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7199777112713486337%29">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://x.com/yellowcard_app/status/1795385010117386749">Twitter</a>.</p>
 <blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/user/status/1794038435218387164"></a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/user/status/1794018057012072690"></a></blockquote> 
<p>Angie Jones, Head of Developer Relations, and Adewale Abati, Staff Developer Advocate, led the workshops, demonstrating the capabilities of developers eager to integrate advanced payment solutions.
Co-sponsored by Yellow Card and Circle, these sessions saw developers integrating wallet applications with tbDEX in just one day.</p>
  
<p>In addition to the workshops, TBD actively participated in notable conferences across Africa.
At the 3iAfrica conference in Accra, Mike Brock, CEO of TBD, delivered an insightful session titled "Trust Reimagined in the Digital Assets World," discussing the economic principles behind digital assets and their impact on trust and value exchange in business.
Angie Jones hosted a roundtable discussion on tbDEX as an open protocol for global money movement."</p>
  
<p>The team also made a stop at Joy 99.7 FM radio station in Ghana, where Mike and Angie discussed how digital identity can enhance payment systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The journey continued to the ID4Africa conference in Cape Town, where TBD engaged with local stakeholders to gain deeper insights into the challenges surrounding digital identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Overall, the roadshow was a significant step in connecting with developer communities across Africa.
We were inspired by the talent and determination we encountered and look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that will emerge from these collaborations.</p>
 
<p>Get Started with tbDEX</p>
<p>With tbDEX, anyone can dive into building innovative payment solutions without needing permission.
This open source tool empowers developers to start building immediately.
We welcome your <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex">feedback and contributions</a> to make tbDEX even more robust and versatile.
Join us in breaking down barriers and building the future of global payments today.</p>

<p>I live in Slack. The rest of the team at YeshID does, too. So do a lot of our customers. That’s why we created the Slack integration we wrote about in <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/ditch-reminder-chaos-yeshid-slackbot-manages-onboarding-offboarding/">this other post.</a></p>
<p>Here, I’m going to tell you how we’ve taken that integration to the next level.</p>
 The Problem 
<p>Imagine you’re in Slack, discussing some problem. Steve’s the guy who seems to have a handle on what to do. The best way for Steve to take the next step is with an app he doesn’t use all the time. He knows how to use it but doesn’t have access right now. So, let’s just get him access. Easy, right? But according to the customers we’ve been talking to, it’s not.</p>
<p>They’ve told us what they have had to do:</p>
 
 Get out of Slack and send an email (or write a JIRA ticket) to the admin for the app to request access. 
 The admin may not be the approver, so the admin has to email the approver. 
 When the approver approves, they reply with an email to the admin, who grants access. 
 The admin then has to notify the requester. 
 However, the requester might not be the person who will use the app, so they have to notify that person. 
 
<p>It’s a mess. Or as it’s usually described, it’s a cluster- umm cluster-something.</p>
<p>Oh, and compliance? You need an audit trail for compliance. A bunch of emails is not an audit trail. You’ve got to record the decision in an organized way–like in a spreadsheet. Ugh spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Of course, some customers have a Slack channel for requests instead of emails. As the organization grows with multiple IT members, they often have a generic channel for access requests (or perhaps you’re just using the general IT team chat). But now you have to hope your request isn’t missed or forgotten in the buffer.</p>
<p>And you still need an audit trail for compliance. And a way to make sure things get done</p>
 The Solution: YeshID’s Access Workflow 
<p>We listened to them, and YeshID solved that problem a while ago. Anyone can go to their YeshID console and request an app, and YeshID will manage everything downstream. Anyone who’s clicked on the “Get Started Now” button on the YeshID website, that is.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.yeshid.com/signup"></a></p>
<p>Hint: click <a href="https://app.yeshid.com/signup">here</a> or on the button to Get Started Now,</p>
<p>If you’ve signed up for YeshID, here’s how it works:</p>
 
 Go to <a href="https://app.yeshid.com">https://app.yeshid.com</a> 
 Click on “My Apps” 
 Click on “Request an application.” 
 Pick the application or request a different one if the one you want isn’t on the list 
 
<p>And you’re done.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID generates a task and gets it to the right person–approver or admin–depending on how you’ve set things up. YeshIID tracks actions and notifies the requester when the request has been completed.</p>
<p>Having YeshID manage the process and provide the artifacts needed for compliance is better than an unmanaged collection (mess) of emails or Slack messages that you have to round up and put into a spreadsheet.</p>
 Even Better: Request Directly from Slack 
<p>But why even switch focus from Slack to YeshID?</p>
<p>With YeshID’s new Slack integration, you make the request right in Slack—no tool switching. And even better, you can request an application for someone else. Here’s how it works.</p>
 
 Just type <code>/request</code> 
 YeshID will pop up a request form in Slack 
 
<p></p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll see if you were part of T’s Tangerine Organization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And the image below&nbsp; how it would look if you wanted to make a request for Figma on behalf of a guy named Steve Jobs. (Not that Steve Jobs. That one has ceased to be, expired and gone to meet his maker, is bereft of life, rests in peace… see <a href="http://montypython.50webs.com/scripts/Series_1/53.htm">Monty Python Dead Parrot Sketch</a>. This is another Steve Jobs.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The request goes straight to YeshID and gets forwarded to the right approver or administrator. YeshID monitors the entire process and constructs an audit trail. When approval has been granted, YeshID notifies both the person who has been given access and the person who requested it for them. No loose ends. All loops closed.</p>
<p>Ready to Revolutionize Your Access Management?</p>
<p>Don’t let outdated processes hold you back. Embrace YeshID and experience:</p>
 
 Increased productivity 
 Enhanced security 
 Simplified compliance 
 Happier employees and IT staff 
 
<p>Start your journey to streamlined access management today with YeshID!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the difference between the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK and Microsoft Entra PowerShell modules?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra PowerShell is a part of our increased investment in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. It brings high-quality and scenario-optimized Entra resource management to the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. Still, it keeps all the benefits of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK for authorization, connection management, error handling, and (low-level) API coverage. As Microsoft Entra PowerShell builds on the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, it is completely interoperable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module compatible with Microsoft Graph PowerShell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. You don't need to switch if you’ve already used the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module. Both modules work well together, and whether you use Entra module cmdlets or Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK cmdlets for Entra resources is a matter of preference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to migrate from the deprecated AzureAD or MSOnline modules. Should I wait for Microsoft Entra PowerShell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. One of our goals with Microsoft Entra PowerShell is to help you migrate from Azure AD PowerShell more quickly by setting Enable-EntraAzureADAlias. Microsoft Entra PowerShell supports simplified migration for scripts that were using AzureAD PowerShell, with over 98% compatibility. However, the legacy AzureAD and MSOnline PowerShell modules are deprecated and will be retired (stop working) after March 30, 2025. We recommend that you act now to begin migrating your MSOnline and AzureAD PowerShell scripts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both modules use the latest Microsoft Graph APIs. For test environments and non-production systems, you can migrate to Microsoft Entra PowerShell. We recommend migrating to this module for production systems only after it reaches general availability. If you migrate scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK now, there is no need to update them again with Microsoft Entra PowerShell, as it enhances and will not replace Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I update Microsoft Graph PowerShell scripts to Microsoft Entra PowerShell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not necessary but a matter of preference. Microsoft Entra PowerShell is part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell solution, and the two modules are interoperable. You can install both modules side-by-side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Microsoft Entra PowerShell add support for more resources in the future?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it is a long-term investment. We will continue to expand support for more resources and scenarios over time. Expect new cmdlets for Privileged Identity Management (PIM), Entitlement Management, Tenant Configuration settings, Per-User multifactor authentication (MFA), and more. We'll also enhance existing cmdlets with additional parameters, detailed help, and intuitive names. Check out <a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/entra-powershell">GitHub repo</a> for ongoing updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Microsoft Entra PowerShell use a pre-consented app like AzureAD or MSOnline modules?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. Microsoft Entra PowerShell permissions aren't preauthorized, and users must request the specific app permissions needed. This granularity ensures that the application has only the necessary permissions, providing granular control over resource management. For maximum flexibility and granularity in application permissions, we recommend <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/entra-powershell/create-custom-application">using your own application identity</a> with Entra PowerShell. By creating different applications for different uses of PowerShell in your tenant, you can have exacting control over application permissions granted for specific scenarios. To use your own application identity with Microsoft Entra PowerShell, you can use the Connect-Entra cmdlet:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Connect-Entra -ClientId 'YOUR_APP_ID' -TenantId 'YOUR_TENANT_ID'&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you still relying on traditional passwords to authenticate users, even while cyber threats grow more sophisticated today? This article will examine passkey authentication work, a modern digital identity verification and security solution. You’ll learn everything about passkey authentication work, from its basic principles to its practical applications, along with the advantages and challenges it presents. By the end, you’ll gain valuable insights to determine if passkey authentication is suitable for enhancing your organization’s digital user verification and security.</p>
 
Traditional Methods vs. Passkey Authentication 
<p>While familiar and straightforward, the traditional password system presents numerous security challenges. These challenges include susceptibility to brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries numerous combinations to guess the password, and phishing attacks, where a user is tricked into revealing their password.<br>
Passkeys mitigate these risks effectively. They provide an additional or an alternative to passwords as a layer of security by issuing a new and unique code for every authentication attempt.<br>
Unlike static passwords, which are vulnerable to reuse in multiple services, passkeys are service-specific and time-bound. This dynamic nature makes it significantly more challenging for unauthorized users to access an account.<br>
If an attacker were to gain your static password, they could use it repeatedly until you notice and take action. With passkeys, however, each code is invalidated after use or after the expiration of a predetermined time, thus nullifying this type of attack vector.</p>
 
Layers of Security: Multi-Factor Authentication 
<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly enhances account security by requiring two or more independent credentials: what the user knows (password), what the user has (security token or phone), and what the user is (biometric verification).<br>
The first layer is typically the password, which the user sets and knows. The second layer, a passkey, is often generated and stored on a users device or within a browser.<br>
Implementing MFA means that even if one layer is compromised, the likelihood of an unauthorized individual gaining access is significantly reduced.<br>
For instance, if your password were to be compromised, an attacker would still need to pass the subsequent layers of authentication, such as the passkey or biometric scan, to access your account.<br>
This multi-layered approach is increasingly considered best practice in cybersecurity to protect against a broad range of attacks and vulnerabilities.</p>
 The Authentication Sequence 
<p>When you try to log into a secure site, a unique passkey is made just for that attempt. It’s like when a game show host says, “Here’s the public key and the private key for your special question.Once the passkey is created and registered, it is stored on your device and can be used to access the associated website or app. To log in, simply select the saved passkey and authenticate using your device’s screen lock, such as a fingerprint sensor or facial recognition.<br>
The passkey is a permanent digital credential that replaces traditional usernames and passwords, providing a seamless and secure login experience without the need to enter anything manually each time.</p>
 
Types of Passkeys 
<p>Not all keys look the same, and neither do all passkeys. Some passkeys stored are a mix of letters and numbers. Others are just numbers but have a time limit, like a game you must beat before time runs out. Some people even use their fingerprints as a passkey.<br>
The type of passkey you use depends on what you’re trying to keep safe. If it’s just an email account, maybe a simple passkey sent through text is enough. But if it’s something like your bank account, you might want more layers, like a fingerprint plus a time-sensitive code.</p>
 
Encryption and Secure Transmission 
<p>Imagine you’re passing a secret note in class. You wouldn’t want anyone else to read it. That’s why you might write it in code or a language only you and your friend understand. This is similar to what encryption does for passkey, unlike passwords and cryptographic keys.<br>
When a passkey is sent to you, it’s scrambled into a code. This scrambled version is the only thing that gets sent over the internet. Even if someone catches it, like catching your secret note, they can’t read it because it’s still in code. Only your device knows how to unscramble it back into the same passkey you can use.</p>
 
Advantages of Passkey Authentication 
 
Security Benefits 
<p>One significant advantage of using passkeys is that they add an extra layer of security key safety to your online activities. Passkeys are often temporary, unlike traditional passwords that remain the same until you decide to change them.<br>
They expire after a short time or after you’ve used them, making them useless to anyone who tries to misuse them later. Another upside of traditional passwords is that passkeys are generated on the spot and sent to you directly; they are much harder for hackers to predict or intercept.<br>
This makes them a sturdy barrier against unauthorized access to Google accounts and user devices, effectively acting like a changing lock that keeps potential intruders guessing.</p>
 
User Convenience 
<p>While high security is crucial, it shouldn’t come at the cost of making life difficult for the user. Passkeys are often simpler to use than they sound. Typically, they are sent directly to a device that you already have on you, like your mobile device PIN or phone.<br>
There’s no need to memorize complex combinations of weak passwords or carry additional hardware. Moreover, because a new passkey is generated each time, the user is less pressured to create and remember a strong password. You don’t need to keep track of a complex string of characters; the passkey system handles the complexity.</p>
 
Scalability and Compatibility 
<p>Passkey systems are highly scalable and can easily expand as a business or organization grows. They can be implemented on various platforms and are usually compatible with existing software and hardware. This makes them a flexible option for both small businesses and large enterprises.<br>
Regarding compatibility, many passkey systems can be integrated into existing multi-factor authentication setups. Adding passkey authentication often doesn’t require an overhaul of the user’s current security system, making it a cost-effective upgrade.</p>
 Passkey Authentication in Corporate Security 
<p>In a business setting, protecting sensitive data is paramount. Passkey authentication is increasingly used to ensure only authorized employees can access crucial company information. Depending on the employee’s role, the passkey support system can be customized to provide different access levels.<br>
Moreover, since passkeys replacing passwords are often combined with other forms of authentication, they help create a robust security environment against remote attacks. This makes it difficult for potential intruders to gain unauthorized access to remote servers, safeguarding the company’s intellectual and financial assets.</p>
 
Use in Financial Transactions 
<p>Regarding banking and financial transactions, the stakes for security are incredibly high. Any vulnerability can lead to financial loss or identity theft. This is why many financial institutions turn to passkey technology for user authentication.<br>
Passkeys’ temporary nature and direct delivery to the user’s device make them a robust security measure for online financial activities. The use of passkeys as authentication factors can also streamline the user experience.<br>
For instance, during a financial transaction, a passkey can be quickly sent to the user’s device, reducing the steps needed to verify the user’s identity and making the process more efficient while maintaining high-security standards.</p>
 
Public and Government Sector Adoption 
<p>The need for secure passkey authentication and public key cryptography isn’t limited to corporations and financial institutions.<br>
Government agencies and public services also handle sensitive information and require high levels of security. Passkey authentication offers a feasible and efficient solution for these sectors.<br>
In many cases, government systems have to be accessible to the public for services like tax filing, voting, or accessing personal records.<br>
Passkey authentication provides a user-friendly yet secure method of using cryptographic private keys to facilitate these interactions, maintaining the integrity of data breaches in the system while ensuring ease of use for the general population.</p>
 
Security Vulnerabilities 
<p>While passkey authentication provides significant advantages, it is not entirely foolproof. For instance, if the device receiving the passkey is compromised, the user’s entire system’s integrity could be at risk. Malware or keyloggers on your smartphone or nearby device could potentially intercept passkeys, rendering the added layer of security ineffective.<br>
At the end of the encrypted call, there’s the possibility of ‘Man-in-the-Middle’ attacks, where an unauthorized entity intercepts the passkey during transmission. While encryption methods are generally strong enough to withstand such attempts, the risk of data breach, although low, still exists.</p>
 
Usability Concerns 
<p>The effectiveness of a security key system also depends on its ease of use. If users find a system cumbersome or confusing, they might avoid using it, compromising security.<br>
For instance, older adults or people not comfortable with technology might find the login process of receiving and inputting a passkey too complex, leading to resistance to adopting this security method.<br>
Also, the dependence on a single device, like a mobile phone, to receive a passkey can be problematic. If the phone is lost, broken, or out of battery, the user’s devices could get locked out of essential services until the issue is resolved.</p>
 
Cost and Complexity of Implementation 
<p>Switching to or adding security keys to a passkey or passwordless authentication-only system is not always straightforward. It requires investment in the technology and could necessitate updates or changes to existing operating systems, too.<br>
This can be a significant challenge for small businesses or organizations with limited resources. A new system will often require staff training who manage it and user education. This entails additional costs and effort, and the transition period could pose temporary but disruptive challenges.</p>
 
Implementation Best Practices 
 
Choosing the Right Passkey Tool 
<p>The first step in implementing passkey authentication is choosing the system that best fits the needs of the organization or service. Factors to consider include the level of security required, ease of use for the target audience, and compatibility with existing systems. Additionally, it’s advisable to opt for plans that offer strong encryption and reliable delivery methods for the user’s passkeys.</p>
 
Technical Requirements 
<p>Before deployment, organizations must ensure their infrastructure is compatible with the new passkey authentication system. This may require hardware and software upgrades or the integration of new modules into the current systems. A well-defined technical requirement will facilitate a smoother transition and mitigate potential challenges.</p>
 
Training and Awareness Programs 
<p>Security measures are most effective when users understand how and why they work. Training programs should be initiated to educate users and administrators about the new system.<br>
This can range from simple guides and FAQs to more intensive training sessions for staff responsible for system management. Ongoing awareness programs can help maintain high levels of compliance and effectiveness.</p>
 Technological Advancements on the Horizon 
<p>Passkey authentication will likely evolve with advancements in biometric authentication and sensor technology. Future systems might incorporate biometrics or behavioral traits as additional forms of biometric authentication of passkeys. There’s also a potential for integrating Artificial Intelligence to detect unauthorized activities more efficiently, making the system even more secure.</p>
 
Integrating with Other Authentication Methods 
<p>As public key cryptography and private key technology evolve, passkey authentication is expected to become more sophisticated and may integrate seamlessly with biometric data and other authentication methods. Combining passkeys with biometrics or hardware tokens can create an even more robust security landscape, offering identity providers high security and user convenience.</p>
<p>Throughout this discussion, we have unpacked the complexities of passkey authentication, shedding light on its benefits, technical implementations, and security best practices.

<p>You have a problem. You see the looming effects of climate change and want to ensure a livable future for your children, but the money you are investing to support your children when they grow up is in mutual funds that likely support fossil fuel companies, arms manufacturers, and others directly responsible for the destruction of our climate.&nbsp;</p><p>The money that you hope will give your children a future is also actively destroying that future.</p><p>There is a new push into ethical funds which are meant to avoid these pitfalls, but these funds are limited in their investment opportunities and the tools for you to audit their activities are in their infancy. This article seeks to expand perspectives on better investing.</p><p>What if you could invest in the environment, in efforts for climate justice, in carbon markets, and systemic change? What if you could invest in a future that you and your children want to live in?&nbsp;</p><blockquote>What we need are new ways of expressing the very real value of these resources so that we can bring them into the system, investing in their preservation and growth. What we need is for our economies to not be at odds with our ecosystems.</blockquote><p>Let me introduce the concept of Regenerative Economics (Regen). The idea is to account for all the costs and values that are missed by traditional economics. That means both social effects, and externalities like carbon emissions.</p><p>If a marsh is drained to allow for a new property development, there is a loss of habitat for important species, there is a release of stored carbon and also a loss of future carbon sequestering and oxygen producing capacity by all of the plants and algae, and then there is a loss of the recreation space which is enjoyed people who live in the area. And all of this before we account for the carbon burned by the construction of the shopping centers and roads and homes that replace the original habitat. These are material and social costs that are paid by local residents, future generations, and the ecosystem as a whole. There is also an economic benefit to the developers, investors, and community members who use the services and spaces of the new development. These benefits and costs both matter, but our current economy only has methods to account for the expenses and value of the development, forgetting the value of the marsh and costs of its loss. Sometimes environmental offsets are bought to compensate, but the specificities are largely unaccounted for. Instead, those socio-ecological losses are termed “externalities” and considered outside the system.&nbsp;</p><p>But, you and I both know that these losses are not external to our lives. The loss of a local wetland, or our favorite childhood hike, or the salmon runs that bring life to our local rivers all impact us and our families for generations. </p><p>What we need are new ways of expressing the very real value of these resources so that we can bring them into the system, investing in their preservation and growth. What we need is for our economies to not be at odds with our ecosystems.</p> Case Studies <p>Two leading projects in the Holochain Ecosystem are attempting to solve pieces of this conundrum. One, Kwaxala, is building financial tools for investing in the environments we want to preserve; and the other, IOEN (the Internet of Energy Network), is connecting global finance to the local renewables that need to be developed. Together, they represent the beginning of a movement for ethical investment and regenerative economics.</p><p>Let’s start with IOEN.&nbsp;</p> IOEN <p>Renewable energy is the future. If our civilization has a future, we will have to shift to more sustainable methods for meeting our energy needs. That much is clear. It’s also clear that fossil fuel companies are resistant to this change, and that large solar and wind farms can only be one part of the solution. Small scale local energy production will be a large portion of the global market. Minigrids and Microgrids are emerging as solutions that are more efficient and resilient as they don’t need the massive infrastructure of energy distribution on top of the infrastructure of production. Energy is generated, stored, traded, and used locally.</p><p>The pathway to fully clean, tradable energy is not immediate. On the way to full access to clean energy, organizations including large corporations are taking seriously the responsibility to offset their production of carbon emissions. A factory produces a lot of carbon, both from the energy it uses and the industrial processes themselves. They can get their electricity from renewable sources, but depending on where a particular factory is and when they are operating, they might not have access to renewables. Renewable energy generation is subject to location, geography, and access to resources like wind, enough sunshine, and the ability to store electricity.</p><blockquote>What if you could invest in the environment, in efforts for climate justice, in carbon markets, and systemic change? What if you could invest in a future that you and your children want to live in?</blockquote><p>But, just because they are incapable of directly using renewable energy doesn’t mean that they cannot support the use of renewables generally. Environmental Attribute Credits (EACs), including carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), help create incentives to invest, support, and use renewable energy.</p><p>Currently, large renewable energy farms can sell carbon credits or RECs (depending on the system used), helping corporations offset their carbon emissions. But these are economies of scale. The accounting needed to get government issuance of these carbon credits only works at large scales (a single electrical meter is a lot easier to measure and monitor than many distributed meters). IOEN is providing a way for small scale energy producers who serve their local communities to aggregate their energy production and access global renewable certificate markets.</p><p>In order to ensure auditability and to account for distributed energy production by a collection of small holders, data is needed to track energy production. IOEN’s current work with partners in Asia is helping companies and home owners provide two types of data. First, photos of their solar arrays, preferably at the time of installation. Secondly, ongoing readings from their meter, showing the energy that they feed back to their local grid. IOEN’s partners then add satellite data which is used to confirm the installation of solar panels at the sites claimed. All of this data becomes available to regulators who can cross reference each source, ensuring that the meter readings match the expected generation range for the panels.&nbsp;</p><p>Aggregating the data of many individual producers allows IOEN to meet the scale requirements to work with government regulators, procuring and then selling the certificates to corporations. As each individual energy producer’s contributions to this larger pool is tracked, they are able to then be compensated directly in relation to the amount of energy they produced.</p><p>Key to IOEN’s value in the market is the ability for clients to store the data (meter data, photographs etc.) in private networks hosted on Holochain which provides auditors with assurance that the certificates minted are validated and true. This creates transparency and integrity in the certificate. IOEN’s blockchain solutions that sit on top of that data then allow secondary markets to emerge, along with fractionalised investment opportunities in these renewable assets, creating liquidity. Because transactions are all tracked on the blockchain, and linked to secure data in Holochain, different organizations involved in the assets all can be paid seamlessly and transparently through fractionalised payments. Already small businesses, communities, and large corporations are seeing the value in this approach for a number of energy-related environmental assets.</p> Kwaxala <p>Kwaxala is an indigenous forest regeneration cooperative taking a different approach to nature protection that goes far beyond carbon credits.</p><p>Rather than focusing on energy production, they are concerned with the preservation and stewardship of what we already have. Remember that marsh? We agreed that it has a value. And the question is: how can we invest in that value? Kwaxala is making that a possibility. Most land used for logging, oil drilling and fracking, and other resource extraction is government owned and often in contradiction with recognised Indigenous land rights in the area. Companies own or buy the permits and right to extract resources from that land, without buying the land itself. Kwaxala is working to buy those same rights, but rather than using them for extraction, they are securing the right to protect and regenerate the ecosystems threatened by extraction. This legal guarantee of preservation, in an area previously at genuine threat of extraction, is then used to generate carbon offsets each year which can be sold to corporations meeting their net zero commitments.</p><blockquote>This rich dataset then provides detailed provenance for both the particular offsets generated by the protected ecosystems and for the long term investments in the ecosystems themselves so that there is detailed visibility into the health and stewardship of the ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Kwaxala offsets not only represent sequestered carbon, but also a wider range of monetized ecoservices such as biodiversity protection and ecosystem preservation alongside positive social outcomes such as Indigenous equity and reconciliation. This enables them to command a premium market price per tonne. Additionally, by enabling capital investment directly into the organization holding the right to regenerate, they provide a new way for investment funds to flow into the asset value of the protected natural ecosystem, generating much needed upfront capital to establish these protected areas and counterbalance the extractive economic pressure to destroy the area.</p><p>But how do we ensure that the land is well taken care of? Here Kwaxala is using overlapping datasets to build a picture of the ecosystem and its health. Working with Indigenous land stewards, who are also the principal shareholders in Kwaxala itself, they are developing the metrics needed to monitor and support the wellbeing of the particular ecosystems. For some situations, that might be the water and air quality; for others, it might be the presence of indicator species; for many, it will be the conglomeration of multiple data points, collaborating to tell a story. This rich dataset then provides detailed provenance for both the particular offsets generated by the protected ecosystems and for the long term investments in the ecosystems themselves so that there is detailed visibility into the health and stewardship of the ecosystem.</p><p>To collect, manage, and maintain this data — and to share it with community members, government regulators, and investors — they are investigating the development of a distributed platform, built on Holochain. Building on Holochain in this case ensures that control of the data isn’t managed solely by the organization claiming to be protecting the ecosystem, but is rather distributed between all stakeholders. With data provenance baked in, it is also easy to track exactly what agent adds any particular piece of data. This combination of verification and distributed storage of overlapping datasets allows for a high degree of trust to be developed, and holds the organization itself accountable.</p><blockquote>...we start to see the potential for a new regenerative economics to be developed. Based not on extraction, but rather the regenerative value of all ecosystem activities.</blockquote> Going Long on the Climate <p>In his book The Ministry for the Future, Kim Stanley Robinson introduces the idea of going long on the climate — basically, investing in our futures. As popular opinion shifts to focus on the climate crisis, we can expect the economic value of climate mitigation strategies to rise. One of the biggest issues to date in the space is a lack of reliable investment opportunities. With the capacities for data provenance that Holochain provides, investors can have more transparent access to the assets they are investing in.</p><p>There isn’t a one size fits all approach here. In comparison to the global replication of industry, climate mitigation is about <a href="https://hackernoon.com/economies-of-specificity?ref=blog.holochain.org">economies of specificity</a>, because ecosystems are specific to their place and relationships.</p><p>Holochain is designed so individual applications can be customized to their particular context, while still being compatible with each other. This gives the flexibility needed for hyper-specific economies to interact with the global market in accountable ways. Add to this <a href="https://hrea.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">innovative accounting methods</a> being developed on the framework and we start to see the potential for a new regenerative economics to be developed. Based not on extraction, but rather the regenerative value of all ecosystem activities.&nbsp;</p> Early Entry into a New Economy <p>The projects outlined above are only first steps towards solving your original problem. You want a way to invest in a future for yourself and your children. A future not only rich in a financial sense, but also an experiential one. Quality of life hinges on the environment and the wellbeing of our society.&nbsp;</p><p>There won’t be any single bulletproof investing strategy, but it’s going to take a multiplicity of tactics to address climate change. Looking at these pilots, we feel that the best way to diversify and to be an early investor in the regenerative economy is to go out and build it. We are looking for more projects innovating in this space. It’s going to take new business structures, financial tools, and community initiatives to shift the landscape and to build a thriving economy. But let’s thrive together, building on real tangible things, building on relationships with the nature we cherish.</p>

             June 2024   
	 
		 
			 Tokenized Securities Unaffected by MiCA, Utility Tokens and Stablecoins Face Stricter Rules 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>As the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is set to partially become applicable&nbsp;on 30th June 2024, it is crucial to understand its implications for various types of crypto-assets. While tokenized securities remain largely unaffected by MiCA, utility tokens and stablecoins will face significantly stricter regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>MiCA introduces comprehensive measures to regulate the crypto-asset market, providing much-needed clarity. However, it’s important to note that&nbsp;MiCA does not apply to crypto-assets qualifying as financial instruments, such as transferable securities. These assets continue to fall under the existing regulatory framework of MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II). This provides clear guidance to securities’ issuers.</p>
<p>In contrast,&nbsp;MiCA imposes significant new requirements on utility tokens and stablecoins, fundamentally changing how these assets can be issued and managed. Most cash equivalent tokens currently use the ERC-20 token standard, which lacks owner identification capabilities. Under MiCA, issuers might need to consider a transition to the&nbsp;ERC-3643 token standard to issue permissioned tokens, enabling the necessary compliance features such as owner identification and additional controls.</p>
<p>In addition, providers of services linked to crypto-assets may have to obtain a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP) license. Obtaining such a license would involve considerable financial and time investments. To some extent,&nbsp;the complexity and costly legal processes could make issuing security tokens easier than issuing utility tokens and stablecoins under MiCA.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the stricter but clear regulations present opportunities for&nbsp;large institutions such as banks to tokenize cash, providing institutionally acceptable money onchain, which is missing today.&nbsp;They are likely to issue permissioned cash coins to enforce compliance, as we discussed in the previous newsletter “<a href="https://csqny04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VVxqrs54ScBmW8y7vlW2Nh3VjW7HlLKX5gQClQN9k7Mbb3qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3myW5tBQN98Z5hL_VhrCLX5BrzP3VzWR3s4w4yykW8lwFvr3TgQkhW4w8Xcq6_7dmhW1flrsg32LtRxW3_rYy35KL1yFW2Hs1y_35jRCRW90NyVs7-hzRXW7zzmpD7m6p8MW12BNJj5xyVGSW5rTFpr8R5-XzW7_ZcFq14xcwWN2FDpsKBTtg2N8pW667XsjsrW7DyR5k70HmJNW6hWYXF7PZvkdW48p9sb1_TL2RW5hWWWc2C12yvVxSbX18R5m-3W5ZPQfZ3FrL7LW6Ghxv28HlT0qW31FG2R4CT-gYW6l7yyM5ZSbySW3nMCZz46lhq5W1gkJLg1Khrnvf1pw0C804">Institutional RWA Tokenization Needs Permissioned Cash Coins</a>”.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, we are well-positioned to leverage these opportunities. Our technology enables both payment coins and securities issuers to&nbsp;identify token holders, track ownership, and enforce automated compliance onchain, which is increasingly crucial as regulations tighten.</p>
<p>This is a historic moment for Europe to position itself as the hub of institutional tokenization, we are excited for what’s coming!</p>

<p>Urban <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> has undergone considerable expansion thanks to the digitalization of its services, made more accessible through a simple application. A societal topic thanks to its public service quality, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marteau-urban-mobility-and-carsharing/">urban mobility</a> contributes not only to the inclusiveness of certain populations, but also to the <a href="https://cor.europa.eu/en/engage/studies/Documents/The%20New%20Urban%20Mobility%20Initiative%20Can%20it%20deliver%20inclusive%20local%20mobility%20needs%20and%20European%20decarbonisation%20goals%20at%20the%20same%20time.pdf">reduction of carbon-based transport</a>. Urban mobility plays a key role in our strategy to combat global warming, by encouraging the use of public transport through the connection of different transport offers, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility</a> and car-sharing.</p>



<p>To encourage the use of public transport, various pricing initiatives have been put in place. For example, reduced-price season tickets have been introduced for certain categories of the population, such as students. These age-based fares are offered by many transport networks in Germany as well as in France, such as <a href="https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en">Île de France Mobilités</a> or <a href="https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-france/mainline-cards-and-fares/avantage-card/avantage-jeune/">SNCF</a>, with offers reserved for those under 26 or senior citizens.</p>



<p>While such measures encourage the adoption of these services, they also open the door to fraudulent practices, with harmful consequences. It therefore seems necessary to provide solutions in terms of age verification of users, to guarantee a fair and efficient service and avoid attempts at fraud and identity theft.</p>



 The importance of discounted fares in urban mobility. 



<p>Discounted tickets exist on many types of platforms and services. From telecom operators to streaming or cultural services, there is a plethora of places offering this type of service. In the field of transport, it is a social policy tool, where the existence of specific offers according to age and income categories promotes access to transport for different categories of the population.</p>



<blockquote><p>The introduction of reduced fares for young people is justified by a number of social and equity considerations: young people are often dependent on public transport (lack of driver’s license and/or vehicle).</p>Île de France Mobilités</blockquote>



<p>These special fares are also used by transport companies as a means of building customer loyalty. However, in a tense economic climate, it is sometimes tempting for users who are not entitled to special fares to abuse the loopholes in a subscription system in order to benefit from them. As a result, mobility providers are increasingly detecting fraud in this area. This may involve the use of false identity documents to take advantage of discounts, or the theft of another person’s identity.</p>



<p>The impact of such fraud is twofold: not only does it adversely affect the revenues of transport operators, it also limits the scope of these offers and the fairness between users. However, it is possible to curb this damaging occurence with online identity verification solutions, which are transparent and easy for the user.</p>



 Combating fraud through identity verification. 



<p>Traditionally, age verification on public transport has been carried out by means of identity documents presented when purchasing season tickets. The possibility of subscribing to these services online has made it easier to commit fraud and obtain discounted fares. It is now easy for anyone to forge an identity document, thanks to editing software that has become readily available.</p>



<p>At the same time, anti-fraud and identity verification technologies have also become more sophisticated, providing even more secure and appropriate responses.</p>



<p>For a transport operator, using these solutions means effectively guarding against identity fraud during the subscription process. They also ensure that users benefiting from an offer are indeed who they say they are.</p>



<p>IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> is a solution that has been used for many years in banking and financial services, but is now proving its worth in the mobility and transport sector. By verifying a user’s identity document and photo, IDnow ensures that users are thoroughly screened and their age confirmed in just a few steps:</p>



  The user submits an identity document when subscribing to the offer;  A biometric capture (facial recognition or live detection) is then performed to obtain a correlation with the user making the subscription;  The document is then analyzed by our APIs to verify its authenticity, and cross-referenced with the biometric capture for comparison. This ensures that it is the same person;  The account is validated in a matter of seconds, based on the results.  



<p>Transparent to the user, the identity verification solution is easily integrated into a mobile or web application via our SDK.</p>



<p>Using this solution limits the risk of identity theft, as the user cannot use someone else’s document to subscribe to an offer. Any alteration is identified and forces the user to terminate the subscription process.</p>



 Safer access to offers for both operators and users. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">constantly evolving</a> mobility sector has undergone digital transformations that have revolutionized our habits. At the same time, fraudsters have adapted to these new operating modes, impacting the economic efficiency of various players. Age and identity verification provides transport operators with the guarantee that their users have access to the offers they are entitled to. </p>



<p>Identity verification solutions can be seamlessly integrated into the user journey, simplifying the user experience. In addition to contributing to the fight against fraud, identity verification solutions help improve operators’ economic efficiency. As a result, they are able to enhance their transport offering, as well as the quality of their services. In the end, all users benefit from these measures.</p>

 Shifting through the noise in the age of information overload — the power of evidence synthesis <p>It is hard for organizations that address complex social, economic, and environmental challenges to determine what strategies may have the greatest impact. This should be easier with more organizations publishing what they learn and AI tools supporting efficient curation of insights. In reality, the vast amount of data generated is met with overwhelm, and impact-focused organizations struggle to determine what data can be meaningfully used to support their strategic ambitions and what is just&nbsp;noise.</p><p>Over the past ten years of working with foundations, government agencies, and private sector organizations, <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou Digital</a> has found that impact evidence synthesis is one of the more powerful tools to support strategic decisions. Evidence synthesis is the process of compiling and analyzing multiple studies to provide comprehensive impact insights on a set of interventions or products.</p><p>In this article, we share our experience of the value that evidence synthesis has catalyzed, the need to improve prevailing impact evidence synthesis norms, and how we have refined our evidence synthesis processes and products to drive impactful decisions.</p> The power of leveraging collective insights <p>Organizations that address complex social, economic, and environmental challenges are not doing it alone. Scattered across the internet and within these organizations’ own knowledge management systems, there is an abundance of insights that could be harnessed to explore the pertinent questions of what works, under what conditions, and for whom. Impact evidence synthesis brings these insights together.</p><p>Individual research efforts provide puzzle pieces that evidence synthesis assembles to create the impact picture. It adds immense value&nbsp;by:</p>  Generating a holistic view: Combining varied perspectives provides a comprehensive view of an issue, allowing for inclusive assessments of what works and what is untested.  Optimizing resources: Identifying promising interventions and avoiding duplicating those with limited impact are valuable tactics in light of finite resources.  Enabling adaptive strategies: Creating an information infrastructure supports agile strategic responses to the changing social and economic landscape.  <p>By basing actions and investment decisions on a curated body of evidence, organizations can establish a clear and justified basis while also building an evidence ecosystem and infrastructure that encourages a collective approach to engaging in shared&nbsp;issues.</p> Challenges within the prevailing forms of impact evidence synthesis <p>There are two phases to unlocking the value of evidence synthesis. The first is intentionality on what is included in a given synthesis, and the second is ensuring the outputs are delivered in ways that support access and — fundamentally — the use of evidence. While there are diverse views on these phases, there are dominant practices. These dominant practices serve some sectors well; in others, they present challenges that can limit their value. Two of the main challenges are:</p>  A bias toward experimental methods: In some sectors, an exclusive focus on one methodology can be challenging for numerous reasons, including issues of power, diversity, and representation, and discounting early insights in emerging and rapidly changing sectors — like digital — where experimental evidence may not be available when investment decisions are being&nbsp;made.  Static representation: Evidence synthesis products often exist as static narratives that summarize the state of evidence. The last decade has seen an increase in evidence maps: graphic representations of the landscape of impact evidence plotted against a set of interventions and outcomes. Maps vary but are usually one-off and focus on visualizing the number of studies rather than the insights gained from them. Unless they are accompanied by narrative summaries, evidence maps leave impact insights on the table. Like all knowledge products, content and medium directly affect engagement and use by different audiences.  <p>At Caribou Digital, we have struggled with these prevailing norms and forms, which sparked our work to innovate and improve the practice of evidence synthesis.</p> How we’ve refined our approach to connect insights to decisions <p>Our approach seeks to provide timely insights with rigor, context, and diversity of perspectives. Five elements distinguish our evidence synthesis approach:</p>  Iterative Theory of Change: Designed with thematic experts, the Theory of Change outlines impact pathways for specific issues as the basis of the synthesis.  Diverse and credible impact methodologies: Experimental and theoretical approaches each offer important views on the evidence. We need both and include&nbsp;both.  Impact results: We include a view of the volume of data points that initiated positive, negative, or no impact, not just the number of studies on a given&nbsp;topic.  Design and delivery mechanisms of interventions: Interventions or products (e.g., upskilling, e-commerce platforms) are not homogeneous. They have unique design and delivery features that can and do affect their impact. We include these features in our analysis to really drill down into what&nbsp;works.  Contextual insights: Who is being studied and where influences impact. We extract contextual data, leveraging localized evidence to support targeted interventions that are more likely to&nbsp;succeed.  <p>Including and extracting this level of detail from individual studies supports a rapid and deeper interrogation of the impact data — many of these elements are visualized in our existing evidence maps on <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/publication/digital-finance-evidence-map/">digital financial services</a> and <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">digital and data-first approaches to driving small business&nbsp;growth</a>.</p> Transforming the way users interact with evidence synthesis <p>At Caribou Digital, we are proponents of interactive and ongoing evidence synthesis. Our experience delivering interactive evidence synthesis has revealed a strong demand for customized and detailed insights on demand. This entails extracting and synthesizing impact evidence from the database on specific questions, such as “<a href="https://strivecommunity.org/insights/library">What is the impact of market-place platforms on small business growth?</a>” This recurring need has led us to further innovate with evidence outputs to support greater access to insights using generative AI. Below are three ways we share our evidence synthesis outputs:</p>  An interactive impact database holds the raw coded data. Guided by a code book, we can filter, search, and access extracted summary insights and data points from the impact database. This has been a successful format for (manually) mining the database on-demand to craft impact narratives on interventions/products in specific countries on specific segments. All our evidence syntheses have an underlying impact database, resulting in a significant body of evidence on <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/publication/digital-finance-evidence-map/">digital financial services,</a> <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">digital approaches to driving small business growth</a>, digital tools to support women’s economic empowerment, and geospatial data for humanitarian action (forthcoming).  Interactive evidence maps provide a visual overview of the entire impact evidence landscape, plotting interventions to outcomes and the direction of impact. The maps are integral for communicating a snapshot of the impact landscape and quickly discerning where evidence is concentrated. Filter buttons enable users to get more specific on other variables of interest (i.e., methodology, design and delivery mechanisms, country, segment, etc.) Alongside these interactive syntheses, Caribou Digital has crafted dozens of targeted insights for client strategy and the public (e.g., <a href="https://www.financedigitalafrica.org/tag/evidence-gap-map/">DFS</a> and <a href="https://strivecommunity.org/insights/library">small business</a>).  <p>3. A chatbot-based conversational interface queries the impact evidence database using natural language queries. This utilizes language-learning models to interpret queries and return synthesized results from the evidence base, with cited references, allowing users to, for example, type a query “Outline e-commerce products that have positively impacted women’s income in India.” This interface opens up new possibilities to engage with impact evidence, particularly when convenience and speed are prioritized and when supporting greater access to insights for those traditionally marginalized from more complex knowledge products.</p> What’s next <p>This is an exciting time to be working in evidence synthesis. With innovative new tools and processes to work with, there are more possibilities than ever to advance the efficiency, accuracy, diversity, and inclusivity of evidence synthesis. In the coming months, we will share more about our iterations with Gen AI and our approaches to deepening inclusivity and equity within the evidence synthesis process and products. We are keen to connect with users and practitioners alike to refine and perfect these approaches.</p><p>Contact <a href="mailto:niamh@cariboudigital.net">niamh@cariboudigital.net</a> with any feedback or questions about our evidence synthesis approach.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/shifting-through-the-noise-in-the-age-of-information-overload-the-power-of-evidence-synthesis-6157e5bc472a">Shifting through the noise in the age of information overload — the power of evidence synthesis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Munich-based identity pioneer looks back on ten years of revolutionizing the KYC space and doubles down on reusable identities and trust services 



<p>Munich, June 27, 2024 – IDnow, a leading platform provider for identity verification in Europe, is looking back on ten successful years of revolutionizing the German and European Know-Your-Customer (KYC) market and is now doubling down on reusable identities and trust services. Founded in 2014 by Armin Bauer, Sebastian Bärhold, Felix Haas and Dennis von Ferenczy, the Munich-based company’s flagship product at the time was <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">the revolutionary VideoIdent</a>, which had just been allowed by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">BaFin</a>).</p>



 A platform with automated and expert-led solutions that serves all needs 



<p>Since then, a variety of solutions have been added to the portfolio, following market needs and technological trends: the AI-supported, fully automated AutoIdent solution was introduced in 2018, followed by the electronic function of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">German ID card (eID)</a> in 2019. Just last year, IDnow introduced ShopIdent, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">onsite solution for identification</a> in German petrol stations and stores. The transaction figures prove the success of these solutions: Over 13.2 million transactions have been processed via IDnow AutoIdent, while the scale-up looks back on another 13 million successfully identified users with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent</a> to date.</p>



<p>In 2019, Andreas Bodczek was appointed as CEO at IDnow: “We have made it our mission over the past five years to actively shape and lead our industry and show our customers why digital identities are essential to their business. In the last decade, we have grown into a platform provider that serves all market needs with the help of the latest technology. We have earned the trust of our customers because we focus on our core business every day without losing sight of the secular trends that are shaping the market.”</p>



 Munich-based scale-up has long been one of the largest European players 



<p>In 2021, increased expansion opportunities led IDnow to acquire the French market leader for identity verification technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German provider identity Trust Management AG, establishing IDnow as one of the largest European players in the identity industry.</p>



<p>In addition to its traditional financial and telecommunications applications, new growth areas for IDnow have opened up in the mobility and travel industry, online dating, gaming, human resources and social media. Although user needs and regulatory requirements differ greatly from traditional industries, the desire for increased trust in digital transactions has grown across territories, regardless of the use case.</p>



 Reusable identities and trust services determine the future 



<p>The digital identity industry is facing a paradigm shift due to regulations, such as eIDAS 2.0 at the European level or announced changes to the Videoident regulation in Germany. With its more than 900 trusted customers, the company aims to leverage these relationships and take them to the next level by building up its own trust service and a digital identity pool of several million users in the next few years. In doing so, the scale-up intends to lead the way in the transformation of the digital identity market heralded by eIDAS 2.0: European trust services, reusable identities and a fully integrated, broad product portfolio form the basis of the company’s long-term product strategy.</p>



<p>“Today, we are facing a fundamental transformation of our industry – away from the one-time verification process and towards reusable identities – and we will once again lead this revolution,” Bodczek says. “Since its founding, IDnow, with its broad and continually evolving portfolio, has shown a great deal of foresight, resiliency, and adaptability to market developments. With a team of over 450 highly skilled colleagues across ten offices in Europe, we are already one of the largest players in the identity industry. The experience, expertise, and innovation drive that we have assembled in-house make us extremely optimistic about the next ten years of our company and the industry at large,” he concludes.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that the <a href="https://setup.cloud.microsoft/entra/migrate-ad-fs-to-microsoft-entra-id">migration tool</a> for Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) customers to move their apps to Microsoft Entra ID is now generally available! Customers can begin updating their identity management with more extensive monitoring and security infrastructure by quickly identifying which applications are capable of being migrated and assessing all their AD FS applications for compatibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/introducing-ad-fs-application-migration-your-path-to-simplicity/ba-p/3980232">announced AD FS Application Migration</a> would be moving to public preview, and the response from our partners and customers has been overwhelmingly positive. For some, transitioning to cloud-based security is a daunting task, but the tool has proven to dramatically streamline the process of moving to Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simplified workflow, reduced need for manual intervention, and minimized downtime (for applications and end users) have reduced stress for hassle-free migrations.

 A Comprehensive Guide &amp;&nbsp;FAQ  Summary <p>The <a href="https://www.superintelligence.io/">Artificial Superintelligence Alliance</a> (ASI) token merger, involving <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a>, <a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.ai</a>, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, will be implemented in a two-phase process starting on July 1, 2024. Phase 1 will see the consolidation of SingularityNET’s AGIX and Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN tokens into Fetch.ai’s FET, before transitioning to the ASI ticker in Phase&nbsp;2.</p><p>Table of&nbsp;Contents</p>  <a>Phase I&nbsp;Overview</a>  <a>Phase I&nbsp;Timeline</a>  <a>Phase II&nbsp;Overview</a>  <a>Key Dates and Action&nbsp;Items</a>  <a>Your Token Migration Journey</a>  <a>Frequently Asked Questions</a>   Phase I&nbsp;Overview <p>Phase 1 of the ASI migration will be focused on merging the three tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain. Holders on other chains that wish to take part in the token merger during Phase 1 will need to bridge from their respective chains. Users that prefer to wait for the support of other chains such Cardano or Polygon can opt to wait for Phase 2 should they&nbsp;desire.</p>  Rebranding: The project will be rebranded as the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance across major platforms.  Token Merge: AGIX and OCEAN will temporarily merge into FET under the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance&nbsp;banner.  FET Trading: FET markets will remain open under the FET ticker without interruption.   Phase I&nbsp;Timeline   July 1,&nbsp;2024:    Project name and logos&nbsp;updated.  Deposits and withdrawals for AGIX and OCEAN will close in preparation for migration.  FET deposits, withdrawals, and trading will continue as&nbsp;usual.  Migration platform for AGIX and OCEAN to FET opens on the <a href="https://www.singularitydao.ai/migrate-asi">SingularityDAO dApp</a>.  AGIX and OCEAN will begin to be delisted from exchanges.  Spot and perpetual trading will continue under the FET&nbsp;ticker.  <p>*For token holders with funds on centralized exchanges like Binance, no action is required. Your OCEAN and AGIX tokens will automatically convert to FET at the appropriate ratio on July 1st, followed by a smooth transition to ASI in mid-July. Individuals holding their funds in self-custody across the Ethereum mainnet will receive detailed guides and tutorials to facilitate a hassle-free transition.</p> Phase II&nbsp;Overview   Community Onboarding: Phase 2 will focus on community member onboarding, specifically for those who have opted to self-custody their&nbsp;funds.  ASI Deployment: The ASI token will be deployed across&nbsp;chains.  Network Upgrades: Fetch.ai’s network will upgrade to the ASI&nbsp;network.  New Migration Contracts: Introduced for conversion from FET, AGIX, and OCEAN to&nbsp;ASI.  EVM and Bridges: Ethereum Virtual Machine and other bridges will open to facilitate ASI token transfers.  Exchange Migration: Exchanges will begin migrating spot markets from FET to&nbsp;ASI.  If your funds are on centralized exchanges like Binance, no action is required.  <blockquote>Scam Warning: At no point will individuals be required to disclose private information, including seed phrases. Be aware of potential scams during this transition period. Malicious actors may attempt impersonation, spoofing, and social engineering tactics.</blockquote><p>Trust only official sources of information as outlined&nbsp;here:</p>  Official ASI website: <a href="https://www.superintelligence.io/">https://www.superintelligence.io/</a>  Official Fetch.ai website: <a href="https://fetch.ai/">https://fetch.ai/</a>  Official Ocean Protocol website: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">https://oceanprotocol.com/</a>  Official SingularityNET website: <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">https://singularitynet.io/</a>   The Dawn of a Unified AI Ecosystem — Phase&nbsp;I <p>The highly anticipated token merger between Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET is on the horizon. This unique and ambitious undertaking aims to create a powerful and unified Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) ecosystem under the new ASI ticker. This unified network aspires to become the leading force in decentralized AI (decentralized Artificial Intelligence).</p> Key Dates and Action&nbsp;Items <p>As a web3 token holder of FET, AGIX, or OCEAN, understanding the key aspects of this token merger is crucial. Here’s a breakdown of important dates and&nbsp;actions:</p><p>July 1,&nbsp;2024:</p>  Migration Opens: Conversion contracts allowing AGIX and OCEAN holders to convert their tokens to FET will be available.  Deposits and Withdrawals: AGIX, and OCEAN deposits and withdrawals will be halted on exchanges in preparation for the migration process.  AGIX and OCEAN: tokens will be delisted from exchanges.  Branding Changes: Project branding will transition to Artificial Superintelligence Alliance across third-party platforms.   Your Token Migration Journey <p>The token merger will impact your existing tokens. Here’s what you need to&nbsp;know:</p><p>*Exchange-Held Tokens: These tokens will be automatically converted to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Conversion Rates</p><p>The conversion rates are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  AGIX tokens will migrate to $FET at a conversion rate of 1 AGIX to 0.433350&nbsp;$FET.  OCEAN tokens will migrate to $FET at a conversion rate of 1 OCEAN to 0.433226&nbsp;$FET.  <p>*We have received inquiries from numerous exchanges expressing their support for the upcoming token merger. While we appreciate this overwhelming interest, it’s important to mention that we cannot guarantee participation from absolutely every exchange. Our team is diligently working to facilitate widespread support, prioritizing a seamless transition for all token&nbsp;holders.</p><p>Please note there is no immediate urgency to convert your assets during this initial phase. Our current focus lies in the strategic onboarding of supporting platforms, ensuring robust infrastructure is in place before proceeding further.</p> Supported Wallets and Conversion Processes <p>The new ASI token merger will be compatible with all major software wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) and hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) familiar to the respective communities. For manual conversion (on-chain, self-custody):</p><p>During Phase I, the assets will be consolidated across the Ethereum Network with future plans to significantly increase interoperability with other ecosystems such as BNB Chain and Cardano active in Phase&nbsp;2.</p>  Connect your existing wallet to the official conversion portal hosted on the SingularityDAO dApp.  Follow the on-screen instructions to convert your tokens. Example images have been attached to illustrate the process. The first picture depicts the contract approval process. The second picture just below demonstrates the migration confirmation. The final step would be to confirm the transaction through the wallet. Holders working with AGIX, OCEAN or FET for the first time might have to add the token contract to the wallet to ensure balances are properly displayed. A guide on that can be found <a href="https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask/">here</a>. The SingularityDAO conversion portal makes this easy by incorporating an “Add to Wallet’’ feature as part of the migration interface.  <p>Verify the conversion using a block explorer like <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a>. If you’re holding FET for the first time on a wallet such as <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> you may need to add FET as a custom token to ensure that it’s properly displayed in the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Important Reminders:   The conversion window will remain open for years, so there’s no immediate pressure to&nbsp;convert.  Dedicated conversion smart contracts are the only official tools that community members will need to rely on. Expect standard transaction fees, but no additional conversion charges. At no point during the conversion process will you need to input private information including your seed&nbsp;phrase.  With respect to native FET holders, it’s important to note that staked tokens will be automatically migrated during Phase 2. Staking rewards will continue uninterrupted.  Liquidity providers will need to manually withdraw their funds and re-allocate them to updated pools for optimal efficiency. More details will be provided.   The Migration from FET to ASI and the network upgrade — Phase&nbsp;II <p>The final step of the merger involves the migration from the FET token ticker to ASI. During this step, new migration contracts will become available for any AGIX and OCEAN tokens yet to be migrated to FET. Migration contracts will also be deployed for EVM based FET. FET Mainnet Tokens will be automatically converted to ASI as the Fetch.ai mainnet completes its scheduled upgrade. Below you’ll find the specific migration ratios&nbsp;again.</p>  FET tokens will migrate to $ASI at a conversion rate of 1 FET to 1&nbsp;$ASI.  AGIX tokens will migrate to $ASI at a conversion rate of 1 AGIX to 0.433350&nbsp;$ASI.  OCEAN tokens will migrate to $ASI at a conversion rate of 1 OCEAN to 0.433226&nbsp;$ASI.  <p>A non-trivial component of this token migration is the network upgrade, which involves enhancements to the underlying blockchain infrastructure. This upgrade ensures improved performance, security, and scalability for the ASI network. The network engineers and validators will execute a series of precise steps to carry out this&nbsp;upgrade:</p><p>Code Deployment: Engineers will deploy the new codebase to all nodes in the network, incorporating the latest improvements and security&nbsp;patches.</p><p>Smart Contract Migration: Existing smart contracts will be migrated to the new network with necessary updates to ensure compatibility and functionality.</p><p>Node Synchronization: All network nodes will be synchronized to ensure they operate on the same updated protocol&nbsp;version.</p><p>Testing and Validation: Extensive testing will be conducted on a testnet before deploying changes to the mainnet to identify and resolve any&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Final Rollout: Once all components are thoroughly tested, the final rollout will occur, and the network will officially transition to the upgraded&nbsp;state.</p><p>As part of the process, all trading pairs on exchanges will be updated to reflect the new ASI token, and integrations with popular wallet and block explorer providers will be completed to ensure broad accessibility. Additionally, comprehensive resources will be delivered to all stakeholders, including token holders, to provide support and information throughout the transition.</p><p>During the network upgrade, there may be potential network downtime and temporary disruptions on exchanges as they update their markets. It’s important to note that this upgrade is being executed by experienced professionals who have meticulously planned and tested each aspect to ensure a smooth transition. Rest assured, every component of the network upgrade has undergone rigorous testing to minimize any impact on users and maintain the integrity of the network.

<p>This blog is third in a series explaining how Mydex’s personal data infrastructure works. It explains how our platforms help deliver our mission of empowering individuals with their own data, enabling them to use this data to manage their lives better and assert their human rights in a practical way on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>So far in this series we’ve talked about some absolute basics: <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-is-a-personal-data-store-a583f7ef9be3">how personal data stores work</a> and how they enable <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/personal-data-stores-and-data-sharing-1f59f5381c85">a new approach to data sharing</a>. But very often, to get something done, you don’t just need personal data. You also need data about the world out there — data about those aspects of the world which relate directly to your task at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Ideally, what you want to be able to do is to connect your personal data to this relevant info ‘about the world’ so that the two types of data get integrated together, providing everything you need either to make a better decision or to act well on this decision, efficiently and effectively.</p> Today — friction, effort, risk and cost all&nbsp;round <p>Today however, this connection and integration happens only rarely. Usually, the two types of data are kept completely apart, which involves you in all sorts of to-ing and fro-ing, looking for which bits of data are relevant and working out how to bring them together.</p><p>Here’s an everyday example. You need to send something in the post but you don’t know the postcode. So you have to stop what you are doing, search for the right website, enter it, and then once there, search again for the information you need. Then you need to copy the information, leave the web site, and go back to what you were doing. A time consuming, irritating interruption — a classic example of what we call FERC — which stands for Friction, Effort, Risk and&nbsp;Cost.</p><p>This is just a trivial example. It gets more complicated — and the FERC just grows and grows — with more detailed, sensitive information such as the medicines that a patient should be taking, where there are more things to think about such as when you should take what dose, what other medicines you can’t take with it, contra-indications and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>This isn’t personal information as such. It’s information about the drug — information that is very important to the person at this time in this context, because it relates and connects directly to what they need and are trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Most services are made up of these two different types of information: Information about the person themselves and information about some aspect of the world that relates to what the person needs and is trying to achieve. Both types of information are needed if a person is to receive a comprehensive, quality&nbsp;service.</p><p>For example, health and care service providers need to integrate detailed data about the particular individual being cared for (personal data) with data about what services they need, based on their specific health conditions and medications they are to take (data about ‘the world’). This extends to referrals to specific services the individual may want to use as part of getting the support they&nbsp;need.</p><p>Currently, such data is kept separate, making it difficult and time consuming for people (both people needing support and service providers providing the support) to bring it together in a way that speaks directly to that particular person’s situation at that particular time.</p><p>The UK’s NHS has developed painstakingly curated lists of the medications it enables doctors to use, and of health conditions they are likely to come across. These lists are freely available and accessible to everyone&nbsp;… if, that is, you know they exist (in separate websites) and have the time, will and energy to jump through all the hoops you need to access and use&nbsp;them.</p><p>To do this, you first have to find the URL for the website in question (a different search process just to get started); navigate your way through mountains of information that’s not relevant for you; then once you have found, it capture the information in some way (such as copy and paste); go back to what you were originally doing; and find some way to integrate it into what you were trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Very often, well-meaning service providers develop general information packs for people dealing with a particular health condition. Very often these information packs are truly informative and helpful&nbsp;… but to find what’s truly informative and helpful in relation to this particular individual with these particular circumstances the person then has to wade through them, looking for the few bits of information that are particularly relevant to them right&nbsp;now.</p><p>Many people feel overwhelmed and exhausted by such processes. Often they feel overloaded with information, get confused. Sometimes frightened.</p> A breakthrough in service provision <p>We have developed our Master Reference Data service (MRD) to get rid of all this hassle so that people can access exactly the right information that they need, at the right time, from within what they are doing, seamlessly. This means they don’t have to stop what they were trying to do to go searching for&nbsp;it.</p><p>Instead, the individual needing the information (the person themselves or a front line team member in a service provider) can instantly look up exactly the right relevant information, sourced from a reliable, curated source as an integrated part of what they are doing — from within whatever application they are using. Individuals can link it into their own records stored in their Personal Data Store and service providers can use it to build personalised information packs and resources for the people they&nbsp;serve.</p><p>Take the example of a service provider arranging an appointment with a person who needs support regarding a particular condition or situation. The appointment is being arranged seamlessly online (no need for letters or emails). It mentions some medications which need to be reviewed and plus some other services they might want to use. As soon as the medication is mentioned, a link to exactly the right place in the curated list is created, so that both sides can instantly see exactly the right information. Same for services and specifics relating to the health condition involved.</p><p>Or, looking at it the other way round, an individual can develop an ‘About Me’ profile that summarises all the key personal information about themselves and their condition, medications, support services etc. They can integrate this information seamlessly into their own records, with all the links stored in their personal data&nbsp;store.</p><p>They can then share this full profile with a new service provider as and when needed, so that the new service provider gets presented with all the key information they need straight away, without delay. This also means that the individual doesn’t keep on having to tell the same story to different people over and over&nbsp;again.</p><p>Result: a much better quality service and process with much lower FERC (Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost) for both the individual and the service provider.</p> Getting the details&nbsp;right <p>Of course, explaining it like this makes it sound simple (as it should be). But behind this simple experience lies a lot of technicalities. So, for example, a key part of the Master Reference Data Service is the detailed support services for developers covering such issues as <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/mrd-api/mrd-authentication.html">authentication</a> to access the service, how <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/mrd-api/cross-service-search.html">cross-service search works</a>, and <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/data-schema/developer-helpers.html">help support services</a>.</p><p>At a higher level, Figure One below sums up how we provide these services.</p>Figure One: Overview of how our Master Reference Data Services&nbsp;work<p>It starts with the curated data sources themselves (the coloured circles at the bottom of the diagram). We access the data from these curated data sources and crunch them so that a) people using different software languages or formats can easily access the data (interoperability) and b) so that the data they contain can be sliced and diced so that only those bits of data that are particularly relevant to a person at a particular time can be easily presented (configuration).</p><p>This means that if you are looking for information about a particular thing that may be referred to in a range of different curated databases, you can search for this information from within our service across all these different databases, all at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>For example, a patient with a particular condition could access information about the condition itself, information about medicines related to treating that condition, and about local services or community groups supporting people with that condition.</p><p>The top of the diagram then shows subscribers subscribing to any and all curated data sources that are relevant to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Currently these data sources include ALISS (A Local Information System for Scotland) and NHS curated content covering a wide range of&nbsp;areas.</p><p>ALISS is a service designed to help citizens find help and support close to them when they need it most. ALISS is maintained and published by the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland (the ALLIANCE) and is funded by the Scottish Government.</p><p>The NHS databases cover:</p>  Health Conditions information for the top 600 health conditions experienced by People. Symptoms, assessments, testing, treatment and implications.  Live Well, which covers advice about healthy living, including eating a balanced diet, healthy weight, exercise, quitting smoking and drinking less alcohol, sexual health and addiction support.  Mental Health support. This covers feelings, symptoms and behaviours, mental health conditions, advice for life situations and events, self-help, mental health services, mental health for children, teenagers and young adults, talking therapies, medicine and psychiatry, social care, mental health and your&nbsp;rights.  Medicines This covers content about common medicines. Includes how and when to take the medicine, possible side effects and answers to common questions.  Pregnancy&nbsp;, including modular advice and guidance about trying for a baby, pregnancy, labour and&nbsp;birth.  <p>Many of these curated lists of information also link with each other. MRD makes it easy to link and pull them together into a seamless payload that can be integrated into any application. This reduces the amount of duplication involved across organisations and their applications, improves the data quality and reduces the complexity of delivering interoperability and integration.</p><p>Subscribers accessing this curated content via our MRD API can be confident that the information they are accessing is accurate and up-to-date. This is because each one of them is refreshed once a week to include any changes that may have been made in the last seven&nbsp;days.</p><p>The list of data services covered by our MRD service is continually growing. For example, we are in the process of adding the World Health Organisation’s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine — Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) which is another standardised, multilingual vocabulary of clinical terminology that is used by physicians and other healthcare providers for the electronic exchange of health information.</p><p>We are seeking to enable standardised lists of the sorts of adaptations people may need in their homes if they are disabled, frail or at risk of falling, postcode look-ups, and (further into the future) comprehensive lists of operational GPs and dentists.</p><p>We also include (or will soon include) data services designed to help service providers improve the quality of the personal data they hold and share. These include personal data quality relating&nbsp;to:</p>  Race and Ethnicity, and Age Range classifications.  Activity and Measurement reference tables covering the full spectrum of datasets supporting wearables (for example relating to activity types, temperature, sleep and exercise)  Postcode and geolocation cross references  <p>The potential list is endless. In this blog we have only talked about health and care, but the concept applies to every aspect of life. The underlying goals and core processes remain the same: it’s all about bringing exactly the right information to people at the right time, as and when they need&nbsp;it.</p> Conclusion <p>Personal data lies at the heart of every service that deals with an identified individual: we need to be able to access and use it to manage our lives better. But very often, for the service to really fulfil its function it needs to relate information about some important things of ‘the world out there’ to the specific needs and context of the individual, as identified by their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Very often, the key to service quality and efficiency is the ability to access and integrate both types of data so that all the right data is made available at the right time, and so that everybody involved can be confident that the information they are using is reliable (i.e. comes from a professionally curated&nbsp;source).</p><p>We have spent years developing our Master Reference Data Services so that both individuals and service providers can use data in this way. Its potential is simply enormous.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/connecting-data-about-me-to-the-world-around-me-18c6c632b94c">Connecting data ‘about me’ to the world around me</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs has the most advanced decentralized identity (DI) <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">mobile wallet SDK</a> on the market—and the newly released version 2.0 has even more features for customers to apply to their own products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a market leader in innovative <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity (DI)</a> technology offerings, Anonyome Labs is proud to bring version 2.0 of the Sudo Platform DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK to market. Like its <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">predecessor</a>, this SDK unites industry-standard DI protocols with <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>’s modularity, reliability and security, and then adds new features that give customers more options for applying the technology to their product suite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">edge agent</a> is an application that sits on an ‘edge device’, such as a user’s mobile phone. Edge agents can provide an array of DI functionality such as <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">wallet</a> and peer-to-peer services. <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">Learn more</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article we run through the technical specs of Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0, but here are the 5 ways the version 2.0 mobile wallet SDK is more advanced than its predecessor:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adopts the latest v2.0 suite of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Hyperledger Aries RFCs</a> for receiving and securely storing credentials and verifiably presenting credentials. Learn about how the banking industry is using <a href="https://anonyome.com/2024/02/revolutionizing-credit-union-kyc-reusable-credentials/">verifiable or reusable credentials</a>, for example.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 still supports <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Hyperledger Anoncreds</a>, and now also supports more credential and presentation formats, particularly <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs)</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adds support for Aries-based chat functionality, so users can exchange end-to-end encrypted chat messages with their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/08/whitepaper-innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">DIDComm</a> connections.&nbsp; 
 



 
 The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to exist in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">DI offerings</a>, such as in the <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Sudo Platform Cloud Agent Service</a> and the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo Platform Decentralized Identity Relay</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 In future we will add into the SDK support for OpenID4VC and more of the latest Hyperledger Aries RFCs. This will be part of our new roadmap as we move on from the initial roadmap we outlined <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">here</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>Let’s now go into more detail about these 5 features:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adopts the latest Aries credential and presentation exchange RFCs&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to expand its support for the Hyperledger Aries RFCs. Having already supported most of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md">Aries Interop Protocol (AIP)</a> 1.0 suite of protocols, we have progressed to the latest AIP 2.0 suite. To do this, we’ve implemented these new Aries RFCs into our edge agent:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2">Issue Credential Protocol 2.0 (RFC 0453)</a> for negotiating and receiving verifiable credentials from Aries issuers&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0454-present-proof-v2">Present Proof Protocol 2.0 (RFC 0454)</a> for presenting verifiable credentials to Aries verifiers.&nbsp; 
 



<p>This means version 2.0 is significantly better than version 1.0 because it can receive and present credentials in a range of different formats, such as W3C VCs, in addition to Anoncreds. We discuss these new supported formats below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As was the case with version 1 of the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK, we implement the core of these Aries RFCs by leveraging and contributing to the open-source Hyperledger project that Anonyome co-maintains: <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">Aries-VCX</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Version 2.0 adds support for W3C credentials and presentations&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Using the latest Aries protocols for credential and presentation exchange, we built support for new credential and presentation formats, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCs and VPs</a>. This means our customers can pick and choose from a wider range of ‘DI flavours’ that best suit their business use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome has <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">previously analysed Anoncreds and W3C VCs</a>, both of which play a crucial purpose in the DI ecosystem. Some benefits the Edge Agent SDK’s support for W3C VCs offers include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Higher interoperability from standardization and widespread adoption as a result of being formalized by W3C&nbsp; 



 Highly flexible data structure in comparison to Anoncreds, including support for more complex credential structures such as nested attributes and lists, suitable for a broad range of applications&nbsp; 



 More maturity and backing by a global standard, with many implementations and growing adoption.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Where Anoncreds may beat W3C VCs is in its advanced privacy-preserving features. Anoncreds thrives in this area, with support for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">zero knowledge proofs</a> (ZKPs) of credential attributes, and partial disclosure of credential attributes (only reveal the attributes that need to be revealed).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To retain some of these privacy-preserving use cases in W3C VCs credentials, the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK adds support for presenting selectively disclosed credentials using BBS+ cryptography (as defined in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0646-bbs-credentials">Aries RFC 0646</a>). This means edge agent users can present a proof with a subset of their BBS credential’s attributes without revealing all the other attributes that may contain sensitive data. This is not otherwise possible with other W3C VC types, such as Ed25519-based VCs.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Version 2.0 adds support for end-to-end encrypted chatting&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>All Aries protocol messages transmitted between the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK and its peers (issuers, verifiers, etc.) are already end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), but with our added support for Aries “Basic Messages” (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0095-basic-message">RFC 0095</a>), our users can now send and receive text chat messages with their DIDComm connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome has built a <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity/edge-agent-sdk/messaging">comprehensive API around this feature</a>, with support for message storage and real-time subscriptions. This new suite of APIs allows our customers to build E2EE chat use cases into their applications, whether that is E2EE chat with an issuer or verifier (e.g. a bank or DMV), or with a fellow edge agent (mobile to mobile chat). The Edge Agent SDK supports these use cases.&nbsp;</p>



 
 The SDK exists in Anonyome’s suite of DI offerings&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Anonyome continues to advance its <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/decentralized-iam/">collection of DI offerings</a>, supporting a wide range of use cases. The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to seamlessly integrate with our highly scalable DI message relay solution, the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo DI Relay SDK</a>, allowing the edge agent to reliably receive messages from the DIDComm peers it connects with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, we continue to thoroughly test our edge agent against our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Cloud Agent Service</a> offering (in addition to a suite of open-source Aries agents) to make sure all our features remain interoperable in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 
 We have a rich roadmap ahead for the SDK&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Maturing into its second stable release, the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK has achieved the roadmap tasks that we laid out in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">this article</a>. But given the evolving nature of the DI industry, Anonyome plans to continue adding new features to every new release of the SDK so our customers’ applications can stay up to date with the latest and greatest in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the future for the SDK, we plan to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Implement V2 Aries protocols for connection establishment, particularly DIDExchange (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0023-did-exchange">RFC 0023</a>) and Out-of-Band protocol (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">RFC 0434</a>)&nbsp; 



 Implement parts of the <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID4VC</a> DI stack, allowing the Edge Agent SDK to receive and present credentials with a wider audience of standards, particularly the EUDI’s <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/arf.md">Architecture and Reference Framework</a>&nbsp; 



 Expand the set of DID methods we support, such as did:cheqd, did:indy, and did:peer, again increasing the level of interoperability with more DI agents.&nbsp;

  <p>Today, we're excited to announce the general availability of user insights in Microsoft Entra External ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User insights, which was launched in public preview in October 2023, is a powerful tool that enables admins and developers to gain deeper insights into their customers’ behavior, preferences, and challenges. It provides key metrics such as monthly active users (MAU), daily active users (DAU), new users added, requests over time, authentications over time, multi-factor authentication (MFA) usage by type, and MFA success versus failure rates. You can also filter and segment the data by time range, operating system, country, and application id. With user insights, you can:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Analyze the trends and patterns of your customers’ application login and registration activity and discover new opportunities for growth and improvement. 
 Optimize user experience and identity management strategies for your customers and make data-driven decisions that align with your business goals and user needs. 
 Build customized dashboards in tools like Power BI using user insights from Microsoft Graph APIs, allowing more flexibility and control of your customer identity data.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access user insights, you need to have a <a href="https://aka.ms/External_ID">Microsoft Entra External ID</a> external tenant. Once you have your tenant ready, you can access the dashboards on the <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDUserInsights">Microsoft admin center</a> or access raw data via <a href="https://aka.ms/userInsightsGraphAPIs">Microsoft Graph APIs</a>. The features we’re announcing today provide significant value and are based on direct feedback from our preview customers. Sign up for your free trial <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_B2CAdmin/Trialtenantcreation.reactview/isFromDevHub/true">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Export data to Excel for offline analysis 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ‘export to Microsoft Excel’ feature is a convenient way to access raw data from the dashboards to suit different user preferences and use cases. You will now be able to export data in comma-separated values (CSV) format to facilitate the seamless importation and manipulation of data with Excel, or any other preferred CSV editor. This allows customers to use data offline for their own customized analysis and manipulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Export authentications data to Microsoft Excel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tailor and optimize your identity management solution for different user segments&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can filter data by language and identity provider to get more insights into the preferences and behavior of your users. For example, you can see which languages are most popular among your users and how they vary across applications and regions. You can also see which identity providers are used the most for authentication and how they may affect the user experience and retention. These filters help you tailor and optimize your identity management solution for different user segments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Analyze authentications data by identity provider or language customization</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improving user experience and security with MFA failure insights 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MFA failure chart shows the number of sign-in attempts that failed due to MFA issues and why they failed. You can see the breakdown by three categories:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Bad request: the sign-in request was malformed or invalid. 
 MFA denied: the user entered the wrong verification code or declined the MFA request. 
 MFA incomplete: the user did not complete the MFA request within the time limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This breakdown can help you understand the common causes of MFA failures so you can target your resources and improve the user experience and security of your applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Monthly MFA failures insights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identify potential issues with user retention, engagement, and satisfaction 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inactive users are users who have not signed in over a certain period. You can see the number of daily and monthly inactive users in your applications, as well as the trend over time. This metric can help you monitor user engagement and identify areas where you can improve your user experience or offer incentives to re-engage your users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 We sit down with our internal subject matter expert in the telecommunications industry to learn what trends this sector is seeing, predictions on where it is headed as well as advice for the future. 



<p>Telecommunications is becoming an ever-growing market, not only because we live in a connected world but also because the number of devices and network connections just keeps increasing. One recent study predicts that <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/5g-iot-connections-to-surpass-100-mn/">5G IoT (Internet of Things) connections will reach 116 million globally by 2026</a>. This industry is therefore confronted with many challenges as the number of devices and connections continues to rise.</p>



<p>According to an identity verification survey conducted by Regula in 2023, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/telecoms-turn-to-identity-verification-as-fraud-concerns-soar">9 out of 10 organizations in the telecommunications industry consider identity verification (IDV) a crucial tool in combating the increasing threat of identity fraud</a>. Furthermore, in the coming years, <a href="https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/information-technology/images/infographics/2024-cio-agenda/2024-cio-agenda-infographics/2024-cio-agenda-banking-and-investment-infographic">CIOs will increase investments by 83% in Integration Technologies/APIs/API Architecture according to Gartner</a>. But fraud isn’t the only challenge this industry faces. Telecommunications needs to stay up-to-date and meet the demands that modern technology brings to the table, or shall I say device, if it is to have any future. Since smart devices are as common and habitual as brushing one’s teeth, the direction in which this industry is headed is one in which needs to stay ahead of the curve or get left behind in the pile of outdated technology.</p>



<p>We spoke with Duke Golden, Director Sales at IDnow, with his almost 30 years within the industry and past experiences at 1NCE, Huawei and Vodafone to name just a few, to learn what topics in the telecommunications sector are trending, his predictions on where this industry is headed and his advice for telco operators.</p>



 As an industry that is perhaps overlooked due to the fact that it is very much part of our everyday lives and common for the generations that grew up within this technology boom, what major trends would you say the telecommunications industry is therefore seeing? 



<p>Telecommunications in our daily lives is almost invisible these days – but it is truly the foundation for our digital lives. It’s just something that you think should be there. I’ve been in the telecommunications industry for about 25 years now. But you’re right, that comment is very much what you get from a generation that grew up with the Internet. But there is a lot that goes into this. Everything we enjoy today from dating apps to ordering groceries, telecommunications is the driving force behind all of these innovations. Nothing happens without a network connection.</p>



<p>To describe it in a different way, network connectivity has very much become a commodity, especially over the last 10-15 years. Connectivity is like bread, milk, eggs, oil, gas—it’s just something we need for our everyday life. However, the struggle right now within the telecommunications industry, especially with regards to Tier-1 operators, is that they need to find a way to make that connectivity into something like a value add for their customers. It can’t just be about the connectivity. The question now is what do telecommunications operators do with that connectivity? They have a great opportunity to do something really special, being the owner of the network connectivity.</p>



<blockquote><p>So right now we’re at a point where telecommunications providers really need to provide new solutions, incorporating their connectivity to bring additional value add to customers.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>A big part of that value add for customers is the IoT—API driven economies. What they’re doing is basically providing the connectivity and then a platform for API integration for a million different types of services that are intrinsically connected to their connectivity.</p>



<p>But how do you monetize connectivity? You have to create an ecosystem where you can generate revenue based on new ideas using that connectivity. Telecommunications providers still want connectivity to be at the center of their proposition but the really interesting and attractive part for customers is the ability to monetize this in a variety of forms. And this is where the IoT starts to come in.</p>



 Yes, IoT (Internet of Things) seems to be one of those trends on the radar within telecom, why is this the case? 



<p>IoT is evolving to become one of the most disruptive and enabling technologies for end users in recent memory. It’s revolutionizing the way we approach network connectivity and digitalization in our daily lives. In the beginning it was just machine to machine which was basically the first iteration of the IoT.</p>



<p>IoT is basically a blank canvas for an artist to use connectivity to paint a picture which didn’t exist before, and that’s what’s happening with the IoT, especially with telco-driven IoT initiatives. Because it’s not just the telcos who are doing IoT. It is a hugely competitive and largely proprietary space where the only limitation to business cases is the creator’s imagination. This is where only the strongest telcos will prosper. Deutsche Telekom, for instance, has a very strong expert approach to IoT which can accommodate entire ecosystems to create business value for their customers.</p>



<p>Now, the pressure on the telecom world is really to bring the knowledge that they have, not just about networks but about industry verticals themselves, into play to develop something meaningful for individual customers.</p>



 What tools and resources will help these initiatives in the telco sector? 



<p>What we do at IDnow is possibly one of the most important enabling solutions within the IoT potentially. One of my goals is to connect IDnow into this API economy so customers of a telco service have the option to conduct an ID verification process. To date, IoT has been more concerned with locating individual devices. A lot of people think IoT is a device-driven type of world where you don’t need to know the person behind it. But that’s changing, especially with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marcel-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/">AI and deepfakes</a>. You can really manipulate a traditional device-based IoT network in a big way unless you verify who the person is working on the IoT platform. You really need to know who has access and who is accessing the platform. Maybe it doesn’t have to be a deep dive, but the key with IoT is trust.</p>



<blockquote><p>Trust is the number one factor that will either enable a customer to deploy a telco-based IoT solution or will stop it in its tracks.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>If there are doubts about the authenticity of the platform, or the ability for that platform to control unauthorized usage, then a lot of times IoT initiatives never make it off the ground, especially in Germany. It’s all about 1% risk means 100% opposition in many cases. Germany has kind of a very strict sense when it comes to these things like 0 risk is the only acceptable risk.</p>



 Since trust is the number one factor within telco, the term Zero Trust with regards to network connections and security has been used a lot recently. Is this something widespread in the telecommunications industry? 



<p>Zero Trust is widely used. That is a term that you will hear everywhere from network engineers to security operations technicians. Zero trust—trust nothing. The reason that it has become popular is because security has become completely endangered, especially over the last five to 10 years. In the network engineering world, there are different points of ingress into the network. In the past before IoT, before cloud, before all these other innovative ways to connect to the Internet, the Internet protocol basically protected these environments. They were standardized environments where you could only enter them with a specific network protocol and it was much easier to protect them. Zero Trust wasn’t really needed at that point because you knew that if someone broke into the network, it was an inside job.</p>



<p>Now, anyone has the opportunity to interface with any layer of the network from a completely unverified position. So Zero Trust was born, and it became probably the strongest terminology used especially in the telco world. You need to verify every single user to a different degree. For example, if you’re talking about an online dating platform, you don’t need to verify everything about this person’s character. You just need to verify they are over 18. Zero Trust doesn’t mean you have to conduct a complete background check on every single individual person, but you need to know who you’re dealing with.</p>



 With the need to verify a person and bind them to the device they are using, will there be hesitation from users with concerns to data privacy? 



<p>Enterprises want to know more about their customers because the more they know the better they can serve their customers. Nothing is for free. A well-known CEO of a cybersecurity company once told me, if you are getting something for free, then you are the product. Thus, we’re not dealing in a cash-based economy anymore. True value lies in information these days.</p>



<p>And with regards to the telecommunications industry, there is a huge push right now to monetize in different ways the connectivity that they’re already providing to people. With the price of connectivity sinking daily, the push now for telcos is to recover that depreciation in the cost of actual connectivity in extra value-added services like IoT, like cloud services, 5G campus Networks and other digitalization initiatives. And the key to all these other value-added services is to verify who those services are going to, not only for the safety and security aspect, but having the knowledge to serve their customers better. That knowledge for telecommunications providers is essential to designing or altering services to fit specific types of the widest possible scope of business cases.</p>



<p>As with all new initiatives, especially from my experience in Europe, there will be hesitation. But it depends on the country and on the culture. Every society globally is very different when it comes to their aversion to risk. At the end of the day, it’s all about the economy and people’s ability to pay for things, either with money or information.</p>



<p>While there might be kickback in conservative countries like Germany, the vast majority of the world will have no problem with signing up for services and giving them a certain amount of information. But it needs to be tied to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">identity verification solutions</a> because the only way to really increase security in a very complicated online services world is to start with a single point of truth. And the only way to truly verify who a person is, is by verifying their identity. But they can’t only be verified one time. It needs to be an ongoing activity verifying and reverifying, especially with regards to critical infrastructure. And this is where the telecommunications industry and IDV is headed.</p>



 How regulated would you say is the IoT industry? For example, in Germany, there is the Telecommunications Act (TKG) but are there any other regulations? 



<p>With regards to the IoT specifically, IoT is still very much wild, wild West. There is very little regulation.</p>



<p>I think there is a serious risk that the IoT can become too dangerous in some ways if we don’t regulate ourselves using best practice instead of waiting for regulatory agencies to act. The difference between traditional telecommunications networks and IoT networks is that telecom networks are completely standardized internally and with IoT all of these solutions are proprietary. There is no standardization within the IoT industry. So that means our ability to secure the IoT is much less than with standardized industry standards like on the traditional network side which have well thought out, highly developed security protocols built into them.</p>



<p>What better place to secure the IoT than at the point of ingress for all users, both internal and external? That means performing a comprehensive ID verification process for admins and users, depending on what type of IoT platform it is. We just need to change our view on what is an acceptable level of risk.</p>



 With the number of smart devices continuing to increase and experts predicting that by 2030 the world population will be around 8.3 billion and the number of devices will have reached an estimated 43.2 billion, what are the main challenges this industry faces when considering these numbers? 



<p>Traditionally, in the IDV sector it’s been about verifying users before they buy their prepaid mobile or before they activate it and then they’re good to go. </p>



<blockquote><p>Now, verification needs to become an integral part of the entire value chain for technology, not just at the point of purchase, but at the point of usage.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>The ID verification process is something that needs to be always going on in the background. And this is where the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0 regulation</a> would come into play with a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a>. But we’re just not there yet. Regulations will always be behind technology.</p>



<p>At IDnow and as an ID verification solutions provider, it’s our responsibility to fill the gap between regulation and everyday business risks that aren’t being addressed by the regulatory environment. Building this bridge of trust for our customers is our core mission which we take very seriously.</p>

<p>Authors: Yanisa Sunanchaiyakarn &amp; Nuttawut Kongsuwan, Finema Co.&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>As we enter the era of generative AI, the risk of identity theft for both individuals and organizations is escalating. A <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">recent case</a> in Hong Kong highlights this threat, where an office was deceived into transferring $25 million after a video call with a deepfake CFO and colleagues. As advances in AI erode trust, it becomes apparent that a robust digital identity solution for organizations is urgently&nbsp;needed.</p><p>In the past few years, the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a> framework has emerged as one of the most promising solutions to this global crisis. The vLEI framework offers one of the most secure and trustworthy digital organization identity management to date and potentially revolutionizes digital business transactions worldwide.</p><p>Since vLEI is also still in its infancy, there is a significant challenge for the community to overcome its adoption hurdle. In this article, we propose 4 pragmatic criteria for identifying fair, good, and great use cases for vLEI from the adoptability perspective. These criteria are by no means rigid rules set in stone but serve as a useful mental model for pioneers and early adopters exploring vLEI use&nbsp;cases.</p> The 4&nbsp;Criteria <p>We have identified 4 criteria for good and great vLEI use&nbsp;cases:</p>  Use cases that involve organization-to-organization transactions  Use cases that involve cross-border transactions  Use cases that are highly regulated  Use cases that have open ecosystems   1. Org-to-Org <p>The first criterion for viable vLEI use cases is that they involve organization-to-organization (Org-to-Org) transactions. This includes business-to-business (B2B), business-to-government (B2G), and government-to-government (G2G) use cases. This is because org-to-org transactions often involve significant monetary value, which far outweighs the initial friction associated with adopting&nbsp;vLEI.</p> 2. Cross-Border <p>Cross-border transactions often face challenges in identifying and verifying clients, suppliers, or partners across different countries, leading to significant perceived risks. The vLEI framework is ideal for addressing these challenges as it is specifically designed for international use. It can potentially streamline the cross-border identification and verification processes, mitigating risks and improving efficiency.</p> 3. Highly Regulated <p>Highly regulated use cases are subject to strict requirements and standards, where non-compliance can result in severe penalties or legal consequences. As a result, these use cases often require extensive due diligence of business partners, including Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)&nbsp;checks.</p><p>The process of obtaining vLEI for organizations and their representatives involves robust identity verification that is more stringent than those often conducted in the financial sector. As a result, vLEI, which is built on the global LEI system, can help streamline the due diligence process, significantly reducing compliance costs.</p> 4. Open Ecosystems <p>The final criterion for viable vLEI use cases is that they operate within open ecosystems, allowing the addition of organizations whose identities are not known in advance. Onboarding a new organization to the ecosystem often incurs significant cost, time, and effort. vLEI allows these onboarding costs to be offloaded to a third party, specifically a qualified vLEI issuer (QVI), which ensures that the organization and its representatives have undergone strict identity verification.</p> Fair, Good, and Great Use&nbsp;Cases  Great Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Great use cases are those that satisfy all 4 criteria, making them ideal candidates that could benefit from integrating vLEI into their workflows.</p><p>A prime example of a great use case is trade finance. It typically involves organizations (criterion 1) which are often located in different countries (criterion 2). Trade finance is also highly regulated, with financiers subject to AML and CFT requirements (criterion 3). The trade finance ecosystem is open, allowing any company worldwide to initiate trades and apply for, e.g., a letter of credit (criterion 4).</p> Good Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Good use cases are those that satisfy 3 out of the 4 criteria. We consider these use cases worth pursuing.</p><p>An example of a good use case is the financial reporting of banking institutions in Europe to the European <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-discussion-paper-centralisation-eea-banks">Banking Authority (EBA)</a>. This exemplifies a B2G scenario (criterion 1), encompassing banks across multiple European countries (criterion 2) that operate within a highly regulated environment (criterion 3). What makes this use case simply good rather than great in our criteria is that European banks are already known entities within the closed ecosystem supervised by the&nbsp;EBA.</p> Fair Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Fair use cases are those that satisfy two or fewer criteria. While they may be a feasible use case for vLEI, we consider them a low-potential candidate. We argue that fair use cases will become viable once vLEI has achieved widespread adoption. For instance, organizations that already possess vLEI for stronger use cases might contemplate applying it to these fair use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>An example of a use case we consider “fair” for vLEI is an HR platform. Such a platform is used internally between employers and employees (not org-to-org) and is also not highly regulated. Typically, employees and employers have alternative means to verify each other, diminishing the necessity for vLEI in this&nbsp;context.</p> Conclusion <p>While vLEI holds significant potential to transform global business operations, it currently faces a challenge known as the “cold start problem,” where there are not enough holders and use cases to foster exponential growth in the ecosystem. Pioneers and early adopters are encouraged to prioritize exploring high-potential use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Do you agree with our criteria? Are there additional criteria we should consider adding to the list?

 In the age of the Internet of Things, autonomous and connected cars are revolutionizing the way we drive. As these vehicles become increasingly sophisticated, verifying user identity is becoming a crucial issue in ensuring safety and preventing fraud. Let’s explore the challenges and solutions associated with this mobility revolution. 



<p>By 2025, it is estimated that <a href="https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/en/braincamps/planet/how-to-reduce-carbon-emissions-of-the-digital-sector/internet-of-things-50-billion-greenhouse-gas-producers/">50 billion objects will be connected worldwide</a>, covering everything from household appliances to urban infrastructure. Among these objects, cars occupy a prominent place, with functionalities multiplying at an impressive rate. According to <a href="https://www.geotab.com/blog/what-is-connected-car/">Geotab</a>, the smart device is what has changed the game the most in recent years. As technology advances, connected vehicles become more sophisticated, offering advanced functionality that goes far beyond simple driving. These advances are not just limited to improving mechanical and safety aspects, but also extend to features that enhance the overall experience for drivers and passengers.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://www.febiac.be/en/article/connectivity-in-cars-seen-from-all-aspects">Belgian Automobile Federation (FEBIAC)</a> explains: “There are two types of connected cars. The first category has a 4G/5G card that vehicles use to be constantly connected to the Internet, and more specifically to the manufacturer’s online services. The second category connects via your smartphone, whose screen will be replicated on that of the vehicle.”</p>



<p>Connected cars are increasingly integrating smartphones into their ecosystems, thanks in particular to the democratization of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple CarPlay</a> and <a href="https://www.android.com/auto/">Android Auto</a>. As Apple points out, it’s now possible to integrate your iPhone with your car’s digital keys, to open and start your vehicle. Users are now able to link their phone to their vehicle, enabling them to benefit from functions such as remote opening and starting, or purchasing options directly from their phone.</p>



<p>However, such functionalities require a high level of user verification. With the <a href="https://www.confused.com/meet-our-experts/content/automotive-hacking-and-connected-cars">risk of hacking on the rise</a>, it is essential to protect against fraud and identity theft by adopting appropriate solutions.</p>



 Connectivity: the new spearhead of the automotive sector. 



<p>Connected cars have opened up a whole new world of opportunities for automakers and end-users alike. Connectivity has made a major contribution to enhancing the driving experience, through the deployment of new functionalities. These include:</p>



  Predictive maintenance, thanks to remote diagnostic modules, or maintenance notifications based on real-time analysis of vehicle data;  Personalized services, such as notification of available parking spaces nearby, or suggestions for restaurants and services based on location;  Entertainment and connectivity, including smartphones accessing streaming services, or compatible applications from stores;  Remote control and command, enabling the vehicle to be locked, unlocked or started remotely, or the vehicle temperature to be preset.  



<p>Some of these advantages require a connection with a smartphone to operate. More and more cars no longer need a key to start, for example. Cards are gradually replacing ignition keys. They can also be dematerialized on a smartphone, for even greater convenience. This is one of the reasons behind the success of car-sharing services such as <a href="https://getaround.com/">Getaround</a> or <a href="https://zity.eco/en/">Zity</a>, which rely on remote unlocking of vehicles, thanks to strong user identification.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/critical-information-systems-and-cybersecurity/news/new-security-methodology-connected-cars">Thales</a> points out, another crucial point in terms of security for connected vehicles lies in web applications. These enable “the exchange of information between the vehicle and/or driver and the manufacturer’s IT system. If the authentication process is not secure enough, an attacker can enter a user’s account and take control of the vehicle.”</p>



<p>For all these reasons, strong identification measures are essential to anticipate these new uses.</p>



 



 

 



 Securing new uses through identification. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">car-sharing</a> is one of the benchmark use cases, there are other situations in which it may be useful to identify the driver of a vehicle. Lending a vehicle to an employee, rental between private individuals or even self-service cars are all examples of uses that justify better identification of the driver.</p>



<p>These new uses require strong authentication of users using their smartphone, as well as identification of the smartphone by the vehicle. This begins as soon as the vehicle is delivered, where an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> check and biometric verification can be carried out, in order to associate a user with his or her account.</p>



<p>When a key is exchanged digitally with another user, it is necessary for the user to prove his or her identity. By going through the same identification and authentication process as the owner, both parties can optimize the security of vehicle access.</p>



<p>It is also possible to request an additional biometric element to reinforce authentication. For example, the use of biometric features such as facial recognition can add an extra layer of security, allowing the user to access their account in complete safety. Many modern smartphones are equipped with biometric sensors that can be used to authenticate the user before allowing them to unlock the vehicle. Even if an ill-intentioned person has the smartphone of the vehicle’s rightful owner, it will not be possible for him or her to gain access, or even worse, to start it.</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’re helping to enhance the security of connected vehicles by offering <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">ID document verification</a> via our APIs, capable of handling over 3,000 ID documents from 195 countries. By leveraging the latest technologies in facial recognition and life detection, we are able to confirm the physical presence of the person during the verification process. By integrating these technologies and strategies, manufacturers and users of connected vehicles can ensure secure identification of users via their smartphones, minimizing the risk of fraud.</p>



 Anticipating future uses. 



<p>As vehicles become increasingly autonomous and integrated into our daily lives, reliable and secure identification systems are essential to protect drivers and their vehicles. Faced with these new uses, we need to think about security and identification, both on the user side and on the component side. Proactive measures will have a positive impact on users’ peace of mind and their confidence in connected cars.</p>

<p>In the first release of 2024 we have updated SSO Swedish BankID adaptor to enable the core Authentication Flow, utalising animated QR codes for all two device authentications. This modern specification helps to limit the potential phishing attacks through the use of continuously changing QR codes.</p>
<p>We have altered our CustomerID application to help reduce the potential of misconfigurations which could result in user invitations being sent repetitively if your PostgreSQL service were misconfigured or became unavailable.</p>
<p>We have also updated Tomcat, Redis, OpenLDAP and PostgreSQL to the latest possible versions for use with Identity Platform. Additionally, as RedHat7/CentOS 7 becomes end of life during 2024, we have updated our support to RedHat9/Rocky9.</p>
<p>For full details over the IDS 2024.1 release, please review the <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> and <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms">System Recommendations</a> pages found on our Developer Portal. </p>
 Patch update: 
<p>SSO 9.4.1 – within this patch release we have updated the Mobile PKI (MPKI) service to fulfil current Traficom requirements. Additionally we have updated Tomcat to 9.0.87</p>
<p>CustomerID 6.4.1 – within this patch release we correct a coding error present when using SSO’s TOTP along with CustomerID’s ability to move users between Organisations. Prior to this patch, moving a user would result in errors and impact both LDAP and PostgreSQL databases. If you utalise TOTP and have CustomerID in active use, we encourage you to update to this patch version of CustomerID.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage all our customers to update to the latest available versions of software. For full details over our latest releases, please review the <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165275180/Identity+Server+2024.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> and <a title="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms" href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20241/pages/9165340673/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms">System Recommendations</a> pages found on our Developer Portal.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, we had the pleasure of attending Identiverse 2024, the premier conference dedicated to identity and security. Now that we’ve had time to reflect, we’re excited to share our key takeaways from the event. Packed with insightful sessions, innovative workshops, and inspiring keynotes, Identiverse 2024 offered a wealth of knowledge and forward-thinking ideas that are shaping the future of digital identity.</p>
 Fundamentals of Passkeys 
<p>One of the standout sessions was on passkeys, which provided a comprehensive overview of FIDO passkeys, their flow, multi-device capabilities, and the evolution of the standard to support new functionalities. The demonstration of transferring 1Password passkeys to Dashlane showcased significant progress in passkey management flexibility. This interoperability is a game-changer, enabling users to move seamlessly between keychains and enhancing their overall experience. Additionally, Air New Zealand’s rapid adoption of passkeys was notable, with 25% of sign-ins using passkeys and a 30% opt-in rate within the first 24 hours. Such success stories underline the potential of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) in real-world applications.</p>
 Innovation Workshop: Overcoming Obstacles to Empower Innovators 
<p>This workshop addressed key challenges and innovative solutions in advancing identity and security. Inspired by a 2015 data breach affecting 21.5 million federal workers’ fingerprint data, the session emphasized the need for technologies that securely handle biometric data while preserving privacy. The concept of open innovation was also explored, particularly in industries with tight IP restrictions like healthcare and defense. Crowdsourcing platforms like InnoCentive were highlighted as tools to drastically reduce innovation time and effectively solve complex problems.</p>
 Opening Keynote: Andre Durand, Ping Identity 
<p>Andre Durand’s keynote was both engaging and thought-provoking, setting the tone for the conference. Durand highlighted the emerging crisis of deepfakes and the critical need for reliable identity verification solutions. He also emphasized the issue of repeatedly proving one’s identity across multiple systems and the necessity to address this fragmentation. The merging of verification and authentication processes was discussed, aligning well with identity-based authentication solutions. Durand stressed that protecting consumer reputation should be a top priority for identity professionals.</p>
 Keynote: Digital Identity at United Airlines 
<p>United Airlines provided insights into their advancements in integrating digital identity into their customer experience. One of the highlights was the Information Security team reporting to the Customer Success team, demonstrating the importance of combining security with a delightful user experience. The transition from security questions to Email &amp; SMS OTP for second-factor authentication was noted as a step forward, though it presents its own set of challenges.

<p>London, June 18, 2024 – Ahead of the busy summer betting period, IDnow, a leading identity verification provider in Europe, has seen a significant spike in the number of gambling customers requesting identity verification.</p>



<p>Between 14 and 16 June, IDnow saw a 750% increase in the number of players being verified with a European gambling operator [1]. The busiest sign-up day was 14 June, the day of the opening match of UEFA EURO 2024, which saw a much higher volume of verification requests than was seen during the 2022 World Cup. </p>



<p>This latest spike coincides with the lead up to the opening game of UEFA EURO 2024 on 14 June. During each country’s first game, IDnow is expecting these figures to stay at a high level. With that, an increased likelihood of bonus abuse, multi-accounting, underage gambling, money laundering and fake documentation.</p>



 Effective, compliant verification processes to onboard vast numbers of players 



<p>“The challenges operators face during major sporting tournaments are not necessarily any different to their regular daily compliance hurdles, but the sheer volume of new players from all around the world, coupled with increased activity is likely to cause issues for unprepared operators,” said Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.<br><br>“EURO 2024 will be a huge opportunity for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gambling platforms</a>, new and old, so it’s essential they capitalize on the event, while safeguarding their players and their reputation. It’s important they have effective, compliant verification processes in place to onboard vast numbers of players as smoothly and safely as possible. Only when operators are confident they can verify accounts thoroughly, and onboard the right players during such busy period, will they be effective in fighting fraud.”</p>



<p>As global sporting events have such broad appeal, they often attract both casual and regular bettors. Combined with the convenience and accessibility that online platforms now offer, betting during these periods is getting increasingly popular. Indeed, betting during the 2022 World Cup increased by <a href="https://www.openbet.com/news/openbet-processes-more-than-200m-bets-during-the-world-cup">13 percent compared with the 2018 FIFA World Cup</a>.</p>



<p>Worryingly, the surge in gambling activity was seen on both regulated and unregulated sites. For example, in the UK alone, <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/black-market-world-cup">250,000 people visited unregulated, black-market sites during the last World Cup</a> compared with just 80,0000 during the same time frame of the previous year.</p>



<p>Other key security concerns that are exacerbated by major sporting events, such as EURO 2024:</p>



  Increase in site traffic is often used by fraudsters as a smoke screen for nefarious activities. They may conduct identity theft, or attempt account takeovers by launching phishing attacks and cyberattacks on unsuspecting users.  Unsecured public Wi-Fi networks can pose a security risk when players log in to place bets. These networks are susceptible to interception by hackers, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts, exposure of sensitive personal information and potential financial losses for both users and operators.  Rising rates of gambling fraud, with chargeback fraud a particularly common issue. While identity verification solutions can help verify the identity of users and detect fraudulent activity, preventing chargeback fraud requires additional measures, such as transaction monitoring and collaboration with payment processors to identify and block suspicious transactions in real time.  



<p>Although all global gambling platforms are likely to see an uptick in player onboarding, it will likely be European nations that share the same time zone as the tournament that will see the biggest increase in usage.</p>



<p>“Gaming operators in these particular regions must offer secure player onboarding, deposits and withdrawals, and conduct seamless Anti-Money-Laundering and age verification checks to help fight the expected proliferation of fraudulent activity in both the build up to EURO 2024 and throughout the tournament,” concluded Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk. </p>

<p>As enterprises shift from on-premises to cloud systems, hybrid cloud solutions have become essential for optimizing performance, scalability, and user ease. However, risks arise when poorly configured environments connect to the cloud. A compromised Microsoft Active Directory can fully compromise a synchronized Microsoft Entra ID tenant, undermining the integrity and trust of connected services.</p>  
<p>Researchers at Horizon3.ai <a href="https://www.horizon3.ai/attack-research/n0-attack-paths/on-prem-misconfigurations-lead-to-entra-tenant-compromise/">recently published a fascinating analysis</a> on how on-premise misconfigurations in hybrid Microsoft environments can be exploited by attackers using well-documented techniques. In this case, the attack chain can lead to full compromise of the Entra Tenant. In complex enterprise environments, such misconfigurations are all too common. It’s critical for security teams to understand the tactics attackers use and strategies to close these points of vulnerability. Here we take a closer look at the attack chain and offer some additional mitigation strategies.</p> 
 The Attack Chain

     <p>T1557.001</p>  
     <p>NBT-NS traffic from Host 1 is poisoned to relay a netNTLM credential to Host 2 — an SMB server that doesn’t require signing.</p>  
    
    
      2   
     <p>T1003.002, T1078.003</p>  
     <p>Host 2 SAM database dump exposes a local administrator credential that is reused on Host 3 and Host 4.</p>

     <p>T1087</p>  
     <p>Analysis of AzureHound data reveals on-premise user Global Administrator (EntraAdmin) within the Entra Tenant.</p>

     <p>Access granted to the Microsoft Graph cloud service, without being prompted for MFA, with Global Administrator privileges.</p>  
    
   
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fortunately, this hacking exercise was carried out by white hat pentesters. The researchers at Horizon3.ai noted that, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the company’s environment, it took the NodeZero tool only an hour to compromise the on-premises AD domain, and the associated Entra ID tenant was compromised in less than two hours.</p> 
 Prevention Strategies  
<p>The team at Horizon3.ai included a set of solid initial mitigation recommendations. These include:</p> 
  
  Prevent NTLM Relay: Disabling NBT-NS and enforcing SMB Signing would have prevented the initial access technique used, although other vectors can be used for initial domain access.&nbsp;  
  Use LAPS: Reuse of credentials for Local Administrators enabled key lateral movements that lead to the discovery of Domain Administrator credentials.&nbsp;  
  Treat Entra Connect as a Tier-0 Resource: Install Entra Connect on a non-DC server (with LAPS enabled) and adequately protected with an EDR solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Do not Use On-Premises Accounts for Entra Administrator Roles: Microsoft recommends limiting the number of Entra Administrators and their level of privilege.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 Further Critical Recommendations  
<p>In addition to those, we recommend specific strategies to close common security gaps in Microsoft Entra ID environments.</p> 
  
  Use HYPR as a complement to LAPS to ensure administrators access their devices and systems using a phishing-resistant authentication method.  
  Review and revise your PAM (Privileged Access Management) program. The Static Domain Admin password should be rotated after it is used / checked out. You should also reduce the viability of the Domain Admin Credential in Cache.  
  Use secure <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/single-sign-on-sso">passwordless SSO</a> methods such as HYPRspeed that don’t rely on shared secrets and instead leverage public key cryptography.  
  Enforce the use of phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> methods, such as HYPR, for privileged Entra users access.  
  Begin migration to Entra ID from legacy on-prem technology. While not a small project, it will reduce the threat model of older protocols that rely on hash/passwords.

  Name: Libby Brown<br>Team: Product Management<br>Based in: Seattle area   About Libby <p>I’ve been working in technology and product management for longer than I care to admit, the past 6 years of which were in Identity at Microsoft as product manager of the Microsoft Authenticator app, then all of our passwordless credentials for Microsoft Entra (formerly known as Azure Active Directory.) I really enjoyed working at that intersection of building new technologies in the identity and security ecosystems, and driving the adoption of those technologies by creating user experiences that were compelling both on an individual and organizational level.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming to SpruceID was just a “shift left” in my career, moving upstream in the identity lifecycle, moving to concepts that are earlier in their definition and implementation stages, while at a company still in its launch phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>As Product Manager, I see my role as setting the longer-term direction of the products we are building while staying grounded in the day-to-day details of what and how we deliver&nbsp; on customer promises today. I want to define who SpruceID’s customers are, what they need, and how we’ll meet them, then get everyone on board to deliver.&nbsp;</p> What do you find most rewarding about your job?&nbsp; <p>Startup life is amazing! I love the hustle, the energy, the pressure to deliver because everyone on the team has to play their part to make the whole company successful - it’s invigorating!&nbsp;</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Product (and program) managers need to be able to explore and understand a subject's big picture and then dive down to the nitty gritty details to be successful. Problem-solving and collaboration are also key skills—my current mantra is, “Yes, and….” as in, “Let’s say yes to the idea or challenge, and what else do we need to do to make it happen?” It’s in those discussions of how to do something that good ideas rise up, and the consensus is gained; that doesn’t happen if the first response is a No.&nbsp;</p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>First, I’m still learning non-Microsoft tools - I doubt I will ever come to love Google Calendar – but after 2 decades of muscle memory, I’m beginning to leave Outlook behind.&nbsp;</p><p>I was reading the AAMVA Implementation Guide yesterday afternoon; digging into the W3C VCDM email digests earlier; and last week was refreshing my knowledge of NIST IAL levels. Learning is just a constant in this space, which is one of the reasons I love working on the bleeding edge of identity and security. If I ever find myself NOT learning, that’s when I know it’d be time to move on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>I was in Rio de Janeiro for our all-company meeting, my second week on the job. It was definitely one of my best onboarding experiences ever! It was a great way to meet everyone at once and learn folks’ roles and responsibilities. Also, being a part of big, foundational conversations we were having as a team helped me jump right into product management tasks when I returned home.&nbsp;</p> What's the best piece of advice you’ve received since starting your job here? <p>“Meet Everyone.” Each person at SpruceID has unique skill sets, so it’s been great to learn what those are and jointly figure out how to combine those capabilities to deliver great results.&nbsp;</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>I have done my job successfully when:&nbsp;</p>  customers know what SpruceID can deliver through our digital identity capabilities with the Credible platform;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Customers can realize the business value to their organization from digital credentials and&nbsp;  SpruceID has a long and lustrous roadmap to continue delivering features of value to our customers, existing and new.&nbsp;   What is your favorite part about working at SpruceID? <p>I love #startuplife! After a long time working in and around Microsoft, the direct control I have for driving product definition is wonderfully both terrifying and invigorating.&nbsp;</p> Fun Facts <p>What do you enjoy doing in your free time? I enjoy spending time with my kids. They’re at a fun age where they still want me to be a part of their activities. </p><p>What is your favorite coding language (and why?): HAHAHAHAHA—I am not a programmer, though I’ve spent my life around computers and technology. My first language was Basic, written on a Timex Sinclair computer and saved on an audio cassette. I built my first website via Notepad and FTP. I really didn’t advance in computer science much beyond that until I took an Intro to Programming class taught in Java this spring. </p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: A weeping willow - they love being near water and make perfect playgrounds and climbing gyms for children under their long boughs.&nbsp;</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Key Insights: 
 
 Germany’s approach to driving wallet adoption includes an innovation competition (“Funke”) and a consultation process with civil society. 
 Interoperability profiles, such as OpenID4VC and the Dutch Decentralized Identity Interoperability Profile (DDIP), aim to promote adoption and innovation by providing a common subset of technologies and specifications. 
 The role of big tech companies in providing mobile operating systems and browsers is a double-edged sword, enabling better user experiences but also raising concerns about control and data monetization. 
 Governments have a crucial role in setting regulations and fostering an equal playing field for all stakeholders in the digital identity ecosystem. 
 
 Strategies: 
 
 Governments can promote innovation and adoption by creating testbeds, innovation competitions, and consultation processes. 
 Interoperability profiles, updated in a cadence, can help organizations and vendors align on a common set of specifications and technologies, enabling interoperability. 
 Separating the roles of big tech companies as infrastructure providers (mobile operating systems, browsers) and product providers (wallets) can help address concerns about control and data monetization.

 We sit down with our Director of Global Regulatory and Government Affairs, Rayissa Armata and our&nbsp;Senior Architect, Sebastian Elfors to discuss collaboration, consortiums and the honor of being invited to join the European Blockchain Sandbox. 



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/consortium-crypto-assets-compliant-eu-regulations/">we revealed</a> that we had joined the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a> consortium, alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="http://havn.network/">HAVN Network</a> and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the aim of creating a Web3-ready KYC and identity verification solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This initiative will enable Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets to become compliant with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer in Funds Regulation (TFR)</a>, which is part of the greater EU Anti Money Laundering Package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sounds relatively straight forward, right? Well, yes and no. New regulations mandate all crypto transactions to a) carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver and b) comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. The issue lies with CASPs also being required to comply with new rules regarding GDPR compliance, which stipulate that personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter the consortium; each partner bringing its own strengths and areas of expertise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, Rayissa and Sebastian fill us in on how the project has been going since it was announced in February 2024.</p>



 As Web3 is still just an idea for a ‘new internet’, why did we decide to join the consortium to try and solve this ‘theoretical problem?’ Will this project be important for the future of payments, in particular in the crypto space? 



<p>Rayissa: Great question. Yes, there were several reasons why IDnow joined the consortium. For one, it is important to collaborate and to be able to adapt to new environments be it from a regulatory or technological perspective. Although concepts can be developed quickly, building the frameworks and ultimately achieving a usable product or service does not happen in a vacuum.</p>



<p>As you know, Europe established the crypto regulatory framework and licensing regime, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA)</a> and the companion rule known as TFR, which applies to transactions between cryptocurrency businesses and personal wallets. Due to be applied by the end of the year, TFR applies to transactions between cryptocurrency businesses and personal wallets. For example, with transactions, TFR requires CASPs to store certain PII so it can be cross matched to verify information on the originator of the transferred funds and the beneficiary of the transfer. The consortium took on the challenge of how this information can be transferred on and off chain. These solutions not only address privacy concerns, KYC and interoperability but will enhance trust in a relatively new technology ecosystem.</p>



<p>Sebastian: One key objective with this project is to design and implement a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/"> KYC solution</a> that can be used when issuing credentials that are stored as SoulBound Tokens (SBTs) on a blockchain. Technically speaking, the consortium is using Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. Having said that, the SBTs must also be compliant with GDPR regulations, so the SBTs contain anonymous identifiers instead of PII  in clear text. If there is a need for an authority to verify the user’s identity, this can be done by requesting the initial KYC user information from walt.id in conjunction with IDnow.</p>



 What has the consortium been working on since February? Do you have any updates? 



<p>Sebastian: The consortium has spent the past four months testing the solution and refining the implementation with scalability for production purposes in mind. Long term archiving and retrieval of identity documents is one such topic. We have also presented and demonstrated the solution to several stakeholders, with very positive feedback.</p>

 Now onto the good news. The consortium’s Web3 Identification Solution (which will enable KYC and identity verification in the Web3 environment), has been selected to take part in the European Blockchain Sandbox. What is it and why is it important? 



<p>Rayissa: Let me share a little about the European Blockchain Sandbox initiative since we have already covered a little about the consortium’s aims and activities above. The European Commission provides various opportunities to introduce new solutions that meet European regulatory requirements, such as data sharing in the TFR. This European Blockchain Sandbox initiative is geared so that new use cases that involve DLT can be developed and tested. This Blockchain initiative began in 2023 and will continue until 2026.</p>



<p>Sebastian: We are proud and happy that our consortium has been selected to participate in the Sandbox. This is a way for IDnow to demonstrate blockchain-based solutions to EU legislators, and pinpoint how they can meet the relevant EU regulations for cryptocurrencies. In particular, the IOTA solution is targeted to comply with the upcoming TFR regulation and we are keen on proving how the product can meet those requirements.</p>



 Why is cross-collaboration so important for such a project? 



<p>Rayissa: The European Commission recognizes the need for collaboration and cooperation between public and private sectors. Part of the regulatory framework is to set requirements that address interoperability, innovation, security and user accessibility. Collaboration is key to enabling this set of requirements and we have many legal experts and technology-savvy developers guiding our project to build something new. IDnow has been at the forefront of good management, regulatory compliance and smart growth since we began and collaboration is a big part of our success.</p>



<p>Sebastian: In addition to the cross-collaboration with the EU Commission, we are also very proud of working with the IOTA-founded consortium. All parties contribute with cutting edge technologies: </p>



  IOTA provides the underlying network based on the IOTA Smart Contract Chain<br>  HAVN Network integrates hybrid blockchain technologies<br>  IDnow delivers the ID verification, prior to the tokenization into a SBT<br>  walt.id has developed the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs<br>  Bloom provides the digital wallet for storing and presenting the SBTs  



 How will our existing and future crypto clients, who use our solutions to onboard customers and process transactions, be able to benefit from the research and development that is going into the Web3 Identification Solution? 



<p>Rayissa: From a compliance perspective, CASPs will be able to use this solution to comply with national and European KYC and TFR requirements to share personal data between the originator and beneficiary of a specific transaction. This will enable trust in the crypto ecosystem and beyond in Web3 and use cases. There may not be a regulatory framework with set requirements for Web3 or Web4 applications, but trust brings growth and what a great opportunity for these environments to become more mainstream.</p>



<p>Sebastian: The solution developed by the IOTA solution has the potential to go beyond the realm of cryptocurrency transactions, which is the current scope of the project. The SBTs that are issued could also be used for digital identities in the Web3 metaverse, for example for identifying avatars purchasing NFTs such as digital paintings.</p>



 Will the Web3 Identification Solution be commercially available in the future? If so, which companies and industries will the product appeal to? 



<p>Rayissa: Yes, certainly that is a goal. We are already in discussions with our consortium members and external CASPs and companies specialized in IOT services.</p>



<p>Sebastian: The term Web3 was initially coined in 2014 by the Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood when he created the vision of a “decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain.” So yes, the Web3 Identification Solution can be used by all industries that have a need for digital identification. In addition to authentication for CASPs, totally different verticals such as the gaming industry could benefit from Web3 identification. Only the imagination sets the limits.</p>

  Decentralized identity is gaining traction globally through diverse implementations and aligns with SpruceID's mission to empower users with control over their data.

<p>Decentralized identity is rapidly gaining momentum as an industry concept, with a growing number of live implementations. Its early roots were in pioneering projects like <a href="https://whitepaper.uport.me/uPort_whitepaper_DRAFT20170221.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">uPort</a>, appearances at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IIW</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-decentralized-id-blockchain/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Microsoft’s subsequent bet</a>, and its emergence as a hot topic at industry conferences like Identiverse and EIC. We see it in practice globally in the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">California DMV Wallet</a>, the European Union Digital Identity initiative, and even digital pioneers like <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/bhutans-national-digital-id-showcased-as-ssi-model-for-others?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Bhutan</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>It’s easy to get confused because “decentralization” has become a buzzword for many new technologies. While its source of decentralization doesn’t need to come from blockchains or cryptocurrencies, decentralized identity is ultimately aligned with the objective of returning control to end users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At SpruceID, we think about decentralized identity as systems built using the <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">issuer-holder-verifier model</a>, which achieves decentralization when open protocols are used such that any party can assume the role(s) of the issuer, holder, or verifier. These roles come with a clean separation of concerns that mitigate undesirable side effects, such as issuer “phone home” during holder usage. These systems can support either functional (“attributes”) or foundational identity. So, it’s decentralized in that we’re not forcing all digital identity-related interactions through one central control point; instead, peer-to-peer interactions are the default.</p><p>Starting with this definition, it’s easier to evaluate technical standards based on their core ability to support these interoperable capabilities, rather than indexing on affiliation with certain brands or use cases. For example, all the digital credential technologies mentioned in the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EU ARF</a>, including W3C Verifiable Credentials, SD-JWTs, and ISO/IEC 18013-5 mobile driver’s license (mDL), can fit this definition of supporting decentralized identity depending on the implementation details. These can all also violate the definition depending on implementation details.</p><p>It’s worth noting that identity and credentialing systems are already more decentralized than you might realize. Even in the United States, DMVs do not have a monopoly on all forms of identification: other documents, such as passports or permanent residency cards, are widely accepted. Even utility bills and bank statements often play a role in verifying identity.&nbsp;</p><p>If we start with a decentralized landscape, a decentralized approach to the technology seems to make the most sense. Open digital standards for sharing this already broad plethora of credentials largely amount to bringing existing credentials together under one umbrella and opening the playing field for other issuers, whom verifiers can choose to trust or not, on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Already, verifiable digital credentials issued across state and federal bodies fall under different administrations, many of which don’t see eye-to-eye, even within the same agency. This doesn’t even scratch the surface of the complexities within the private sector—and an open system is the best way to accommodate that complexity.&nbsp;</p><p>Here at SpruceID, we believe the use of decentralized identity, under this definition, furthers our mission to let users control their data across the web (and beyond). We will continue to evaluate technologies and technical standards to ensure alignment with these capabilities and our organization’s values.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about how we are working to build decentralized identity, visit our <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn?ref=blog.spruceid.com">knowledge base</a>.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Stablecoins — Inherently, Unfixably, Problematic  …And Why Gold on the Blockchain Makes Them&nbsp;Obsolete <p><a href="https://www.mattereum.com?utm_source=Medium+Stablecoin&amp;utm_medium=article">Mattereum’s</a> partnership with <a href="https://sempsajp.com/">Sempsa JP</a>, one of the world’s oldest and most respected producers and distributors of precious metals, is enabling us to <a href="https://x.com/i/spaces/1vAxRvwLmRVxl">tokenize gold</a> through our German regulated exchange partner <a href="https://mattereum.com/2023/07/23/announcing-swarm-x-mattereum-partnership/">Swarm</a> in quantity, giving investors immutable proof of ownership and provenance so that every token has a traceable, legally enforceable, connection to a specific gold bar in a named vault and warranties relating to its provenance and other qualities, legally valid in 170 countries worldwide. To make it even easier to put gold, or any other high value asset on chain, the Mattereum group, through its German subsidiary Mattereum GmbH has a discount token, <a href="https://mattereum.de/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=marsmatr">MATR*</a>, on sale through Swarm. This gives anyone onboarding assets a discount of up to 50% on their onboarding fees, which is significant when you are talking about gold&nbsp;bars.</p><p>With other forms of tokenized gold, the value of the token is backed by gold that remains in the ownership of the token issuer, and you just have to trust that it’s there. With Sempsa gold as an NFT, backed by a Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP), the token buyer indisputably owns the gold to which the token is bound, and their claim to it is enforceable by international law in over<a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/english"> 170 jurisdictions</a>. This combines the solidity and value of owning a physical gold bar with the convenience, speed and flexibility of selling NFTs. No more needing to have bars lugged from the seller’s vault to the purchaser’s vault, no more complex paperwork, no more hassle. This is new, this is revolutionary, and it has the potential to kill stablecoins stone&nbsp;dead.</p><blockquote>It has the potential to kill stablecoins stone&nbsp;dead</blockquote><p>How so?</p><p>Stablecoins exist because they claim to offer the convenience of being blockchain tokens, but with the kind of stability that Bitcoin can’t provide, through being pegged to a currency, usually the US dollar, so that the stablecoin always has a set dollar value that doesn’t fluctuate — pegging (an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegging_(sexual_practice)">unfortunate term</a> [nsfw!], I know, but given the nature of stablecoins, maybe not inappropriate). As a result, they are meant to act as stable repositories of value against Bitcoin’s wildly fluctuating price. It is not uncommon for speculators who have reaped vast profit from Bitcoin fluctuations to cash out and put the earnings into stablecoin to hold onto the profits instead of trading it in for fiat and putting it in a&nbsp;bank.</p><p>So why is tokenized gold better? Why does it make stablecoins dead men walking? Well, for a start, stablecoins are not stable. We’ve already seen that can happen when stablecoins go wrong and depeg, and it was ugly. When TerraUSD and LUNA did it in 2022, it wiped out billions of dollars in value, and there were <a href="https://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2023/moody_launches_new_digital_asset_monitor_to_track_risk">more than 600 fiat-backed stablecoin depegs </a>in 2023 alone. Not so&nbsp;stable.</p><blockquote>There were <a href="https://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2023/moody_launches_new_digital_asset_monitor_to_track_risk">more than 600 fiat-backed stablecoin depegs </a>in 2023&nbsp;alone</blockquote><p>Tokenized gold done through <a href="https://www.mattereum.com?utm_source=Medium+Stablecoin&amp;utm_medium=article">Mattereum</a> so that it legally bonds the token to a named gold bar — one bar, one token — can’t depeg, it creates a StableNFT that is massively more solid than any stablecoins. Faced with this innovation, stablecoins are already dead, they just haven’t realized it&nbsp;yet.</p><p>Let’s dig into that a bit more. So how do you make a stablecoin? Somebody gives you $1 You put the dollar in the bank. They ask for the dollar back, you take the dollar out. Okay, great. That’s fine. How’d you make a living? Well, option one is the bank pays interest, which means it’s lending that money out. And you hoped the bank is stable and doesn’t lend the money to the wrong people. Maybe that’s fine. Maybe it’s not. Option two is to charge transaction fees like Mattereum does on the gold. You give us the gold. We charge a fee. That means that we’re not doing anything stupid with gold. In the meantime, we just hold on to it, we don’t move it, and that costs us some money and we charge that to you. Option three is you give me that dollar and I go and put it into the lowest risk legitimate investment instrument — one of these index funds type things. Now the thing that I told you is worth $1 is correlated to the stock market and if the stock market crashes we’re both toast, but if the stock market booms you get your dollar back and I get to keep all the upside. Then you imagine option three, but with shitcoins, and that’s a stablecoin, and the very, very large providers of stablecoins have problems, because that model is inherently problematic, inherently unfixably problematic; Tether has horrible, horrible lockbox issues. Nobody really knows what’s going on in there. Then USDC had a bunch of money in Silicon Valley Bank. If Silicon Valley Bank had not been bailed out by the US government, they might have had really serious problems — it turns out that they had about<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/13/usdc-stablecoin-regains-dollar-peg-after-silicon-valley-bank-induced-chaos/"> 8% of their reserves</a> in that single financial institution, but no one owning USDC knew that until the bank hit trouble. So stablecoins are highly opaque. They’ve proven that they have interdependence with the global financial system and so are inherently volatile. Plus, there may or may not be issues of mismanagement that can be discovered at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>So, OK, you could say, that’s why we have central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). They are stablecoins, but unlike the privately issued stablecoins I’ve been talking about above, they are issued by a central bank so are no more likely to depeg than the money in your pocket (I am assuming some of you still use actual cash there). Well, yes, but these still have problems that make gold bound stable NFTs a better option. Like the dollar or pound, or whatever currency you choose, any CBDC linked to those is going to suffer the same problems with inflation that steadily erodes their value, at 2–3% inflation a year, which is less than recent rates, it doesn’t take long for a CBDC to have a fraction of the buying power it once did. Not so with gold, gold value, as I said, is steadily going up, and a stable NFT for a gold bar is going to do the same, so it’s still better than a CBDC stablecoin.</p><p>The core problem with privately issued stablecoins is a lack of transparency because you cannot see exactly what your stablecoin is backed by — that is proprietary information to these guys. But this proprietary information is what you would need to have full insight into a stablecoin and be able to do a full analysis and be sure what you were getting for your dollar. It’s not like it’s a small pool of these things — there’s $140 billion in them. What I’m suggesting is that the first criteria that you want for a stable instrument is staggering, bright side of the moon, black and white photography levels of clarity. You want a zero atmosphere full daylight shot of where the underlying asset is. With an on chain gold StableNFT backed by a MAP, that’s what you get. It’s this chunk of solid gold; it’s got this number; it’s in this building here. You own&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>You cannot see exactly what your stablecoin is backed by — that is proprietary information to these&nbsp;guys</blockquote><p>In theory, that could be a dollar in a central reserve bank account instead. You can have an account with the US Federal Reserve Bank — you could just say there’s a million dollars in the Fed and million tokens one to one, here’s your deal. You could have a situation where you have an absolutely transparent portfolio. We can say we own a single thing and it is backed with a BlackRock index fund and for every dollar you give us we buy BlackRock index fund; here’s an audit report that says this is exactly what we own. We own 151,000 shares and our current market value x that is more than your reserve. Have a nice day. You could use gold and then it would be dollar price, gold, you give us $1 — we buy gold, when we can show you that there is enough money in the portfolio. We like the gold option, anything even remotely tied to dollars loses value due to inflation. Gold doesn’t — in 1929, ten gold bars would buy the average house, and today, ten gold bars will still buy you the average&nbsp;house.</p><blockquote>Anything even remotely tied to dollars loses value due to inflation. Gold&nbsp;doesn’t</blockquote><p>There’s no reason that you couldn’t use any single appreciating asset in a very simplistic way. If your asset value goes up, your investment goes up, and if it goes down, so does your investment. What you wouldn’t get with that is any of the fancy schmancy obfuscated hedge fund stuff, where if that asset went down, you are meant to have something else in the portfolio that would go up. Everything balances and you aren’t supposed to lose money, and, hopefully, you gain some. But as soon as we go down that path, we wind up a highly opaque hedge fund that sells portfolios, which are being used to theoretically secure value in an asset that is not supposed to go up and down. So basically, the suggestion here is that you either pick one thing and your stable coin goes up and down to that one thing, or you pick a basket of things and they’re connected by super complicated maths and you have to pray that that thing is stable, and that’s what the grown ups are supposed to do. However, those grown ups are called hedge fund operators. And hedge funds implode all the time. So if you’re going to pick one thing and anchor to that thing, it should either be something like $1 in a Federal Reserve Bank Account, or it could be an index fund object, or it could be something like US Treasury bonds, or it could be a gold brick, but these are the kinds of assets which have extraordinary ease of audit. And then at that point, you either have a token attached to a very large very non-transparent bucket of things or you have a token which is directly attached to a thing which is extremely audited. These are your two&nbsp;choices.</p><p><a href="https://www.mattereum.com?utm_source=Medium+Stablecoin&amp;utm_medium=article">Mattereum </a>has made it easy to have a token directly attached to an asset which is extremely audited. The MAP enables a firm legal binding between the asset and the token, so that ownership is solid and provable. The asset we believe is the absolute best to bind to is gold, so that is what we have done, and we are looking to grow the gold ecosystem, we’re building to increase opportunities for token buyers to own something that really is stable and acts as a repository of value. Also, Gold is steadily going up in value, dollars are getting eaten by inflation, even without all the underlying horrors lurking in stablecoins. The whole sector is just awaiting a deeply horrible, value-incinerating implosion, it’s only a matter of time before something blows away the whole house of cards and reveals the ‘stable’ in stablecoin to be wishful thinking. With the alternative that Mattereum’s gold-bound StableNFTs offer, why take that risk? Do you want to hang around and get pegged by your stablecoins?</p><p>Stablecoins are truly dead in the water for those who have eyes to see.

 A Deep Dive to ZKPs and Decentralized Technology with Extrimian 



<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital identity management, privacy and security are paramount. <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp/" title="">Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</a> stand out as a revolutionary technology, enabling the verification of claims without revealing underlying data. Extrimian is at the forefront, integrating ZKPs into decentralized digital identity systems to offer unmatched security and privacy.</p>



 Understanding Zero Knowledge Proofs 



<p>Zero Knowledge Proofs are a form of cryptographic protocol that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This technology is particularly potent for privacy-preserving digital interactions.</p>



 Key Concepts of ZKP: 



 
 Completeness: If the statement is true, an honest verifier will be convinced by an honest prover. 



 Soundness: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability. 



 Zero-knowledge: If the statement is true, no verifier learns anything other than the fact that the statement is true. 
 



 Extrimian’s Application of ZKPs in Digital Identities 



<p>Extrimian harnesses the power of ZKPs to enhance the security and privacy of digital identities. By using ZKPs, Extrimian allows users to authenticate and share their credentials without exposing any sensitive personal information.</p>



 Example of ZKP in Action: 



 <code>const { zkSnark, generateProof, verifyProof } = require('extrimian-zkp-toolkit');

// Setup: A simple example where a user proves they are over 18 without revealing their age.
const { proof, publicSignals } = generateProof({
    age: 21,
    lowerBound: 18
});

// Verification: The verifier checks the proof without ever knowing the user's exact age.
const isValid = verifyDetails({
    proof,
    publicSignals
});

console.log(isValid);  // Output: true</code> 



 



<p>This simple code snippet demonstrates how a user can prove they meet the age requirement without revealing their exact age, using Extrimian’s ZKP toolkit.</p>



 Practical Use Cases of ZKP in Decentralized Digital Identity 



<p>ZKPs empower several practical applications in decentralized identity systems:</p>



 
 Privacy-Enhanced Authentication: Users can authenticate themselves to services without revealing any unnecessary personal information, thus enhancing privacy. 



 Credential Verification: Verify the authenticity of credentials without exposing the underlying data, useful in scenarios like employment verification or accessing restricted services. 



 Fraud Prevention: Secure systems against fraudulent claims and transactions by enabling entities to prove the legitimacy of their actions without revealing sensitive data. 
 



 Extrimian’s Integration and Benefits 



<p>At Extrimian, we integrate ZKPs within our digital identity solutions to provide:</p>



 
 Enhanced Privacy: Users have complete control over their personal information. 



 Increased Trust: Entities can trust the verification process without accessing private data. 



 Scalability: ZKPs allow for complex operations to be conducted without a significant increase in transaction costs or delays.

<p>Last week, SpruceID attended the European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) in Berlin, an event that brings together industry leaders, innovators, and experts to discuss and explore the latest advancements in digital identity and cloud security.</p><p>This year, SpruceID CEO Wayne Chang was among the panelists contributing to three in-depth discussions on the evolving landscape of decentralized identity. These panels provided a comprehensive overview of how decentralized identity can help mitigate modern threats and enhance trust in digital ecosystems in today’s world.</p> Panel: Building Trust in AI through Decentralized Identity Photo courtesy of the Decentralized Identity Foundation<p>One of our most anticipated sessions was the panel "Building Trust in AI through Decentralized Identity." This session focused on the pressing issues posed by AI technologies and brought together Wayne Chang, Kim Hamilton Duffy from the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), and Linda Jeng, founder of Digital Self Labs.</p><p>In this talk, Wayne highlighted the increasing risks of traditional identification methods in the face of sophisticated AI technologies. He pointed out, “Until now, we’ve been able to get by holding a driver's license up to a webcam, but with new AI tech, you can fool these systems — this is already showing up at the edges. ” He emphasized the rise in phishing attacks utilizing AI-generated voices that can convincingly mimic trusted individuals, making it easier for scammers to deceive victims.</p><p>The panelists discussed how decentralized identity could offer solutions to these emerging challenges. Wayne explained, “We need to add authenticity to communication. We don’t want to present a strong ID every time we want to use a chat app, so it makes sense to embed decentralized identity into comms channels to prove I’m real.” Decentralized identity is not only about identity but also about establishing data governance and creating chains of trust to mitigate risks from synthetic data. This approach empowers individuals with greater control over their data.</p><p>They touched on the promising developments in automated compliance with data regulations and the potential for expanding trust to content authenticity. They emphasized the need for ongoing education and the role of user demand in driving the adoption of decentralized identity technologies. In Linda Jeng’s words, “We need to spend time educating policymakers and the public, but in the end, it comes down to end-user demand for solutions.”</p><p>Read more about the discussions that took place during this panel in the blog post published by the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/building-trust-in-ai-through-decentralized-identity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.</p> Panel: Expert/Digital Wallet &amp; Verifiers Q&amp;A Photo courtesy of the Decentralized Identity Foundation<p>In the Expert/Digital Wallet &amp; Verifiers Q&amp;A session, Anil John, Technical Director of the DHS S&amp;T Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, introduced the newest cohort members of SVIP, including SpruceID. Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO, engaged in a Q&amp;A with digital wallet solution providers and industry experts from other SVIP cohort members, including Hushmesh, Procivis AG, Ubiqu, Netis, and Credence ID. The discussion focused on the practical aspects of integrating digital identity into digital wallets and verifiable credential systems. It covered a range of topics, including the challenges and opportunities in implementing decentralized identity, the role of verifiers in ensuring trust and security, and the potential for digital wallets to enhance user privacy and data control.&nbsp;</p><p>Panelists emphasized the importance of interoperability and user-centered design in developing digital wallet solutions, which are crucial for securely and conveniently managing digital identities and credentials.</p> Panel: Decentralized Identity in Production <p>Our final panel, "Decentralized Identity in Production," explored the practical applications of verifiable credentials and the integration of decentralized identity into production environments.&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne, along with panelists from Condatis, Adobe, Spherity, and Accenture, shared valuable insights and experiences on the business case for decentralized identity, highlighting key success factors and lessons learned from recent projects and discussing how verifiable credentials have been effectively integrated into workforce certifications, supply chain documentation, and educational qualifications, demonstrating enhanced trust achieved through decentralized identity. </p><p>The panelists emphasized key success factors in project learnings, product roadmaps, and the future direction of decentralized identity, and they encouraged attendees to explore practical applications for decentralized identity technologies within their organizations.</p> Continuing the Conversations on Decentralized Identity <p>We're grateful to have been invited to speak on several panels alongside other experts in the field at this year's event. </p><p>SpruceID is excited to be at the forefront of these important discussions and committed to advancing the development and adoption of decentralized identity solutions. We look forward to continuing these discussions and working with partners and stakeholders from EIC!</p><p>Check out our website to learn more about how SpruceID uses decentralized identity to build a more secure and trustworthy digital future.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

   We’re excited to announce that guidance for SAP Identity Management (IDM) customers planning to migrate their identity management scenarios to Microsoft Entra is now available.

  <p>We’re excited to announce that guidance for SAP Identity Management (IDM) customers planning to migrate their identity management scenarios to Microsoft Entra is now available. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-and-sap-collaborate-to-modernize-identity-for-sap/ba-p/4056600">previous post</a>, we discussed SAP ending maintenance for their identity management solution (SAP IDM) by 2030.&nbsp;We've since begun jointly developing documentation to help customers plan a seamless migration to the recommended alternative—Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;For many customers, it may be possible to get started immediately, leveraging the subscriptions that they already own with Microsoft 365 suites. Microsoft 365 enterprise suite licenses include Entra ID P1 features that will be the focus of this first round of guidance.&nbsp;In this post, we’ll also outline additional benefits of Microsoft Entra ID and list some key partners who can help you get started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Continuing collaboration for enterprise security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft and SAP have a long history of collaborating to keep our customers’ organizations productive and secure—an effort especially important now as more companies have adopted hybrid work arrangements, making it possible to work from office and from home. For example, last year we announced how Microsoft Sentinel is helping organizations bring&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/revolutionize-your-sap-security-with-microsoft-sentinel-s-soar/ba-p/3823857">SOAR threat monitoring capabilities to their SAP environments</a>. We continue to deepen our relationship, and now we’re extending support for SAP customers’ digital transformation and cloud adoption goals with a seamless and secure identity management solution in Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing the first set of&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/MigrateFromSAPIDM">guidance to migrate from SAP IDM to Entra ID</a>. SAP customers who are using SAP IDM for cloud and on-premises applications like SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud Identity Services, or Windows Server Active Directory can begin to use Microsoft Entra features such as Conditional Access to enforce Zero Trust access policies, and automatic provisioning that ensures users have the accounts they need for their job role. For SAP IDM customers who want more guidance on advanced IAM integrations, such as with Micosoft Entra ID Governance or external IDs, for example, we’re developing additional in-depth guidance on each of those areas that will be published later this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modernizing your security strategy and moving toward a Zero Trust framework is not an overnight process, so we recommend customers start their journey to adopt cloud services and gain productivity and security benefits.&nbsp;Therefore, we’ve included guidance for migration of the most common scenarios, including:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft and SAP will continue to enhance Microsoft Entra ID and deliver deeper integrations with SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance.&nbsp; As new scenarios become available, we’ll provide ongoing updates to this&nbsp;guidance, incorporating customer and partner feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Modern identity management is a strategic investment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Progressive organizations are switching to cloud-based identity solutions. Older systems, designed for on-site environments, fail to satisfy the demands of the modern cloud-first, mobile, decentralized workforce. Additionally, they can be expensive, complicated, and susceptible to security risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that multifactor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on methods&nbsp;<a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW166lD?culture=en-us&amp;country=us">can reduce password breaches by 99.9%</a>, but the benefits of a cloud-based solution in Microsoft Entra ID extend beyond just a stronger security posture. Optimized operational efficiency allows identity teams to do more impactful work and an improved user experience makes the entire organization less frustrated. By moving to Microsoft Entra ID, the benefits of your strategic investment continue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for SAP and non-SAP apps and systems—both on-premises and cloud&nbsp; 
 Rich set of APIs, SDKs,&nbsp;and connectors for customization&nbsp; 
 Minimized vendor footprint&nbsp; 
 Reduced costs and complexity&nbsp; 
 Help meeting identity-related requirements for GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 
<p>Modernizing identity management is key to boosting organizational security and shielding users and assets from the most common security threats. It’s more than just a cybersecurity measure; it also enhances user experience and operational efficiency. Generative AI, Zero Trust security, decentralized identity, and the flexibility to tailor access policies to exactly match your unique needs and demands offer compelling opportunities to better protect&nbsp;your apps and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Partner network ready to help 
<p>&nbsp;<br>We’ve also been working with a set of key partners to help organizations begin their migrations, including some with long-term experience in Microsoft/SAP environments. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are organizations with whom we’ve shared the guidance and can help get you started:</p>

Looking ahead, we are preparing for a comprehensive hard fork scheduled for next month, aimed at introducing broader systemic improvements and new functionalities. This article will outline the recent updates and preview what to expect from the upcoming&nbsp;changes.</p> Updates on Aergo&nbsp;Scan <p>In anticipation of the Aergo V4 hard fork, we have introduced a new feature to Aergo Scan, the Internal Transaction UI (Beta version). This enhancement, inspired by similar features in the Ethereum Explorer, enables users and network participants to track detailed histories related to addresses and transactions effortlessly.</p><p>This is just a glimpse of what the Aergo V4 hard fork will bring, including the full implementation of internal transaction logging to increase transparency across all transactional histories. Additionally, contract sources will be stored and compiled directly on-chain, facilitating easy access and reference.</p> Upcoming Hard Fork to Aergo&nbsp;V4 <p>The Aergo V4 hard fork is focused on several key objectives:</p>  Enhancing Transparency: <br>- We are committed to increasing the Aergo mainnet’s transparency for both developers and users, fostering a more trustful environment.  Adopting a “White-Box” Model: <br>- This new model will enhance the transparency and readability of contracts and transactions, benefiting both current and future applications.<br>- The new data model will prep Aergo for applications on Machine Learning and Small and Large Language Model integration”  <p>The new features for Aergo V4 include the following:</p>  Internal transaction logging:<br>- Provides increased transparency for complex contracts that interact with each other.<br>- Essential for future developments like DAOs and enabling machine learning on the Aergo&nbsp;mainnet.  C<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/issues/149">omposable Transactions</a>:<br>- Explicit atomic transactions without relying on internal transactions<br>- Enhancing transparency and trustless transactions without the need for turing complete contract implementation (“White-box transactions”)  Text-based Contracts:<br>- All Lua contracts on Aergo will be stored as source code (in lieu of bytecode) to make it more human-readable and deterministic<br>- The basis for text-based language model applications as well (same as text-based transactions)  T<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/issues/252">ext-based Transactions (WIP)</a>:<br>- A transaction format that is both human-readable and machine-interpretable, embodying the principles of the <a href="https://webisoft.com/articles/ricardian-contract/">Ricardian Contract</a> <br>- Aims to fully realize Ricardian Contract capabilities<br>- Also serves as a foundation for text-based language model applications<br>- Enables the use of text-based transactions for prompt engineering and data&nbsp;storage  <p>The technical specifications for the new features introduced in the Aergo V4 hard fork are available on <a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/discussions/256">GitHub</a>.

<p>In a hybrid world that blends on-premises and cloud-based resources, securing access to sensitive data and systems is no longer achieved by defending a perimeter, but through authentication. While authentication technologies have evolved over the past decades from their humble password origins, preventing unauthorized access still hinges on choosing and implementing the right identity-based controls.</p>
<p>This involves navigating a landscape where knowledge-based, possession-based, biometric, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods offer a variety of advantages and limitations. Let’s consider each of the options available to organizations and how to select the right mix of controls to improve their security posture.</p>
 Knowledge-Based Authentication 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA), which encompasses passwords and PINs, is the most traditional form of authentication. Its widespread adoption and user familiarity make it a convenient starting point for many security protocols. However, its susceptibility to social engineering, phishing attacks, and the perennial issue of weak password creation by users necessitate a cautious approach. For environments where ease of use is paramount and risk levels are comparatively low, KBA can serve as a component of a more comprehensive security strategy, particularly when augmented with additional authentication factors.</p>
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is best suited for environments with comparatively low risk levels, where ease of use is paramount and the accessed information is not highly sensitive or critical. It can serve as a supplementary authentication factor in conjunction with other methods, such as biometric or device-based authentication. Examples include accessing non-critical information, utilizing KBA alongside other authentication methods as a first factor, and implementing it in public Wi-Fi hotspots for streamlined user access without compromising security.</p>
 Possession-Based Authentication 
<p>Possession-based authentication methods require users to have a physical object, such as a security token or a mobile device, to gain access. This approach adds a tangible layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access without physical possession of the required object. It’s particularly effective in scenarios where additional security is needed without significantly complicating the user experience, such as in financial transactions or access to high-security areas. However, the risk of loss or theft and the potential cost implications of deploying hardware devices must be considered.</p>
<p>Possession-based authentication methods offer heightened security measures for a range of scenarios, including financial transactions, remote work access, secure online transactions, and compliance-driven environments like legal and government agencies. In online banking, users require physical possession of a security token or mobile device to access their accounts securely. Similarly, in remote work settings, this method ensures that only authorized employees with designated devices can connect to corporate networks and sensitive data, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access. Additionally, in e-commerce platforms and online payment systems, possession-based authentication enhances transaction security, reducing the risk of fraud and protecting sensitive financial information. Furthermore, compliance-driven industries can benefit from this approach to meet regulatory obligations and safeguard confidential information.</p>
 Biometrics 
<p>Biometric authentication offers a high-security level by utilizing unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. This method is highly resistant to traditional hacking attempts and provides a seamless user experience. It is well-suited for environments where security cannot be compromised, such as in government or healthcare settings. Nevertheless, concerns around privacy, the potential for spoofing, and the need for compatible hardware investments can pose challenges. Organizations must weigh these factors against the critical need for secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.</p>
<p>Biometric authentication, which leverages unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, is ideal for various high-security environments. It is best suited for secure access to sensitive data and fortifying high-risk online systems. Despite its advantages, organizations must consider privacy concerns, potential spoofing, and compatible hardware investments when deploying biometric authentication systems.</p>
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>MFA combines two or more authentication methods listed above to create a layered security approach, significantly enhancing protection against various threats. By integrating knowledge, possession, and biometric factors, MFA creates a dynamic defense mechanism that is much harder for attackers to bypass. This method is ideal for protecting sensitive data and critical systems, offering a balanced solution that addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in single-method authentication systems. While MFA introduces complexity and potential user resistance, its ability to significantly reduce security risks makes it a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategies.<br>
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a versatile security method that finds applications across industries, serving to protect sensitive data and critical systems. More commonly, MFA is required to ensure secure access to corporate systems from outside the office, and in e-commerce platforms to safeguard customer accounts and high-risk customer and citizen transactions. Overall, MFA provides a defense mechanism against various threats, combining multiple authentication factors to significantly enhance security and mitigate risks inherent in single-method authentication systems.</p>
 Passwordless 
<p>Passwordless authentication represents a significant leap forward in cybersecurity, eliminating the vulnerabilities associated with traditional knowledge-based methods. The majority of authentication methods included in the above still require a user name AND password as a first step in authenticating users. But, by leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a user-friendly and highly secure alternative that reduces the risk of phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This method is particularly advantageous in creating a seamless user experience without compromising security, and ideal for environments aiming to minimize friction while maintaining high security standards. Organizations looking to bolster access security while enhancing user satisfaction should consider integrating passwordless authentication into their strategic security framework, offering an optimal balance between ease of use and robust protection.<br>
Organizations across diverse sectors, particularly those looking for a better, more secure user experience, should carefully consider integrating passwordless authentication into their security frameworks. By leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a robust and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based methods, effectively mitigating the risks associated with phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This approach not only enhances security posture but also fosters a seamless and efficient user experience, aligning with the modern landscape of digital operations where stringent security measures and user satisfaction are paramount.</p>
 Choosing the Right Strategy 
<p>The choice of authentication method should be driven by an organization’s specific needs, considering factors such as the sensitivity of the data, user experience requirements, and regulatory compliance mandates. Here are four key considerations for selecting the appropriate authentication method:</p>
 
 Risk Assessment: Evaluate the level of security risk associated with the data or systems being protected. Higher risk scenarios may warrant more stringent authentication methods, such as biometric or MFA. 
 User Experience: Consider the impact on the user. While security is paramount, overly cumbersome authentication processes can lead to poor compliance and user frustration. 
 Cost and Infrastructure: Assess the financial and infrastructure implications of deploying new authentication technologies. While advanced methods like biometric authentication offer enhanced security, they also come with higher implementation costs. 
 Compliance Requirements: Ensure that the chosen authentication method aligns with industry regulations and standards, which may dictate specific security measures. 
 
<p>Defending against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats requires understanding the unique advantages and limitations of available authentication methods, and selecting the controls that are best aligned with organizational needs and user expectations. Using the methods described above can help define an authentication strategy that ensures security measures remain robust, responsive, and user-friendly.</p>

  <p>Providing a product or service across markets internationally can come with significant technical and regulatory overhead. The challenge of such overhead might seem to reduce itself in the current market development in Europe with the soon to be standardized eIDAS architecture and unified wallet interaction protocols that seem to streamline identity integration requirements across 27 countries. In practice though, moving beyond the EU context will still require significant adaptation and often parallel implementation of identity standards and protocols, this is true for the Swiss market as much as it is true for the US or even Japanese market. While all these markets move towards the digital identity wallet paradigm as a new identity model, their technical approach differs significantly.</p>
<p>Abstracting this complexity for companies that simply want to provide their product or service across markets is a tough challenge. Solution providers need to consistently monitor changing specifications, requirements, and regulation, while making sure that their own technological platform is ready to support the variety at hand. Many incumbent solutions and platforms do not handle such diversity well since they were developed for a concrete market environment and then updated on a sub optimal path of evolution towards ever more complexity.</p>
<p>As a Swiss provider of digital identity core technologies, Procivis had to naturally tackle the challenge of a future proof technology solution that is capable of handling complexity since day one. Our home market is too small to justify a solution built for only that environment, so we had to get creative and build a product that can naturally handle complexity and interoperability without compromise.</p>
<p>This presentation will tell the story of our journey to rethink product development in times of uncertainty. It will describe how we learned to radically build for adaptability and extensibility. After the initial instinct to resist uncertainty, we learned to embrace it and I will talk about our company's journey to this new state of consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/embracing-diverse-specifications-eic24"></a>

  <p>Digital wallets are applications used to receive, store, and share identity attributes in a standards-based [preferably], secure, privacy enhancing fashion. To prove that the legitimate, natural person is receiving, in possession of, or sharing these identity attributes a means to bind them to the natural person is needed.<br> In 1995, for example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) clearly recognized the desirability of pursuing the use of biometrics in travel documents as the single best way to link the document and its rightful “owner.”<br> In this example the issuing authority binds the identity attributes to the authorized holder by including biometric data in the cryptographically signed logical data structure. When the holder makes an identity claim the relying party (verifier) can determine the authenticity and integrity of the identity attributes and, through biometric recognition, determine if the authorized holder is presenting the information. This works well for the intended use case: in-person identity verification by government authorities for cross border travel.<br> The EU, for another example, specifies three assurance levels for electronic identification (low, superior, and high) which involve different levels of rigor in the identity proofing process and in the binding process itself, from: <br> The binding has been established on the basis of nationally recognised procedures.<br> to<br> The binding has been verified on the basis of a unique identifier representing the legal person used in the national context; and on the basis of information uniquely representing the natural person from an authoritative source.<br> Here the EU defines authoritative source as:<br> any source irrespective of its form that can be relied upon to provide accurate data, information and/or evidence that can be used to prove identity; <br> The goal of digital wallets in general, and the EU digital wallet in particular, is to be able to prove identity claims to a certain level of assurance both in-person (like an ICAO ePassport or ISO 18013-5 mDL) and on-line (like an ISO 18013-7 mDL). <br> <br> This session will discuss how authentication may rely on the digital wallet to bind the holder to identity claims and what the associated challenges as influenced by varying levels of assurance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-wallet-holder-binding-eic24"></a>

  <p>The IAM community grapples with various issues today, including complex UIs from vendors, vendor-specific jargon, and heavy reliance on SMEs for routine tasks, driving up service costs significantly. This presents a challenge for smaller organizations unable to afford such expenses, hindering their ability to derive benefits, despite training efforts. Large organizations face lengthy onboarding processes and complex implementations, frustrating business lines as they struggle to perform tasks efficiently. Generative AI simplifies the process by removing the need to decipher vendor terminology and navigate intricate UIs. It provides a uniform interface, enhances productivity, and leads to significant savings in deployment and maintenance. This approach enables all stakeholders, including deployment personnel and help desk teams, to effectively engage with IGA.

  <p>The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, and traditional security paradigms are proving inadequate in the face of modern threats. As organizations strive to embrace Zero Trust principles, the role of Privileged Access Management (PAM) is pivotal. This talk explores the transformative concept of "Micro Authorizations" and its potential to shape the optimal direction for PAM implementations in support of Zero Trust initiatives.</p>
<p>The Authorization Fabric decides whether a specific principal is authorized to perform a precise operation on a particular resource and whether the resource permits this access.</p>
<p>The granularity of this approach is vital in today’s threat landscape, requiring organizations to shift their focus to a comprehensive, system-wide authorization framework. This shift, parallels the principles of microservices but applies them to the realm of access control.</p>
<p>Rather than depending on a single point of control, there is a need for a network proxy that acts as a bridge between trust and authorization.</p>
<p>Join us on a journey towards a future powered by micro authorizations, where precision, adaptability, and contextual awareness define access control. Explore how micro authorizations can address contemporary security challenges and facilitate the adoption of the Zero Trust model.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-in-privileged-access-management-eic24"></a>

  <p>Compared to externalising authentication, externalising authorization has proven elusive. Yet a combination of the rise of advanced threat actors, regulation, compliance and pressures for greater business agility is bringing it back in focus. It is tempting to think of externalising authorization as a technology problem. Technology like policy languages, authorization engines and workflow systems is necessary to enable the externalisation of authorization, but it is not sufficient. Externalising authorization requires three foundational building blocks to be in place, namely value for all stakeholders from engineers to customers, supporting business processes and technology. In this session we explore each of these building blocks should be internalised in terms of mapping value for all stakeholders, the process and culture needed to make authorization policies explicit and finally the need to drive authorization infrastructure, from policy language to enforcement engines, into the compute and network fabric to address greenfield and brownfield deployments in order to remove barriers to externalising authorization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/authorization-before-we-externalise-it-eic24"></a>

  <p>In an era marked by the pervasive spread of disinformation and the&nbsp;democratization of advanced artificial intelligence capabilities to&nbsp;create synthetic media, the need for robust defense mechanisms has never been more urgent. The Defending Against Disinformation Common Data Model&nbsp;(DAD-CDM) and the DISARM Framework stand at the forefront of this&nbsp;battle, offering structured approaches to identify, analyze, and&nbsp;counteract disinformation campaigns. The DISARM Framework and DAD-CDM&nbsp;serve as a unified platform for organizations worldwide to exchange&nbsp;critical information, facilitating early detection and rapid response to&nbsp;emerging threats. Leveraging the DISARM Framework, which codifies&nbsp;adversary behaviors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),&nbsp;stakeholders gain insight into manipulative strategies employed in&nbsp;disinformation campaigns, enabling proactive defense measures and&nbsp;enabling a more rapid and comprehensive incident response.<br> <br> In our upcoming presentation, we will explore the intricate&nbsp;intersection of AI, disinformation, and cybersecurity, shedding light on&nbsp;the pivotal role of DAD-CDM and DISARM in safeguarding against evolving threats. Through real-world case studies and practical insights, we&nbsp;explore how these frameworks empower governments, cybersecurity experts,&nbsp;industry, and organizations to mitigate the influence of disinformation&nbsp;and AI-created synthetic media. Join us as we uncover strategies to&nbsp;fortify defenses and foster collaborative efforts in combating&nbsp;misinformation in the digital age.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/combating-misinformation-in-an-ai-enabled-world-eic24"></a>

  <p>The proliferation of micro-services along with the changing threat landscape means it is no longer possible to rely on network segmentation to establish a secure permitter while allowing broad access between services inside the perimeter. As a result, we have to assume that the attackers are inside the perimeter and apply fine grained authorization at the microservice level to ensure least privilege access based on the context of each transaction. This context includes details of the transaction, the user, other services, or workloads in the call chain as well as the trust domains in which the services operate.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are two new complimentary standards being developed in the IETF OAuth working group that provide a standardised mechanism for preserving transaction context. The Transaction Tokens draft provides a mechanism for preserving context for fine grained authorization decisions within a trust domain, while Identity Chaining across Trust Domains provides a mechanism for preserving that context even when crossing trust boundaries. In this session we will provide an overview of these two emerging standards and describe how they are used to enable fine grained authorization in microservices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enabling-fine-grained-authoirization-eic24"></a>

  <p>Stolen secrets and credentials are one of the most common ways for attackers to move laterally and maintain persistence in cloud environments.</p>
<p>Modern cloud deployments employ secrets management systems such as KMS to protect key materials at rest and avoid leaking keys or credentials in source code or other build artifacts. However, secrets are unprotected at runtime, so any vulnerability or compromise of a service could lead to credential theft.</p>
<p>This talk will propose an architecture that, in conjunction with a secret manager, tokenizes secrets and rewrites requests at runtime. Through this approach, application code never directly interacts with key material. Additionally, it enforces stringent access control rules based on Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies for accessing secrets, significantly reducing the blast radius in the event of a security breach.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-workload-identities-eic24"></a>

  <p>As part of the revision of the EU common identity framework regulation, also known as eIDAS 2.0, EU Member States will all soon implement a new common structure for electronic credentials based on digital identity wallets. This includes the development of a European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet.</p>
<p>This wallet can be implemented as a web wallet running in a browser. This means a smartphone is not required to use the wallet – making it inclusive and independent of app stores and phone vendors. Instead of using native APIs to protect cryptographic keys, this web wallet can use FIDO security keys to secure the wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO is a natural fit to secure digital wallets as users are becoming more and more familiar with its associated registration and sign in flows now many websites have adopted passkeys as a means to access their services.</p>
<p>In this session, we will discuss how the wallet works, how FIDO is used to protect the wallet, highlight current use cases of how the wallet is being used by EU member states, and how this model can be replicated in other countries around the world.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-digital-identity-wallets-using-fido-security-keys-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the realm of modern authentication, FIDO and passkeys have launched a new paradigm that is both practical and transformative. Passkey providers have seamlessly integrated the capability to synchronize passkeys across various devices, extending their reach even to different device families. Users enjoy default implementations of passkey providers with each new device, empowering relying parties to leverage passkeys across the multitude of devices.<br> In contrast, relying parties cannot assume the universal presence of identity wallet functionality on the typical devices used by their customers.<br> Given the three-year device switch cycle and the concurrent use of multiple devices, cloud storage services have efficiently addressed the migration of standard data between devices. While these services generally have access to data in the clear, they implement safeguards to prevent inadvertent disclosure.<br> Passkey providers not only synchronize passkeys but also implement robust recovery methods, crucial for scenarios involving the loss or theft of all devices. Similarly, identity wallets, tasked with managing verifiable identity attributes and associated secrets, necessitate safeguards akin to those implemented by passkey providers. <br> This webinar explores the similarities and differences between passkey providers and identity wallets, offering valuable insights into what identity wallets can glean from the proven methodologies of passkeys.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/convergence-of-passkeys-and-identity-wallets-eic24"></a>

  <p>For decentralised identity to reach its full potential we need high levels of trust and high levels of inclusion. <br>As a community we have developed some great standards and practices for identity verification, but they mostly rely on having strong documentation issued by a government if you want to gain the higher levels of trust. <br>The reality is not everyone has strong documentation and not everyone has access to digital technology to verify that documentation remotely. For example, in the UK around 11 million people have neither a passport nor a driving licence, the 2 primary documents used for identity verification. In many countries this number is far higher. <br>And, while we drive forward with more and more technological means of proving who we are online, some people will always struggle to use these technologies or simply not be able to. <br>Vouching for someone as part of the identity verification process has been around for a while but is only now crystalising in the minds of identity experts. It is also one of the most decentralised ways of proving who you are. <br>The process of Vouching is intended to increase inclusivity of population scale identity systems by enabling people with insufficient documentation (identity evidence), or those unable to complete a conventional identity registration to gain a digital identity.<br>In this session Adam Cooper seeks to outline the issues we should be addressing and the approaches we can take to create better inclusivity in digital identity ecosystems based on over a decade of working with governments, citizens, and the private sector to deliver better outcomes for all of us.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-is-already-decentralized-eic24"></a>

However, that framework does not match with a lot of technical and business practices already in use. In Belgium an ecosystem is forming to perform data sharing in a way which is adapted to the needs of the different existing stakeholders: data subjects, sources, attribute attestation service providers, vaults, IdP and relying parties. It reuses a lot of existing initiatives and infrastructure for a low threshold implementation with the high trust level of the existing initiatives. Nevertheless, it allows to implement important features like privacy, selective disclosure, etc.<br> During this presentation, we will see how this alternative ecosystem works, how it ensures trust and ease of use for the different stakeholders (including data subjects) and why it will lead to a low threshold for adoption.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-sharing-ecosystem-and-trust-eic24"></a>

  <p>The Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP), which just had its fourth birthday, has long held the conviction that technical trust alone is insufficient for enabling human trust in digital interactions. Thus, ToIP has been developing a dual stack that pairs technical architecture with governance architecture. <br> <br>To maximize technical interoperability, ToIP believes there must be a minimum viable “trust spanning” protocol that enables ubiquitous secure, private data exchange. Then every digital trust ecosystem can choose which higher-layer “trust task” protocols—such as exchanging digital credentials between digital wallets, or verifying ecosystem participants using trust registries—they need to meet their specific authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy requirements.<br> <br> With regards to the harder problem of human trust, in the real world this is built through relationships, agreements and other intangible elements within a context. By contrast, in the digital world trust has to be engineered. This means each ecosystem needs to be able to define their governance architecture, policies, credentials, and trust lists/registries that can be communicated both within and across ecosystems using interoperable protocols to maximize the potential for cross-ecosystem trust relationships.<br> <br> This interactive panel, moderated by ToIP’s Executive Director, will convene a set of ToIP leaders to explain why they have been investing in this new approach to decentralized digital trust infrastructure, where it fits with eIDAS 2.0, how it builds upon (not replaces) X.509 PKI and OpenID, and what to expect over the coming year.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/emerging-trust-layer-for-the-internet-eic24"></a>

  <p>With cybercrime on the rise, ransomware attacks that target Active Directory (AD), the primary identity store for most businesses worldwide, are as common as having a cup of coffee. Many cyber incidents involve AD in one way or another. Given that an attack on AD, these days, is more of a "when" rather than an "if" scenario, organizations must have a tested AD DR plan and purpose-built solutions for securing AD before a cyberattack and recovering and securing AD after that cyberattack. In addition, if like many organizations today, you have a hybrid identity environment that connects AD with Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD), do you know what needs to happen to reconnect? Recovering as fast as possible is one thing, assessing the security of your AD and mitigating any (critical) risks is another. But what about reconnecting AD back with Entra ID? Knowing which precautionary measures to take to minimize damage (i.e., the impact on user experience and data loss) within Entra ID is of utmost importance!</p>
<p>This presentation discusses the risk to today’s enterprise organizations and explains why prioritizing hybrid identity (Active Directory and Entra ID) security is so important. Examples of various identity threat detection and response (ITDR) tools to evaluate AD security (pre- and post-attack) and discover vulnerabilities that could attract attackers are also discussed.</p>
<p>Attendees will also learn why an AD Recovery Plan is a vital resource for ongoing operational resilience, including the different ways to execute parts of that DR plan and what the impact is of such an execution. Finally, we will discuss what the problem is with reconnecting AD back with Entra ID and what you can do about it to mitigate any impact.</p>
<p>In summary, during this session, attendees will learn the following:</p>
 
 Learn how to evaluate the security of an AD 
 Learn how to prepare for a disaster scenario 
 Learn which backup to choose and why 
 Learn how to remediate risk (due to security) right after recovery 
 Learn how to remediate impact when reconnecting AD with Entra ID&nbsp; 
 
<p>If time allows, the highlights of a real-life AD recovery scenario will be discussed, to put all the pieces together.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ransomware-attack-against-your-ad-eic24"></a>

  <p>Rainer Witzgall, Security Evangelist @Veridium, showcases how Veridium’s Identity Threat Protection A.I. is capable of protecting valid user sessions throughout the entire session, from the first authentication to the broader SSO-experience. Veridium utilizes its groundbreaking and patented identity threat protection technologies in connection with user authentication. Rainer is convinced: “This is where continuous authentication currently sits, its current state of evolvement”. Continuous Authentication can be defined as the “Holy Grail of Identity Security,” as it is the best solution to prevent Account Takeovers.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/one-step-closer-to-continuous-authentication-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the&nbsp;Dialectic of Enlightenment, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer introduce a critical view of the process of civilization, economy and enlightenment as such, a critical view of the seemingly self-evident notion of pure reason, science, and technology. What Horkheimer and Adorno are trying to capture and reflect is the very process of rationality backlashing into irrationality. The long history of enlightenment is thus the demystification of nature and the development of pure calculative rationality. According to Horkheimer and Adorno, we have tried to free ourselves of the dangers and brute force of nature, but in the process of developing technology and production we have ended up narrowing our rational capacities, dominating ourselves, and tying ourselves to a petrified system now even endangering our own planet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We seem to have reached the era of modern technology and exact calculation, but this leaves us with no sense of control or meaningfulness in the face of a global environmental crisis. Humanity's technological orientation to the world makes clear the responsibility of human beings to the well-being of the world. This taking of responsibility will become vital in the future since it has become perfectly clear that the Earth will not be able in the long term to support the exploitative and care-less ways in which ever growing parts of humanity have been inhabiting her since at least the Industrial Revolution. However, the need to ask about modern technology is presumably dying out to the same extent that technology more definitely characterizes and regulates the appearance of the totality of the world and the position of man in it. Thus, it is important to ask: how does modern technology affect our actuality?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will explore how technology is not merely a means to an end but also a lens through which we understand ourselves and the world. It will highlight the increasing responsibility that humanity bears for the well-being of the planet, especially in the face of a global environmental crisis. The session will demonstrate how this transformation represents a radical change in our technological relationship with the planet and with ourselves.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/philosophical-perspective-identity-cybersecurity-professionals-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the fast-evolving landscape of digital connectivity, one of the biggest challenges service providers in highly regulated industries face today is ensuring that authentication and API authorization mechanisms are implemented correctly. At the same time, they are required to meet high expectations of customers for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Traditionally, authentication and API authorization functions have been combined into one system architecture, often through a managed service provided by a vendor. However, this restricts how service providers can customize their identity and access management systems to deliver a consistent brand experience.<br>To thrive in the competitive environment, service providers are increasingly opting to build their own authorization servers in-house. They are taking control of their identity and access management systems to deliver a frictionless and differentiated experience.<br>Discover examples of how well-respected brands have built their fully compliant and secure authorization servers by offloading the protocol processing and management, accelerating the growth of their digital services.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/liberate-yourself-from-vendor-limitations-eic24"></a>

Then, the initial adoption of digital credentials will mostly be driven by ‘local’ needs. This is inevitable due to the decreasing cost and complexity of technology. However, as more and more begin to issue credentials on their own terms with little to no coordination, even when the technology everyone uses is based on interoperable standards, as long as there is no established human trust, two entities won’t be able to accept each other’s credentials right away.

  <p>In the rapidly evolving agricultural sector, the importance of data management and sharing has never been more critical. Traditional methods are no longer sufficient; they create compliance burdens, inefficiencies and face a lack of trust. New Zealand is undertaking a transformative approach with the Digital Farm Wallet pilot, conceived by the Trust Alliance New Zealand (TANZ), a non-profit industry consortium recognising that trusted data sharing is essential for the growth of New Zealand’s primary sector.</p>
<p>The TANZ Digital Farm Wallet Pilot Project exemplifies the commitment to empowering stakeholders to share and verify information in a trusted and permissioned manner, fostering trust and transparency throughout the value chain. This initiative aims to offer tangible proof of brand promises, while alleviating farms from the repetitive tasks of data management.</p>
<p>To ensure international market and financial access demand of digital proofs, such as environmental claims are increasing. The Digital Farm Wallet addresses this by facilitating the sharing of key data points like greenhouse gas and Scope 3 emissions, underscoring good management practices. Exploring various applications, this initiative aims to deliver real value for farmers and food processors.</p>
<p>Klaeri Schelhowe was contracted through Scheddebrock Ltd. to act as the Executive Director for TANZ. In this role she established an industry consortium to focus on trusted data sharing within the primary sector. A significant challenge was posed in bringing together the many and varied stakeholders, many of whom competed with each other, to cooperate in the development of a functioning ecosystem. Developing stakeholder understanding and willingness to engage in a co opetition model in order to build critical mass is a more complex and demanding undertaking than the adoption and deployment of the technology itself.</p>
