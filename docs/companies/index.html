In times where identity chaos prevails, we can see what it means when Julia can no longer be sure about her digital identity, with only her physical identity being certain. In a world dominated by mega corporations Julia‘s experiences with her employer show us the far-reaching significance and influence such corporations have gained in relation to IAM.

<p>Digital transformation is everywhere. It is used to describe so many things that it risks losing its meaning, and with it, the potential for a common approach to supporting it in pursuit of equitable, sustainable development. We’re sharing this blog, then, as part of defining this important area.</p><p>Digital transformation should include both the processes and outcomes of mindful, intentional, and shapeable efforts that lead to intended, prosocial effects. Definitions of digital transformation at the firm level tend to focus on existing or new business models. For McKinsey, it is to “<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-transformation-improving-the-odds-of-success#">enable existing business models by integrating advanced technologies</a>,” while for Salesforce, it’s “<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/what-is-digital-transformation/">using digital technologies to create new — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences</a>.”</p><p>Definitions at the national level tend to take a broader perspective. The European Commission characterizes digital transformation as “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/policy/advanced-technologies_en">a fusion of advanced technologies and the integration of physical and digital systems</a>.” The OECD defines it as “t<a href="https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264312012-en">he economic and societal effects of digitization and digitalization</a>.” This is important; while the first three definitions focus on process, the last focuses on effects and the consequences of these significant changes.</p><p>Development-focused definitions emphasize this outcome-focused perspective but highlight challenges and risk. The Pathways Commission at Oxford University cautions that “<a href="https://bsg-pathwaystoprosperity.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/The_Digital_Roadmap.pdf">The use of digital technologies will not automatically lead to the inclusion of the poor and marginalized</a>.” UNCTAD points to the <a href="https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/der2019_en.pdf">challenge of measuring the broader national digital economy</a> and emphasizes how digital transformation is “<a href="https://unctad.org/topic/ecommerce-and-digital-economy/ungis-dialogue#:~:text=In%20this%20context%2C%20the%20United,UNGIS%20presents%20for%20more%20effective">highlighting the significant divides that exist.</a>” The United Nations Foundation Digital Impact Alliance, having reviewed over 30 frameworks, concludes that “<a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/accelerating-national-digital-transformation-announcing-the-first-in-dials-new-series-of-leadership-briefs/">more work is required to attempt an overarching articulation of the most important elements</a>” of digital transformation. This blog is a contribution to this continuing effort.</p><p>We believe that the emphasis on transformation as both process and effects is particularly important, especially as although digitization and digitalization are well underway, accelerated by the response to COVID-19 (remote working, payments, etc.), these are not inevitable processes. They are the results of human decisions. Similarly, the effects of these are not inevitable, either. We agree that technologies <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1940761.1940772">amplify</a> intent, and left unchecked, digital transformation may amplify the most powerful, strengthening autocracy and dystopia. With strategic engagement and clear intention, it is possible to build ethical and inclusive digital economies, societies, and politics that mitigate risk and prioritize protection.</p><p>Digital transformation that works for all requires values-based intentional focus on the promises of this new era and mindfulness to mitigate their perils. The following five considerations are insights that help us ensure we are intentional in our support to governments, donors, and other partners in their work to ensure digital transformation prioritizes people, protects fundamental rights, and promotes equality of opportunity.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/five-reflections-on-five-years-cc63120363d2">Digital transformation as development in a digital age</a>. Since we made this phrase central to our work in 2016, we’ve only become more convinced that while digital is fundamental to processes of change in politics, economy, and society, the emphasis needs to be not on digital but on the changes and developmental outcomes. It is vital to recognize that this is not simply focusing on technology to drive changes, and that there are particular characteristics and challenges to achieve developmental goals in a digital age. As we wrote for one donor, “Digital transformation introduces new risks as well as opportunities,” so building inclusive, ethical transformation demands engaging “<a href="https://link.medium.com/ZfiwxERgubb">with complex, nuanced concepts around agency, literacy, power, and structure in the digital&nbsp;age.</a>”  <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/five-reflections-on-five-years-cc63120363d2">Digital transformation requires an ecosystem approach</a>. Most digital development projects still exist in sectoral silos and/or are driven by a relentlessly optimistic approach to “connecting the last billion.” This is despite all the evidence pointing to the significant cross-cutting — both negative and positive — impacts of digital technologies on economies and societies as the excellent<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2016"> 2016 World Development Report</a> on “Digital Dividends” laid out. We have found it helpful to firstly define and bind <a href="https://www.digitaldevelopment.org/digital-ecosystems">digital ecosystems</a>, at the national or firm level, for example, and to engage at this level — for example, on mapping a <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/five-reflections-on-five-years-cc63120363d2">digital identity</a> or on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-57878-5_4">entrepreneurial ecosystems</a>. Although the map is not the territory, it is vital to know the terrain before plotting a course to successfully reach your&nbsp;goal.  Digital transformation must be inclusive, leave no one behind, and prioritize the protection of vulnerable communities. Otherwise, at best, it will leave them behind, or at worse, it will increase vulnerability and exclusion. The promise of digital transformation in terms of added value to government and the economy are increasingly recognized, but there is a growing realization of the harms these transformations can bring, particularly on the most vulnerable. We have found that for groups such as <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/report-launch-identity-at-the-margins-identification-systems-for-refugees-69466244fa62">refugees</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/why-is-id-important-for-women/home">women</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">informal, gig, and platform</a> workers, there are increased risks to privacy, personal protection, and secure jobs that enable social wellbeing — not forgetting the risks to <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/unbundling-the-imaginary-community-adf1eb7e5ea8">political process and social polarization</a>. In supporting clients to develop digital transformation strategies, we have emphasized the importance of incorporating “responsible digital” and “digital inclusion” as critical components of strategy to support ethical and inclusive digital transformation.  Digital transformation should be integrative, not additive. In our work with partners, we are often asked to develop a digital program — building a new team and developing a program of work. We have found that to effectively influence the arc of digital transformation, development outcomes can be better achieved if programs and organizations incorporate digital into existing teams, programs, and work. We advised on ways that <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-and-management-information-systems-for-humanitarian-and-social-protection-response-b1b25e5623a2">digital information systems might enable humanitarian to social protection transitions</a> while emphasizing protection and security. We worked with Oxfam to help their team conceptualize, develop, and sustain an <a href="https://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-approach/ict-in-programme]">approach that emphasized digital</a> technologies that “<a href="https://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-approach/ict-in-programme]">are not an end in themselves; but&nbsp;…integrated into existing programs</a>.”  Digital transformation requires leadership and ownership. All change is hard, and without leadership, it is often sidelined and withers. Efforts to direct digital transformation are no different, and require leadership to own and push for the changes that are required. Globally, efforts such as the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a> provide helpful normative framings. With national governments, we’ve found it to be critical to identify champions who take ownership and invest political capital in attaining success. However, champions cannot be isolated figures. One international development donor that we supported in developing a team of digital champions found they were unable to gain traction because they had no ownership over the processes they tried to influence.  <p>There are many different interests advancing the processes and effects of digital transformations, but for these to lead to inclusive development outcomes requires purposeful, intentional, and considered engagement. This will be particularly important as the challenges of equitable progress, social inclusion, and climate change place ever greater demands on the international community and its capacity to&nbsp;respond.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/transformation-in-a-digital-age-9068338fd778">Transformation in a Digital Age</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Firstly, I hope you’re keeping well and looking forward to the holiday season. This has been a difficult year for many, but I’m pleased to say progress has continued unabated here at Nuggets. In fact, we’ve made some significant strides&nbsp;forward.</p><p>We’ve all been working remotely for the past 10 months, with no in-person events since early March. But everyone has adapted well, and the pandemic restrictions haven’t held us&nbsp;back.</p><p>Looking back at some of the highlights from the last 12 months, I’m extremely proud of what we’ve been able to achieve — and enormously excited for&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Here’s a quick&nbsp;recap…</p><p>Product</p>  Our big product news this year was the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nuggets-pay-id/id1216139887">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=life.nuggets.app">Android</a> releases across Europe in May, and shortly after in Australia. This was a huge step for us: making Nuggets available to any business that wants to protect its customer data. Now, anyone can enjoy the privacy, security and simplicity of&nbsp;Nuggets.  We also launched <a href="https://merchandise.nuggets.life/">our own demo store</a>, which allows businesses to test the platform in a live environment. Any business can download Nuggets and experience the onboarding, log in and payment flows — without sharing or storing their data. It gives potential partners a full overview of exactly how the platform works, and allows them to run through the user experience.  Our engineering team grew this year — and will again in 2021. As always, there’s been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes.The team has been hard at work on UI/UX, infrastructure and architecture updates, continually improving the platform’s resilience, robustness and functionality. This puts us in a great position for the exciting things we have lined up for&nbsp;2021.  In June we created a <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xeab7e907e01203bf0b823dbe135b151921b74568">liquidity pool for NUG on Uniswap</a>, meaning NUG is now available to swap with any other ERC20 token available on the platform.  <p>Partnerships and memberships</p>  We announced our commercial partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions in November, after working with them for some time. This is a big one. LexisNexis is one of the world’s largest protectors of private and confidential data, and one of the biggest risk and fraud companies in the world. And this partnership has huge, positive implications for us. Specifically, we’re working together to deliver self-sovereign digital identity (SSI) solutions for existing and prospective customers. <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/new-nuggets-partnership-with-lexisnexis-risk-solutions-769fa676de0">There’s more on this on Alastair’s blog</a>.  We joined the<a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/"> Open Identity Exchange</a> (OIX) earlier this year, complementing our existing membership of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>. Formed in 2010 to address the increasing challenges of building trust in online identity, OIX is uniquely dedicated to ID Trust. As a member, we’re collaborating on thought leadership initiatives and getting involved in sector-specific working groups. Fellow members include companies such as Barclays, Microsoft, LexisNexis and HSBC. We’ll also be able to support pilot projects, working alongside other members. For more on OIX, read <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/were-now-members-the-open-identity-exchange-89424eb77ad8">my blog from September</a>.  <p>Awards and recognition</p><p>We’ve done well on this score in the past, and thought last year would be hard to beat. Little did we know! We don’t celebrate these accolades just to show off — they’re important evidence of the impact we’re&nbsp;making.</p><p>Let’s start with the&nbsp;awards:</p>  Most recently, we won ‘<a href="https://www.emergingpaymentsawards.com/2020-winners">Best Use of Blockchain in Financial Services</a>’ at the Emerging Payments&nbsp;Awards  We won ‘<a href="https://www.retail-systems.com/awards/winners20.php">Mobile Innovation of the Year</a>’ at the Retail Systems Awards, and ‘<a href="https://www.payments-awards.com/awards/winners20.php">Security Innovation of the Year</a>’ at the Payments Awards — where we were nominated for five awards in&nbsp;total.  Nuggets also won the <a href="https://youtu.be/AemOOIByaQg">Women in Payments Unicorn Challenge</a>, where I got to showcase the platform to a panel of judges from Santander, JP Morgan and American Express. Competing against five other fintechs, we were especially proud to win both the main judges’ award and the audience choice&nbsp;award.  On a personal note, I was honoured to receive some individual awards this year, including <a href="https://techplaymakerawards.com/last-years-awards/seema-khinda-johnson">Entrepreneur of the Year at the Booking.com Technology Playmaker Awards</a>, and the <a href="https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2020/2020-female-fintech-competition-winner-announced-en-11710.htm">Female FinTech Competition 2020</a> held by Atos, Deutsche Bank, Google and TechQuartier.  <p>We were nominated for other awards&nbsp;too:</p>  We were named as one of the 10 Best Payments Startups globally in Efma-Capgemini’s Financial NewTech Challenge 2020  We were nominated for ‘Best Enterprise Security Product’ at Computing.co.uk’s Technology Product Awards, and were up for a Financial Services Forum’s Product and Service Innovation Award, in the Security&nbsp;category  <p>There was plenty of high-profile recognition for Nuggets&nbsp;too:</p>  We were named one of the ‘<a href="https://info.harringtonstarr.com/the-financial-technologist-tufwa-edition-2019-0">Most Influential Firms in Financial Technology for 2020</a>’ by Financial Technologist Magazine. Judges from EY and Lloyds Banking Group selected the shortlist based on innovation, growth, product and&nbsp;team.  We were listed in <a href="https://www.businesscloud.co.uk/100-fintech-disrupters-2">BusinessCloud’s 100 FinTech Disrupters</a>, at number 42. That put Nuggets alongside some of the UK’s most established names such as Revolut, Starling Bank, Monzo and Checkout.com  We were also included in the <a href="https://www.efma.com/assets/portals/fintech/FNT_Watchlist_banner_Final.pdf">Efma-Capgemini Global Financial NewTech 2020 Watchlist</a>. The list is made up of 100 Financial NewTechs that will help reshape financial services in&nbsp;2020.  Alastair and I appeared in the <a href="https://www.businessleader.co.uk/who-are-the-uks-top-32-fintech-leaders/97865">UK’s ‘Top 32’ fintech leaders</a> by Business Leader&nbsp;News  I was also named one of the <a href="https://www.paymentssource.com/list/the-most-influential-women-in-payments-2020">Most Influential Women in Payments 2020</a> by PaymentSource, and selected for the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/30-entrepreneurs-selected-for-female-founders-first-programme-by-barclays">Female Founders First programme</a>, created by Barclays and Techstars. Just two weeks ago, I made it onto the <a href="https://asiansintech.com/top-100-asian-stars-in-uk-tech-2020">Top 100 Asian Stars in UK Tech&nbsp;list</a>.  <p>Team</p>  Our sales team grew this year, and we were delighted to welcome Ben Geleit as Director of Partnerships and Alliances. Ben’s been driving all the end-to-end go-to-market activity and commercialisation. We’re now working through a number of great opportunities, and hope to reveal more in the new&nbsp;year.  <p>Events and&nbsp;media</p><p>We haven’t been to as many events as previous years — for obvious reasons! But we did manage to get to a few at the start of the&nbsp;year.</p>  I took part in a fireside chat as part of the European Women Payments Network Meetup, held at legal firm Allen and Overy’s offices in London in February.  In January, I was invited by MasterCard to speak at Paris FinTech Forum. I showcased Nuggets during a session entitled ‘Building trust in the future with…Data’.  I was also involved in a panel discussion at February’s Women in Identity Meetup, where the discussion focussed on ‘Diversity and Identity’.  Our last event before the lockdown was in March, when Alastair took to the stage at London Blockchain Week — twice! On Day One he was on a panel on Decentralised Finance. Day Two saw him discussing data sovereignty on the Decentralised Data Marketplace panel.  <p>Once again, there’s been a huge amount of media coverage throughout the year. We’ve been in titles like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-id-solution-aims-to-tackle-spike-in-delivery-fraud-amid-coronavirus-measures">CoinDesk</a>, <a href="https://www.retail-week.com/tech/seven-tech-innovations-to-help-run-stores-in-a-post-coronavirus-world/7034882.article?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT1RKaU1XWm1aak16Wm1KaiIsInQiOiJESkpXSkJtVlZxQjh6Mm5FcjFkaUNhWjVGbUVqVnMxbEY1VHlKWExEZWFRRHFPaFZWdjd0VVdtbTV5Rlp5K2FKaUFyU3AxMENhM0d1Z2U2a1pYWWlWY0FobVZlaFNXdjdMa1NuZmM0SWV5WlVOTE5aWEtpeXN0eFFuVVdMVmdyNSJ9&amp;authent=1">RetailWeek</a>, Cointelegraph (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-digital-id-putting-people-in-control-of-their-data">here</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bookingcoms-entrepreneur-of-the-year-talks-blockchain-and-women-in-tech?platform=hootsuite">here</a>), <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/how-biometrics-can-put-an-end-to-identity-theft">TechRadar</a>, <a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/the-era-of-cashlessness-is-here-are-we-prepared-for-the-change/">The Fintech Times</a>, <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/lexis-nexis-risk-explores-blockchain-identity-to-address-bank-fraud">Ledger Insights</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202005/nuggets-brings-biometrics-to-delivery-confirmation-as-industry-offers-solutions-for-new-working-normal">Biometric Update</a>, to name but a few. <a href="https://nuggets.life/media.html">Visit the Media page on our website</a> for a full list of this year’s coverage.</p><p>Alastair continued to publish his influential thought leadership articles on Forbes.

  <p>Nowadays, using a password for authentication is becoming less and less secure. Password attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and data breaches occur more frequently. <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>, the website where you can check if your account has been compromised in a data breach, contains more than 10 billion accounts and more than 600 million passwords. With <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/informationweek-home/password-reuse-abounds-new-survey-shows/d/d-id/1331689">62% of users reusing passwords</a>, a successful attack on one of the websites gives the attacker access to your accounts on other sites as well. What’s more, the Director of Identity Security at Microsoft warns that <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/your-pa-word-doesn-t-matter/ba-p/731984">long and complex passwords mostly don’t help either</a>. Using multi-factor authentication is one of the easiest ways to secure your account but is still suspectable to some types of attacks.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about how passwordless authentication works, why it is more secure, and how to implement passwordless authentication with WebAuthn in ASP.NET Core together with Okta.</p>

<p>To continue, you will need:</p>

 
   A basic knowledge of C# and JavaScript 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio 2019</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core">.NET Core 3.1 SDK</a> 
   Windows 10 Anniversary Update or newer and a computer with either a fingerprint reader, a Near-Infrared webcam, or a USB security key. 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
 

 Introduction to Passwordless Authentication with WebAuthn 

<p>The Web Authentication (also known as WebAuthn) is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> specification of an API that allows web applications creation and authentication using public-key cryptography instead of using passwords. The specification is the official web standard for passwordless login since March 2019 and <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=webauthn">is supported by all major desktop and mobile browsers</a>.</p>

<p>The web browser sits between two components that are outside the browser:</p>

 
   Relying Party—also known as a web server—is the web application that will use web authentication API to register and authenticate users. 
   Authenticators— are devices that can generate a cryptographic key pair and register it with the relying party. An authenticator can be a device with TouchID, FaceID, Windows Hello, or a USB or Bluetooth security key. 
 

<p>A web browser’s role is to exchange data between authenticators and relying parties, provide a user interface for authenticators if needed, and manage error handling.</p>

<p>When the authenticator generates a new private-public key pair for a website, the browser sends the public key and a random credential ID to the server, but the private key is stored securely on the user’s device. This makes passwordless authentication much more secure as there is no need to store or remember passwords anymore, and the public key is not secret and cannot be used without the corresponding private key.</p>

 Benefits of Passwordless Authentication with WebAuthn 

<p>Passwordless authentication has several key advantages:</p>

 
   Protection against phishing; if an attacker creates a fake login page, the user won’t be able to login because the keypair is scoped to the website’s origin. 
   Reduction of the impact of data breaches; if a data breach happens and an attacker steals public keys, they can’t authenticate without the private key. 
   Invulnerability to password attacks: With passwordless authentication, users can’t reuse passwords anymore, and user accounts aren’t susceptible to brute-force attacks either. 
 

 Setup Windows Hello for Fingerprint Authentication 

<p>Before I start the project, let’s set up fingerprint authentication with Windows Hello. Windows Hello requires Windows 10 Anniversary Update or newer, so make sure to update your Windows if you are using an older Windows version.</p>

<p>Click the Start menu, open Settings, click Accounts and click Sign-in Options.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then click on the Windows Hello Fingerprint, click Set up and click Get started On the next screen, swipe your finger to add your fingerprint.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, you are ready to add passwordless authentication to your web application.</p>

 Configure Passwordless Authentication in ASP.NET Core Web App 

<p>First, create a new ASP.NET Core project. Fire up Visual Studio and create a new project by clicking File&gt;New Project select ASP.NET Core Web Application, and click Next. Name the app OktaWebAuthn and click Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the next window, select Web Application (Model-View-Controller). Now, click Create, and Visual Studio will create a new ASP.NET Core web project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To enable passwordless authentication for the project, I will use <a href="https://github.com/abergs/fido2-net-lib">FIDO2 .NET Library</a>, so go ahead and add a NuGet package for it and Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Fido2.AspNet
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson --version 3.1.10
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>appsettings.json</code> file and add this section:</p>

   <code>  "fido2": {
    "serverDomain": "localhost",
    "origin": "https://localhost:44372",
    "timestampDriftTolerance": 300000
  }
</code>   

<p>Make sure that <code>Enable SSL</code> is checked and replace <code>44372</code> with the port number that your project is configured to use:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, open <code>Startup.cs</code> file and configure the FIDO2 .NET Library in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method:</p>

   <code>services.AddControllersWithViews().AddNewtonsoftJson();

services.AddFido2(options =&gt;
{
  options.ServerDomain = Configuration["fido2:serverDomain"];
  options.ServerName = "Okta WebAuthn Demo";
  options.Origin = Configuration["fido2:origin"];
  options.TimestampDriftTolerance = Configuration.GetValue&lt;int&gt;("fido2:timestampDriftTolerance");
});
</code>   

<p>Now, you are ready to add passwordless authentication to the project. The first step is to enable users to register a new user account using passwordless authentication.</p>

 Create User Accounts with Passwordless Authentication 

<p>Open the <code>_Layout.cshtml</code> file in <code>Views\Shared</code> folder and add the following before the <code>&lt;ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"&gt;</code> element:</p>

   <code>&lt;ul class="navbar-nav"&gt;
    @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" href="#"&gt;Hello, @User.Identity.Name&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Profile" id="profile-button"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    }
    else
    {
        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Register" id="register-button"&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignIn" id="login-button"&gt;Sign In&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    }
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>AccountController.cs</code> file in the <code>Controllers</code> folder, add <code>RegisterModel.cs</code> in the <code>Models</code> folder, and add <code>Register.cshtml</code> in the <code>Views\Account</code> folder:</p>

   <code>public class AccountController : Controller
{
    private readonly IFido2 fido2;

    public AccountController(IFido2 fido2)
    {
        this.fido2 = fido2;
    }

    public ActionResult Register()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
</code>   

   <code>@model RegisterModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Register";
}

&lt;h1&gt;@ViewData["Title"]&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;form method="post" id="register-form"&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Create a new account.&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;hr /&gt;
            &lt;div asp-validation-summary="All" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
                &lt;label asp-for="Email"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;input asp-for="Email" class="form-control" name="email" /&gt;
                &lt;span asp-validation-for="Email" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
                &lt;label asp-for="FirstName"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;input asp-for="FirstName" class="form-control" name="firstName" /&gt;
                &lt;span asp-validation-for="FirstName" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
                &lt;label asp-for="LastName"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;input asp-for="LastName" class="form-control" name="lastName" /&gt;
                &lt;span asp-validation-for="LastName" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" id="register"&gt;Register&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

@section Scripts {
    &lt;partial name="_ValidationScriptsPartial" /&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/helpers.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/passwordless.register.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
}
</code>   

   <code>public class RegisterModel
{
  [Required]
  [EmailAddress]
  [Display(Name = "Email")]
  public string Email { get; set; }

  [Required]
  [Display(Name = "First Name")]
  public string FirstName { get; set; }

  [Required]
  [Display(Name = "Last Name")]
  public string LastName { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>To create a new credential when the user registers, you need to call <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create"><code>navigator.credentials.create</code></a> JavaScript method. The <code>create()</code> method accepts a <code>PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</code> parameter with several required and optional fields that specify options for the requested credentials.</p>

<p>The required fields are:</p>

 
   <code>rp</code> - The relying party that requested credentials. 
   <code>user</code> - The user for which credentials are created. 
   <code>challenge</code> - A buffer of cryptographically random bytes that will be signed by the authenticator and sent back to the server to avoid replay attacks. 
   <code>pubKeyCredParams</code> - An array of algorithms that can be used for a cryptographic signature. 
 

<p>To generate these options, add a method to the <code>AccountController</code> class that looks like this:</p>

   <code>[HttpPost]
public ActionResult CredentialOptions([FromBody] RegisterModel model)
{
  var user = new Fido2User
  {
    DisplayName = $"{model.FirstName} {model.LastName}",
    Name = model.Email,
    Id = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(model.Email)
  };

  var options = fido2.RequestNewCredential(user, new List&lt;PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor&gt;());
 
  HttpContext.Session.SetString("fido2.attestationOptions", options.ToJson());

  return Json(options);
}
</code>   

<p>The method takes the user details, generates an options parameter, and returns it as a JSON object to the browser.</p>

<p>Finally, create <code>passwordless.register.js</code> in <code>wwwroot\js</code> folder that ties all the pieces together:</p>

   <code>document.getElementById('register-form').addEventListener('submit', handleRegisterSubmit);

async function handleRegisterSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    let email = this.email.value;
    let firstName = this.firstName.value;
    let lastName = this.lastName.value;

    var data = new FormData();

    data.append('username', email);
    data.append('firstName', firstName);
    data.append('lastName', lastName);

    // send to server for registering
    let credentialOptions;
    try 
    {
        credentialOptions = await fetchMakeCredentialOptions({ email: email, firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName });
    } 
    catch (e) 
    {
        console.error(e);
        alert("Something went really wrong");
        return;
    }

    if (credentialOptions.status !== "ok") 
    {
        alert(credentialOptions.errorMessage);
        return;
    }

    // Turn the challenge back into the accepted format of padded base64
    credentialOptions.challenge = coerceToArrayBuffer(credentialOptions.challenge);
    credentialOptions.user.id = coerceToArrayBuffer(credentialOptions.user.id);

    if (credentialOptions.authenticatorSelection.authenticatorAttachment === null) 
    {
        credentialOptions.authenticatorSelection.authenticatorAttachment = undefined;
    }

    let newCredential;
    try 
    {
        newCredential = await navigator.credentials.create({publicKey: credentialOptions});
    } catch (e) 
    {
        alert("Could not create credentials in browser.");
        return;
    }

    try 
    {
        await registerNewCredential(newCredential);
        window.location.replace("/Account/Signin");
    } catch (e) {
        alert("Could not register new credentials on server");
    }
}

async function fetchMakeCredentialOptions(formData) {
let response = await fetch('/Account/CredentialOptions', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(formData),
    headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });

  let data = await response.json();

  return data;
}


// This should be used to verify the auth data with the server
async function registerNewCredential(newCredential) {

    let attestationObject = new Uint8Array(newCredential.response.attestationObject);
    let clientDataJSON = new Uint8Array(newCredential.response.clientDataJSON);
    let rawId = new Uint8Array(newCredential.rawId);

    const data = {
        id: newCredential.id,
        rawId: coerceToBase64Url(rawId),
        type: newCredential.type,
        extensions: newCredential.getClientExtensionResults(),
        response: {
        AttestationObject: coerceToBase64Url(attestationObject),
        clientDataJson: coerceToBase64Url(clientDataJSON)
        }
    };

    let response;
    try {
            response = await registerCredentialWithServer(data);
        } catch (e) 
        {
            alert(e);
            return;
        }

  console.log("Credential Object", response);

  // show error
    if (response.status !== "ok") {
        alert(response.errorMessage);
        return;
    }

    alert("You've registered successfully.");
}

async function registerCredentialWithServer(formData) {

    let response = await fetch('/Account/SaveCredentials', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(formData),
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    });

    let data = await response.json();

    return data;
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the code and break down what it does. First, I register an event handler for the <code>sign-up</code> form. In the event handler, I call the <code>/Account/CredentialOptions</code> endpoint with the user data and use the resulting options to call the <code>navigator.credentials.create</code> method. After that, I send the generated credentials to the server by calling the <code>/Account/SaveCredentials</code> endpoint. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>The <code>SaveCredentials</code> endpoint doesn’t exist yet, but before I create that method, I will configure Okta as I will store user data and their credentials in Okta.</p>

 Store User and User’s Public Key in Okta 

<p>This tutorial will use Okta to store users and the public key of their credentials. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication, as well as all OpenID Connect flows out of the box—it can take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.</p>

<p>To get started, log in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer account</a> via the URL in the sign-up email to access your org’s portal dashboard. Once you log in, make sure to note your Org URL from the upper right corner of the screen:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> and log in to your Okta account with the <code>okta login</code> command. You can also sign up for a new account with the <code>okta start</code> command if you don’t already have an Okta account.</p>

<p>Now, create a custom field for storing the user’s public key. Go to Users in the menu, click Profile Editor, and click the Profile button next to the default Okta profile. Click Add Attribute, fill the <code>Add Attribute</code> form and click Save:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Do the same to add another attribute called <code>CredentialId</code>.</p>

<p>Next, go to API in the menu, click Tokens, and click the Create Token button. Enter the token name (I will use OktaWebAuthn) and click the Create Token button. Make sure you copy the token because you won’t be able to view it again:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Switch to Visual Studio, open the <code>appsettings.json</code> again, and add a section for Okta:</p>

   <code>"Okta": {
  "Domain": "",
  "ApiToken": "{yourToken}"
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, add a NuGet package for managing users in Okta:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.Sdk
</code>   

<p>Open the <code>AccountController</code> class and add the <code>SaveCredentials</code> method:</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;JsonResult&gt; SaveCredentials([FromBody] AuthenticatorAttestationRawResponse attestationResponse)
{
    try
    {
        var jsonOptions = HttpContext.Session.GetString("fido2.attestationOptions");
        var options = CredentialCreateOptions.FromJson(jsonOptions);

        var fidoCredentials = await fido2.MakeNewCredentialAsync(attestationResponse, options, IsCredentialUnique);

        var storedCredential = new StoredCredential{
            Descriptor = new PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor(fidoCredentials.Result.CredentialId),
            PublicKey = fidoCredentials.Result.PublicKey,
            UserHandle = fidoCredentials.Result.User.Id,
            SignatureCounter = fidoCredentials.Result.Counter,
            CredType = fidoCredentials.Result.CredType,
            RegDate = DateTime.Now,
            AaGuid = fidoCredentials.Result.Aaguid
        };

        var result = await oktaClient.Users.CreateUserAsync(new CreateUserWithoutCredentialsOptions
        {
            Profile = new UserProfile
            {
                Login = options.User.Name,
                Email = options.User.Name,
                DisplayName = options.User.DisplayName,
                ["CredentialId"] = Convert.ToBase64String(fidoCredentials.Result.CredentialId),
                ["PasswordlessPublicKey"] = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(storedCredential)
            }
        });

        return Json(fidoCredentials);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        return Json(new Fido2.CredentialMakeResult { Status = "error", ErrorMessage = e.Message });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>SaveCredentials</code> method accepts the public key object created by the authenticator, turns it into a credentials object for storing, and saves the user together with the credentials in Okta.</p>

<p>Now let’s see the app in action! Click F5 or use <code>dotnet run</code> to launch the app and click the Register menu item. Enter your email, personal details, and click the Register button. You should see a screen similar to this one:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scan your finger on the reader, and a new user will be saved in Okta with the public key corresponding to your passwordless credentials.</p>

<p>You can now register a user so let’s move on to signing in to passwordless accounts.</p>

 Authentication with WebAuthn 

<p>First, enable authentication using cookies in the project. Add the following in <code>ConfigureServices</code> method in <code>Startup</code> class:</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication("Cookie").AddCookie("Cookie");
</code>   

<p>Also in the <code>Configure</code> method:</p>

   <code>app.UseAuthentication();
</code>   

<p>Next, add <code>SignIn</code> method to the <code>AccountController</code></p>

   <code>public ActionResult SignIn()
{
  return View();
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, add a <code>SignIn.cshtml</code> in <code>Views\Account</code>:</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Sign In";
}

&lt;h1&gt;@ViewData["Title"]&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
    &lt;form method="post" id="signin-form"&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Sign in without password&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label for="email"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input id="email" class="form-control" name="email" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" id="register"&gt;Sign In&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

@section Scripts {
    &lt;script src="~/js/helpers.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/passwordless.login.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>Now, you are ready to add passwordless authentication. Login flow with passwordless authentication is similar to the registration flow. First, you need to initiate authentication for the user that wants to log in, and then use WebAuthn to facilitate the authentication process using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/get">navigator.credentials.get</a> method.</p>

<p>To create options for <code>navigator.credentials.get</code>, add a method in <code>AccountController</code> that will accept the user that initiated login and return corresponding options:</p>

   <code>[HttpPost]
public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; SignInOptions([FromForm] string username)
{
    try
    {
        var user = await oktaClient.Users.GetUserAsync(username);

        if (user == null)
        throw new ArgumentException("Username was not registered");

        var credential = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;StoredCredential&gt;(user.Profile["PasswordlessPublicKey"].ToString());

        var options = fido2.GetAssertionOptions(new List&lt;PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor&gt; { credential.Descriptor },
                                                UserVerificationRequirement.Discouraged);

        HttpContext.Session.SetString("fido2.assertionOptions", options.ToJson());

        return Json(options);
    }

    catch (Exception e)
    {
        return Json(new AssertionOptions { Status = "error", ErrorMessage = e.Message });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>SignInOptions</code> method fetches the user that is trying to sign in from Okta, creates options with the credentials that the user is allowed to use, and returns them as JSON to the caller.</p>

<p>Next, add the JavaScript code that will get the options and prompt the user for authentication. Create a new <code>passwordless.login.js</code> file in <code>wwwroot\js</code> and paste the following:</p>

   <code>document.getElementById('signin-form').addEventListener('submit', handleSignInSubmit);

async function handleSignInSubmit(event) 
{
    event.preventDefault();

    let username = this.email.value;

    var formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('username', username);

    let publicKeyOptions;
    try {
        var res = await fetch('/Account/SignInOptions', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData,
            headers: {
                'Accept': 'application/json'
            }
        });

        publicKeyOptions = await res.json();
    } catch (e) {
        alert("Request to server failed");
        return;
    }

    if (publicKeyOptions.status !== "ok") {
        alert(publicKeyOptions.errorMessage);
        return;
    }

    const challenge = publicKeyOptions.challenge.replace(/-/g, "+").replace(/_/g, "/");
    publicKeyOptions.challenge = Uint8Array.from(atob(challenge), c =&gt; c.charCodeAt(0));

    publicKeyOptions.allowCredentials.forEach(function (listItem) {
        var fixedId = listItem.id.replace(/\_/g, "/").replace(/\-/g, "+");
        listItem.id = Uint8Array.from(atob(fixedId), c =&gt; c.charCodeAt(0));
    });

    // ask browser for credentials (browser will ask connected authenticators)
    let credential;
    try {
        credential = await navigator.credentials.get({ publicKey: publicKeyOptions });

        try {
            await verifyAssertionWithServer(credential);
        } catch (e) {
            alert("Could not verify assertion");
        }
    } catch (err) {
        alert(err.message ? err.message : err);
    }
}

async function verifyAssertionWithServer(assertedCredential) 
{
    let authData = new Uint8Array(assertedCredential.response.authenticatorData);
    let clientDataJSON = new Uint8Array(assertedCredential.response.clientDataJSON);
    let rawId = new Uint8Array(assertedCredential.rawId);
    let sig = new Uint8Array(assertedCredential.response.signature);

    const data = {
        id: assertedCredential.id,
        rawId: coerceToBase64Url(rawId),
        type: assertedCredential.type,
        extensions: assertedCredential.getClientExtensionResults(),
        response: {
            authenticatorData: coerceToBase64Url(authData),
            clientDataJson: coerceToBase64Url(clientDataJSON),
            signature: coerceToBase64Url(sig)
        }
    };

    let response;
    try {
        let res = await fetch("/Account/SignIn", {
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify(data),
            headers: {
                'Accept': 'application/json',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        });

        response = await res.json();
    } catch (e) {
        alert("Request to server failed", e);
        throw e;
    }

    console.log("Assertion Object", response);

    if (response.status !== "ok") {
        alert(response.errorMessage);
        return;
    }

    window.location.href = "/Account/Profile";
}
</code>   

<p>The above code handles the sign-in button click, fetches options from the server, and prompts the user for passwordless authentication. When the user signs in, the credentials are sent to the server for validation. I will now add the method to accept the credentials and sign in the user:</p>

   <code>[HttpPost]
public async Task&lt;JsonResult&gt; SignIn([FromBody] AuthenticatorAssertionRawResponse clientResponse)
{
    try
    {
        var jsonOptions = HttpContext.Session.GetString("fido2.assertionOptions");
        var options = AssertionOptions.FromJson(jsonOptions);

        var user = await GetUserByCredentials(clientResponse.Id);

        var credential = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;StoredCredential&gt;(user.Profile["PasswordlessPublicKey"].ToString());

        var result = await fido2.MakeAssertionAsync(clientResponse, options, credential.PublicKey, credential.SignatureCounter,
                                                    args =&gt; Task.FromResult(credential.UserHandle.SequenceEqual(args.UserHandle)));

        await UpdateCounter(user, credential, result.Counter);

        var claims = new List&lt;Claim&gt;
        {
        new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, user.Profile.Email)
        };

        var claimsIdentity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims, CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

        await HttpContext.SignInAsync(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, new ClaimsPrincipal(claimsIdentity));

        return Json(result);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        return Json(new AssertionVerificationResult { Status = "error", ErrorMessage = e.Message });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the project again, click the Sign In in the menu, enter the email you signed up with, and click the Sign In button. You will see a prompt like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Swipe your finger, and you will be signed in and redirected to the profile page. To show the current user profile data, you can use the Okta .NET SDK to get the current user details and display them.</p>

<p>Add a <code>Profile</code> method with the following code:</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Profile()
{
  var subject = HttpContext.User.Claims.First(claim =&gt; claim.Type == ClaimTypes.Name).Value;
  var user = await oktaClient.Users.GetUserAsync(subject);
  return View(user);
}
</code>   

<p>Next, create the <code>Profile.cshtml</code> file in the <code>Views\Account</code> folder that looks like this:</p>

   <code>@model Okta.Sdk.IUser

@{
  ViewData["Title"] = "User Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;User Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;dl class="row"&gt;
    &lt;dt class = "col-sm-2"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.FirstName)
    &lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd class = "col-sm-10"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.FirstName)
    &lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt class = "col-sm-2"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.LastName)
    &lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd class = "col-sm-10"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.LastName)
    &lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt class = "col-sm-2"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.Email)
    &lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd class = "col-sm-10"&gt;
        @Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Profile.Email)
    &lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a asp-action="EditProfile"&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>The view renders profile details such as the user’s first name and last name, email, city, and country code.</p>

<p>Rerun the app, click the Profile button, and you will see the details of the currently logged in user.</p>

<p>That’s it! You can register and sign with passwordless authentication and view the details of the current user.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you learned how to use WebAuthn in ASP.NET Core and Okta to make passwordless authentication more secure.</p>

<p>What a difference a year makes. At this point last year, who knew how the world would change in the face of a pandemic that would shift the way we conduct business and interact with loved ones and coworkers, alike. What we’ve seen in the digital identity space, though, is constant revolution and adaptation. With these breakthroughs and shifts in technology, insights and discoveries, along with consolidation, OWI has remained a valued source of information and aid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>With that in mind, OWI has also made sure its services shift to remain ahead of the changing digital identity landscape. As we build a nexus of insight and data for the entire industry, we also have developed a number of key ways to provide deeper access, resources, and networking.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of guidance across industries and markets focused on growth strategy and transaction services has become increasingly vital to digital identity, both now and into a post COVID-19 world. It’s with that realization that we developed the <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/sab-announcement/">Senior Advisory Board</a>, which includes a group of executives with decades of experience in the digital space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the board, we’ve also welcomed <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/team-member/tushyati-maudgalya/">Tushyati Maudgalya</a>, former business consultant at McKinsey and BCG, as Managing Director of our advisory services, and <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/team-member/justin-jarae/">Justin Jarae</a>, former Senior Solutions Architect and Business Automation Practice Lead at Red Hat, as Chief Technology Officer. These moves empower the advice and guidance we can provide both our customers and the industry at large. It’s also a strategy steeped in technology, as we seek to unify advisory services with technology tools to ensure guidance has the support and reliability modern organizations expect in all areas of the business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, one of the best ways to move the industry forward is by fostering growth among entrepreneurs and new talent. These leaders need three things: funding, access to data, and guidance. To tackle the funding challenges, we’ve partnered with OWI Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm focused solely on digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To meet the other two needs – information and guidance – OWI launched the <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/distil">Digital Identity Standards, Technology, and Innovation Lab (DISTIL)</a>. The DISTIL community will convene through groups, classes, and networking opportunities via our new Immersive Experience Lab, Startup Accelerator Program, Working Groups, and Roundtables. To kick DISTIL off, we will convene the first Startup Accelerator Program on April 5, 2021. Applications will open in January with selected entrepreneurs to meet for a 12-week program with OWI Ventures, which also provides them with access to a community of over 300 digital identity experts and proprietary information through the Immersive Experience Lab. The selected startups will receive funding through OWI Ventures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More information on how to sign up for this extraordinary opportunity, as well as details on the various aspects of DISTIL, will become available in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These, again, are all ways we will look to support our clients and industry moving forward. And as the next year comes, and certainly new surprises await, we will ensure we continue to shift no matter what lies ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had a widespread effect on nearly every industry, and education has been no exception. While we recently explored the impact of Covid-19 on remote education in a recent whitepaper,&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/reports/learning-through-disruption-au10tix/">Learning Through Disruption: Digital Identity in Education</a>, we wanted to take a more in-depth look at how this shift has raised issues concerning the integrity of online testing and exams. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous testing conditions consisted of tens to hundreds of students sitting in one room at a time. With the pandemic, this is no longer a safe or viable option. Instead, institutions have begun partnering with companies that offer online proctoring software. These softwares implement tools such as webcams and microphones, facial recognition, and screen record to verify the test-taker’s identity. How can schools, colleges, and standardized testing boards verify that the test-takers sitting on the other side of the screen are who they say they are? How can test-takers prove their identities while maintaining privacy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Current State Analysis: Tech Stack Breakdown 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These solutions address two main issues: verifying the test-taker’s identity and preventing cheating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifying the Test-Taker’s Identity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure that test-takers are who they say they are, these softwares&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">require a scan of the individual’s ID</a> before the exam and use facial-recognition technology to match the face to the ID photo. Random scans are performed throughout the exam to ensure that the test-taker does not switch places with another person. Companies will also verify identity through a typing test. The test-taker is asked to type 140 words at the beginning of the semester and then perform the typing test before any exam. The speed and rhythms of the keystrokes are used to verify their identity, and any discrepancies are flagged for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">further inspection</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-Cheating Software Leveraging Behavioral Biometrics</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online proctoring services such as Proctorio and ProctorU implement a variety of security features to prevent cheating. They hire live proctors to watch test-takers’ faces and listen to them talk, and proctors can demand test-takers aim their cameras around the room to prove their honesty. ProctorU requires test-takers to show their ID cards, their rooms, and the surface of their desk before beginning the exam. During the exam, the proctor takes precautions to mitigate cheating, such as listening through the microphone, accessing the test-taker’s screen, and using the webcam to allow the video system to view the test-taker’s eye movements. If the system or proctor suspects cheating, the instance is flagged as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">a suspicious event</a>&nbsp;for further review or alerted to a specialist known as an “interventionist,” who can take action and enforce an academic penalty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The COVID-19 Shift and Concerns 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These softwares are not offering dramatically new technology, and before the pandemic, they were used in online-only classes. But in 2020, they have seen a boom in business as grade schools and standardized testing organizations pivot to maintain operations. According to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/05/11/online-proctoring-surging-during-covid-19">Educause poll</a>&nbsp;conducted in April of 2020, 54 percent of institutions had already begun using online or remote proctoring services. Another 23 percent were considering or planning to use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>As adoption skyrockets, data privacy now becomes a pressing concern. Students not previously familiar with such technology are experiencing a culture shock and raising&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecampusnews.com/2020/09/04/online-proctoring-keeps-remote-exams-secure-but-raises-privacy-questions/?all">questions regarding privacy rights</a>. Also, now that grade schools have moved online, more minors are using exam proctoring software, raising concerns about how their privacy rights should be protected.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond privacy concerns, comfort with the technology is another issue. Many test-takers have pointed out the “creepiness” and general “inhumanness” of being watched through a camera while taking a test, leading to increased anxiety and, therefore, lower performance. In fact, with ProctorU’s software, test-takers used to see the proctor watching them on their screen. Due to reported negative experiences, ProctorU&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">disabled that function</a>&nbsp;to increase the feeling of privacy, even though the proctor is still watching.&nbsp;Privacy is a crucial factor affecting comfort. If users are ensured that their recordings, face, and photos are securely protected, they will become more comfortable with the software, and subsequently, user adoption and success will increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Solution 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A clear solution is the implementation of a student digital identity. If schools issued their students a digital identity, it could be used to verify the student’s identity before they take an online exam. The idea of a digital student ID isn’t new; in 2018, edtech company Blackboard Inc.&nbsp;<a href="https://press.blackboard.com/2018-10-02-Blackboard-Announces-Support-for-Student-ID-Cards-on-iPhone-and-Apple-Watch">announced</a>&nbsp;Blackboard Mobile Credential support for Student ID cards in Apple Wallet, allowing students to use their phone as a mobile ID, becoming the first campus credential solution provider to offer NFC-enabled contactless mobile IDs for iPhone and Apple Watch. Over the past two years,&nbsp;<a href="https://dukecard.duke.edu/mobile-dukecard">Duke University</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://actcard.ua.edu/actioncardinapplewallet-gettingstarted/">University of Alabama</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ou.edu/soonercard/mobile">University of Oklahoma</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scu.edu/news-and-events/press-releases/2020/february-2020/santa-clara-university-offers-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-.html?#:~:text=SANTA%20CLARA%2C%20Calif.%2C%20Feb,from%20the%20library%20and%20more.">Santa Clara University</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.temple.edu/news/2019-01-28/mobile-owlcard">Temple University</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2019/03/28/apple-wallet-homewood-campus-ids/">Johns Hopkins University</a> have given students the ability to use this solution.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier in 2020, campus card solutions provider Transact rolled out support for Android NFC student IDs, integrated with Google Pay, to <a href="https://www.nfcw.com/2020/05/19/366583/transact-rolls-out-android-nfc-student-ids-at-16-us-universities/">16 US universities</a>. This kind of student mobile identity also provides an extra level of security as it requires two-factor authentication on the device, keeping its credentials and information secure.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>OWI recommends taking the mobile student ID a step further. Not only could it provide the same uses as a physical ID, such as offering access to dorms and checking out library books, but it could also be expanded into other sectors such as student healthcare. Post-graduation, it could be updated to reflect alumni status and allow the option to offer alumni benefits. Employers can use this digital ID to quickly verify an applicant’s education credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of November 2020, Mastercard, Australia Post, and Deakin University are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.securitydocumentworld.com/article-details/i/16600/">moving toward</a>&nbsp;this solution. Students can create a digital identity in Australia Post’s Digital iD app and use it to gain access to Deakin University’s exam portal. Integrated into both organization’s platforms, Mastercard’s digital identity service “ID” successfully orchestrated the sharing of verified identity data between the two parties – sending only the specific personal information required to permit entry using its highly secure network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward, OWI believes that there is an opportunity to expand the mobile student ID’s functionality into verifying test-taker identity. Players in this space, whether new or established, must keep data privacy concerns at the forefront of their solutions. Ultimately, a digital student identity could address the issues of test-taker identity, and its uses could be expanded into a variety of sectors and span a lifetime.</p>

<p>This post was authored by Alexis Falquier, who helps lead the self-sovereign identity (SSI) initiative at GlobaliD.</p><p>Back in October, team GlobaliD attended the 31st biannual Internet Identity Workshop (IIW), the premier conference dedicated to building collaborative environments that foster the development of open standards around all things digital identity. According to legend, it’s the birthplace of&nbsp;SSI</p><p>On top of leading two sessions, we also unveiled our Dynamic Governance API. And as part of GlobaliD’s ongoing commitment toward open SSI standards, <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7">we open sourced our iOS and Android native Hyperledger Aries frameworks</a>.</p><p>With the year coming to a close, we wanted to look back at the conference and highlight some of the fascinating topics we came across and what we&nbsp;learned.</p><p>Disclaimer: This piece is a bit jargon heavy given the nature of the space. I’ve made my best attempt at making it as approachable as possible, but if you’re looking for a crash course on the basics of SSI, distributed identifiers (DID’s) and Verifiable Credentials, here’s some recommended reading:</p>  <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">What is self-sovereign identity?</a>  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">Multi-Source and Self-Sovereign Identity</a>  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity&nbsp;Systems</a>  <p>OK, without further adieu, here are some highlights from&nbsp;IIW:</p> Now KERI is my best&nbsp;friend <p>One of the hottest topics at IIW 31 — in part because of how much it offers — was our new friend KERI, which stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. It’s no trivial subject, to the point that Drummond Reed held three separate sessions dedicated to describing it at different levels — KERI for Muggles, KERI for mudbloods, and KERI for Wizards. I can tell you that even KERI for Muggles very much felt like a “Wizards” session but I will do my best to share what KERI is all&nbsp;about.</p><p>In its most fundamental sense, KERI is a Public Key Infrastructure or PKI. One of the foundational pieces of SSI is public/private key cryptography and its relationship with a decentralized identifier or DID. In other words, public key encryption makes SSI go round. KERI, then, is a new and fully decentralized PKI. You can see why all of this might be such a big&nbsp;deal.</p><p>Some of real-world benefits of KERI — and why it was incidentally the belle of the ball — as explained by Timothy Ruff, Sam Smith, and Drummond Reed during <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lpzYcPrIox9V4hERtn4Kcf7uq01OVU9u3PuVm1aYzR0/edit#slide=id.ga411be7e84_0_116">their muggle-friendly and all around more approachable KERI session at&nbsp;IIW</a>:</p><p>Independent and&nbsp;Portable</p><p>Distributed ledgers underpin many SSI solutions, but KERI is a highly portable public key infrastructure that does not necessitate their use. It is self sustained, and therefore every organization/individual is its own root of trust. It is not locked into one governance framework, network or ledger. It is truly decentralized.</p><p>Secure</p><p>KERI relies solely on cryptography as the means to prove the root of trust. What this means is that you can rotate the key without changing the identifier. You can pre-rotate future keys, safely store these, and — in the case that your current private key is compromised — you can use the pre-rotated keys to restore your identifier. To throw some more jargon at you, this pre rotation turns out is actually a post-quantum proof (secure against attacks with quantum computers) method of key security. In other words, it is future&nbsp;proof.</p><p>Delegatable</p><p>You can easily create keys and delegate them as needed. This creates the potential for any number of hierarchical architectures.</p><p>Scalable</p><p>Since KERI is self reliant it is extremely scalable, only limited by its hardware. Given its cryptographic nature, existing key management solutions can be&nbsp;used.</p><p>Private</p><p>The key logs are controlled by the organization/individual themselves. In some SSI solutions that rely on immutable ledgers privacy can become problematic in terms of GDPR, and the right to be forgotten. Since KERI is not reliant on ledgers this can be avoided all together.</p><p>Standard Adherent</p><p>Like many SSI solutions, KERI uses existing cryptography in new ways including W3C standards, DID’s and SSI Wallets. KERI follows open source standards and is fully auditable.</p><p>Sound good so far? If you’ve made it this far, here’s how KERI actually works at a very high&nbsp;level:</p>  KERI uses self certifying identifiers (SCID’s), which means that a specific identifier can prove to be the one and only identifier using cryptography alone. This is the pivotal piece of&nbsp;KERI.  KERI uses key event logs (also self certifying) which carry the history of the keys, such that if you ever need to rotate your key you can do so, sign it, log it, and prove that you control this new key via the event&nbsp;logs.  KERI uses “witnesses” that keep and sign a copy of your logs for added ‘evidence’ of your key ownership.  You can pre-rotate future keys, safely store the keys, log the pre-rotation, and when this key is needed you will be able to prove the key is yours and keep your identifier safe.  KERI is not attached to any one system, any system that can process data will be able to validate your identifier.  KERI allows for the creation of multiple identifiers that can be delegated, allowing for any complex hierarchy of identifiers and&nbsp;keys.  <p>If you feel like you still do not really get it, don’t worry, most of us didn’t either. One thing that isn’t hard to get is why KERI made such a big splash at the conference. These are still early days but the possibilities for KERI are vast and disruptive — it’s certainly one to keep an eye&nbsp;on.</p><p>If you’re feeling brave and are interested in learning more about the nitty gritty of KERI, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">here’s the 140-page white&nbsp;paper</a>.</p> Chained Credentials <p>Another compelling topic at IIW was chained credentials — the concept of linking two or more verifiable credentials with one another. The discussion focused less on the how but rather on the&nbsp;why.</p><p>At its most basic function, linking credentials makes sense in the same way that databases have relationships that link data from one table to another. You might have two credentials that work just fine on their own for a specific purpose, but attributing them together can provide broader significance.</p><p>A basic example of this would be having a credential of citizenship and a credential of residence — the link of which allows you to vote in local elections. Really, anytime you have a history of transactions such as supply chain, registries, etc., verifiable credentials add value. So rather than present use cases, I will focus on a few primary benefits.</p><p>Reputation</p><p>For Kiva’s Nathan George, their work with refugees led them toward the path of chained credentials. Since refugees often lack traditional forms of documentation and credentials, the concept of chained credentials opens up the possibility of building their reputation by allowing them to receive credentials that attest to their skills — whether by linking one with the next or by adding endorsements.</p><p>Proof of&nbsp;Linkage</p><p>Linked credentials would allow for proof of a larger scope of information without disclosure. If part of my verifiable credential is how it is linked to another, then I could disclose to a verifier the proof of linkage without disclosing the credential itself, thus demonstrating the reputability of my credential without actually disclosing it. If this proof of linkage also shows where the credential was linked from, I am able to show the provenance of truth. In other words, the source of the link can add to the validity of my credential.</p><p>Delegatable Credentials</p><p>Chained credentials are a core building block of delegatable credentials. In simple terms, a delegatable credential is one that proves the permission of an action by means of proving a link to the original credential that allows for that action. For example, if I lend my friend my car, I will delegate my car’s credential to them, in the case that they need to prove that they are allowed to drive it (or in the future, be able to start and drive it, period). For delegatable credentials to work, revocation is also needed — a topic for another day. The point being, linked credentials are a key part of the delegation process.</p><p>All in all, there are use cases abound — one reason why I’m so excited to see where people take the&nbsp;concept.</p> Guardianship (AKA Custodial Agents) <p>The topic of guardianship made an appearance in multiple sessions. For the purposes of this piece, I’ll focus on the one held by Ken Ebert and Sam&nbsp;Curren.</p><p>At first glance, you might think that this is about the legal role of guardianship when it comes to a person’s online identity, i.e. a parent being a guardian for a child’s digital presence until they turn 18. While that is an ever present topic at IIW and one that is always interesting to be part of, this discussion focused on guardianship in a technical sense.</p><p>This potential for confusion came up during the discussion and we ended up changing the phrase to custodial agents for semantic&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>A custodial agent is an agent that resides on a cloud infrastructure rather than on someone’s personal device. Therefore, their identity and wallet is being maintained by someone else. This is worth considering because in reality, there are people who cannot have an end agent, generally for the purposes of convenience and access. That might mean a web wallet interface for easy integration and adoption or simply because not everyone has a smartphone.</p><p>Since the agent is not on a personal device, this means that the keys are being managed by whoever manages the cloud infrastructure. Naturally, this adds a degree of centralization. (Someone on the discussion made the joke that here, SSI stands for Somewhat Sovereign Identity.) That’s true — to an extent. On the other hand, it’s important to solve for cases where the ideal scenario might not exist in the name of inclusivity.</p><p>The thing is, even though cloud hosted wallets inherently takes away some portability, we should focus on the potential benefits cloud-hosted wallets provide users over not having an SSI wallet at all. End users (for the most part) do not care what is happening in the background. They simply care how it affects their experience.</p><p>So while not not all the benefits of SSI come with cloud hosting, there’s enough upside that it would still make a significant impact.</p><p>This also puts the onus on cloud-hosted providers to maintain sovereignty of their users’ identity to the largest extent possible. Given that they inherently hold some fiduciary responsibility, we discussed ways in which cloud-hosted against could be architected that optimized for user sovereignty.</p><p>One of the first ideas brought up was the imposition of restrictions on what agents can do. Cloud-hosted providers should focus on and adhere to specific use cases. Furthermore — as to allow a user to move to a truly self-sovereign solution — the agent and the wallet should be de-coupled such that the user always has the option to retrieve their wallet and transfer it to an end agent. GlobaliD’s Dev Bharel also brought up the concept of “trusted execution environments” as a means to host an agent and wallet without requiring the ability to see any information transaction — including keys.</p><p>There’s still plenty of considerations to consider in the context of custodial agents, but many organizations along with GlobaliD are actively exploring options that promote inclusivity in the&nbsp;space.</p> Signing out <p>These are but a few of the notable highlights, but if you’re interested in reading more about any of these or any other session at this past IIW, the book of proceedings (which contains notes on each session) can be <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">found&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>It’s truly difficult to put into words the level of knowledge and ideas shared at each and every IIW, a conference that breeds innovation every time you attend. For us it’s a privilege and an opportunity to see how the world of online identity is evolving. So here’s to the next IIW, where we will eagerly see what is discussed and find what’s already been implemented — while also sharing some of our own progress along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Also, stay tuned for another follow up piece on the GlobaliD approach to Governance Frameworks.</p><p>The digital identity revolution is well underway, and here at GlobaliD, we’re proud to be apart of&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/what-we-learned-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-aebda1f49f3a">What we learned at the Internet Identity Workshop</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>Co-authored by <a href="https://medium.com/u/b3e0625479e">Mario Cardoso</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/e52c6099919c">Andre&nbsp;Rabello</a>.</blockquote><p>The Operations Tools team in <a href="https://medium.com/u/2714cdc6872a">Onfido</a> handles a lot of repositories. Being “the glue” for manual check processing, the domain is large and vast. Front-end projects were written in JavaScript and while there was some Flow types, they weren’t first-class citizens and were usually either old/unmaintained/wrong or simply&nbsp;missing.</p><p>Exactly because we have to context switch so much between different repos, strict types help immensely with code discovery and safety. When the interface between two unrelated files is typed and you only need to change a single one, you no longer need to read the other. As long as you don’t change the interface and type checking passes, you can be sure your code won’t&nbsp;break.</p><p>Thus began our journey to refactor our biggest and most frequently changed app, Ops Manager, a React front-end with a Node GraphQL server, into TypeScript.</p> The journey <p>To be fair, we had been writing new features in TypeScript for about a year, and sometimes refactoring a file or two. We were confident that a migration would be straightforward.</p> TS setup <p>Ideally you want an editor that integrates well with TypeScript so that you see red squiggly lines below errors and don’t have to watch the terminal, which makes fixing issues that much faster and&nbsp;easier.</p><p>We recommend using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS&nbsp;Code</a>.</p><p>Additionally, you should use a tsconfig to tell the compiler what to do in you project, specifically. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html">official docs</a> and the example&nbsp;below.</p><p>Depending on the bundler you use you will also need to setup TypeScript support. If you use <a href="https://parceljs.org/typeScript.html">Parcel</a> it works out of the box. If you use Webpack, like we still do, you can follow <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/">their&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Essentially all we did was remove babel completely, install the appropriate loader and add this single line to module.rules:</p><p>{ test: /\.tsx?$/, loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader' }</p> Start converting <p>First step, pick a file and replace its extension with&nbsp;.ts. You will immediately notice a bunch of tslint errors about missing types. Now the goal is to get rid of all the&nbsp;errors.</p> Imports <p>Let’s start with the beginning of the file that usually contains imports. We can split them in three different groups:</p>  imports from third party libraries;  imports from other project&nbsp;files;  type imports (in case you were using non-TS types, like&nbsp;Flow).   Import from 3rd-party libraries <p>In case the library doesn’t provide TS types along with code, you should install them from @types if they exist. <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">It’s a community managed repo</a> that has types for most common libraries in npm. For example if you use lodash, you can install TS types with npm i -D @types/lodash or yarn add -D <a href="http://twitter.com/types/lodash">@types/lodash</a></p><p>If the package is not popular enough to have @types, you have 3&nbsp;options:</p>  contribute to the community by submitting a Pull&nbsp;Request;  create a local&nbsp;.d.ts file that defines the&nbsp;module;  just use tsignore until there is&nbsp;one.  <p>Option 3 provides the least benefits, you just disable type checking for that library which defeats the&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>Option 2 is a nice temporary fix, for example: foo-library.d.ts</p> define 'foo-library' {<br>  function Foo(): string;<br>} <p>If you’re familiar with its API you can cover just the necessary cases for your code to function and be type checked&nbsp;:)</p> Import from project&nbsp;files <p>The simplest way is to use tsignore until it is converted to TS. Don’t forget to come back later and remove it once the imported file is converted. That way you can focus on one file at a time, but if some imported files are really easy and simple to convert you can also just go convert them first. That depends on complexity but generally we would have a more iterative/progressive approach and focus on a few files at a&nbsp;time.</p><p>Another option is to start inwards, from files that have no dependencies up the tree. That’s not always the best approach as you’ll change context/domain pretty frequently, but is definitely helpful for the “utils” kind of&nbsp;files.</p> Import types <p>In case your project is using Flow (we will not discuss whether you should or should not go from Flow to TS), you could find imports like import type FileName. In that scenario, just convert the Flow type to a TS compatible type and you can keep the import type&nbsp;. Depending on your build process and bundler, you should still use import type, it was introduced in TypeScript 3.8, you can read more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html">here</a>.</p> Auto-fixable issues <p>VS Code commonly suggests fixes for some tslint issues. Generally the suggestion is good enough and you can start with that, and later you can improve it. Examples of suggestions for types include “infer by usage”, where VS Code tries to infer the type of a variable based on how it is used. For example, it understands which arguments in a function are used inside it or which methods of an object are used (if you use a String.prototype method it suggests that the type of the argument should be string). You can usually accept the suggestion and if needed update it by giving it a name or adding missing types, and you could also extract it to its own type&nbsp;file.</p><p>Generally it works pretty well, just validate if it makes sense and improve it if you can. But that’s a great and helpful feature, specially when you are starting&nbsp;out.</p> From Flow to&nbsp;TS <p>That was our case, we were using Flow in most files. This definitely helped because we had already some knowledge about our types and the work was mostly about completing the missing types and converting to TS because the syntax is a bit different. Most types are pretty similar, like&nbsp;these:</p><p>Some are slightly different, like this function:</p> Different ways to&nbsp;type <p>In our case we were heavily influenced by the types written in Flow, but there are many ways to achieve the same goal. For example, the function above could be written in any of these 3&nbsp;ways:</p><p>There are also many TypeScript utility types that you can use, for example the Record&nbsp;type:</p><p>Your team might prefer a specific style, like inline types vs isolated files, but at the end of the day agree on some standards you all can abide by, and above all be consistent.</p> Any <p>You should almost never use any, it defeats the purpose of using TS. Always try defining the types, looking at how they are used and if you get stuck use tsignore until you figure it out. tsignore should be temporary and a reminder that you should come back later and fix it. That worked for us, we saw them as TODOs for later, and that helped us proceed and not get&nbsp;stuck.</p><p>In situations where you definitely don’t know the type, you can use unknown. You can read more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type">here</a>.</p> As any (casting) <p>In actual code, don’t do it. For tests however, it is very useful. Instead of polluting mock objects and stubs with useless data (for that specific test case), you can cast it to any, essentially disabling type checking, to provide the minimum necessary interface for the test&nbsp;case.</p><p>In the example below the type requires fullName, but we know that if a name exists in the object we won’t need the rest. In this test case, we can ignore fullName and disable type checking because we are sure of the consequence (for testing). Just remember to cast it as late as possible so you still have type check in your actual test&nbsp;code.</p> GraphQL types vs TypeScript types <p>As mentioned before one of the projects we were working was built with GraphQL so this could also help you introduce TypeScript in the sense that you already have to define types for your Schema (queries, mutations, subscriptions). At the same time be aware that the syntax is not exactly the same and could sometimes cause some confusion. But if you keep most of your GraphQL code in separated files it’s easier not to mix things and better organise you&nbsp;code.</p><p>As you can see shared types are easier to achieve in TypeScript than in GraphQL. Also the philosophy of null in each language are opposites (default nullable vs default defined).</p><p>You can also use the amazing <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com">GraphQL Code Generator</a> to create types for you automatically! We don’t yet use it but plan to in the&nbsp;future.</p> What we&nbsp;learned   Some Flow types were incorrect and caused bugs after the migration to TypeScript, which shows the importance of keeping types up to date. I’d argue it’s better not to have types than to have wrong types. Mostly it was arrays and objects which could be null but weren’t typed as&nbsp;such;  Several bad data paths were discovered and potential future bugs prevented, like nullish objects, empty arrays, bad tuples, loading and error&nbsp;states;  Writing types for a whole repo is repetitive, boring work. It’s also the fastest and surest way to understand all of its interconnections and intricacies;  As you migrate, you discover better patterns and solutions and will probably want to come back to earlier&nbsp;files;  Don’t try to convert many files at once, go one by one and use tsignore when importing other JS files so you can focus on one file at a&nbsp;time;  TS and JS files can co-exist so you can migrate progressively from easiest to hardest file and not block other changes in the&nbsp;process;  The benefit of having types is not obvious at first, when you only have a few TS files, but it becomes easier and a better Developer Experience as more files are converted, which is nice to keep you motivated.  <p>Having the entire project in TypeScript has some clear benefits, like being much easier to onboard, maintain and change with some confidence it won’t break (thanks to type checking).</p><p>Migrating an old repo to TypeScript, especially if it has some other form of types that aren’t all that precise, is arduous and time intensive work. Make sure to properly weigh the benefits for your team and to plan it out in advance. We chose a big-bang refactor, which worked well for the GraphQL server but not as great for the React app, as it introduced some issues and blocked other features until the whole thing was resolved (merging conflicts later would be a nightmare). Doing one module at a time would have been a better approach in our&nbsp;case.</p><p>If you decide you want TS in your repos too, good luck migrating and enjoy your improved Developer Experience!&nbsp;:D</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/@mariorcardoso">Mario Cardoso - Medium</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@andre.rabello">Andre Rabello - Medium</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/migrating-600-files-to-typescript-580440141c35">Migrating ~600 files to TypeScript</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Digitalization is an important topic in the insurance industry. However, according to a study by NTT Data, many insurers urgently need to catch up on their homework when it comes to digitalisation: the status and development of digitalization are measured and assessed by 12% of insurance companies (12%) according to clearly defined criteria. One in three companies (36%) does have various indicators in place that give an approximate picture of the state of digitalization. On the whole, however, the topic of ” digitalization ” is apparently still often diffuse, complex, and not very concrete. Around half (52%) lack a systematic measurement of the degree of digitalization.</p>
<p>API management as a key factor of digitalization.</p>
<p>New digital business models, changing user requirements, and the general shift towards fast and simple solutions are forcing new and established insurers alike to act. Many service providers have realized this business potential, and the market is flooded with API providers. Insurance companies are finding it increasingly difficult to keep an overview of external – but also internal – API-based services and their performance. Intelligent API management has thus become one of the central challenges of digitalization.</p>
<p>Syncier, a spin-off of Allianz in partnership with Microsoft, has recognized this problem: On the Syncier marketplace, digital services specifically relevant to the insurance industry are made available. These can then be integrated directly into insurers’ existing IT systems via API.</p>

 Ontology Partners With Litentry, Accelerating Adoption Of Its Decentralized Identity and Credit Scoring Solutions <p>Litentry’s Integration Of Ontology’s Bespoke Products Aims To Increase Adoption By 10K&nbsp;Users</p><p>Singapore — 16 December 2020 — In a bid to further the shared goal of bringing about greater data privacy and transparency, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, public blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with <a href="https://www.litentry.com/">Litentry</a>, a blockchain identity management layer based on the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>As part of the agreement, the two pioneers in decentralized identity and data management solutions will collaborate to integrate Ontology’s bespoke decentralized identity solution, DeID, and DDXF, Ontology’s decentralized data exchange and collaboration framework, into Litentry’s identity aggregation and computation system.</p><p>In line with this, Ontology will make its DeID solution, as well as its OScore, the company’s proprietary decentralized credit-rating system, available to Litentry for the integration with its DID aggregation technology to generate new use cases. Over time, the partnership will see Litentry build a cross-chain identity aggregator based on Polkadot, which includes a unique decentralized Web3.0 identity computation network and related tools. In joining forces, Ontology and Litentry are aiming to onboard 10,000 users to the DeID and OScore solutions, enriching aggregated Identities and targeting potential customers based in Europe, USA, Latin America and South East&nbsp;Asia.</p><p>Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, stated “The great synergy between Ontology and Litentry makes this partnership an obvious one. The need to bring about greater fairness, privacy and transparency when it comes to data is extremely important to both parties and our shared missions. Our team is excited to see this partnership come to fruition and to leverage our commonalities to accelerate the growth of both Ontology and Litentry. In particular, we are really happy to be furthering our relationship with the Polkadot ecosystem, having partnered with Patract Labs and Parity Technologies just last&nbsp;month.”</p><p>Fei Liu, CTO of Litentry said, “Ontology has made a great achievement in the development of decentralized identity solutions, and in particular decentralized credit scoring solutions — a timely solution in high demand given the industry’s current focus on DeFi. We are delighted to collaborate with Ontology to integrate these solutions and to work to increase user adoption of our products and services to create a fairer world when it comes to individuals and their&nbsp;data.”</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-litentry-accelerating-adoption-of-its-decentralized-identity-and-credit-95870de47ea3">Ontology Partners With Litentry, Accelerating Adoption Of Its Decentralized Identity and Credit…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>As <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-language-popularity-python-overtakes-java-as-rust-reaches-top-20/">Python grows in popularity</a>, the variety of high-quality frameworks available to developers has blossomed. In addition to steadfast options like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, there are many new options including <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>.</p>

<p>First released <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/releases?after=0.2.0">in late 2018</a>, FastAPI differentiates itself from other Python frameworks by offering a modern, fast, and succinct developer experience for building reliable <a>REST APIs</a>. While one of the newer open-source Python frameworks available, FastAPI has quickly gained a following with over <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi">22,000 stars on GitHub</a> and an active <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/">community of maintainers</a> working on the project.</p>

<p>In this post, you’ll learn more about FastAPI, and why it might be the right choice for your next project. You’ll see how to set up a new FastAPI project and use <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a> to secure the API.</p>

 What Sets FastAPI Apart? 

<p>Unlike many web frameworks, FastAPI is built to support REST APIs first. As <a href="https://w3-lab.com/web-development/single-page-applications-pros-2020/">single-page applications become increasingly common</a>, separate backends like those created with FastAPI are an essential part of web application architecture. With this in mind, FastAPI incorporates several features meant to support HTTP API-driven application development.</p>

<p>First, documentation is created for your application automatically. Using <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>, FastAPI generates clean, interactive documentation for your application. Later in this tutorial, you’ll see how you can use this documentation to test your API’s authorization functionality.</p>

<p>Next, FastAPI is, as its name suggests, <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/benchmarks/">fast</a>. Python has historically tended to be slower than Node or Go because of the blocking, synchronous nature of the language; in Python 3, the option to declare functions <code>async</code> changed that. Some older frameworks aren’t built to support asynchronous Python, but FastAPI does. It’s built on <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a>, a lightweight asynchronous Python server, and it takes advantage of modern features like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> to improve developer experience.</p>

<p>Another feature implemented by FastAPI, but not necessarily common in the Python ecosystem, is <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#dependency-injection">dependency injection</a>. The FastAPI framework uses type hints in your function signatures to find and inject the required dependencies. This allows you to write decoupled, reusable code, making unit testing much easier as dependencies can be swapped out at runtime.</p>

<p>Finally, while FastAPI comes with many of the features you would expect in a REST API framework (like <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#validation">data validation</a> and <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#security-and-authentication">authentication</a>), it lets you choose your ORM and database of choice. This means that FastAPI can work with your existing data models if you’re migrating from an existing Python application.</p>

<p>While FastAPI is an excellent option for building REST APIs in Python, it’s not perfect for every situation. If the system you’re building relies on Python 3.5 or any earlier Python framework, you won’t be able to use FastAPI. FastAPI also isn’t a great choice if you’re building a server-side web application that needs to display HTML, as it doesn’t include all the view helper functions that full-stack frameworks like Django do.</p>

<p>Now that you’re familiar with FastAPI at a high level, you’re ready to start building your first application. In the rest of this tutorial, you’ll see how to get started and secure your endpoints using Okta as your OAuth authorization server.</p>

 Building a New FastAPI Project 

<p>In this section, you’ll create a new FastAPI project and add a single, unprotected endpoint to your API.</p>

<p>Before you get started, make sure your computer has <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download">Python 3.6+ installed</a>. FastAPI uses the typing and asynchronous features in Python, so earlier versions of the language won’t run it.</p>

 Install FastAPI 

<p>Start by creating a new Python project and using pip to <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#installation">install FastAPI</a> and <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">Uvicorn</a> as your asynchronous server:</p>

   <code>pip install fastapi uvicorn
pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code>   

<p>The dependencies will be added to your requirements.txt file.</p>

 Create a New Endpoint 

<p>For this tutorial, you’ll use a single <code>main.py</code> file that contains all your routes. You can <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/">break this file up as your application grows</a>, but since you’ll just be adding a couple of endpoints, you don’t need to worry about that now.</p>

<p>Create the <code>main.py</code> file in your project’s root directory and add the following:</p>

   <code>from fastapi import FastAPI


app = FastAPI()


# Hello World route
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

</code>   

 Accessing Your API 

<p>When using FastAPI, there are two ways you can access your API. You can use an API explorer like <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>, or you can use FastAPI’s interactive documentation in your browser. This tutorial will focus on the latter.</p>

<p>To start your application, run the Uvicorn server:</p>

   <code>uvicorn main:app --reload
</code>   

<p>Then, open <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000</code> in your browser to see your “Hello, world” endpoint in action:</p>

<p></p>

<p>FastAPI’s interactive documentation is available at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>. Once you’re there, you’ll see details about each endpoint automatically. FastAPI uses type hints and context in your application to produce these docs on its own.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you’ve seen how easy it is to get started, you’re ready to build a more useful application. In the remainder of this tutorial, you’ll see how to create protected endpoints in FastAPI that use Okta as an authorization server.</p>

 Securing FastAPI with Okta 

<p>To demonstrate some of the more advanced features of the FastAPI framework, I’ll show you how to build a protected endpoint that uses <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-client-creds/overview/">the client credentials flow</a> to authorize access. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to enter your Okta client ID and secret into FastAPI’s interactive docs to get an access token. You’ll see how to validate this JWT access token remotely using Okta’s <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#introspect">introspect</a> endpoint and locally using the <a href="https://github.com/adithyasampatoor/okta_jwt">Okta JWT Python library</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to run the final application, <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-fastapi">the code is available on GitHub</a>, or you can follow along for step-by-step instructions.</p>

 Setting Up a New Application in Okta 

<p>Before you create any endpoints in your FastAPI application, you’ll need to create a new application in Okta and get your Authorization Server’s issuer URL and audience. As you go through these steps, add the Okta environment variables to a new file in your application called <code>.env</code>. You’ll see how to use these variables later in the tutorial.</p>

<p>To create a new server application, log in to your Okta account and go to Applications and click the Add Application button in the top left. Select Service, Machine-to-Machine, then click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter a name for your application and click Next again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from this page and add them to your FastAPI application’s <code>.env</code> file as <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET</code> respectively.</p>

<p>Your <code>.env</code> file should look like the example below, with your <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET</code> values filled out:</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Next, go to API &gt; Authorization Servers. Copy the Issuer URI and Audience, and add them as the <code>OKTA_ISSUER</code> and <code>OKTA_AUDIENCE</code> environment variables in your <code>.env</code> file.</p>

<p>Your <code>.env</code> file should now look something like this:</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=
OKTA_ISSUER="https://SOMETHING_HERE.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default"
OKTA_AUDIENCE="api://default"
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Now that you have your environment variables, you need to create a custom scope for your authorization server. Your FastAPI application will request a token with this scope. Click the pencil icon to edit the authorization server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Scopes tab and then the Add Scopes button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Give your scope a Name and Display phrase so you can identify it. I used <code>items</code> for the scope name since the example here is pretty generic, but it’s a good idea to be specific about the resources users will gain access to when requesting a scope.</p>

<p>Click Create when you’re finished.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you’ve created a new application, set up a custom scope, and set your environment variables, you’re ready to call the Okta authorization server from your FastAPI application.</p>

 Retrieving an Access Token in FastAPI 

<p>The client credentials authorization flow requires users to enter a client ID and secret. The authorization server will then return an access token that allows the user to access the API. When using Okta, you’ll call the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#token"><code>/token</code> endpoint</a>, passing your client ID and secret in as the authorization header.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/774">set FastAPI to call an external authentication endpoint like Okta’s</a>, but it requires a bit more custom code. Because the documentation’s API call originates from the browser, you also introduce further security considerations.</p>

<p>The easiest way to request an access token is to use the <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/">Python HTTPX library</a> to call the Okta <code>/token</code> endpoint from your API.</p>

<p>First, install HTTPX:</p>

   <code>pip install httpx
pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code>   

<p>Next, open your <code>main.py</code> file and add the following:</p>

   <code>from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, Request
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
import httpx
from starlette.config import Config


# Load environment variables
config = Config('.env')

app = FastAPI()

# Define the auth scheme and access token URL
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl='token')


# Call the Okta API to get an access token
def retrieve_token(authorization, issuer, scope='items'):
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'authorization': authorization,
        'cache-control': 'no-cache',
        'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    }
    data = {
        'grant_type': 'client_credentials',
        'scope': scope,
    }
    url = issuer + '/v1/token'

    response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

    if response.status_code == httpx.codes.OK:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=response.text)


# Get auth token endpoint
@app.post('/token')
def login(request: Request):
    return retrieve_token(
        request.headers['authorization'],
        config('OKTA_ISSUER'),
        'items'
    )
</code>   

<p>This creates a new endpoint (<code>/token</code>) in your FastAPI application that passes the request’s <code>Authorization</code> header on to your Okta authorization server. It also includes your custom scope (<code>'items'</code>).</p>

 Creating a Protected Endpoint 

<p>Now that you have an endpoint that generates a token, you are ready to create a new endpoint that checks the token before granting access.</p>

<p>Before you worry about token validation, create the new endpoint and <code>validate</code> function. You’ll add the logic to this function in the next step, but for testing purposes, you can simply return <code>True</code>.</p>

   <code>...
# Add these to your imports
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel

...

# Validate the token
def validate(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    # TODO: Add token validation logic
    return True


# Data model
class Item(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str


# Protected, get items route
@app.get('/items', response_model=List[Item])
def read_items(valid: bool = Depends(validate)):
    return [
        Item.parse_obj({'id': 1, 'name': 'red ball'}),
        Item.parse_obj({'id': 2, 'name': 'blue square'}),
        Item.parse_obj({'id': 3, 'name': 'purple ellipse'}),
    ]
</code>   

<p>The new <code>/items</code> endpoint includes a <code>response_model</code> definition. This allows FastAPI to generate documentation for your endpoint with a sample response. It uses FastAPI’s dependency injection pattern to call the <code>validate</code> function. In turn, that function injects the <code>oauth2_scheme</code>, which extracts the access token for you.</p>

<p>To view the interactive documentation, start the Uvicorn server (if you stopped it earlier), and go to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To test the authorization flow, click the grey lock in the top right corner of the endpoint. Enter your Okta client ID and secret (you can ignore the username and password fields) and click Authorize.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, click Try it out then Execute to call the endpoint. FastAPI’s documentation automatically stores and injects your access token. Because the <code>validate</code> function you created above never throws an exception, the API will show you the equivalent <code>curl</code> request and respond with the list of items.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you see how the interactive documentation is generated and how access tokens can be used, you are ready to implement token validation.</p>

 Validating Access Tokens Remotely 

<p>There are two ways to validate JWT access tokens generated by Okta. The first method you’ll see uses the Okta authorization server’s <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#introspect"><code>/inspect</code> endpoint</a> to check the token. The advantage of this method is that you will know if the token has been revoked; the downside is that it’s slower than validating the JWT locally.</p>

<p>To validate access tokens remotely, update your <code>validate</code> function, and add the following <code>validate_remotely</code> function:</p>

   <code>
def validate_remotely(token, issuer, clientId, clientSecret):
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'cache-control': 'no-cache',
        'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    }
    data = {
        'client_id': clientId,
        'client_secret': clientSecret,
        'token': token,
    }
    url = issuer + '/v1/introspect'

    response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

    return response.status_code == httpx.codes.OK and response.json()['active']


def validate(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    res = validate_remotely(
        token,
        config('OKTA_ISSUER'),
        config('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'),
        config('OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET')
    )

    if res:
        return True
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400)
</code>   

<p>Now, refresh the docs, generate an access token by entering your Okta client ID and secret again, and call the <code>/items</code> endpoint. You should see a <code>200 Success</code> response again with the items. This endpoint is now calling the Okta authorization server on every request.</p>

 Validating Access Tokens Locally 

<p>Because access tokens are generally short-lived (an hour by default), you might <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/go/overview/">prefer to validate the tokens locally</a>. This method is slightly less secure because you can’t be sure that the access token hasn’t been revoked remotely, but on the other hand, you don’t have to use your Okta client secret to validate the token locally. Finally, local validation is significantly faster because you don’t have to make a request to the Okta authorization server with every API call. You’ll have to decide which method is most appropriate for your application.</p>

<p>To validate the access token locally, install the <a href="https://github.com/adithyasampatoor/okta_jwt">Okta JWT Python package</a>:</p>

   <code>pip install okta_jwt
pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code>   

<p>Next, import the package’s <code>validate_token</code> function and update the <code>validate</code> function in your <code>main.py</code> file:</p>

   <code>...
from okta_jwt.jwt import validate_token as validate_locally

...

def validate(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    try:
        res = validate_locally(
            token,
            config('OKTA_ISSUER'),
            config('OKTA_AUDIENCE'),
            config('OKTA_CLIENT_ID')
        )
        return bool(res)
    except Exception:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403)
...
</code>   

<p>When you call the <code>/items</code> endpoint, the API will decode the JWT and validate it locally. The decoded JWTs are cached, so subsequent requests will be faster than the first one.</p>

 Learn More About Python and REST APIs 
<p>In this post, you’ve seen how to use FastAPI to build a REST API endpoint that uses an external authorization server to generate and validate access tokens. You’ve seen some of the key features of FastAPI in action, including dependency injection, the OpenAPI documentation, type hinting, and OAuth implementation.</p>

<p>FastAPI is a great option for building secure and performant backend systems. While there’s much more to building a robust production API, including testing, handling POST and PUT endpoints, and connecting to a database for persistence, I hope this tutorial helps you get started.</p>

   CEO Perspective 

<p>In 2020 we witnessed radical changes in how we live, work and play, requiring all of us to embrace “remote everything.” The world’s reliance on digital access has never been more profound, and watching how our customers stepped up to new challenges to keep their virtual doors open has been inspiring.</p>

<p>Some of the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/our-customers">customer</a> stories I’ve heard this year stand out because of their massive scale and transformative effects. A luxury car maker was able to onboard 25 million new consumer and workforce applications in just seconds. A financial services customer was able to deploy the recent release of the ForgeRock platform in just 25% of the time that it took them to deploy earlier versions - and they did this using just half the number of resources previously required. And one of our major healthcare customers was able to identify 550,000 excess entitlements among 14.6 million assignments within three hours and reduce their cybersecurity risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The enhancements we made to the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> this year were incredible, and when combined with our commitment to customer success, it was truly a special year at ForgeRock. We hired nearly two hundred new ForgeRockers to the team, deepened relationships with our partners, onboarded exciting new customers like Calabrio and BTPN Bank, and grew existing relationships with Allianz, BMW, BBC, Verizon, Australian Securities Exchange and WW (Weight Watchers). And topping it off was industry recognition from three major industry analyst firms that named ForgeRock an <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">identity and access management</a> leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished together. Take a look at some of the highlights.&nbsp;</p>

 A Growing Presence in the Cloud&nbsp; 

<p>We made significant investments in the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> and our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-expands-leadership-team-extend-success-cloud-and-identity">Cloud Success </a>operational model, keeping our customers top of mind as we rolled out new features. We took configurability to the next level to enable customers to deliver superior omnichannel experiences to their users and secure all of their workforce and consumer identities. We introduced a one-subscription model to provide complete deployment flexibility in data centers, private clouds or public cloud. And, our full tenant isolation ensures that all customer data is stored separately so you can rest easy knowing that your data is safe and secure.</p>

 Platform Upgrades&nbsp; 

<p>We introduced one of our biggest <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> updates in company history. The addition of AI-driven intelligence in ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a> provides a deeper understanding of the risks associated with user access and reduces costs. We also introduced ForgeRock<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access"> </a><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access</a>, which helps customers create seamless and secure experiences that adapt to your users’ needs in real time. This new release also added <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">ForgeRock Go,</a> making passwords and usernames a thing of the past.&nbsp;</p>

 Expanding Our Partner Network&nbsp; 

<p>Our Trust Network continues to be one of our greatest assets as it has expanded to over 90 technology partners extending the value of the ForgeRock Identity Platform. Today nearly half of our new customers will leverage at least one <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">Trust Network</a> partner as part of their complete Identity Solution. Our partnership program gained momentum as we expanded relationships with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/partner/google-cloud">Google Cloud</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/partner/aws">AWS</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-joins-microsoft-intelligent-security-association">Microsoft</a>. In April, we joined the Google Cloud co-sell program and our Google Cloud marketplace listing, which will enable us to further expand our sales pipeline, is coming soon. We continued to expand our partnership with AWS as an advanced technology partner, and joined the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA) in September, providing an integration with Microsoft Cloud Security services to help reduce risk and strengthen compliance for our joint customers.</p>

 Corporate Updates 

<p>We’re excited to share that ForgeRock earned major recognition from top industry analysts this year. We’ve been named a leader in access management and customer identity and access management (CIAM) – by top <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports">analyst </a>firms. These analysts have highlighted our ability to provide exceptional digital experiences while meeting our customers’ requirements for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">privacy and compliance.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>ForgeRock also achieved an important milestone that put us one step closer to becoming one of the premier digital identity companies in the market. In April, we secured an additional $93.5 million in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/series-e-funding-marks-momentous-day-forgerock">Series E funding</a>&nbsp;led by Riverwood Capital, with our existing investors, Accel, Meritech Capital, Foundation Capital and KKR Growth also participating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want to thank all of you – our customers, partners and employees – for your support and hard work this year. As we move into 2021, we will continue to stay focused on our purpose: to help people simply and safely access the connected world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wish you a healthy, safe and joyful holiday season!</p>

  Digital technology is not intended to aggravate inequalities and must not become an obstacle to integration in today's society but, on the contrary, a valuable aid. Cozy Cloud has joined forces with the CEMÉA for digital inclusion.

 <p>Not having access to the Internet or <a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4241397">not knowing how to use digital tools is a handicap for nearly 17% of the French population</a>, according to a study by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE). This digital illiteracy particularly affects the most fragile populations and is closely linked to what is commonly known as the digital divide.</p>
<p>Although our uses, our administrative procedures and our relationships with others have never been as online as they are today, inequalities persist among the oldest people, those with fewer qualifications and those on modest incomes. However, digital technology is not intended to aggravate inequalities and must not become an obstacle to integration into today's society but, on the contrary, a valuable aid. A few months ago, <a href="http://www.cemea.asso.fr/">CEMÉA</a>, a group of associations and a major player in the popular education movement came knocking at the door of our cosy cloud to propose a project that has just been deployed...</p>
 Introduction 
<p>First of all, it is important to remind you that our mission at <a href="https://cozy.io/en/about/">Cozy Cloud</a> is to democratise the digital home with a simple tool for the technical reappropriation of its data.</p>
<p>Because we strongly believe that for a society to be democratic, individuals must control their personal data themselves, we have developed a personal data platform for a new approach to digital inclusion - a kind of new channel to create a real digital proximity with users, to empower them digitally.</p>
 Cozy and digital inclusion 
<p>By definition, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_num%C3%A9rique">digital inclusion</a> is a process that aims to make digital technology accessible to every individual and to provide them with the digital skills that will be a leverage for their social and economic inclusion.</p>
<p>This process includes the establishment of a set of policies and strategies that aim to lead to the creation of an "inclusive" information society, which can benefit everyone without excluding citizens from marginalised communities. These policies are developed taking into account the social and economic reality of individuals. They aim to put in place ways of overcoming digital exclusion in order to promote access for all. This can be done through access and education to tools, training and learning, etc., aiming at the autonomy of people in the use of new technologies. A nationwide plan has been deployed for <a href="https://www.cohesion-territoires.gouv.fr/inclusion-numerique-favoriser-lapprentissage-du-numerique-et-developper-les-usages">this purpose</a>.</p>
 La clé d'accès à mes droits" (The key to access my rights): Project by CEMEA in partnership with Cozy Cloud and with the support of Secours Populaire Français, Samu Social de Paris, AFNIC Foundation and Framasoft. 
<p>Today, access to rights requires a real mastery of the digital world (applying for benefits, updating CAF and RSA files, etc.). However, for many people, particularly the most vulnerable (young people who have dropped out of school, homeless people, asylum seekers, women victims of violence, etc.), this remains a complex task.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The project "The key to access my rights" consists of enabling people in a situation of fragility in their relationships or access to digital technology to regain their autonomy and pursue their emancipation while preserving their personal data, in order to strengthen their access to their social rights.</p>
<p>It is inspired by the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framakey">Framasoft's Framakey project</a>, i.e. a USB key containing the embedded applications (without any personal data being stored on it) enabling everyone to find their personal space simplified whatever the machine used.</p>
<p>Access to the key is completely secure. The helper's data is synchronised with an online personal space. In addition, this also serves as a portal to access various services. This object also symbolises the reappropriation of data belonging to people on the road to digital autonomy.</p>
<p>This project has been designed as a whole:</p>
 
 political (reappropriating one's rights, etc.), 
 technical (simplicity and data protection), 
 deontological (to put the accompanying persons in the right place by holding personal data), 
 educational (support the training of users and support staff in the use of the key), 
 partner (by associating field actors and users in the construction of the tool and support). 
 
<p>In addition, this project aims at decomplexifying the ubuesque situations in the accompaniment of people by professionals and/or volunteers (passwords entrusted to third parties in public digital spaces, non-disconnected transfers on public computers, sometimes very personal attachments present in the "download" folder of these same computers, etc.).</p>
<p>Moreover, it is complex and even almost impossible for vulnerable and sometimes homeless people to keep all the documents that enable them to assert their rights, or even simply "souvenirs" or personal objects such as a simple photograph.</p>
<p>Our administrative procedures are increasingly dematerialised and this results in risks, in particular the non-use of rights. Many people are no longer in a position to carry out their own procedures. As a result, many end up delegating their procedures to a third party so that they can continue to access their services and rights. This assistance sometimes turns into a real situation of interference, which is partially suffered.</p>
<p>It is therefore with great pride that <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy</a>, as a simplified personal space, complements this project with the Secours Populaire Français, the Samu Social de Paris, the CEMEA and the Afnic Foundation (French Association for Cooperative Internet Naming).</p>
 Relevance of the Cozy digital home 
<p>Managing online services is complicated: you have to manage your identities and passwords to connect to services that have become essential (CAF, RSA, Pôle emploi, Social Security, etc.), often from a mobile phone, find the website address, navigate the site to find the right information or fill in the right form.</p>
<p>To carry out their administrative procedures, individuals are confronted with a multitude of services and sometimes complex technologies. The digital home developed by <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy</a> simplifies these procedures.</p>
<p>Mon-domicile-num-rique](/en/content/images/2020/11/Mon-domicile-num-rique.png)</p>
<p>Cozy brings together several services (storage applications, bank aggregator, password, contact and photo manager) and data, simplifying usage with simple and easy to use features: direct links to share a folder or document, password management with automatic filling or generation of strong passwords, automatic online data retrieval with a single click, alerts and help with budget tracking.</p>
<p>All this in a context that places the individual truly in a "home" - a digital home, which he can keep beyond the initial provision, which he can move to...</p>
<p><a href="https://cozy.io/en/"></a></p>
 From assistance to autonomy 
<p>Cozy thus becomes an immediately operational solution to simplify the digital daily life of these people in a precarious situation and enable the effectiveness of aid by guaranteeing :</p>
<p>✓Easy access to the rights of the person receiving aid<br>
✓Facility and secure actions of those accompanying them<br>
✓Back up of passwords / identities of the person being helped<br>
✓all the personal data are secure (supporting documents, photo, contacts, bank details, etc.)</p>
 A frictionless and uncomplicated grip for both parties 
<p></p>
 
 
<p>The Cozy digital home then provides several services to the person being helped:</p>
 
 "My Accounts": direct access to their bank accounts, which allows them to monitor their cash inflows/outflows 
 "My Contacts" : directory of people to contact, in particular the carer and other people essential to the management of his administrative life. 
 "My Photos" : backup folder and organisation of your photos 
 "My Rights" : direct access to the website <a href="https://www.mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr/accueil/">https://www.mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr/accueil/</a> 
 "My Papers" : access to the backup of your identity papers and retrieve your pdf's, certificates and other documents automatically recovered without any action on your part thanks to connectors (for example Ameli and Impots.Gouv). 
 "My Notes": direct access to notes shared by the carer 
 "My Mails": direct access to your webmail (upcoming feature). 
 
 
 
<p>Each helped person (= new user with a personal cloud) is accompanied by a helper (= companion), trained and available to help him/her progress in the reappropriation of his/her data, papers and other necessary documents.</p>
 
 
<p>The person being helped has a USB key with which they can open their Cozy digital home from any PC. The content of this key will be systematically synchronised in the assisted person's digital home. The USB key symbolises physically the possession of their data (in addition, for some people concerned, the assurance that they no longer run the risk of losing a photo, letter, diploma, etc., the only witnesses to their story) even if they will obviously be kept in a cloud. The key is really only the simplified access key to one's personal space, inaccessible without a password. The browser - Firefox- is installed and configured on the key, so that the person being helped does not leave any personal data (cookie, browsing history, etc.) on the computer on which he or she inserts the key to access his or her personal space.<br>
In the event of loss or destruction of the key, it will nevertheless be very simple to reconstitute a new one from the data saved on the digital home.</p>
 
 
<p>The Pass extension, the password manager is already installed in the private Firefox browser available on the USB key. The person being helped thus federates and secures all their identities and passwords in their Cozy so that they do not lose them and are always at hand.</p>
 
 
<p>The Cozy of the person being helped thus becomes a place to share documents (via sharing often read-only in Drive) and help to recover passwords (if the carer needs to find this or that paper/lamp).</p>
 
 
<p>This is a paradigm shift for the person receiving assistance, who until now has been on the fringes of digital use and who, by reappropriating and controlling his data in his digital home, becomes a real player in his digital life and a citizen again.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We are convinced that our collective digital sovereignty will be the sum up of individual digital autonomies and it is by allowing each individual to control their data in a personal space to which they hold the key that we will achieve this. **At Cozy Cloud, we want the emancipation of each individual and not their manipulation or exclusion from society through digital technology.</p>
<p>A big thank you to the CEMEAs for having taken us on this adventure that gives a key back to those who need it.</p>

 🔄 Cozy Drive 
 Cozy Drive - synchronization application 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-desktop/releases/tag/v3.24.1">version 3.24</a> fixes some residual issues that occur in rare cases (especially when moving files under MacOS) and paves the way for the developments we have started to work on.</p>
 
 
<p>Under MacOS, we fixed a bug that prevented some successive moves of the same document, especially if the user has an HFS+ partition and there is an automatic change of the UTF-8 encoding of the path.</p>
 
 
<p>The permission to execute files under macOS and Linux is kept even when the file is also synchronized on a PC under Windows (which doesn't have this kind of permission).</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://cozy.io/en/download/"></a></p>
 
 
<p>When a local folder and a remote folder of the same name are linked together, the metadata of the remote folder is updated.</p>
 
 
<p>Storing the local metadata allows us to better detect when a remote change to a file has been saved but not applied to the local disk before a client restart. So we can now do without a backup copy to the local file trash when we decide to apply this remote change.</p>
 
 
<p>I can confirm that the features you are waiting for are under development and will arrive beginning 2021.</p>

 Cozy Drive - web 
<p>The sharing path has been completly reviewed and the team is working to make the experience as fluid as possible. Let's get down to the details:</p>
<p>✨ adding a preview link of the share directly in your Cozy if the Cozy of the sender knows the URL</p>
<p>✨ you can now find out if a folder or document you have shared has been viewed</p>
<p>✨ remove the share request step if the recipient URL is already known</p>
<p>✨ improvement of the sharing window with a separation between the upper part dedicated to sending by e-mail or contact and the lower part dedicated to sharing by link. This makes the modal more airy and clearer.</p>
<p>✨ appearance of a red badge in your Cozy on new shares you have not yet consulted</p>
<p>✨ the share link sent by email (or added in the Cozy) has been shortened</p>
<p>You can find the details of the possibilities on <a href="https://help.cozy.io/article/485-how-to-share-files-or-folders-with-your-cozy">our FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>By Simone Hill, Senior Manager, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Illustration by <a href="https://www.tiphughes.com/">Tiffany&nbsp;Hughes</a>.<p>In June, <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">Omidyar Network committed $500,000 to organizations fighting on the frontlines for racial justice</a> because we firmly believe that this work is core to our ability to create inclusive, equitable societies. While the funding is an essential step toward our vision, the way we invested was also critical to developing thoughtful partnerships with organizations already building or scaling innovations.</p><p>What does it mean to invest in justice? It begins with a clear-eyed recognition of the systemic racism that manifests within all of our systems to undermine the safety of Black and Brown people. Investing in justice means attacking the many resulting symptoms of white supremacy at their root by finding organizations working to innovate and advance holistic ways to create lasting change. It means being strategic and careful about ensuring that while we are looking for ways to address the wrongs that pervade our societies, we are not inadvertently causing more harm. With that, an awareness of our own limitations as a funder is required –– financial investments are a step at the beginning of a long-term journey towards holistic, strategic action. Finally, investing in justice means continuing to integrate racial justice with our firm-wide focus to reimagine systems: building an economy that works for all — an anti-racist economy is a <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">key pillar of our point of view</a>; realizing the promise of responsible technology; and fostering a more pluralistic society.</p><p>We searched around the country for Black-led organizations whose work combined economic, civic, or criminal justice reform with narrative shift or movement building towards racial justice. Among many organizations doing incredible work, the following five are achieving impact in ways that align with our current strategic focus.</p> Large Scale Change, Powered by Deep Networks: <a href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/centering-blackness-the-path-to-economic-liberation-for-all-f6c2c7398281">Centering Blackness Initiative</a> <p>Spearheaded by three dynamic women of color, the Insight Center for Community Economic Development has developed the <a href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/centering-blackness-the-path-to-economic-liberation-for-all-f6c2c7398281">Centering Blackness Initiative</a>; a lens to identify how and where economic policies, practices, and institutions harm Black&nbsp;people.</p>Graphic illustration from Insight Center’s Power Learning Community<p>A multi-pronged approach to systemic change, the Initiative is a new framework for examining and reimagining systems. It is accompanied by a set of tools, currently in development, to encourage multiracial, progressive organizations to adopt the framework. Not only will organizations be supported to develop new internal operations through this lens, but they can also adopt it for their policy advocacy campaigns.</p><p>Because narrative shift is a critical component of the Centering Blackness Initiative, the Insight Center has also launched the <a href="https://www.blackthoughtproject.com/">Black Thought Project</a> to create safe spaces in cities that center, celebrate, and protect Black thoughts and expression.</p>Black Thought Project installation <a href="http://www.blackthoughtproject.com/">www.blackthoughtproject.com</a> Systems Change in the Informal Economy: <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">Equity &amp; Transformation</a> <p>“Black informal workers are resilient and creative, and they have constructed an informal economy to acquire a means of subsistence,” — Richard Wallace, founder, and director of <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">Equity &amp; Transformation</a> (EAT).</p>(Right) Richard Wallace, Founder and director of&nbsp;EAT<p>Founded in 2018, EAT is the only organization in the United States, specifically focused on protecting and uplifting Black workers operating in the informal economy. Defined as a set of unregulated economic activities, the informal economy includes street vending, childcare, auto-mechanic, and moving services — activities which allow people who cannot find standard employment to make a living, but without the protection of formal labor standards.</p><p>While EAT’s work includes research and policy development to destigmatize the informal economy, the organization also educates workers about their protections. EAT spearheads and collaborates on campaigns across Chicago to improve the lives of Black workers in the informal economy. The Guaranteed Income Project, for instance, provides previously incarcerated individuals with $500 per month to help cover their bills, find homes, and ultimately, reduce recidivism.</p>EAT <a href="http://www.eatchicago.org/">www.eatchicago.org</a> Building Power through Black Leadership: <a href="https://www.jwj.org/our-work/absi">Advancing Black Strategists Initiative</a> <p>Black leadership is critical to the success of racial and economic justice movements, but while BIPOC are often the implementers of social change campaigns, they rarely drive the strategies that energize these movements. The <a href="https://www.jwj.org/our-work/absi">Advancing Black Strategists Initiative</a> (ABSI)—a joint project led by The Jobs With Justice Education Fund, in collaboration with the Black Worker Initiative at the Institute for Policy Studies and Morehouse College—is raising a cohort of Black economic-justice and labor-focused strategists to lead, develop, and advance policies and campaigns.</p><p>ABSI will provide the tools and knowledge to equip Black strategists to work from the strength of their lived experiences, to inspire participation and engagement around polices that center Black economic justice. As this new generation of Black leaders takes on bigger roles and builds and wields power across movements, they will ultimately strengthen Black institutions, advance economic democracy, and change the socio-economic conditions of the Black community.</p> Narrative Shift at the Intersection of Race and Technology: <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet&nbsp;Enquiry</a> <p>While technology permeates our everyday lives, it is another system where built-in white supremacy limits both usage and accessibility by Black&nbsp;people.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet Enquiry</a> (a newly-founded interdisciplinary research center at UCLA) aims to use art and storytelling to reimagine technology, and in the process, champion racial justice, reframe our understanding of the role of technology in our lives, and strengthen democracy by holding those who create unjust systems and technologies accountable.</p><p>Over the next year, artist-in-residence, film-maker <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7307049">Oge Egbounu</a>, will work alongside the center’s co-directors and racial justice lead, to translate the center’s work into cultural artifacts that can resonate with a broad audience. This project creates a unique opportunity to develop cultural artifacts grounded in the center’s research that can shift narratives for mass audiences and tech workers alike, to more intentionally use and create technology in ways that do not harm&nbsp;others.</p> A Clear Path Forward: <a href="https://m4bl.org/">Movement for Black&nbsp;Lives</a> <p><a href="https://m4bl.org/">Movement for Black Lives</a> has a courageous vision: a long-term plan to shift the consciousness toward racial reckoning, and an ability to chart a clear path towards their goal. Fiscally sponsored by the Common Counsel Foundation, the Movement for Black Lives’ Black Power Rising: Vision 2024 seeks to build the social, political, institutional, and collective power of Black people by harnessing the collective power and creativity of Black people. Grounded in Black culture, the initiative aims to bring an informed electorate to the table to drive anti-racist policy&nbsp;shifts.</p><p>This strategic five-year plan will guide the coalition’s programmatic and campaign efforts to build mass support for progressive policies that center the needs of Black people. A core part of this work will equip local leaders with tools and strategies to build power within and between their organizations, scale engagement around political participation, and attack white supremacy by ensuring political representation and leadership, especially in Black communities.</p>Illustration by <a href="https://www.tiphughes.com/">Tiffany&nbsp;Hughes</a>. Restorative Justice Requires Restorative Investment <p>Why invest specifically in narrative shifting, and power-building in the intersections between movements, institutions, and Black leadership? Why look for spaces that prioritize economic justice in underfunded regions? Because we believe that this is where organizations are creating innovative, holistic solutions to specific problems that will generate the most significant returns.</p><p>In the course of identifying these organizations, we collaborated with five of our sister organizations within <a href="https://www.omidyargroup.com/">The Omidyar Group</a> —<a href="https://democracyfund.org/"> Democracy Fund</a>, <a href="https://flourishventures.com/">Flourish</a>, <a href="https://humanityunited.org/">Humanity United</a>, <a href="https://www.imaginablefutures.com/">Imaginable Futures</a>, and <a href="https://luminategroup.com/">Luminate</a> — to jointly fund two regranting organizations focused on supporting grassroots racial justice groups. Emergent Fund (a fiscally sponsored project of Amalgamated Charitable Foundation) quickly moves no strings attached resources to communities of color under attack by federal policies and priorities. Liberated Capital Fund of the Decolonizing Wealth Project (fiscally sponsored by Allied Media Projects) provides unrestricted resources through a reparations model to Black and Indigenous-led organizations to shape a future where we can all heal from generations of colonial trauma. As a result of the substantial work we’ve seen around the country, we will have exceeded our initial goal and invested a total of $1,050,000.</p><p>We believe that these investments are a significant step towards creating the world we are advancing toward in our mission as an organization. But this is only a first step. We are committed to building true partnerships with these organizations, putting our relevant resources at their disposal, and amplifying their work to a broader audience of both practitioners and funders. Investing in justice means much more than dollars; it is a whole-hearted commitment by our institution.</p>

			<p>Luxembourg, December 16, 2020 — <a href="http://cbinsights.com">CB Insights</a> today named Tokeny Solutions in its inaugural <a href="http://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/blockchain-technology-companies">Blockchain 50 ranking</a>, a list of the top private companies applying or analyzing blockchain technology to solve business or consumer problems across various industries.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with Blockdata, the 2020 Blockchain 50 cohort includes companies from all around the globe across varying investment stages of development, from early-stage startups to well-funded unicorns.</p>

		 
	 
    Blockchain moved from possible to practical in 2020 as evidenced by the enterprise adoption we tracked. At the same time, the blockchain company ecosystem also became more crowded, creating noise and uncertainty for enterprises as they evaluate vendors and partners. The Blockchain 50, which we've created in conjunction with Blockdata, was born out of a desire to reduce that uncertainty and recognize the pioneering companies using the blockchain.  Anand SanwalCB Insights CEO     <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/blockchain-technology-companies/"> </a>     This inaugural class of the Blockchain 50 is tackling a range of use cases across trade finance, capital markets, exchanges and more and are being used by banks, governments and major retailers. We’re excited to see the impact the Blockchain 50 will have on industries as their solutions are deployed and to see the continued evolution of blockchain technology as it matures.  Anand SanwalCB Insights CEO       2020 has been a year where blockchain has made some important steps in becoming a reputable and accepted piece of technology. The digital assets industry has grown phenomenally. CBDCs have manifested on the agendas of major governments, regulations have progressed and there have been more security token issuances, particularly in real estate. All of this has only fuelled interest in security tokens, and many now see the path to private market liquidity. We are pleased to have further recognition in this vision by the CB Insights Blokchcain 50 and are excited to be included in such an impressive cohort of companies.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions    
	 
		 
			<p>Tokeny Solutions marked some important industry milestones in 2020. It was a year in which they accelerated private market adoption; they tokenized a total of $27bn in asset value, were selected by the government of Monaco as its tokenization platform and teamed up with the major banks in France to explore the use of a digital currency. Through the institutional-grade T-REX protocol, they are bringing genuine asset transferability to private markets, an industry that has always been starved of liquidity.</p>
<p>Through an evidence-based approach, the CB Insights research team, in collaboration with Blockdata, selected the Blockchain 50 from thousands of applications and nominees, based on factors including patent activity, business relations, investor profiles, news sentiment analysis, proprietary Mosaic scores, market potential, competitive landscape, team strength, and tech novelty.</p>
<p>Quick facts on the 2020 Blockchain 50:</p>
 
 The 2020 Blockchain 50 companies have raised over $3B in aggregate equity funding across 110+ deals since 2017. 
 The list includes five unicorns (companies valued at or above $1B). 
 While the majority of the companies are based in North America, 40% of the 2020 Blockchain 50 winners are based outside the United States, in countries such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland and Luxembourg. 
 Blockchain Capital, Castle Island Ventures, Kinetic Capital, Pantera Capital, and Valar Ventures are the most active venture investors in the Blockchain 50, with 5 investments each since 2017. 
 

		 
	 
   
	 
		 
			 About Tokeny Solutions 
<p>Tokeny Solutions allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny Solutions enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments.</p>
<p>The multi-award winning firm is the leading tokenization platform and the creator of the T-REX, the institutional-grade security token protocol.

 Voting just got a whole more&nbsp;secure. <p>The two blockchain companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding and entered into a technological partnership. As part of the deal, the companies will share their tech experience and vision, provide mutual consulting on their blockchain solutions, and jointly develop and integrate related technologies.</p><p>The parties are especially interested in applying the <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">Decentralized Identity Solution (DeID)</a> developed by Ontology, in a <a href="https://we.vote/">blockchain-based e-voting system</a> recently launched by Waves Enterprise.</p><p>Voting technologies similar to those used in Waves Enterprise’s online voting service were tested and applied in an e-voting system developed for the Russian Central Election Commission by Rostelecom and Waves Enterprise during the single voting day in the Russian Federation, when more than 30,000 people took part in voting. This system employed the Russian unified identification and authentication system to identify users, which is centralized and not available to corporate users.</p><p>User authentication and identification are weak points of any e-voting system, even if it is fully implemented on a blockchain and utilizes advanced encryption. Together, the companies will explore how to integrate DID technologies into the voting service so that corporate users can seamlessly use and benefit from a fully decentralized approach.</p><p>“To implement and launch the voting process in some types of legal entities, we need to integrate our e-voting platform with KYC service providers, since trusted user authentication and verification is an essential requirement.

  <p>Almost any web app needs some sort of access control, usually implemented by user login. Choosing how user authentication is implemented depends on the type of application and its audience. In this post, I want to show you a few different ways of creating a login feature in a single-page React application using Okta.</p>

<p>I will start with a login redirect. This is the easiest option to implement and is a good choice for some use cases. On the other hand, hosting the login form inside the application can provide a more seamless user experience. The Okta Sign-In Widget can be used as a simple out-of-the-box login form. To have more control over the appearance of the user login, you can also implement your own form and use Okta’s authentication service to verify the user’s credentials.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, I will assume that you are familiar with JavaScript and have some knowledge of React. You should have Node and <code>npm</code> installed on your system.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node 14</a> 
   <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">Okta CLI 0.7.1+</a> (optional)

   <a>Create a React Application for Login</a> 
   <a>Register an OpenID Connect App for Authentication</a> 
   <a>Add React Login with Redirection</a> 
   <a>Use the Okta Sign-In Widget for Login</a> 
   <a>Create Your Own Login Form</a> 
   <a>Learn More About React and Authentication</a> 
 

 Create a React Application for Login 

<p>Now you are ready to create the React application. Open a terminal in a folder of your choice and run <code>npx</code>, the Node.js Package Runner included with npm.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app react-login
</code>   

<p>This will create a new React project in the folder <code>react-login</code> and set up all the necessary build infrastructure. Now, navigate into the new directory and install the React router.</p>

   <code>cd react-login
npm install -E react-router-dom@5.2.0
</code>   

<p>The router manages the browser routes and maps them to React components. You will be creating two routes for now. The first route is the homepage of the application. The second route represents a restricted area that should only be available to users that are logged in.</p>

<p>Open an editor of your choice in the project and create a file <code>src/Home.js</code>. Paste the code below into the new file.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Home() {
  return (
    &lt;div className="page"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Login with React&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;Link to="/private"&gt;
        &lt;button type="button"&gt;
          Visit Restricted Page
        &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>This is a simple page containing a button that links to a restricted page. The <code>Link</code> component is part of the router and allows you to declare links to different parts of the application. Similarly, create a file <code>src/Private.js</code> and paste the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

function Private() {
  return (
    &lt;div className="page"&gt;
      &lt;div className="warning"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Restricted Access&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Authorized Personnel Only&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default Private;
</code>   

<p>Every good application needs a header bar. Create another file <code>src/Header.js</code>. Add the code below into the file.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Header() {
  return (
    &lt;header&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;React Login&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;ul className="menu"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;Link to="/"&gt;Home&lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;Link to="/private"&gt;Private&lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
  );
}

export default Header;
</code>   

<p>Next, open the existing <code>src/App.js</code>. This is the main component of the application. Edit the contents to match the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Header from './Header';
import Home from './Home';
import Private from './Private';
import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;div className="page"&gt;
        &lt;div className="content"&gt;
          &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
             &lt;Header/&gt;
             &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home}/&gt;
             &lt;Route path='/private' exact={true} component={Private}/&gt;
          &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>You can see the <code>BrowserRouter</code> component containing the routes for the home page and the private page. It also contains the <code>Header</code> component. This component is not a separate route, but it must be contained within the <code>BrowserRouter</code> in order for the router links within the header to work. The application still needs some styling. Open <code>src/App.css</code> and replace its contents with the CSS code below.</p>

   <code>.App header {
  background-color: #282c34;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  color: white;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

ul.menu {
  list-style: none;
}

ul.menu li {
  display: inline;
  padding: 12px;
}

ul.menu a {
  color: #ffffff;
}

.page {
  text-align: center;
}

button {
  background-color: #6200ee;
  color: #ffffff;
  border: none;
  padding: 12px 16px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-weight: bold;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #3700b3;
}

.warning {
  width: 800px;
  margin: 24px auto;
  border: 5px solid #ff0000;
  border-radius: 15px;
}

.warning h1 {
  margin-top: 0;
  color: white;
  font-size: 48px;
  line-height: 96px;
  background-color: #ff0000;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

.warning h2 {
  font-size: 36px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
</code>   

<p>This completes the basic application. You can test it by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>This should build the JavaScript code and then automatically open your browser at <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. You will see the home page and when you click the Visit Restricted Page button, you will be taken to the restricted page. At this point, anybody could see the restricted page. No user authentication has been added so far.</p>

<p></p>

 Register an OpenID Connect App for Authentication 

<p>Before you add a login feature, you need to sign up for a free Okta developer account. If you haven’t already got one, go to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">developer.okta.com</a>, click Sign Up, and follow the sign-up procedure. Once completed, you can log in to the Developer Console.</p>

<p>TIP: You can also create an account and register apps using the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli#readme">Okta CLI</a> with the <code>okta register</code> and <code>okta apps create</code> commands.</p>

<p>In your Okta Development Console, select Applications from the top menu and click Add Application. Next, select Single-Page App and click Next. You now see a form with application settings. You can give the application any name of your choice. Both the Base URI and the Logout redirect URI should be changed to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>.</p>

<p>You will be testing the application using the React development server that listens on port 3000 on your local machine. For production, you would of course change this to the URI of the production server. The Login redirect URI should be <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code>.</p>

<p>Click Done when ready. On the next page, you will see an overview of the settings as well as a Client ID. Note the ID for later when you set up your React application.</p>

 Add React Login with Redirection 

<p>The simplest way to add authentication to the app is to use Okta’s hosted login page. When users need to sign in, they are directed away from the site to a login form on the Okta servers. On success, the user is redirected back to the application. The authentication token is passed to the application, and the validity is checked. This allows the application to open up restricted content that is hidden from unauthenticated users.</p>

<p>This sort of authentication flow is ideally suited for single sign-on situations. For example, within a corporate network, a user logs in once through the central authentication provider. After that, the user has access to all applications within the corporate environment.</p>

<p>To add authentication to the application, install the Okta libraries for React by running the command below.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@4.1.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@4.4.0
</code>   

<p>The Okta React SDK has a peer dependency on Okta Auth JS, which provides most of the heavy lifting. In previous versions of the Okta React SDK, this was included as a transitive dependency. Now you have to install both packages.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/App.js</code> and import the components you’ll need from <code>okta-react</code> and <code>okta-auth-js</code> at the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
</code>   

<p>Create an <code>OktaAuth</code> instance with your settings.</p>

   <code>const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: 'https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{ClientId}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/callback'
});
</code>   

<p>Here, <code>{YourOktaDomain}</code> is the Okta developer domain that you can find on your Okta dashboard. <code>{ClientId}</code> is the ID that was generated earlier when you registered the application with the Okta service.</p>

<p>If you created an app with the Okta CLI, the values you need to specify for the <code>issuer</code> and <code>clientId</code> are printed out for you. For example:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133320.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oa5qedkihI7QcSoi357
</code>   

<p>Modify the elements within the <code>BrowserRouter</code> component to match the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
  &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth}&gt;
    &lt;Header/&gt;
    &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home}/&gt;
    &lt;SecureRoute path='/private' exact={true} component={Private}/&gt;
    &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
  &lt;/Security&gt;
&lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
</code>   

<p>You can see that the routes are now all contained within the <code>Security</code> component. This component makes the authentication service available to all its children. The <code>SecureRoute</code> component replaces <code>Route</code> for components that require authentication. You will also notice a new route on the <code>/callback</code> path. The <code>LoginCallback</code> component attached to this route handles the callback from the Okta servers once the user has logged on successfully.</p>

<p>This is already enough to require authentication whenever the user wants to see the restricted page. To see how the authentication service can be used to create context-dependent content, open <code>src/Header.js</code>. Add the following import to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
</code>   

<p>Next, add code to create a sign-in or logout button depending on the current status. The <code>Header()</code> function should be modified to match the following.</p>

   <code>function Header() {
 const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

  const login = () =&gt; { oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect(); }
  const logout = () =&gt; { oktaAuth.signOut(); }

  const userText = authState.isAuthenticated
    ? &lt;button onClick={ logout }&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
    : &lt;button onClick={ login }&gt;Sign In&lt;/button&gt;;

  return (
    &lt;header&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;React Login&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;ul className="menu"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;Link to="/"&gt;Home&lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;Link to="/private"&gt;Private&lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      {userText}
    &lt;/header&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Run <code>npm start</code> again to test your application. Now, when you click on VISIT RESTRICTED PAGE, you will be first taken to the sign-in page on your Okta domain. If you don’t see a login form like the one below, it’s likely because you’re already logged in. Once you have signed in, you will be redirected to the protected page.</p>

<p></p>

 Use the Okta Sign-In Widget for Login 

<p>Redirecting the user to an Okta-hosted login page is appropriate in many situations. But sometimes you want to keep the user on your site without redirecting them to a server that they might not recognize. This is probably true for most public-facing web applications where you want to reach as many users as possible and reducing perceived barriers is important. The Okta Sign-In Widget allows you to embed the same user experience of the external login page into your website. To start, install the widget library using the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-signin-widget@5.1.4
</code>   

<p>The Sign-In Widget does not come packaged as a React component. Instead, it comes as a JavaScript class that can be attached to a plain DOM element. To be able to use the widget, you need to wrap it inside a React component. Create a new file <code>src/OktaSignInWidget.js</code> and paste the following code into it.</p>

   <code>import React, { Component } from 'react';
import OktaSignIn from '@okta/okta-signin-widget';
import '@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-sign-in.min.css';

export default class OktaSignInWidget extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.wrapper = React.createRef();
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.widget = new OktaSignIn({
      baseUrl: this.props.baseUrl
    });
    this.widget.renderEl({el: this.wrapper.current}, this.props.onSuccess, this.props.onError);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.widget.remove();
  }

  render() {
    return &lt;div ref={this.wrapper} /&gt;;
  }
};
</code>   

<p>I am using a class component here because it makes it easier to perform actions during the component’s lifecycle. The <code>wrapper</code> property is a React reference to the wrapper div for the widget. When the component is displayed, the <code>OktaSignIn</code> object is created and attached to the wrapper. The component expects three properties <code>onSuccess</code>, <code>onError</code>, and <code>baseUrl</code>.  <code>onSuccess()</code> and <code>onError()</code> are callbacks that will be called when the login has been successful or when an error occurred. The property <code>baseUrl</code> is the URL of your application.</p>

<p>The <code>OktaSignInWidget</code> component can be used on a login page. Create a new file <code>src/Login.js</code>. Paste the code below into the file. Make sure you change <code>{YourOktaDomain}</code> to match your Okta domain.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import OktaSignInWidget from './OktaSignInWidget';

function Login() {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

  const onSuccess = function(res) {
    if (res.status === 'SUCCESS') {
      return oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect({
        sessionToken: res.session.token
      });
    }
  }

  const onError = function(err) {
    console.log('error logging in', err);
  }

  return authState.isAuthenticated ?
    &lt;Redirect to={{ pathname: '/' }}/&gt; :
    &lt;OktaSignInWidget
      baseUrl='https://{YourOktaDomain}'
      onSuccess={onSuccess}
      onError={onError}/&gt;;
}

export default Login;
</code>   

<p>The <code>Login</code> component obtains the authentication state and the <code>oktaAuth</code> instance through a call to <code>useOktaAuth()</code>. It then defines the <code>onSuccess</code> and <code>onError</code> callbacks. <code>onSuccess</code> checks the result of the sign-in and sets the session token on the authentication service. By calling the <code>signInWithRedirect()</code> method, the page is redirected to whatever page the user wanted to navigate before the login page showed.</p>

<p>The component returned by the <code>Login</code> function depends on the authentication state. If the user is authenticated, the component will redirect the user back to the home page. Otherwise, the <code>OktaSignInWidget</code> is shown.</p>

<p>To make the application redirect the user to the login page when they try to access a protected route, you need to split up the main application. Extract the <code>Security</code> component and all its children into a separate component by creating a new file <code>src/SecuredApp.js</code>. Add the following code into this file and change the <code>{...}</code> placeholders to match your settings.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Home from './Home';
import Login from './Login';
import Private from './Private';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router';
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: 'https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{ClientId}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/callback'
});

function SecuredApp() {
  const history = useHistory();

  const onAuthRequired = function() {
    history.push('/login')
  }

  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} onAuthRequired={onAuthRequired} &gt;
      &lt;Header /&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home}/&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/login' exact={true} component={Login}/&gt;
      &lt;SecureRoute path='/private' component={Private}/&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
}

export default SecuredApp;
</code>   

<p>Because you want to redirect the user to a custom route whenever authentication is required, you need to pass a function to the <code>onAuthRequired</code> property of the <code>Security</code> component. This function simply pushes the <code>/login</code> route into the router’s history.</p>

<p>Now you can see the reason for splitting the component out into a separate file. The <code>useHistory()</code> function is only available in components that are contained within the <code>BrowserRouter</code> component. This means that it is not available in the main <code>App</code> component and must be separated out.</p>

<p>The main application component can now be simplified. Edit <code>src/App.js</code> to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import SecuredApp from './SecuredApp';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;div className="page"&gt;
        &lt;div className="content"&gt;
          &lt;Router&gt;
            &lt;SecuredApp/&gt;
          &lt;/Router&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>This renders the <code>SecuredApp</code> component within the router. Now run the application again with the following command.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>Now, when you try to navigate to the Private page you will be presented with a sign-in form that is rendered within your React application. The form has the same look and feel as the sign-in form on the Okta servers. If you don’t see the login form, open <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in an incognito window.</p>

<p></p>

 Create Your Own Login Form 

<p>Sometimes it is useful to implement a sign-in form that seamlessly integrates with your website’s design and style. The widget provided by <code>OktaSignIn</code> can be styled using CSS but in some circumstances, this might not be enough. With only a little extra code, you can create your own login form. All you need to do is change the <code>OktaSignInWidget</code> to render its own form and handle the sign-in.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/OktaSignInWidget.js</code> and replace the contents with the code below. Make sure to replace the <code>{ClientId}</code> placeholder.</p>

   <code>import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { withOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

class OktaSignInWidget extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      sessionToken: null,
      email: '',
      password: ''
    };

    this.oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
      issuer: props.baseUrl,
      clientId: '{ClientId}',
      pkce: true
    });

    this.handleEmailChange = this.handleEmailChange.bind(this);
    this.handlePasswordChange = this.handlePasswordChange.bind(this);
    this.signIn = this.signIn.bind(this);
  }

  handleEmailChange(event) {
    this.setState({email: event.target.value});
  }

  handlePasswordChange(event) {
    this.setState({password: event.target.value});
  }

  async signIn(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const transaction = await this.oktaAuth.signIn({
      username: this.state.email,
      password: this.state.password
    });

    if (transaction.status === 'SUCCESS') {
      this.props.oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect({sessionToken: transaction.sessionToken})
    } else {
      throw new Error('Could not sign in: ' + transaction.status);
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;form onSubmit={this.signIn} className="login-form"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Log In&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Please login to continue&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;label className="full-width-input"&gt;
          Email
          &lt;input type="text" placeholder="Email" value={this.state.email} onChange={this.handleEmailChange} required /&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;label className="full-width-input"&gt;
          Password
          &lt;input type="password" placeholder="Password" value={this.state.password} onChange={this.handlePasswordChange} required autoComplete="off" /&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;button className="button"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    );
  }
};

export default withOktaAuth(OktaSignInWidget);
</code>   

<p>You will notice a number of differences compared to the implementation in the previous section. First, the <code>render()</code> function now returns its own form with Email and Password input elements. The functions <code>handleEmailChange()</code> and <code>handlePasswordChange()</code> update the components state, always reflecting the value in the input fields.</p>

<p>In the constructor, you will see that an <code>OktaAuth</code> object is created and assigned to the <code>oktaAuth</code> property. This object is used inside the <code>signIn()</code> function, which is called when the form is submitted. <code>OktaAuth</code> is responsible for connecting to the Okta servers, sending the user credentials, and in return, receiving a session token.</p>

<p>The last thing you will notice is the fact that the <code>OktaSignInWidget</code> class is wrapped in the <code>withOktaAuth()</code> function before being exported. This adds the <code>authService</code> to the properties of the object. Remember, this widget is rendered within the <code>Security</code> widget. Inside the <code>signIn()</code> function the <code>authService</code> is used to set the application’s session token and redirect the user to the protected page they wanted to visit before the sign-in was triggered.</p>

<p>To round things out, add a bit of styling for the login form. Open <code>src/App.css</code> and paste the following code at the end of the file.</p>

   <code>.login-form {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 20em;
}

.full-width-input {
  display: block;
  text-align: right;
}

.full-width-input input {
  width: 12em;
  padding: 4px 8px;
  margin: 4px 8px;
  border: 1px solid #aaaaaa;
  border-radius: 0;
}
</code>   

<p>Start the application again by running <code>npm start</code>. Now, try to navigate to the protected page and you should see a login form that looks like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Congratulations! If you have made it this far, you now have the knowledge to implement the right sign-in solution for your React application.</p>

 Learn More About React and Authentication 

<p>In this tutorial, I have shown you three ways to implement authentication in your React application. The easiest of these three options redirects the user to a hosted sign-in page on the Okta servers. While this is a perfectly good solution in many situations, you sometimes want to host the login form on your own servers. The Okta sign-in widget lets you embed the trusted login form on your own site. If you want a sign-in form with your layout and design, you can use the <code>OktaAuth</code> class to send the username and password directly to the Okta servers for validation.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for this example in <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-login-example">the oktadeveloper/okta-react-login-example repository</a> on GitHub.</p>

  <p>As the buzz around Artificial Intelligence has increased, so have the issues around trust. There is an increasing polarisation in the discourse around AI, ADS and automation. So what can you do as a tech leader or employee in a company utilising tech, to build trust? Or much more to the point, what can you do to become trustworthy?</p>
<p>An important step is to communicate honestly with your customers and stakeholders about the technology you use. However too often organisations fall at the first hurdle due to the damaging visual misrepresentations of AI that accompany their written communications, promotional material or media coverage. This session investigates the way that organisations and the media represent AI through images, and what this says about what they and customers expect and understand about the benefits of technology. We look at how this exposes the broader implications of anthropomorphising technology, and how to deal with describing the role of humans and human agency in your solutions.</p>
<p>As well as exploring how public perceptions of AI will shape the risks and opportunities faced by your organisation, you will leave this session with some practical suggestions on earning and building trust in your AI solutions, and helping to imagine a more positive AI future.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybernetixworld2020_2020_11_25_cetin_duarte"></a>

<p><a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC) is a hugely popular user authentication and identity protocol on the web today. It enables relying parties to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience.</p><p>In typical deployments of OpenID Connect today, in order for a user to be able to exercise the identity they have with a relying party, the relying party must be in direct contact with what’s known as the OpenID Provider (OP). OpenID Providers are responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties. This effectively means that an OpenID Provider is the Identity Provider (IdP) of the&nbsp;user.</p>In today’s OpenID Connect implementations, the Identity Provider mediates on behalf of the&nbsp;user<p>It’s the reason we often see buttons that say “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook” during the login journey in an application or service. The website or application you want to use must first authenticate who you are with a provider like Google or Facebook which controls and manages that identity on your behalf. In this context we can think of the IdP as the “man in the middle.” This relationship prevents users from having a portable digital identity which they can use across different contexts and denies users any practical control over their identity. It also makes it incredibly easy for IdPs like Google or Facebook to track what users are doing, because the “man in the middle” can gather metadata about user behavior with little agency over how this identity data is shared and&nbsp;used.</p><p>In order to allow users to have practical control over their identity, we need a new approach.</p><p>Introducing <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, an extension to OpenID Connect which enables the end-user to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a digital wallet. This specification defines how an OpenID Provider can be extended beyond being the provider of simple identity assertions into being the provider of credentials, effectively turning these Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p>OIDC Credential Provider allows the user to manage their own credentials<p>To maximize the reuse of existing infrastructure that’s deployed today, OIDC Credential Provider extends the core OpenID Connect protocol, maintaining the original design and intent of OIDC while enhancing it without breaking any of its assumptions or requirements.</p><p>Instead of using OIDC to provide simple identity assertions directly to the relying party, we can leverage OIDC to offer a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) which is cryptographically bound to a digital wallet of the end-users choice. The digital wallet plays the role of the OpenID Client application which is responsible for interacting with the OpenID Provider and manages the cryptographic key material (both public and private keys) used to prove ownership of the credential. The credentials issued to the wallet are re-provable and reusable for the purposes of authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-related information by providers and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the user-controlled “wallet” layer between issuers and relying&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Essentially, a wallet makes a request to an OpenID provider in order to obtain a credential, and then receives the credential back into their wallet so they can later use it to prove their identity to relying parties. The interaction consists of three main&nbsp;steps:</p>  The Client sends a signed credential request to the OpenID Provider with their public&nbsp;key  The OpenID Provider authenticates and authorizes the End-User to access the credential  The OpenID Provider responds to the Client with the issued&nbsp;VC  <p>In this new flow, the credential request extends the typical OpenID Connect request in that it expresses the intent to ask for something beyond the identity token of a typical OIDC flow. Practically, what this means is that the client uses a newly defined scope to indicate the intent of the request. The Client also extends the standard OIDC Request object to add cryptographic key material and proof of possession of that key material so that the credential can be bound to the wallet requesting it. Though the credential can be bound to a public key by default, it can also support different binding mechanisms, e.g. the credential can optionally be bound to a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifer</a> (DID). In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user.</p><p>The request can also indicate the format of the requested credential and even ask for specific claims present within the credential. This is designed to allow multiple credential formats to be used within the OIDC&nbsp;flow.</p><p>On the provider side, OpenID Connect Providers are able to advertise which capabilities they support within the OIDC ecosystem using OpenID Connect Provider Metadata. This approach extends the metadata to support additional fields that express support for binding to DIDs, for issuing VCs, and advertising which <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a>, credential formats, credentials, and claims they are offering. This information can be utilized by the end-user’s digital wallet to help the user understand whether or not they wish to proceed with a credential request.</p><p>In order to create a way for the wallet or client to connect to the OpenID Provider, the spec also defines a URL which functions as a Credential Offer that the client can invoke in order to retrieve and understand the types of credential being offered by the provider. The client registers the ‘openid’ URI scheme in order to be able to understand and render the offer to the user so they can make an informed decision.</p><p>The sum of these changes means that OpenID Connect can allow users to have a portable digital identity credential that’s actually under their control, creating an opportunity for greater agency in digital interactions as well as preventing identity providers from being able to easily track user behavior. The OpenID Connect Credential Provider <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">specification</a> is in the process of being contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item at the A/B Working Group, where it will continue to be developed by the community behind OpenID&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>MATTR is pleased to announce that our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/extensions/oidc-bridge">OIDC Bridge Platform Extension</a> now uses OIDC Credential Provider under the hood to facilitate issuing credentials with OpenID Connect. OIDC Bridge hides the complexity associated with setting up infrastructure for credential issuance and simply requires configuration of a standard OpenID Provider. We also simplify the process of verifying credentials issued over OIDC Credential Provider by allowing the wallet to respond to requests, present credentials, and prove ownership and integrity of their credentials via&nbsp;OIDC.</p>OIDC Bridge is an Extension to the MATTR&nbsp;Platform<p>This new set of capabilities allows OpenID Providers greater flexibility around which claims end up in a credential, and allows for the support of many different credential types with a straight-forward authentication journey for end-users.</p><p>Our Mobile Wallet supports the ability to invoke credential offers using OIDC Credential Provider as well as creating credential requests and receiving credentials from an OpenID Provider.</p><p>To find out more, check out our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">tutorials</a> on MATTR Learn, read the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">spec</a>, or watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2WPwotNArI">recording</a> of our presentation on this spec from the recent Internet Identity Workshop.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">Introducing OIDC Credential Provider</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Our steps can be fearful and cautious. They can also be bold leaps made out of clear-eyed hope and raw necessity.</p><p>In this year of concurrent crises and collapses, when many ways forward seem possible, the challenge is to critically discern between pathways which wind up leading back to a broken “normal” and pathways which lead us into a future we have never seen before — one that is more equitable, just, and beautiful.<br> <br>At Omidyar Network, this kind of discernment is vital to our mission of <a href="https://omidyar.com/#focusareas">reimagining systems that shape our daily lives</a>: building an economy that works for all, realizing the promise of responsible technology, and fostering a more pluralistic society. We launched the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/exploration-and-future-sensing-ac4ef4ae302e">Exploration &amp; Future Sensing</a> unit in 2019 to help achieve this mission. Building upon years of prior experimentation, the unit peers beyond what we know and see today by scanning for signals of change, investigating emerging trends, using scenarios to shake old patterns of thinking, and activating new collaborations. <br> <br>Much of our exploration revolves around the question: When uncertainty abounds, how do we move beyond our own biases and blind spots to build a world we’ve never seen before? <br> <br>The short answer is that we turn to community. We must center people with experience living in between worlds, or on the margins, who have honed an extraordinary capacity for imagining and building futures that are more beautiful and resilient. They’re people who have crossed cultures, borders, and identities. They have learned to live in the future and navigate its uncertain terrain often out of necessity.</p><blockquote>When uncertainty abounds, how do we move beyond our own biases and blind spots to build a world we’ve never seen before? We turn to community. We must center people with experience living in between worlds or on the margins, who have honed an extraordinary capacity for imagining and building futures that are more beautiful and resilient.</blockquote><p>In the process of engaging with a variety of foresight methods, creative approaches, and practitioner communities, we’re finding a growing group of partners and collaborators who embody a new wave of future thinking for social change. Their talent for exploring alternative futures comes from asking not just what the future could hold but also who thrives in it and how we will take action to get there together. Instead of simply extrapolating from existing systems, these alternative futurists are rooted in transformative visions of equity, access, belonging, and justice.<br> <br>It’s never been more critical to support and partner with people who are thinking more courageously and hopefully about the future. Here are four such efforts Omidyar Network Exploration &amp; Future Sensing is honored to&nbsp;support.</p> Radical Imagination with Angela Glover Blackwell <p>This podcast is a window to a more equitable future where guaranteed income, reparations, and open borders, are real possibilities.</p><p>Angela Glover Blackwell doesn’t call herself a futurist. She doesn’t issue forecasts about what 2030 and 2050 will hold. Instead, she has a remarkable track record of sensing what we need today to achieve a more equitable tomorrow, and telling stories that invite more people into that new world of possibility. After founding and leading <a href="https://www.policylink.org/">PolicyLink</a> for the past 20 years, Angela launched the <a href="https://radicalimagination.us/">Radical Imagination</a> podcast. Now entering its third season, Angela features bold innovators who remind us that change is already happening. Past episodes include conversations with Chief August Creppel on climate migration; Mélisande Short-Colomb and Ana Lucia Araujo on reparations; Walidah Imarisha on storytelling and organizing; and Tiq Milan on&nbsp;gender.</p>Angela Glover Blackwell, <a href="https://www.policylink.org/">PolicyLink</a> Founder-in-Residence and host of the <a href="https://radicalimagination.us/">Radical Imagination</a> podcast.<p>The podcast has grown as a beacon this year. “We all need the hope that comes from two things,” Angela says in one episode. “First, envisioning our way out of this pandemic; and second, seeing ourselves emerge with the collective resolve and communal spirit to create a better society than the one we had when COVID-19 hit. A society that rejects fear, divisiveness, and the perverse idea that greed will save us. A society in which we all stand together and take care of one another. This isn’t daydreaming, it’s radical imagination.”</p><blockquote>“We all need the hope that comes from two things.

This isn’t daydreaming, it’s radical imagination.” — Angela Glover Blackwell</blockquote> Next Generation Foresight Practitioners <p>This network of younger future-alert activists aims to influence how foresight is done…and by&nbsp;whom.</p>The<a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/"> Next Generation Foresight Practitioners</a> Program at <a href="https://soif.org.uk/">School of International Futures</a> released their “<a href="https://soif.org.uk/blog/ngfp-futures-manifesto-covid-19/">Futures Manifesto</a>” amidst the pandemic.<p>Foresight, the practice of investigating the future, has traditionally been dominated by a relatively small group of practitioners in Western countries with long careers in foresight methodologies. The <a href="https://soif.org.uk/">School of International Futures</a>, founded by Cat Tully, is addressing this imbalance with the <a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/">Next Generation Foresight Practitioners</a> (NGFP) Program, which believes that foresight empowers all changemakers to build a better future. The program supports emerging voices across underrepresented geographies with a fellowship award; connects them to a network of future-alert activists spanning 68 countries; and amplifies their influence by partnering with critical decision-making institutions.</p><p>For example, NGFP worked on a project this year helping the World Health Organization’s Western Pacific Regional Office to identify younger people’s visions and priorities for the future beyond COVID-19. As Pupul Bisht, NGFP’s Creative Lead and Network Weaver (winner of an inaugural award in 2018), explains, “We believe that when it comes to thinking about post-pandemic futures, supporting bottom-up agenda setting is critical.”</p> Guild of Future Architects <p>This cross-disciplinary community is remixing the art and science of collaboration to build tomorrow’s systems.</p><p>What would a water cooler for a different kind of future thinking look like? That’s one of the questions that spurred Sharon Chang to create <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a>, led by Executive Director Kamal Sinclair. Unlike how future thinking is tethered to commercial or geopolitical objectives, Guild of Future Architects seeks to “make the world more beautiful for more people” and intentionally nurtures collaborations across a diverse array of disciplines to get there. Founding members include artists, technologists, writers, as well as practitioners in health, economics, and urban planning.</p><a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a> members Madebo Fatunde and Thomas DeBass hatching early concepts for Institute of African&nbsp;Futures.<p>At a recent event, teams engaged virtual audiences around <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/shared-futures/profiles">Shared Futures</a> projects incubated by the Guild, including Embodied Intelligence, a framework to help people reclaim physical agency in the age of technology and surveillance; Abundant Health, a model of health care that empowers communities to restore wellness; Institute for African Futures, a dream tank for the future of the African continent; and The Gift, a multimedia experience bridging astrophysics and social transformation. All four prototypes pointed to a future that doesn’t see today’s limitations.</p> Comuzi <p>This design studio believes minority communities must have power to shape emerging AI and algorithmic systems before harm is&nbsp;done.</p><a href="https://www.comuzi.xyz/info.html">COMUZI</a>’s Akil Benjamin, Richard Fagbolagun, and Alex<br> Fefegha.<p>Who gets to shape the future? London-based for-profit design studio <a href="https://www.comuzi.xyz/index.html">COMUZI</a> believes in a more democratic vision where minority voices have the power to influence emerging algorithmic systems rather than being erased by them. Leveraging backgrounds at the nexus of technology, design, and social justice, COMUZI’s project “Beyond Tools of Resistance” will engage community members to prototype tools for holding governments and corporations accountable as AI innovations rapidly reshape how economic safety nets, health services, and transportation systems work. <br> <br>That people should have influence over these systems should not be a radical idea, but when it comes to historically marginalized communities having that power, this thinking is often far outside of the proverbial box. “The process of petitioning and pressuring government officials for change can be very fragmented.

 The GiD Report#139 — The landmark antitrust case against FB, Visa + Circle/USDC is a big&nbsp;deal <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-138-the-age-of-antitrust-stripe-is-windows-for-fintech-b5dcfbf5da5d">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Well — a LOT went down this last&nbsp;week:</p>  The landmark antitrust case against&nbsp;FB  Don’t expect it to be a&nbsp;panacea  Why the real solution is always innovation/competition  Visa + Circle’s stablecoin USDC is a big&nbsp;deal  Why porn is suddenly taking identity so seriously  This week in credentials  Stuff happens   1. Make no mistake, last week’s lawsuits against Facebook were a landmark moment in American antitrust history. <p>As Greg Kidd noted, this is “the big&nbsp;one.”</p><p>It’s been a long time coming—and how quickly the tide has turned. Not five years ago, Big Tech was still the bell of the ball. Today, you’d be hard pressed to find a Facebook defender. Regulators have turned — both federal and state. So have the public at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Last week’s lawsuits included not only the FTC but also now 48 state attorney generals. In a time of intense social and political division, such comprehensive consensus speaks&nbsp;volumes.</p><p>As Kara Swisher opined, Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/opinion/facebook-antitrust-ftc.html">has become a&nbsp;menace</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-e9f50136-c3c3-49f4-a786-7adb44ce3e8e.html">the latest from&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Both the Federal Trade Commission and the states want to break up Facebook, not just reform its practices. This wasn’t a given, or inevitable. The FTC also wants the court to require Facebook to seek approval for future acquisitions, going beyond what’s already required under&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook’s moves to freeze out competitors raised antitrust alarms. The FTC argues that Facebook limited third-party software developers’ access to its platform in anticompetitive ways and cut off firms it perceived as&nbsp;threats.</blockquote><blockquote>Privacy, regulators now say, is a competition concern. The states’ lawsuit mentions privacy dozens of times, arguing that Facebook surveils its users and that its monopolistic practices have reduced the “quality and variety of privacy options and content” available to the public. The states also argue that WhatsApp started as a privacy-focused app and Facebook has slowly eroded its privacy protections.</blockquote><p>Also, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-ftc-facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-is-important-2020-12">BI</a>:</p><blockquote>What the lawsuits really represent, experts said, is an indication that the government will no longer look the other way when it comes to how Facebook operates.</blockquote><blockquote>“Every acquisition they try to make from here on will be met with such a level of inspection and skepticism associated with it,” one expert told Business&nbsp;Insider.</blockquote><p>Notable that this stance is not just limited to Big Tech and Facebook if the ongoing Visa/Plaid situation is any indication.</p><p>Greg outlined his take on Twitter. On <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1337458090036215808">the lawsuits</a>:</p><p>You can and do need to turn back the clock when it comes to anti-competitive behavior that destroys #innovation and user rights to their own&nbsp;data.</p>Photo: Anthony&nbsp;Quintano<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1337798851676184577">Facebook and&nbsp;privacy</a>:</p><blockquote>#Facebook’s pattern of bogus privacy claims are simply a cover for a pattern of anti-competitive behavior and misuse of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (#CFAA).” Users should be able to view their own data however they see fit to authorize.</blockquote><p>The thing is — this fight isn’t new nor are Facebook’s anti-competitive tactics, of which those who have been on the short end of the sticks have been keenly aware, as Greg&nbsp;points:</p><blockquote>46 states are now following up on the same grounds as our portfolio company</blockquote><blockquote>@LenddoEFL — which sued #Facebook over anti-competitive blocks to #API access that deny users access to and control of their own data. Original filing: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4otqucr">https://tinyurl.com/y4otqucr</a></blockquote><p>Of course, those at the short end of the stick continue to expand in numbers. <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-end-of-the-facebook-crime-spree?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzEzNiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MjQxODIyMDUsIl8iOiJRd3ZzbCIsImlhdCI6MTYwNzYwNzY2NiwiZXhwIjoxNjA3NjExMjY2LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTE1MjQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.q1ETVKKVDGsLqOK5u02PwT43TUuO7R4kGQZSEHX43aY">Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>So what changed? Well, we made the case for the rule of law. Many people were involved, like Jeff Chester, who opposed the Instagram and WhatsApp mergers at the time. The list of people who sought to address the harms of Facebook grew every year I was paying attention, and I started paying attention closely in 2013. Just in terms of what we did and Facebook’s reaction, we wrote, researched, and advocated against monopolization, and Facebook in particular. For one shareholder meeting, we hired an airplane to draw in in the sky outside of Facebook’s shareholder the slogan “You broke democracy.”</blockquote><blockquote>In response, Facebook hired a company to investigate us, and then tried to smear us in the press as anti-semites in an attempt to undermine our arguments. We were no strangers to retribution by powerful monopolists, and we aren’t the only ones that Facebook sought to target. I suspect they regularly go after many people. I mean, just before the election, Facebook sued NYU researchers trying to study how its political ad targeting worked after its ad archive ‘accidentally’ malfunctioned. This kind of dirty stuff is routine, it’s a business in Washington, D.C., and increasingly Brussels. It’s the crust of corruption protecting the slime of monopoly.</blockquote> 2. But don’t get it twisted. It would be naive to assume antitrust regulation to be some sort of panacea to widespread problems that the Facebook monopoly symbolizes. <p>For one, experts <a href="http://4ce3e8e.html">question the long term effectiveness</a> of legal action on its&nbsp;own:</p><blockquote>The FTC and states have to prove that rejecting Facebook’s acquisitions would have made life better for consumers and increased industry competition — a tough case to make, legal experts told&nbsp;Axios.</blockquote><blockquote>The court will be looking at whether the acquisition of WhatsApp, for instance, was lawful when it occurred in 2012, not whether it would be lawful now, said Kristen Limarzi, a partner at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher and former chief of the appellate section of the DOJ antitrust division.</blockquote><blockquote>One hurdle for the FTC is “that they reviewed the transaction and cleared it,” she said. “Their suit depends on admitting they made a mistake in&nbsp;2012.”</blockquote><blockquote>It’s not common for the FTC to try to undo previous acquisitions, but it has happened, said Jeffrey Jacobovitz, a partner at Arnall Golden Gregory and former antitrust attorney at the FTC. He called the FTC suit “super aggressive.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-ftc-facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-is-important-2020-12">And</a>:</p><blockquote>Wall Street analysts told Business Insider’s Martin Coulter that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-antitrust-lawsuits-wall-street-breakup-instagram-whatsapp-2020-12?r=kc-sub">the lawsuit might not actually have legs to hold up in court</a>, and a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp is unlikely to happen, Lightman&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“If you break them up now, are you going to give them a refund check?” Lightman said. There are so many integrated assets, from engineers and executives to user data, so the question is how does that even begin to be unraveled, according to Lightman.</blockquote><blockquote>Experts said what the lawsuit really represents is being part of a series of governmental actions signaling the broader consensus that the industry needs oversight.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s time to take all of these companies seriously, both in terms of the incredible benefits they’ve provided to our economy, to the marketplace of ideas and to our personal lives, but also the problems that they pose for those same things,” Dinielli&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Rather than the end, it’s just the beginning.</p> 3. Instead these latest actions serve as one part of a multi-pronged campaign. Another prong will be innovation and competition. <p>Like Matt Stoller, I also started paying attention to Facebook nearly a decade ago when I was still covering Wall Street and Big Tech for VICE/Motherboard (before setting my sights on a nascent thing called Bitcoin). That beat eventually culminated into <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pggg3z/what-happened-to-the-facebook-killer-it-s-complicated">an investigative longread about Diaspora</a> (an open source, decentralized social network), at the time, the most successful Kickstarter project on the platform.</p><p>Even as early as 2010, Facebook had already soiled its reputation:</p><blockquote>Since it launched, as Facebook made tweaks to privacy settings — with the presumption that privacy standards were changing — users were largely kept out of the loop, learning of privacy abuses after the fact. They were like the proverbial frog in the pot of water, slowly coming to a boil. The frog jumps out if the heat’s turned up too fast. But if it’s turned up gradually, the frog never notices, and stays in the water until it boils. Except the anecdote is fallacious. Most of the time, the frog&nbsp;notices.</blockquote><blockquote>In February of 2010, at the height of Facebook’s run-in with the public’s trust, a law professor named Eben Moglen delivered a public lecture at NYU titled “Freedom in the Cloud.” “The human race has susceptibility to harm, but Mr. Zuckerberg has attained an unenviable record: he has done more harm to the human race than anybody else his age,” Moglen declared, and outlined the dubious contract the connected world was entering into with Facebook. “Namely, ‘I will give you free web hosting and some PHP doodads and you get spying for free all the time.’ And it works. That’s the sad part, it&nbsp;works.”</blockquote><p>Enter Diaspora:</p><blockquote>The idea was simple. Build a decentralized, open source version of Facebook for the Freedom Box. Own your data. Own your social network. No Mark Zuckerberg. No need for real names. Just the people. Hoping to raise some funds for what was supposed to be a summer distraction, the team posted their idea on then little-known microfinance site, Kickstarter, with an unfussy target of $10,000. They called it Diaspora*, which fit the project’s decentralizing aims nicely. From the Greek διασπορά, “scattering, dispersion,” it’s “the movement, migration, or scattering of people away from an established or ancestral homeland” or “people dispersed by whatever cause to more than one location.”</blockquote><p>TL;DR — Diaspora didn’t work out (in tragic fashion). Here’s what Bram Cohen, creator of BitTorrent, told me at the&nbsp;time:</p><blockquote>To Cohen, guru of p2p, Diaspora isn’t just cumbersome: it’s deeply flawed. And it’s not something we really need at the moment. “There may be room for a form of social networking somewhere between email and Facebook,” he wrote in an email. “It can’t just be a verbatim copy of Facebook though, it would need some rethinking.” And a big part of it is timing. All of this is relatively brand new and a solution like Facebook in its current form still has much to offer. “I think it’s a good idea to wait for things to get more mature before trying to build something less&nbsp;agile.”</blockquote><p>And that’s essentially how things played out. Facebook’s centralized and integrated approach to the world still had much to offer — and when its influence started to wane, they deftly picked up the hottest new kids on the block in Instagram and WhatsApp, extending its ascent and&nbsp;power.</p><p>As Bram keenly pointed out, Diaspora was ahead of its time. A lot has happened since then. The Facebook platform, IG and WhatsApp in tow, is fully matured. We’ve seen the rise of Bitcoin and crypto and blockchain — open source, decentralized projects with builtin mechanisms for financing and consequently, economic sustainability.</p><p>Which brings us to the next prong. New approaches that leverage the innovation we’ve experienced the last decade and a more populace, one that now expects and demands&nbsp;more.</p><p>So the legal fight is important. But what will really pave the road to a better future is actually building the solutions that take us there and compete with a status quo that is clearly failing&nbsp;us.</p><p>What’s cool is that it’s already happening.</p><p>(It’s one reason why Libra — or Diem as it’s now called — is core to Facebook’s long term strategy. Mark Zuckerberg, too, can see where this is&nbsp;going.)</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>— <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/once-again-facebook-using-privacy-sword-kill-independent-innovation">Once Again, Facebook Is Using Privacy As A Sword To Kill Independent Innovation</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>—<a href="https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/facebook-sued-for-shutting-out-competition/">Facebook Sued for Shutting Out Competition — Tech</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a>+ <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/u-s-government-calls-breakup-facebook-n1250588">FTC sues to break up Facebook, sell off assets like Instagram and&nbsp;WhatsApp</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebooks-big-risk-from-antitrust-suit-is-losing-whatsapp">Facebook’s Big Risk from Antitrust Suit is Losing&nbsp;WhatsApp</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-antitrust-suits-surprises-c3af3e8a-1ed9-4d48-a264-60b3eeaed895.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">Surprises in the Facebook antitrust lawsuits</a>  Matt Stoller: <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-end-of-the-facebook-crime-spree?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzEzNiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MjQxODIyMDUsIl8iOiJRd3ZzbCIsImlhdCI6MTYwNzYwNzY2NiwiZXhwIjoxNjA3NjExMjY2LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTE1MjQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.q1ETVKKVDGsLqOK5u02PwT43TUuO7R4kGQZSEHX43aY">The End of the Facebook Crime&nbsp;Spree</a>  <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_2020121[%E2%80%A6]9e6b273&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">Dealbook on&nbsp;Facebook</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-e9f50136-c3c3-49f4-a786-7adb44ce3e8e.html">Facebook faces the&nbsp;law</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/five-tech-giants-facebook-google-antitrust-pentopoly-83a64bb3-024e-4918-b167-691d1a3df2e1.html">Tech’s “pentopoly” will make antitrust cases harder to&nbsp;win</a>  <blockquote><a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-giants-new-gatekeepers-1548976974-25f26494-a67c-4252-9c18-418588f8de06.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Tech giants are the new gatekeepers</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-giants-crisis-life-cycles-14c079f0-418d-4583-a032-0130d06c5d6a.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Tech giants’ life cycles shape their crisis responses</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-amazon-apple-google-ceos-techs-big-four-big-contrasts-b189f4b0-9b6f-4486-9272-41e4c9bcc068.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">For tech’s big four, big contrasts</a></blockquote>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-lawsuit-by-federal-trade-commission-state-attorneys-general-11607543139">Facebook Hit With Antitrust Lawsuits by FTC, State Attorneys General</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/opinion/facebook-antitrust-ftc.html">When it Comes to Facebook, the Need for Action Has Been Obvious for a Long&nbsp;Time</a>  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-ftc-facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-is-important-2020-12">Experts say the antitrust suits against Facebook may not change anything, but they’re still a ‘big deal’ and signal that the US government will no longer look the other&nbsp;way</a>  <p>Also in antitrust:</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/u-s-sues-to-block-p-g-s-deal-for-women-s-razor-brand-billie">U.S. Sues to Block P&amp;G’s Deal for Women’s Razor Brand&nbsp;Billie</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-seeks-to-join-justice-department-antitrust-case-against-google-11607719192">California Seeks to Join Justice Department Antitrust Case Against&nbsp;Google</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/china-fines-alibaba-tencent-for-flouting-rules-in-past-deals">China Fines Alibaba, Tencent Unit Under Anti-Monopoly Laws</a>  <p>Also in competition:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://www.axios.com/whatsapp-apple-privacy-label-requirements-cc0d5edd-ab2f-4549-b9d7-ea3c97184056.html">WhatsApp goes after Apple over new privacy label requirements</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://www.axios.com/frenemies-facebook-and-apple-square-off-5f60467f-2a2a-4a27-8bd1-f3e1522887a5.html">Frenemies Facebook and Apple square&nbsp;off</a>   4. Speaking of Facebook and Diem, Visa moving into the stablecoin space with the help of Circle is a big&nbsp;deal. <p>First <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/12/02/visa-partners-with-ethereum-digital-dollar-startup-that-raised-271-million/?sh=3af6d3e44b1f">the news from&nbsp;Forbes</a>:</p><blockquote>Credit card giant Visa today announced it is connecting its global payments network of 60 million merchants to the U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC) developed by Circle Internet Financial on the ethereum blockchain. The digital currency is now valued at $2.9&nbsp;billion.</blockquote><blockquote>While Visa itself won’t custody the digital currency, effective immediately, the partnership will see Circle working with Visa to help select Visa credit card issuers start integrating the USDC software into their platforms and send and receive USDC payments. Circle itself is also going through the same Fast Track program. In turn, businesses will eventually be able to send international USDC payments to any business supported by Visa, and after those funds are converted to the national currency, spend them anywhere that accepts&nbsp;Visa.</blockquote><p>How Visa sees&nbsp;it:</p><blockquote>“We continue to think of Visa as a network of networks,” says Sheffield, a five-year veteran of Visa, who took over as head of crypto last June. “Blockchain networks and stablecoins, like USDC, are just additional networks. So we think that there’s a significant value that Visa can provide to our clients, enabling them to access them and enabling them to spend at our merchants.”</blockquote><p>Why it’s a big&nbsp;deal:</p><blockquote>Visa estimates that $120 trillion in payments annually are made using checks and instant wire transfers, costing as much as $50 each, regardless of the size of the transaction. Since USDC settles on the ethereum blockchain, transactions can close in a little a[s] 20 seconds and, importantly, can be done for nearly free, Visa believes its vast array of merchants could choose to use this nearly instant alternative form of payment. “We worked closely with digital currency wallets to issue Visa credentials,” says Sheffield. “And helping them receive USDC payouts can add additional value for&nbsp;them.”</blockquote><p>Moreover, the move essentially creates a direct connection between Visa and the crypto universe with Circle’s USDC serving as a bridge — no doubt a savvy move by all parties involved, one that could also have a huge impact on the continued mainstreaming of Bitcoin et.&nbsp;al.</p><p>Keep an eye on this&nbsp;space.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> + <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>— <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/12/02/visa-partners-with-ethereum-digital-dollar-startup-that-raised-271-million/?sh=77358bc84b1f">Visa Partners With Ethereum Digital-Dollar Startup That Raised $271&nbsp;Million</a>  <p>Also in&nbsp;crypto:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/kiwipete">/kiwipete</a> + <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>: <a href="https://event.webinarjam.com/replay/101/vo5y0t1mtl1b8zi6pk">Dave Schwartz on XRP: Remodelling the future of&nbsp;finance</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-criminals-idUSKBN28J1IX">Criminals getting smarter in use of digital currencies to launder&nbsp;money</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/87175/bitpay-bitcoin-bank-occ-filing">Bitcoin payments startup BitPay wants to create a national bank in&nbsp;Georgia</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/cenbanks-digital-idUSKBN28K1NI">Central banks split on role of private sector in payments — survey</a>  <a href="https://blockfi.com/fidelity-digital-assets-adds-collateral-agent-capabilities-custody-for-bitcoin-pledged-on-loans-financed-by-blockfi">Fidelity Digital Assets Adds Collateral Agent Capabilities for BlockFi&nbsp;Loans</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a>— <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-lawmakers-tell-mnuchin-to-back-off-from-potential-crypto-wallet-regs">Lawmakers Urge Mnuchin to End Rumored Wallet Rules — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microstrategy-raising-another-400m-btc">A De Facto ETF?

			<p>Luxembourg, December 2020 – With <a href="http://www.digibrixx.lu">Digibrixx</a>, blockchain technology makes its entry into the property investment market in Luxembourg. Developed by Property Token, the Digibrixx brand is a solution enabling anyone wishing to invest in property in Luxembourg to purchase digital bricks backed up by real, solid bricks and mortar. The project has been made compliant thanks to the T-REX protocol and the solutions provided by <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny Solutions</a>.</p>
 The benefits of digitalisation 
<p>Digibrixx breaks a property down into small digital bricks (or tokens). An investor can then buy one or more of those bricks for a few thousand euros. In other words, Digibrixx democratises property investment, making it accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Digibrixx brings simplicity, ease and flexibility. The investor has no need to involve their bank, get tied up in red tape with the authorities or have to keep monitoring their property. It is managed by a professional throughout the whole process. The administrative costs borne by the investor are therefore also reduced.</p>
 For all investors 
<p>Given how flexible and accessible Digibrixx is in financial terms, this investment is aimed at all people who want to invest in bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>It could be an attractive option for someone near the border who wants to invest in Luxembourg and take advantage of its dynamic property market, while at the same time ensuring they do not need to dip into their borrowing facilities to finance the purchase of a home of their own.<br>
Digibrixx is also aimed at anyone seeking to diversify their assets, but keep a large degree of agility and freedom for manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Digibrixx also offers a suitable investment solution for self workers who want to invest in property but sometimes face obstacles because of the employed banks’ requirements when it comes to borrowing, given their employment status.</p>
 How does Digibrixx work? 
<p>When they visit the Digibrixx site, investors can learn about the different investment projects in which they have an opportunity to invest.</p>
<p>Those projects are owned by developers who offer serious guarantees and who have chosen to sell one or another of their property projects via the Digibrixx brand. Assets are automatically audited and selected by Digibrixx experts, who have a background in immovable property.</p>
<p>Transparency is essential. Each project is covered by a detailed presentation. The percentage of funding already raised is automatically stated and an estimate of the annual performance is given.</p>

		 
	 
    If the investor is interested, all they need to do is click on the subscription form for their chosen project. They will then be put in touch with the developer, who will remain their direct contact person. They are also put in touch with BIL, Banque Internationale à Luxembourg, Digibrixx’s financial partner, which is responsible for issuing digital title deeds, otherwise known as tokens  Cyril LamorletteChartered Accountant &amp; Audit Partner    
	 
		 
			<p>Investments are therefore appropriate, secure and transparent. </p>

		 
	 
    Tokenization activity has continued to surge in Luxembourg since the regulation has become clearer. Real estate is a key driver in this space because lower ticket sizes can be offered, opening up new investor segments. We’re pleased to provide the technological pieces to this innovative project and help provide new pathways for investment. We believe Digibrixx will act as a precursor to many more like minded projects.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions    
	 
		 
			 What project, and what will the returns be like? 
<p>The money gathered by the developer is used to create leverage and finance the property operation. The investor therefore sees an immediate growth in their return. The process also provides an additional security guarantee for the investor: the developer, too, invests in the project, as does the bank which grants a loan.</p>

		 
	 
    The approved property projects offer real potential in terms of return on investment. They may be commercial premises, residential or garages  Laurent OlmedoAdministrator at Digibrixx    
	 
		 
			<p>During the investment period the building is constructed and put up for rent. At the end of that period, which is specified straight away, the subscriber recovers their initial investment, the capital gain on the sale of the property, and their share of the rental income, minus the charges and fees relating to the Digibrixx programme.</p>
<p>Risk is weighted because Digibrixx is based on an existing property asset, and the Luxembourg market cannot collapse overnight. Over the past decade it has actually proved its resilience through a steady continuously upward trend. But, as with any investment, there is an element of risk.</p>
 Toward a digital exchange platform 
<p>Digibrixx has already launched its first property investment project. The entry price was voluntarily set at 10,000 euros to attract qualified investors.</p>
<p>The ambition is quickly to roll out offers aimed at the “general public”, allowing property investments in the Grand Duchy amounting to a few thousand euros, or just a few hundred.</p>
<p>Digibrixx is also considering the rollout of an online trading platform which will allow investors to sell, buy or even exchange their tokens with total freedom and ease. That innovation will be launched once the legal and regulatory frameworks governing digital assets in Luxembourg and Europe (security<br>
tokens) allow.</p>
<p>But, right now, Digibrixx falls within a well-defined legal framework based on a securitisation vehicle governed by a Luxembourg law dated 22 March 2004.</p>

			 About Tokeny Solutions 
<p>Tokeny Solutions allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny Solutions enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments.</p>
<p>Tokeny Solutions is the leader in its field and in 2019 they were included in KPMG’s top 100 FinTechs globally, awarded Luxembourg’s FinTech of the year and raised €5mn in funding from the leading pan-european exchange, Euronext.</p>

 As more businesses in Europe move to adopt multi-factor solutions that comply with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), we thought we’d explain what strong authentication actually&nbsp;is. <p>To give a little background, financial institutions and e-commerce platforms in Europe must change how they authenticate users by the 1st January 2021 under the revised <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en">Payments Services Directive</a> (PSD2). This change has been driven by a sharp rise in <a href="https://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/is-the-payments-market-ready-for-sca/">fraud and identity&nbsp;theft</a>.</p><p>So as Europe gets ready to adopt strong customer authentication (SCA) solutions that are compliant with PSD2&nbsp;, we thought we’d cut through the noise to give you a clear breakdown on what strong authentication actually&nbsp;is.</p><p>To put it simply, strong authentication is achieved when solutions combine at least two mutually-independent authentication factors (keep reading to learn more about the three factors), to confirm a user’s identity and grant access to private accounts, systems and&nbsp;data.</p> Combating the password&nbsp;threat <p>Passwords are still clinging onto their place as the number one means of verifying a user’s identity online, but are they still sufficient in protecting users from threats? With the volume of digital accounts each user has (and by result number of passwords they have to keep safe), alongside a steady increase in <a href="https://www.securelink.com/blog/81-hacking-related-breaches-leverage-compromised-credentials/">hacking attacks and data breaches caused by compromised credentials</a> — it’s safe to say passwords have lost their intuitiveness and effectiveness when it comes to mitigating unauthorized access.</p> What is multi-factor authentication? <p>Solutions providing multi-factor authentication (MFA) combine at least two independent authentication challenges in order to provide a solution that is more resilient to threats and account takeovers.</p> Multi-factor authentication solutions integrate at least two of the below challenge factors: The 3 authentication challenge factors — knowledge (verifying something the user knows), possession (verifying something the user has), inherence (verifying something the user&nbsp;is). 1. Knowledge challenges <p>Knowledge challenges verify that a user knows something that no one else does. Common examples are passwords and PINs. In reality, passwords and PINs are readily shared and compromised — making knowledge based challenges one of the least reliable methods for verifying a user’s identity&nbsp;online.</p> 2. Possession challenges <p>Possession challenges verify that the user has something in their possession that no one else does. In the context of consumer authentication, proving a user has possession of something is usually done by delivering one-time passwords via push notifications or SMS to a user’s trusted device or phone number. In the workforce, employees could be given swipe-cards or USB&nbsp;tokens.</p> 3. Inherence challenges <p>Inherence challenges verify that a user is something. Essentially this is verifying the unique characteristics and traits of an individual by way of biometric sensors.</p><p>Having two mutually-independent factors enhances security by enabling an additional security layer. This means that even if one factor is compromised, private accounts, systems and data are all theoretically still protected, so long as the second factor hasn’t also been compromised.</p> A real-world example for multi-factor authentication is the usage of credit-card (something the user has) with a PIN code (something the user&nbsp;knows).  MFA vs strong customer authentication (SCA) <p>The European Central Bank takes security one step further and says that to enable strong authentication, at least one of the authentication factors must be non-reusable.</p><p>A common example of a non-reusable authentication challenge is a one-time authentication code sent to a user’s device, for example a push-notification or SMS-token.</p><p>One-time codes are by nature less likely to be compromised, making the challenge response more resilient to threats, however, <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252476811/Four-fifths-of-SIM-swap-fraud-attempts-succeed">with four out of five SIM swapping attacks being successful, one-time codes are not without&nbsp;risk.</a></p><p>Rather than verifying a user’s identity based on something they know or possess, inherence challenges authenticate users by validating something the user&nbsp;is.</p> The benefits of biometrics for&nbsp;SCA <p>The benefit of authenticating users via their biometrics is that biometrics are much harder for an attacker to steal or&nbsp;fake.</p> This is especially true when solutions take a multi-modal approach to biometrics. <p>Multimodal biometrics are when a user is authenticated via both physical and behavioral traits unique to them, essentially a form of biometric two-factor authentication.</p><p>An example would be if a solution verified a user’s unique facial measurements (using facial recognition technology), alongside their unique keystroke dynamics (the way they interact with their&nbsp;device).</p><p>Because of their layered approach, multi-modal biometrics can give companies extremely high assurance that a user is who they claim to be online, without disrupting the user-journey or adding undue complexity.</p> Strong authentication = seamless&nbsp;login  At Keyless we combine inherence and possession factors to provide fast, secure, user-friendly authentication that is resilient to common threats including phishing, credential stuffing and SIM-swapping attacks.  1. Our first factor is inherence (something the user&nbsp;is) <p>We leverage multi-modal biometrics, combined with advanced liveness detection and anti-spoofing technology, to verify that a user is who they say they are, both at the point of authentication and continuously as they user accesses private systems and accounts. The intuitiveness offered by multimodal biometrics allows our clients to strengthen access control security, without jeopardizing on productivity or user-experience.</p> 2. Our second factor is possession (something the user possesses) <p>We use device-identity verification to ensure that each authentication request is launched from a user’s trusted device without needing to send a push-notification to the user’s device. The combination of inherence and possession factors allows for seamless, strong authentication that is resilient to a wide range of threats facing enterprises, while also being intuitive to the user, and minimally disruptive to workflow.</p> Implementing Strong Authentication <p>The deadline for financial institutions and e-commerce platforms in Europe to implement SCA is fast approaching.</p><p>When executed properly, strong authentication should not disrupt the user-experience or make authentication more challenging for the user. Instead, strong authentication should enhance employee and customer experiences while protecting your company from privacy and security&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Keyless passwordless solutions are PSD2 compliant and designed to seamlessly integrate with existing security and identity management infrastructure, so that you can quickly deploy biometric-enabled passwordless solutions to your remote workforce and&nbsp;users.</p> Interested in how Keyless can help you achieve SCA compliance&nbsp;?

  <p>Google’s recent approach to SameSite cookie attributes caused a bit of confusion among developers. Especially in cases where handling redirects is necessary. After doing some research in the topic I’d like this article to be a guide on how to handle SameSite cookie attributes properly in production. This guide can serve as the basis for deploying an application to any Linux based environment—such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine">Google Cloud App Engine</a>—or any VPS Linux deployment. Also I created a sample application to demonstrate redirect handling with the Okta login flow. I won’t discuss the topic of <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/09/18/build-a-simple-dotnet-core-app-in-docker">containerization</a> as a possible solution, as we have resources available that give a great overview.</p>

 What is Okta? 

<p>Okta is a cloud service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. Using Okta, you don’t have to worry about implementing sign up, login and logout flows manually. <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Sign up for a forever-free account</a> if you don’t have one already, to handle auth for your users easily.</p>

 Prerequisites 

<p>An <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu 20.04</a> Linux machine with SSH access. You can use <a href="https://multipass.run">Multipass</a> to run a virtual machine as a playground.</p>

 SameSite Enforcement and the Decline of the Cookie 

<p>In February 2020, Google <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/developers-get-ready-for-new.html">implemented an update</a> in Chrome on how to interpret the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/SameSite">SameSite</a> attribute of cookies. Up until now, it was assumed that all cookie data could be shared across domains— unless told otherwise. However, after February 2020, the default became that cookies could only be used on the site of origin, so no cookie data would be shared across domains. The reason for this, according to Google, is to increase security against CSRF (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">Cross Site Request Forgery</a>) attacks. So now, developers have to make sure to set the <code>sameSite=None</code> attribute.</p>

 Preparing the .NET Core 3.1 Application 

<p>.NET Core 3.0 supports the updated SameSite values and adds an extra enum value, SameSiteMode.Unspecified to the SameSiteMode enum. This new value indicates no SameSite should be sent with the cookie. You can take a look at <a>this post</a> to see how Okta ties into the app for authentication. The rest of this article will focus on the configuration strategies to deal with SameSite specifically within that application.</p>

 Setting Cookie Authentication 

<p>In <code>Startup.cs</code>, <code>ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)</code> method.</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(options =&gt;
{
    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
    options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
})
</code>   

 Setting Session State Cookies 

<p>In <code>Startup.cs</code>, <code>ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)</code> method.</p>

   <code>services.AddSession(options =&gt;
{
    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
    options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
});
</code>   

 Intercepting Cookies 

<p>In <code>Startup.cs</code>, <code>Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)</code> method. Use <code>CookiePolicy</code> middleware to intercept cookies. It should be placed into the HTTP request pipeline before any components that write cookies.</p>

   <code>public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
            app.UseHsts();
    }
    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseAuthorization();
    app.UseCookiePolicy();
    app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions
    {
        ForwardedHeaders = ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto
    });

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
    {
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
</code>   

 Preparing the Linux Server 

<p>Now let’s get started with configuration.</p>

 Install .NET Core Runtime 

   <code>wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
</code>   

   <code>sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
</code>   

   <code>sudo apt-get update; \
  sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https &amp;&amp; \
  sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
  sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-3.1
</code>   

 Installing Nginx Reverse Proxy 

<p>A reverse proxy is responsible for terminating the HTTP/HTTPS request and forwarding it to the ASP.NET Core app.</p>

   <code>sudo apt-get update
</code>   

   <code>sudo apt-get install nginx
</code>   

 Configuring Nginx to use SSL 

<p>To make the Okta login work, we need to set up Nginx to handle HTTPS requests. I’ll create self-signed certificates, however if you have your own certs for your own domain, you can skip this step.</p>

 Creating Self-Signed Certificates 

   <code>sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
</code>   

<p>You can answer the questions with your own data. Common Name is the important line. You can add your own domain name or the server’s IP address. You can get your server’s IP address by running <code>hostname -I</code> command.</p>

<p>Output:</p>

   <code>Output
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:New York
Locality Name (eg, city) []:New York City
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Bouncy Castles, Inc.
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Ministry of Water Slides
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:server_IP_address
Email Address []:admin@your_domain.com
</code>   

<p>Creating a Diffie-Hellman group, which is used in negotiating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy">Perfect Forward Secrecy</a> with clients. This may take a few minutes.</p>

   <code>sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048
</code>   

 Updating Nginx Configuration 

<p>I have prepared a configuration file for this example. You can download and update the current Nginx config using:</p>

   <code>sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-netcore3-deploy-samesite-example/main/default &gt; 
default
</code>   

<p>Open Nginx configuration file and change the server_name variable to match your server’s IP address.</p>

   <code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
</code>   

<p>Your Nginx config should look like the following.</p>

<p>Please note the 3 lines related to buffer size. These configurations are necessary to allocate enough buffers to read response headers.</p>

   <code>server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;

    location / {
        proxy_pass         https://localhost:5001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_buffer_size          128k;
        proxy_buffers              4 256k;
        proxy_busy_buffers_size    256k;
     }
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;

    server_name 192.168.64.2; #Replace with your server's IP address or domain name

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384;
    ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1; # Requires nginx &gt;= 1.1.0
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_tickets off; # Requires nginx &gt;= 1.5.9
    ssl_stapling on; # Requires nginx &gt;= 1.3.7
    ssl_stapling_verify on; # Requires nginx =&gt; 1.3.7
    resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 valid=300s;
    resolver_timeout 5s;
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
}

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name 192.168.64.2;

    return 302 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
</code>   

 Adjusting the Firewall 

<p>You need to adjust the settings of the Firewall to allow SSL traffic.</p>

   <code>sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
</code>   

 Enabling Changes in Nginx 

<p>Now that you’ve made your changes and adjusted the firewall, you can restart Nginx to implement your changes.</p>

<p>First, let’s validate the configuration.</p>

   <code>sudo nginx -t
</code>   

<p>Then restart Nginx to implement your changes.</p>

   <code>sudo systemctl restart nginx
</code>   

 Takeaways 

<p>To make sure <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/okta-hosted-flows">Okta redirect flows</a> are working properly in a .NET Core 3.1 application that is running on Linux, we should take into account the following considerations:</p>

 
   Make sure to set the <code>sameSite=None</code>attribute in the .NET Core application. 
   The Linux server needs to handle HTTPS requests properly to support Okta redirect flows. 
   Setting the  Nginx buffer size is critical to allocate enough buffer size to read response headers.

  <p>If 2020 taught the world nothing else, organizations learned the vital importance of adapting to disruption. When COVID-19 halted supply chains and countries around the world phased in and out of various lockdown procedures, organizations needed to quickly shift gears to survive.</p>
<p>To meet the challenges of today’s world, organizations must improve the resilience and sustainability of their application platforms and architectures to continuously evolve to meet business needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Application leaders should focus on optimizing and refining application delivery to make it repeatable, effective and efficient</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Optimizing application delivery has always been about continual evolution, but to implement digital transformations, modernize existing applications and innovate, skills in distributed architecture, integration patterns and cloud platform technologies are critical.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“Sustainable application delivery requires architecture and platforms with effective governance, architectural dexterity and relevant skills,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/54513/Brad-Dayley">Brad Dayley</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>In the coming year, application leaders should focus on optimizing and refining application delivery to make it repeatable, effective and efficient. The key is implementing continuous learning, with a focus on:</p>
 
 Strong agile architecture: Does your organization have the skills to enable delivery of components of the application (such as individual apps, APIs and services) at independent cadences and using optimal technologies? 
 DevOps: Can your application technical professionals implement an operation and effective tool chain that supports continuous integration and continuous delivery? 
 Cloud-native skills: Is your team able to design, architect, integrate and operate applications that are ready to deploy and operate in a cloud environment? 
 
<p>With a foundation in these areas, application technical professionals can make realistic and pragmatic assessments of new architecture and integration technologies, platforms and patterns as they emerge.</p>
<p>But much more is needed to ensure your organization is sufficiently flexible and adaptable to meet new challenges in the future.</p>
 Adapt and modernize application architecture 
<p>Changing user needs, customer expectations, business models, processes and application delivery requirements are intrinsic challenges of running a business. Yet the COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the need for change.</p>
<p>Application architects and delivery teams with the appropriate skills and technologies in place have been able to step up, adapt and support their organizations to meet those significant challenges and weather the storm.</p>
<p>Conversely, lack of skills has inhibited application delivery professionals from making needed transitions to meet business needs, accelerate delivery cadence, optimize costs and scale applications to meet accelerated requirements.</p>
 Prioritize skills 
<p>With skills in place for agile architecture, DevOps and cloud-native, organizations should then prioritize skills based on real business and application needs. To determine the additional skills needed based on the real impact to your business, ask these questions:</p>
 
 Is this a skill that has already been identified by my organization as critical? 
 Is this a skill in which we are currently deficient on my team or within my organization? 
 How will I apply this skill in my current role? 
 Will this skill enable me to expand my current role in the products I am working on? 
 Is this skill required for future modernization/innovation efforts that have been approved and are underway in my organization? 
 Look for strong and clear “yes” answers to these questions. Avoid skills for which there is uncertainty. 
 
 Gain experience and knowledge 
<p>Successfully learning skills means balancing knowledge and experience. Gaining too much knowledge is dangerous because you know how to do things without the experience to understand when and why to do them. At the same time, trying to learn a skill solely through experience is painful.</p>
<p>Depending on the skill and individual learning style, many learning activities are available, such as tutorials, online courses, bootcamps, conferences, proofs of concept (POCs), book clubs and lunch-and-learns. Look for those opportunities within your organization and utilize them. When they don’t exist, take the initiative and start one when appropriate. However, always prioritize those activities that provide practical experience and enable you to gain both knowledge and experience. Some examples include:</p>
 
 Communities of practice 
 POCs/prototypes 
 Paired (programming, design, architecture) 
 Team rotation/sharing 
 
<p>These types of activities tend to provide multiple benefits to application architecture and integration professionals. They enable you to focus on real-world problems; they integrate into your normal workflow so you don’t need to set aside learning time; and the outcomes are often used in production applications.</p>
 Culture of continuous learning 
<p>The most successful organizations encourage and support a culture of continuous learning and allow technical professionals the time and opportunities to learn new skills. A culture of continuous learning is one where multiple activities are available for individuals to increase their skills.</p>
<p>Application architecture and integration professionals contribute to this culture by participating in available activities and taking the initiative to create, start or encourage activities. To overcome any barriers to justifying the time and effort to learn new skills, define valuable and measurable outcomes from your learning activities.</p>
<p>Dedicate time to develop soft skills (e.g., time management and listening) as well as technical skills.</p>

					 <p>Our mission is to make the world more accessible through <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). But to do that, we first are making SSI more accessible to the world. We strive to consistently remove barriers to entry to getting started with SSI. About a year ago, we became <a href="https://trinsic.id/launch/">the first SSI vendor in the world</a> to host a free, production-ready platform for issuing and verifying credentials. Since then, we’ve grown into a community of hundreds of developers who trust Trinsic enough to build their SSI solutions on our platform. Today, we’re excited to release the next generation of <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the simplest tool for verifiable credential exchange, Trinsic Studio was originally designed to help developers get started with Trinsic’s <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">powerful APIs</a> in less than 5 minutes. The release of Trinsic Studio 2.0 only enhances and increases our ability to meet that goal. The Studio also serves as the mechanism through which our users manage their API keys and subscription.</p>

					 <p>As a part of the launch of the new Studio, we announce changes to our pricing model that make SSI more accessible than ever.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Usage-based pricing 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In line with our values, for the last year we’ve charged based on a metric called “DIDComm” which is any interaction between two participants in an SSI ecosystem. Despite its imperfections, this model was well-received due to the fact that our subscribers only had to worry and estimate one value (DIDComm), and they could build in the usage-based pricing into the pricing model they charge their customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, DIDComm is an unfamiliar term and requires deep technical knowledge of SSI protocols and accurate forecasting of usage in order to correctly model pricing. Throughout our platform, we strive to abstract these complexities away into the simplest possible experience for our users—so it didn’t make sense to expose the complexity through our pricing model.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Simplified pricing 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>With Trinsic Studio 2.0, we’ve implemented a pricing model that keeps all the benefits of our former DIDComm-based pricing model but removes the complexity. Going forward, Trinsic will charge based on&nbsp;credential exchange. That means we’ll charge for:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Credentials issued  Credentials verified  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simple.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The subscription plans will remain the same; the Developer plan for just starting out and the Production plan for when you are ready to go to production or get additional support. But now, there&nbsp;is a much lower minimum threshold and added flexibility for each of Trinsic’s paid plans; see the table below for a quick comparison.</p>

					 <p>This means more teams will be able to join the Trinsic community, allowing us to start to scale with them from an earlier point in their development as partners. All users can easily manage their subscription plan through Trinsic Studio.</p>

					 <p>This release was about more than a simple glow-up—the Trinsic Studio has been completely rewritten based on a more scalable architecture. With world-class Blazor architect&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StevenTCramer">Steve Cramer</a>&nbsp;at the helm, we migrated the Studio from server-side rendering to client-side via WASM. More to come in another blog if you’re interested in going deeper; but the end result is that pages load 2x faster. You can now start to issue a credential in the time it used to take to load the page!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of Trinsic’s value propositions is that we abstract away the low-level SSI protocols so that developers can focus on their use case. Another is that Trinsic is continually adopting SSI standards and new technologies as they mature. Therefore, a flexible architecture that’s easily extensible was an important design decision. Shipping new features on Studio 2.0 takes our developers, on average, 4x less time than it took on the original Trinsic Studio. Plus, we have integrated end-to-end testing that should prevent bugs from sneaking in and speeding up our time to release. So not only will we move even faster in our development, but we’ll be more flexible to evolve with the SSI space as it advances over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See below for an example; you can create a Verification Template in the new studio in the time it would take you to simply load the verifications page in the previous studio.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					Previous Studio lacked performance.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					New Studio loads pages at least 2x faster.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Other changes 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In addition to simplifying pricing, UI, and performance, we’re introducing a couple of other important changes. See the feature breakdown on our <a href="https://trinsic.id/pricing/">pricing page</a> for more detail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Support: We’re launching an exclusive community where members receive early access to features, co-marketing opportunities, and a dedicated support channel. Available for our Production subscribers.  Documentation: All of the content on our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">documentation site</a> will continue to be available free to all subscription levels. We don’t believe in restricting content behind a paywall unless it is client-specific.  Organizations &amp; Cloud Wallets: Organizations (institutional agents) and cloud wallets (“custodial” cloud-hosted end-user agents) will be limited based on the subscription tier.

					 <p>It’s amazing to look back and see how much Trinsic Studio has evolved since we first launched. We are thankful to all of our users and their feedback which continually inspires us to develop the best and simplest developer tools for self-sovereign identity. With the release of Trinsic Studio 2.0, verifiable credentials exchange has never been more accessible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking to build an SSI solution or integrate SSI into your existing solution, <a href="https://trinsic.studio/">sign up for a free Trinsic Studio account</a> today, and see how easy it is to get started with SSI.</p>

  <p>Digital transformation has made it imperative for application leaders to find effective ways to modernize legacy systems. The biggest challenge? Knowing the risk-to-reward ratio before acting.</p>
<p>“For many organizations, legacy systems are seen as holding back the business initiatives and business processes that rely on them,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/52795/Stefan-Van-Der-Zijden">Stefan Van Der Zijden</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “When a tipping point is reached, application leaders must look to application modernization to help remove the obstacles.”</p>
<p>The Gartner three-step evaluation process provides direction in determining how to approach application modernization. The best approach depends on the problem that needs to be solved.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 STEP 1: Evaluate legacy systems using six drivers 
<p>There are six main drivers for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/key-strategies-for-cost-optimization-in-application-design-and-development/">application</a> modernization. These are the issues, concerns or impediments that have been created by the legacy application as a result of its technology, architecture or functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three of these drivers come from a business perspective — business fit, business value and agility. If the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-evaluate-an-application-integration-platform-infographic/">legacy application</a> is not meeting the new requirements imposed by digital business, it needs to be modernized to fit properly, and should be upgraded to provide greater business value. Applications that lack the agility to keep pace with the demands of digital business may be a cost or risk liability.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/key-strategies-for-cost-optimization-in-application-design-and-development/">Key Strategies for Cost Optimization in Application Design and Development</a></p>
 
<p>The three other drivers come from the IT perspective, and involve cost, complexity and risk. If the total cost of ownership is too high, the technology too complex, or security, compliance, support or scalability are being compromised, it’s time to modernize.</p>
<p>The best modernization opportunities are those with multiple drivers from both a business and an IT perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 STEP 2: Evaluate modernization 
<p>Once the opportunity is selected and the problem is identified, look at modernization options. Gartner has ranked seven options by ease of implementation (the easier it is, the less risk and impact it will have on the system and the business processes; the harder, the more risk and impact it will have.)</p>
 
 Encapsulate. Leverage and extend the application features by encapsulating its data and functions, making them available as services via an API. 
 Rehost. Redeploy the application component to other infrastructure (physical, virtual or cloud) without modifying its code, features or functions. 
 Replatform. Migrate to a new runtime platform, making minimal changes to the code, but not the code structure, features or functions. 
 Refactor. Restructure and optimize the existing code (although not its external behavior) to remove technical debt and improve nonfunctional attributes. 
 Rearchitect. Materially alter the code to shift it to a new application architecture and exploit new and better capabilities.&nbsp; 
 Rebuild. Redesign or rewrite the application component from scratch while preserving its scope and specifications. 
 Replace. Eliminate the former application component altogether and replace it, considering new requirements and needs at the same time. 
 
 STEP 3: Choose the modernization approach with highest effect and value 
<p>Finally, choose the modernization approach that will have the highest effect and value to your organization by mapping the seven modernization options in terms of their effect on technology, architecture, functionality, cost and risk.</p>
<p>Ultimately, modernizing legacy<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/its-time-to-disrupt-the-application-organization/"> applications</a> means choosing between rearchitecting, rebuilding or replacing. Rearchitecting has medium costs and risks, whereas rebuilding or replacing provides best results with higher costs and risks. The key is to weigh all options to help identify the extent to which each will have the desired effect — with the minimum effort and maximum positive impact.</p>

  <p>Spring Boot and Spring Security have delighted developers with their APIs for quite some time now. Spring Security has done an excellent job of implementing OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) standards for the last few years.</p>

<p>If you’re using Spring Security’s default authorization code flow with OIDC, it’ll establish a session on the server and serve up old fashion session cookies. If you want to scale your services, you’ll need to share session information. This tutorial shows you how to configure a Spring Boot application to store sessions in Redis with Spring Session, so the session can be shared among multiple gateway nodes and is preserved when a node failure happens.</p>

 Build a Microservices Architecture with Spring Session and Redis 

<p>Let’s start by building a microservices architecture. With JHipster and <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/getting-started#deployments">JHipster Domain Languange</a> (JDL) you can generate a microservices architecture from a file that describes the applications and entities.</p>

<p>Install JHipster:</p>

   <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster@6.10.5
</code>   

<p>For this tutorial, you can use the JDL sample <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples/blob/main/microservice-ecommerce-store-4-apps.jdl"><code>microservice-ecommerce-store-4-apps</code></a> from the JDL samples repository.</p>

<p>Create a folder for the project:</p>

   <code>mkdir spring-session-redis
cd spring-session-redis
</code>   

<p>TIP: If you’re using <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">Oh My Zsh</a>, you can run <code>take spring-session-redis</code> as an alternative.</p>

<p>Copy <code>microservice-ecommerce-store-4-apps.jdl</code> to the project folder and rename it to <code>jhipster-redis.jdl</code>.</p>

   <code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhipster/jdl-samples/main/microservice-ecommerce-store-4-apps.jdl -O jhipster-redis.jdl
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>store</code>, <code>product</code>, <code>invoice</code>, and <code>notification</code> configs to use OAuth 2.0 / OIDC for authentication and Maven as the build tool (shortcut: replace <code>jwt</code> with <code>oauth2</code> and <code>gradle</code> with <code>maven</code>):</p>

   <code>application {
  config {
    ...
    authenticationType oauth2,
    buildTool maven,
    ...
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the <code>jdl</code> command:</p>

   <code>jhipster jdl jhipster-redis.jdl
</code>   

<p>After the generation completes, you will see folders <code>invoice</code>, <code>notification</code>,<code>product</code>, and <code>store</code>—one for each generated application.</p>

<p>Next, create the Docker Compose configuration for all the applications using JHipster’s <code>docker-compose</code> sub-generator.</p>

<p>Create a folder <code>docker-compose</code> in the project root and run the sub-generator:</p>

   <code>mkdir docker-compose
cd docker-compose
jhipster docker-compose
</code>   

<p>Choose the following options:</p>

 
   Type of application: Microservice application 
   Type of gateway: JHipster gateway 
   Root directory for microservices: <code>../</code> (the default) 
   Choose all applications with your spacebar and arrow keys (invoice, notification, product, store) 
   Don’t select any application for clustered databases 
   Setup monitoring: No 
   Enter an admin password for JHipster Registry 
 

<p>You will see the following WARNING:</p>

   <code>WARNING! Docker Compose configuration generated, but no Jib cache found
</code>   

<p>This means the application images have yet to be built. Go through each application folder and build the images with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
</code>   

<p>The architecture you generated uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. By default, it’s configured to work with Keycloak in a Docker container. It’s also quite easy to make it work with an Okta developer account.</p>

<p>I’ll show you how to configure Okta as the authentication provider for the store application, which will act as a gateway to the other services and provides a simple UI to manage the entities.</p>

 Add Authentication with OpenID Connect 

<p>You can register for a free developer account with the following simple commands using the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a>, in the project root folder:</p>

   <code>okta register
</code>   

<p>Provide the required information. Once you register, create a client application in Okta with the following command:</p>

   <code>okta apps create
</code>   

<p>You will be prompted to select the following options:</p>

 
   Type of Application: 1: Web 
   Type of Application (again): 3: JHipster 
   Redirect UI: accept the default values provided for you 
 

<p>The OIDC application’s configuration will be generated in the file <code>.okta.env</code> and it will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
</code>   

<p>Edit the file <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> and override the default OAuth 2.0 settings for the services <code>invoice</code>, <code>notification</code>, <code>product</code>, and <code>store</code> with the following values (you will need to update these properties under the <code>environment</code> key):</p>

   <code>- SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}
- SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID}
- SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET}
</code>   

<p>By default, the JHipster Registry is configured to use Keycloak in <code>docker-compose/jhipster-registry.yml</code>. You don’t need to change anything for this to work, but you will be using Keycloak for the JHipster Registry and Okta for the rest of your apps. To fix this, you can update this file with the same settings as above, or remove the <code>oauth2</code> profile which will cause it to use JWT for authentication (and the default <code>admin/admin</code> credentials).</p>

<p>Create a file <code>docker-compose/.env</code> and set the value of the <code>OKTA_OAUTH_*</code> environment variables for Docker Compose, copying the values from <code>.okta.env</code>:</p>

   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID={clientId}
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET={clientSecret}
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also set the OAuth 2.0 configuration for all the applications in a single place, using the JHipster Registry, since it’s also a Spring Cloud Config Server. See <a>Java Microservices with Spring Cloud Config and JHipster</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Run the services with Docker Compose:</p>

   <code>cd docker-compose
docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>The JHipster Registry will log the following message once it is ready:</p>
   <code>jhipster-registry_1     | 2020-12-11 16:03:47.233  INFO 6 --- [           main] i.g.j.registry.JHipsterRegistryApp       :

</code>   

<p>You can sign into the JHipster Registry at <code>http://localhost:8761</code> to check if all services are up:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once all services are up, access the store at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and sign in with your Okta user:</p>

<p></p>

 Configure Spring Session and Redis 

<p>The <code>store</code> application maintains a user session in memory, identified with a session ID that is sent in a cookie to the client. If the store instance crashes, the session is lost. One way to avoid losing the session is by adding Spring Session with Redis for the session storage and sharing among <code>store</code> nodes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store—used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports many data structures, has built-in replication, provides high availability, and supports partitioning. A session store requires high availability and durability to support uninterrupted user engagement. Redis is the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-databases-loved4">most loved database of 2020 according to Stack Overflow</a>, and it is a popular choice for session management due to its low latency, scalability, and resilience.</p>

<p>Before making the modifications to the <code>store</code> application, stop all services with CTRL+C and remove the containers:</p>

   <code>cd docker-compose
docker-compose down
</code>   

<p>Delete the store image:</p>

   <code>docker rmi store
</code>   

<p>Edit the <code>store/pom.xml</code> and add the Spring Session + Redis dependency:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.session&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-session-data-redis&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.lettuce&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;lettuce-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;6.0.0.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Spring Session Data Redis depends on Spring Data Redis, which integrates with Lettuce and Jedis, two popular open-source Java clients for Redis. Spring Data Redis does not pull any client by default, so you need to add the Lettuce dependency explicitly.</p>

<p>To enable Redis for your Spring profiles, add the following configuration to <code>store/src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml</code> and <code>store/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>spring:
  session:
    store-type: redis
</code>   

<p>For this example, disable Redis in the store’s test configuration, so the existing tests don’t require a Redis instance. Edit <code>src/test/resources/config/application.yml</code> and add the following:</p>

   <code>spring:
  session:
    store-type: none
  autoconfigure:
    exclude:
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.data.redis.RedisAutoConfiguration
</code>   

<p>Rebuild the <code>store</code> application image:</p>

   <code>cd ../store
./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> to set the Redis configuration. Under the <code>store</code> service entry, add the following variables to the environment:</p>

   <code>- LOGGING_LEVEL_COM_JHIPSTER_DEMO_STORE=TRACE
- SPRING_REDIS_HOST=store-redis
- SPRING_REDIS_PASSWORD=password
- SPRING_REDIS_PORT=6379      
</code>   

<p>Add the <code>store-redis</code> instance as a new service (at the bottom of the file, and indent two spaces):</p>

   <code>store-redis:
  image: 'redis:6.0.8'
  command: redis-server --requirepass password
  ports:
    - '6379:6379'
</code>   

<p>Run the service again with Docker Compose:</p>

   <code>cd ../docker-compose
docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Once all services are up, sign in to the <code>store</code> application with your Okta account. Then, confirm Redis has stored new session keys:</p>

   <code>docker exec docker-compose_store-redis_1 redis-cli -a password KEYS \*
</code>   

<p>The output should look like this:</p>

   <code>spring:session:sessions:21eb225f-f92e-4a9b-937b-28162fd14c20
spring:session:index:org.springframework.session.FindByIndexNameSessionRepository.PRINCIPAL_NAME_INDEX_NAME:00u1h70sf0trRsbLS357
spring:session:sessions:expires:21eb225f-f92e-4a9b-937b-28162fd14c20
spring:session:expirations:1604972940000
</code>   

 Spring Session Redis with HAProxy Load Balancing 

<p>Load balancing in a JHipster microservices architecture is handled at the client-side, where the client is the Spring Boot instance. The JHipster Registry is a Eureka discovery server, maintaining a dynamic list of available service instances, for the service clients to do request routing and load balancing. The store service, which acts as a gateway and also as a Eureka client, requests the available instances to the JHipster registry for service routing.</p>

<p>As you want to test session sharing among multiple <code>store</code> nodes, you need load balancing for the <code>store</code> service as well. You’ll need to run an HAProxy container and two instances of the <code>store</code> service for this test.</p>

<p>Stop all services and remove the store container with <code>docker rm docker-compose_store_1</code> before starting the modifications below.</p>

<p>First, extract the docker-compose <code>store</code> base configuration to its own <code>docker-compose/store.yml</code> file:</p>

   <code>version: '2'
services:
  store:
    image: store
    environment:
      - _JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx512m -Xms256m
      - 'SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod,swagger'
      - MANAGEMENT_METRICS_EXPORT_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
      - 'EUREKA_CLIENT_SERVICE_URL_DEFAULTZONE=http://admin:$${jhipster.registry.password}@jhipster-registry:8761/eureka'
      - 'SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_URI=http://admin:$${jhipster.registry.password}@jhipster-registry:8761/config'
      - 'SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://store-mysql:3306/store?useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=utf8&amp;useSSL=false&amp;useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&amp;serverTimezone=UTC&amp;createDatabaseIfNotExist=true'
      - SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}
      - SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID}
      - SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET}
      - JHIPSTER_SLEEP=30
      - JHIPSTER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=admin
      - LOGGING_LEVEL_COM_JHIPSTER_DEMO_STORE=TRACE
      - SPRING_REDIS_HOST=store-redis
      - SPRING_REDIS_PASSWORD=password
      - SPRING_REDIS_PORT=6379
</code>   

<p>Then, edit <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> and remove the <code>store</code> service. Instead create <code>store1</code> and <code>store2</code> services, extending the base configuration. Add the HAProxy service as well.</p>

   <code>services:
  ...
  store1:
    extends:
      file: store.yml
      service: store
    hostname: store1
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
  store2:
    extends:
      file: store.yml
      service: store
    hostname: store2
    ports:
      - '8081:8080'  
  haproxy:
    extends:
      file: haproxy.yml
      service: haproxy      
</code>   

<p>Create the HAProxy base configuration at <code>docker-compose/haproxy.yml</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>version: '2'
services:
  haproxy:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-haproxy
    image: haproxy
    ports:
      - 80:80
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>docker-compose/Dockerfile-haproxy</code> file to specify how Docker should build the HAProxy image:</p>

   <code>FROM haproxy:2.3
COPY haproxy.cfg /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
</code>   

<p>Create the file <code>docker-compose/haproxy.cfg</code> with the HAProxy service configuration:</p>

   <code>global
    daemon
    maxconn 2000

defaults
    mode http
    timeout connect 5000ms
    timeout client 50000ms
    timeout server 50000ms

frontend http-in
    bind *:80
    default_backend servers

backend servers
    balance roundrobin
    cookie SERVERUSED insert indirect nocache
    option httpchk /
    option redispatch
    default-server check
    server store1 store1:8080 cookie store1
    server store2 store2:8080 cookie store2
</code>   

<p>In the configuration above, <code>store1</code> and <code>store2</code> are the backend servers to load balance with a round-robin strategy. With option redispatch, HAProxy will re-dispatch the request to another server if the selected server fails.</p>

<p>HAProxy listens on port 80 so you’ll need to update your Okta application. Run <code>okta login</code>, open the resulting URL in your browser, and go to Applications. Select your application and add
<code>http://localhost/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> as a Login redirect URI, and <code>http://localhost</code> as a Logout redirect URI.</p>

<p>Run all your Spring services again:</p>

   <code>docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Once all services are up, sign in to <code>http://localhost</code> with your credentials and navigate to Entities &gt; Product. In your browser’s developer console, check the SERVERUSED cookie by typing `document.cookie’. You should output like the following:</p>

   <code>"SERVERUSED=store2; XSRF-TOKEN=6aa9ebef-b62f-40b5-9310-3e9d74042fa6"
</code>   

<p>Stop the container of that <code>store</code> instance:</p>

   <code>docker stop docker-compose_store2_1
</code>   

<p>TIP: If you get a “No such container” error, run <code>docker ps --format '{{.Names}}'</code> to print your container names. For example, it might be named <code>docker-compose_store2_1</code>.</p>

<p>Create a new entity and inspect the POST request to verify that a different server responds, without losing the session:</p>

   <code>SERVERUSED=store1
</code>   

<p>Did it work? If so, give yourself a big pat on the back!</p>

<p>Red Hat surprised the open source world with its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/centos-shifts-from-red-hat-unbranded-to-red-hat-beta/">announcment</a> that it is pulling the plug on CENTOS. But should anyone be surprised? At the end of the day, why does it make sense to offer a product that undermines your business model? On the one hand, you have a huge investment in Red Hat Enterprise Linux that generates a ton of revenue. On the other hand, you have an underfunded effort working on an open source project that generates no revenue. You don’t need an MBA to figure out what the smart financial decision is here.</p>
<p>But is there an analogy that relates to identity and access management? Is there a product where IBM has a huge investment in an another profitable product, where a little under-financed open source project undermines the business model? Hmmm, what about <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/verify-access">IBM Security Verify Access</a> and Keycloak? </p>
<p>The writing is on the wall. Keycloak makes no business sense. IBM doesn’t need two access management platforms. The current IBM access management platform has more features that are valuable to businesses. It has more integrations with current IBM products. It has more documentation, “red books”, training, engineers–more of just about everything else you’d want for a product.</p>
<p>It’s just a matter of time before we see a similar “suprise” announcement for Keycloak. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons we moved the core Gluu software to the <a href="https://jans.io">Janssen Project</a>. When one company controls the destiny of a project, the project’s fate is subject to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that may befall that one company. Enlightened despotism is efficient. But it is not democratic. At Gluu, we have moved to consensus based governance to ensure that whatever happens to Gluu, the project will survive. We didn’t spend the last 10 years building an open source identity distribution to see some bean counters decide to change the license and close the repository.</p>
<p>Janssen is just getting started. In 2021 we’re going to work hard to fill in the gaps to make it a world class, cloud-native identity platform. Heed the writing on the wall. Ditch Keycloak, and join us!</p>

<p>By Subhashish Bhadra, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Regulators, governments, and courts have struggled to catch up with today’s rapid technological progress. That’s why Omidyar Network is exploring what it takes to reimagine our institutions.</p><p>Circa 2011, the internet was hailed as a bastion of freedom. A man in Egypt even named his newborn daughter “Facebook,” in honor of the pivotal role the social media company played in the Arab&nbsp;Spring.</p><p>Today, countries in the Global South have a litany of complaints against tech companies: privacy breaches, domestic tax evasion, inadequate content moderation, lack of free speech online, data extraction to outside the country, and much more. So, what’s changed since 2011? And why didn’t we see this&nbsp;coming?</p><p>Technology has evolved in ways we didn’t imagine, so we didn’t plan and prepare accordingly. Tech has transformed into new business lines, using the data at its disposal to create sprawling commercial empires. It has permeated governments, with law enforcement using facial recognition and other surveillance technologies. And it has fell into the hands of bad actors who used AI, for example, to create deep fake pornography.</p><p>Governments, courts, and regulators — the institutions we created to protect us — have failed to catch up; oftentimes they simply lacked the tools to counter these new&nbsp;threats.</p><p>We must catch up and look ahead. Omidyar Network believes we must reboot our institutions to set them up for success in the data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Many consequences of technological progress are unknown — and will remain so for years to come. Therefore, our institutions need to serve as “safety valves” that can identify and act as soon as harms become evident. Western democracies took centuries to develop such institutions for the industrial age; we don’t have that luxury for this digital era. Our institutions need to either move fast or risk undermining digital progress by exacerbating digital&nbsp;harms.</p><p>We have urgent concerns that public and private tech implementers must address now — like misinformation and privacy — but we must proverbially walk and chew gum at the same time. We need to tackle the immediate needs while building robust institutions for the long-term. The latter is critically important for three reasons. First, technology will keep throwing new challenges at us and we shouldn’t always be playing catch up. We need to get ahead of the curve and tackle issues in their infancy. When institutions like Parliament and courts work well, they provide forums for individuals to question how tech is rolled out. Second, most of today’s solutions originate in the US and Europe, but the same solutions may play out differently in different socio-economic contexts. Citizens need forums in which they can discuss what is best suited for them, rather than have a solution thrust from the Global North. Third, it is not just where we land that matters, but also how we get there. The path countries take on tech needs to be based on democratic norms and a respect for constitutional principles like individual liberty and non-discrimination. Those that don’t will risk being unsustainable because of possible tech lash by the people or&nbsp;courts.</p><p>That’s the “easy” part. The more difficult question is where to even start. Here’s the approach Omidyar Network is experimenting with:</p><p>We are seeking to better understand the existing laws and institutions, and how they are performing, including the entire mosaic required for a thriving digital economy: data protection, competition, taxation, transparency, cybersecurity, speech regulation, consumer protection, and more. Many of the underlying principles are context-agnostic, although their application to a country requires nuance and caution. To help guide our learning, we have commissioned multiple cross-country analyses of data protection <a href="https://omidyar.com/data-protection-and-digital-infrastructure-before-during-and-after-a-pandemic-2/">laws</a>. We have also recently funded the <a href="https://africafoicentre.org/">Africa Freedom of Information Centre</a> in Uganda to evaluate whether open contracting norms are applied effectively to government procurement of tech systems. We are curious about issues surrounding surveillance and online free&nbsp;speech.</p><p>Concurrently, we are exploring ways to strengthen the capacity of institutions that uphold these laws. Across the globe, we see that regulators struggle with low budgets and headcounts, wait for years for cases to wend their way through the courts, and for governments to belatedly apply ineffective band-aids on issues that require fundamental re-thinking. As such, we are working in different institutional contexts to understand which types of capacity-building efforts are most effective. For example, we recently funded the <a href="https://digitalrightslawyers.org/who-we-are/#:~:text=Digital%20Rights%20Lawyers%20Initiative%20is,exercisable%20in%20the%20digital%20space.">Digital Rights Lawyers Initiative</a> in Nigeria to train lawyers in digital rights litigation in the hopes it will improve the quality of technology rulings.</p><p>Finally, we are supporting digital rights organizations throughout Africa to act as checks on technological excesses of both governments and corporations. We partnered with the <a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/">Next Generation of African Foresight Practitioners at the School of International Futures</a> to generate a set of insights, signals, and scenarios that look out to 2030, and explore their implications for African institutions.</p><p>Our hope is that these investments will help us — and our many partners — answer critical questions: Which laws do we need? Which institutions can uphold them? And how can we hold institutions accountable?</p>

					 <p>For this tutorial, we will be referring to Alice Smith who is a recent graduate of Faber College. Alice is looking to apply for a job at ACME Corp. and has started the process of filling out the company’s online application form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In previous “how to” posts, we walked through the scenarios of 1) Faber College <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">issuing Alice a university diploma</a> in the form of a verifiable credential and 2) Alice <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-create-connections-in-trinsic-studio/">creating a connection</a> with ACME Corp. to securely begin applying for a job online. If you have not already completed these steps, we suggest you go back and complete those steps before continuing with the tutorial below.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Log in to Trinsic Studio 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>To do so, go to <a href="https://trinsic.studio/login">https://trinsic.studio/login</a>. If you do not have a Trinsic Studio account, you can create one for free at <a href="https://trinsic.studio/">https://trinsic.studio/</a>. As mentioned above, you will need to complete the tutorials for <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">issuing credentials</a> and <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-create-connections-in-trinsic-studio/">creating connections</a> in Trinsic Studio before moving forward.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create a verification template 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Before Alice can fill out an online job application from ACME Corp., the company must create one. Let’s assume that ACME Corp. wants to request the following information in the application:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  First Name  Last Name  Degree  Year  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because ACME Corp. wants to ensure the legitimacy of an applicant’s responses, the information listed above must come from a valid college diploma. So let’s get started creating the verification template.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, get the Schema ID for the transcript. To do so:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  First, click on the Faber College organization card on the dashboard screen.  Click on the “Credentials” tab.  Copy the “Schema ID” from the College Diploma credential template.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now create the job application template:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Return to the dashboard screen and click on the ACME Corp. organization card.  Click on the “Verifications” tab, and click the “+ Template” button.  Name the verification “Job Application”.  Now we are going to set the policies. Policies are a way to specify what data to request from a digital wallet. Click on the “+ Policy” dropdown, and you will see that there are two types of Policies—”Predicate” and “Attribute”. Select “Attribute”.  Enter “Diploma Verification” as the policy name.  In the “Select Credential Template” dropdown, select “Define Custom Attributes”.  In the “Define Attributes” text box, enter the attribute names exactly as they appear in the credential template that you created for Faber College. So we will write in First Name, Last Name, Degree, and Year.  In the “Credential Restrictions” dropdown, select “Schema ID” and paste the transcript schema ID into the text box that appears. This is so that only credentials issued from the template you created previously will pass the verification.  Click the “Save Policy” button and wait a few seconds for the template to be saved.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Send a verification request 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now that ACME Corp. has set up its verification template, it can send its verification to Alice!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As ACME Corp.:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  In the “Verifications” tab, locate the verification template you’ll use to request a verification from Alice. Click on the “Request” button which corresponds to this template.  In the list of “Send verification request via options”, select the “Connection” option.  Click on the connection you’ve made for Alice.  Click “Send Request”.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now as Alice:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Your Trinsic Wallet should get a push notification for the verification request from your ACME Corp. connection.  From your home screen, select the verification request to respond. Once you’ve opened it, you can customize the information you share if you have more than one credential that can satisfy the request. In this case, we do not.  If the information looks correct, press&nbsp;“Present”.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>And just like that, Alice has securely sent ACME Corp. the information it asked for in the online job application.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					In the Trinsic Wallet, a verification request notification will appear.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					Once the user clicks on the verification request, the user can see what the verifier is asking for along with the information the user will be sending to the verifier.

<p>Last night I woke with a start, sweating heavily. I dreamed that Facebook had contacted me to ask if they could sell Amazon some of the data I shared to create an account along with some behavioral insights from my activity throughout the years on Mark Zuckerberg’s platform. Yes, some of the data because I was actually given the choice of how I wanted to monetize my personal and digital activity information. That felt so empowering. Then reality hit me rather hard. I looked to the left and my girlfriend was sound asleep next to me. I looked to the right and my watch was indicating it was indeed the middle of the night.</p>

 Bruce Pon, Founder of Ocean Protocol, on Ocean’s latest release, the intricacies of DeFi, and data sovereignty <p>In the ninth episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we had a candid conversation with Bruce Pon, Founder of Ocean Protocol. During this discussion, he explains the different layers of the Web3 data economy, the various facets of a data marketplace, and the recent release of Ocean V3, featuring datatokens. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> What is the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy? <p>Bruce simplifies Web3 for us: Web3 denotes the fact that you are working on technologies that are decentralized. In the world of Web3 — smart contracts, the code, the tokens — they all run on substrates that can’t be stopped by people or central intermediaries.</p><p>As a group, people can determine the direction of the platform and the infrastructure. But it’s a very hard coordination problem and there needs to be a democratic process in order to make changes on that. This makes Web3 resilient and robust for putting many of the concepts of value on top because by using that, as a substrate. You can start to give people, companies, individuals, back control of things that they value, whether it’s their identity, intellectual property, their money, land titles, whatever is the value that we, as humans have, can now live on that substrate.</p><p>We as individuals can control data using a private key, an ethereum address, a Bitcoin address — these types of things. This is what signifies Web3 as opposed to something like Web 2, which is the rise of the Internet platforms — it was where you have a central database, where your private information is vacuumed up, where governments are the sole authority for issuing identity, or privileges, etc. You have large multinational companies that have almost more power than governments in some ways, and having this rich database that you actually kind of have to trust that they’re handling.</p><p>“We’re seeing that there are these hacks of governments, Internet companies, banks that hold the customer data — be it with identity or money. The difference between Web 2 and Web 3, philosophically is that instead of trusting somebody else, you hold your things of value with important records. You put it on the substrate and control that. You have to question what is the right structure for holding value and managing governments, managing your society, depending on the state of the technology and the state of the people,” he&nbsp;says.</p> Data Sovereignty, DeFi and Government control of&nbsp;data <p>If a government wants something, they can still take it, but the power of Web 3 is that — it has to be something very specific. Instead of going to a bank and seizing the bank and all their assets, now they’d have to go to each one of us individually, knock on the doors and ask for those private keys. This constraints the power. The overreach of government is pervasive, regardless of which government and with Web3 technologies that overreached are now constrained back to perhaps a more natural agreement that citizens would agree&nbsp;to.</p><p>We asked Bruce what is the term he would give for decentralized finance, the new way of controlling your&nbsp;data:</p><p>“I call it a ‘new data economy’, rivaling other sectors like land and property, or the corporation and all these innovations of humanity. I think data itself will become an economy as big as these. I can break it down into two parts: First is can I truly control my data? And then when I do share it, is it safe? Do I feel comfortable? Can I maintain a certain amount of privacy? That’s one set, just control. The second set is: What is my data&nbsp;worth?”</p><p>We haven’t had enough trading on data. Or if we have had trades, it’s held by a very small group of people who know what the data is worth. So we don’t really have a price. These are the two things that we need to unlock the data&nbsp;economy:</p>  To have the tools available to unlock the data while giving each individual control and the comfort to&nbsp;share.  We need to find a way to price the data so that once you’ve priced something, then you can start layering on the various tools like securitization, collateralization, lending, insurance etc on data. These are the two&nbsp;pillars.   Ocean V3 and The New Data&nbsp;Economy <p>Bruce talks about how Ocean spent the first few years thinking about the first problem that existed. How do you share data securely? It basically comes down to access control and Ocean uses blockchain and all the capabilities within blockchain for access control. If you trigger a smart contract correctly, then it will give you access to this resource. That’s what Ocean does, it solves that first problem. That was our first release V1 and&nbsp;V2.</p><p>“Ocean V1 was just about access control, V2 was this concept of computer data, where we acknowledge that data is heavy. It never wants to move. It wants to stay exactly where it’s sitting because that’s the safest place it is. And then you bring an algorithm, to compute to process that data, and then the algorithm just leaves with the data with the results and not the data. And Ocean V3 is solving the second problem, which is the financialization of it and it is the concept of data tokens, where every dataset is encapsulated in a token — both the value of the token and the&nbsp;access.”</p><p>It’s this kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:</a> you can use this data token both for accessing data, but it also represents the value. This interesting approach has now spawned in the Ocean market. “We released Ocean V3 recently, but it’s now spawned a very vibrant ecosystem of people who are scouting for data, who are assessing the value of data as well as people who are essentially doing prediction markets, another word could be speculating on the value of that data. And it’s exciting, we have already 500 datasets, there’s 2 million Ocean locked up in the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>.”</p><p>The interesting part is that the community is figuring out how to price&nbsp;data.</p><p>“We’re seeing that when a new dataset comes out — within one or two hours, the price stabilizes, normally taking no more than six hours now. Because of this datatoken concept on the Ocean Market, you can now price data, and the market will tell you it’s real value. This is a huge innovation because the more datasets we get onto the market, the better it will be for analysing this data and more sophisticated the players will become in pricing that data faster and faster. That’s how markets form. So that solves the second problem we now have using Web 3 technologies, like automated market makers, ERC-20 tokens, the ethereum network, we have the ability to price data and give access control securely. I think that’s revolutionary.”</p> Main players in the Data market: Publishers, consumers, and the ‘stakers’ <p>You could call the data marketplace a three-sided market. If you look at a traditional company like Airbnb: you have Airbnb as the platform provider, and then you have the people who put up the capacity such as the rooms, the other people who are the consumers, the visitors. In Ocean Market, you have a third player. You’ll have the publisher, the consumer, the AI researcher. The publisher is an individual company. On top of that, you’re going to have the staker. This is the person who participates in a prediction market and helps give that data asset a price signal and can speculate on the value and make gains or losses, depending on whether or not their bet is correct how good their analysis tools are. So in Ocean Market, you have three players, you have the publishers, the consumers and the&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>“ I’ve had a lot of conversations with companies who have reached out to us who are interested in Ocean Market. The response has been great, surprisingly great. We’ve realized with the design of the market, you don’t actually don’t need incentives from the project just to publish your dataset. If you are a data hunter and you find a valuable dataset — you publish or help that publisher publish it. Then you stake on it and you’re the winner. You’re either the first or the second staker on that&nbsp;data.”</p> Final Thoughts <p>“I think that we as humans are really bad at understanding the concept of exponential, whether it’s for investing or technological progress. We’re on an exponential curve and now with crypto and blockchain, we brought finance onto an exponential curve. We’re bringing data onto an exponential curve at the pace of innovation,” says&nbsp;Bruce.</p><p>He concludes by quoting Ocean Co-Founder Trent McConaghy. “ He told me very early on when we were kind of throwing ideas around in 2013 or 2014. Trent said ‘One thing I’ve learned is that anything that touches Moore’s Law starts to assume the characteristics of Moore’s law, which is exponential growth.’ That’s what we’re doing, we’re putting a data economy on an exponential curve.”</p><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topic discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>1:18 — 4:57 The journey of Bruce Pon (Founder, Ocean Protocol) from banker to data&nbsp;banker</p><p>4:57 — 8:00 What is&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>8:30 — 11:57 Is data sovereignty real sovereignty?

  <p>New business opportunities require agility from application portfolios. Yet many businesses today are limited in their ability to adapt, often due to their application portfolios being bloated, difficult to change and aligned to the strategy of the past.</p>
<p>Enter the composable business.</p>
<p>A composable business is an organization that delivers business outcomes and rapidly adapts to business change. Think of it as building blocks made from applications to be assembled and rearranged as needed.</p>
<p>“Application leaders are in a unique position to support digital transformation, as the ability to adapt and change applications in the portfolio is central to delivering on the composable business,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/36581">Dennis Gaughan</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>To deliver the future strategy of the organization, application leaders must modernize the application portfolio to ensure it operates at the pace of business change.</p>
 Develop a vision for the composable business 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable/">The composable business</a> will manifest in different ways for different organizations, based on business strategy dynamics and the competitive nature of the market. A critical first step to support this vision is to define what the composable business will look like over the long term.</p>
<p>Ask key questions to help the organization understand the broader market and technology impacts that will inform and influence the composable business, such as:</p>
 
 How will the markets we operate in evolve over the next three to five years, and how will that change the competitive landscape? 
 How does our business strategy and operational structure need to change to reflect the changing market dynamics? 
 What new business models are we pursuing? What new markets do we plan to penetrate? 
 In which areas can we gain competitive advantage by developing capabilities in-house, rather than buying standard capabilities from vendors? 
 
<p>Once a set of longer-term goals have been established based on the current technology landscape and architecture, begin to define the organization’s roadmap to the composable business.</p>
<p>Essential elements of the roadmap include:</p>
 
 A clearly defined set of business outcomes 
 A plan for modernizing the existing application state 
 A vendor strategy 
 A target architecture 
 A plan for adapting the application delivery model 
 A powerful integration platform strategy 
 A mechanism for measuring the realization of business outcomes 
 A risk analysis and mitigation strategy

 Begin the architecture evolution toward PBCs 
<p>Application leaders can support composability through the assembly and combination of application building blocks, also known as packaged business capabilities (PBCs). PBCs deliver more unique and customized application experiences to users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dynamic experience of the composable business will become the prevailing architecture, integration and delivery model for software innovation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PBCs can be sourced from third parties or <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/key-strategies-for-cost-optimization-in-application-design-and-development/">composed internally</a>. They are assembled using their APIs and event streams to create application experiences that are intuitive and can be tailored to individual needs or preferences. This new portfolio is grounded in a mesh app and service architecture (MASA). It defines a new set of application capabilities that can be combined and recombined as business needs shift.</p>
<p>The transition to the composable business is gradual. Over time, more PBC-centric applications will be available from software vendors and marketplaces, and legacy applications will be modernized toward the PBC model. The dynamic experience of the composable business will become the prevailing architecture, integration and delivery model for software innovation.</p>

 ONCHAINID Notifications 
<p>Once an investor updates any of the personal information linked to their ONCHAINID profile, all the relevant parties that have previously KYC’ed the individual will be automatically alerted with a notification. </p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in November 2020.</p>   
	 
		 
			 Why is ONCHAINID Notification important? 
<p>Issuers who are issuing financial instruments have an obligation to identify their investors and confirm their eligibility for the instrument in question. As you know, our products support the issuers in those processes when they issue digital securities.</p>
<p>However, while an investor might be KYC’ed and qualified to subscribe in a security token at its issuance, their status in that respect might evolve and change during their period of holding. As a result, the issuer is required to KYC their investors on a regular basis or possibly whenever their investor’s personal information (e.g. country of residence) changes.</p>
 How does it work? 
<p>So far, for securities issued in traditional private markets, the process of keeping track of these changes in the status and information related to investors is generally quite a heavy, manual and lengthy process. Each counterparty is notified individually, if at all, creating significant risk exposure for issuers.</p>
<p>ONCHAINID Notifications brings efficiency to this process through the use of blockchain identities. Once an investor updates any of the personal information linked to their ONCHAINID profile, all the relevant parties that have previously KYC’ed the individual will be automatically alerted with a notification. The investor does not need to inform all issuers (or their Agent) of those changes.

  <p>Country leadership teams carry significant responsibility for both regional sales achievement and in-country operations in support of the local customer base. But the pandemic has sparked massive disruption to regional markets.</p>
<p>Country managers are now increasingly concerned about customer churn. At headquarters, global executive teams share the same worry: 50% of C-suite execs in companies with more than $100 million in revenue are very concerned about customer churn caused by the economic disruption related to COVID-19, according to the Gartner 2020 Technology Marketing Benchmarks Survey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Market conditions and depressed demand make it imperative to focus on retaining the business you have in hand</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the 2020 Tech Marketing Benchmarks survey did not find that technology marketers share this level of concern. In fact, only 29% of technology marketers reported they are “very concerned” with customer churn.</p>
 [swg_ad id="37599"] 
<p>The disconnect is because marketing teams are still held accountable for driving new business leads into the sales pipeline. The metrics by which<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-market-to-b2b-technology-buyers/"> marketing</a> is measured lag behind reality — the same survey revealed that only 33% of respondents had changed their marketing KPIs in response to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/create-contingency-plans-for-events-canceled-due-to-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>And metrics drive behavior. Only 42% of respondents had taken steps to increase resources for customer retention and expansion as a result of COVID-19 between April and July of 2020.</p>
<p>Although country leadership teams should have goals that focus on new customer acquisition, market conditions and depressed demand make it imperative to focus on retaining the business you have in hand as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drive customer touchpoints at scale through “tech touch” — a programmatic cadence of content, programs and events offered through digital channels</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond just churn prevention, country leadership teams must seize the opportunity to shift attention and resources to focus on expansion within the customer base — which may offer the biggest revenue “opportunity” right now — especially as new prospect acquisition slows.</p>
<p>To do this, country leadership teams should encourage partnership between technology marketers and customer success teams. Marketing should collaborate closely with customer success to design digital outreach throughout the customers’ owning journey to accelerate adoption and customer time to value, both of which will head off churn risk. In times of uncertainty, customer success resources are stretched thin and struggle to scale across the entire customer base.</p>
<p>Marketing can drive customer touchpoints at scale through “tech touch” — a programmatic cadence of content, programs and events offered through digital channels that proactively guide them to success and complement human-powered interactions.</p>
<p>Country leadership must recognize that marketing has a crucial role to play with existing customer <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-product-management-drives-tech-firm-growth/">retention and growth</a> and enable adjustments to marketing KPIs based on the fact that business conditions have changed drastically.</p>
<p>Not making this shift is a missed opportunity to help protect and generate revenue growth by driving expansion within current accounts. If country managers are depending on a global/corporate marketing organization, it is vital they make the case for customer-focused marketing resources for their region.</p>

<p>Om burgers met een laag inkomen en een chronische ziekte of beperkingen te ondersteunen, bieden ruim 300 gemeenten in Nederland een collectieve zorgverzekering aan: de Gemeentepolis.&nbsp; Deze kan via Gezondverzekerd.nl worden aangevraagd. Dankzij de premium licentie van Gezondverzekerd.nl (BS&amp;F) kan de benodigde informatie voor deze aanvragen vanaf nu makkelijk en veilig worden aangeleverd met behulp van de Ockto-app.</p>



<p>Snelle en veilige beoordeling van aanvragen<br>Aan het aanvragen van een Gemeentepolis zijn een aantal voorwaarden verbonden. Zo is deze collectieve zorgverzekering inkomensafhankelijk. Voorheen werden alle benodigde gegevens handmatig gecontroleerd in de Backofficeapplicatie van Gezondverzekerd.nl. Een tijdrovend proces, waarbij communicatie en documenten via post en e-mail werden verstuurd. Door het gebruik van Ockto in het inventarisatieproces kunnen gemeenteambtenaren nu sneller beoordelen of iemand recht heeft op de Gemeentepolis.</p>



<p>Wanneer iemand een aanvraag doet voor de Gemeentepolis wordt hem of haar vanaf nu gevraagd om de benodigde gegevens aan te leveren via de Ockto-app. Met de app worden, na inlog met DigiD de benodigde gegevens opgehaald bij overheidsportalen zoals de Belastingdienst en het UWV. Deze brondata wordt na goedkeuring verstuurd naar de Backofficeapplicatie van Gezondverzekerd.nl. Daar kan de gemeente vervolgens beoordelen of deze persoon, op basis van zijn of haar inkomens- en/of vermogenssituatie, in aanmerking komt voor een Gemeentepolis.</p>



<p>Auke Dirkmaat, Ockto: “We zijn zeer verheugd te zien dat men dit aanvraagtraject door gebruik van de Ockto-app een stuk zelfstandiger doorloopt. Het gemak van de app en de gegevens in één keer goed aangeleverd zorgen voor een aanzienlijke verbetering van dit proces.”</p>



<p>Hertoetsing en snel uitsluitsel<br>Ook kan Ockto worden ingezet bij de hertoetsing van alle burgers die al onder de Gemeentepolis vallen. Gegevens van de Belastingdienst en het UWV kunnen eenvoudig worden aangeleverd. Na het goedkeuren van de aanvraag of hertoetsing wordt er automatisch een beschikking gestuurd naar de burger.</p>



<p>Dit scheelt veel tijd en ook de burger weet snel waar hij of zij aan toe is. Daarnaast kunnen onterechte polissen sneller worden geïdentificeerd. “Het gebruik van Ockto maakt de beoordeling van een aanvraag niet alleen makkelijker voor de gemeente, ook de burger heeft sneller uitsluitsel”, meent Niek Wezenberg, manager bij BS&amp;F.</p>



<p>Over BS&amp;F &amp; de Gemeentepolis<br>De Gemeentepolis is een&nbsp;collectieve verzekering voor mensen met een&nbsp;laag inkomen en mensen met een chronische ziekte of beperking. Deze zorgverzekering wordt aangeboden door ruim 300 gemeenten via Gezondverzekerd.nl. In Nederland bieden bijna alle gemeenten een Gemeentepolis aan.</p>



<p>Bureau BS&amp;F ondersteunt overheden, zorgverzekeraars, zorgaanbieders, patiëntenorganisaties en belangenorganisaties bij het versterken van sociaal beleid, het realiseren van toegang tot zorg en het ondersteunen van kwetsbare mensen. Bijvoorbeeld door het opzetten en beheren van het platform Gezondverzekerd.nl</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/reinwarth">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>Since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, the use of language in public life, in the press, and in everyday life has changed. Terms that were formerly confined to the circles directly affected by them are now much more common. For example, every informed and responsible citizen is now familiar with specific terms from epidemiology and immunology such as “reproduction number” and “herd immunity”.</p>
<p>Another term that has risen to prominence since the beginning of the crisis is “first-line worker”. These workers literally work on the front line. They are often found in retail and hospitality. But this way of working is also prevalent in the manufacturing industry and in customer service. And the current health crisis is rightly drawing attention to the many different types of first-line workers in the healthcare sector.</p>
<p>Whether a doctor or nurse, restaurant server or supermarket employee, whether a specialist in multi-shift operation at the robotized production line of an industrial enterprise or a short-term employee in a promotional campaign in a consumer electronics store, first-line workers all have one thing in common: They all need technical access to corporate resources and most of them use shared devices. In other words, devices that are used by several users one after another or in rotation.</p>
 Balancing efficiency and user experience with security and compliance 
<p>Fast logon and fast user switching (using authentication mechanisms such as RFID chip or biometrics), secure access to all data and systems needed in the current context, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and secure, reliable logoff are essential for first-line workers. The example of a nurse working in shifts who needs immediate yet secure access to patient data in a medical emergency shows how important this can be.</p>
<p>First-line workers were around before the pandemic and there are a lot more than expected. Managing them properly is essential. But while <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/modernizing-iam-solutions-leveraging-new-operating-models-with-the-kuppingercole-identity-fabric">traditional enterprise IAM</a> (Identity and Access Management) is often largely mature in many companies for conventional working models, the specific requirements of these ways of working are sometimes insufficiently covered. The consequences are obvious: lack of efficiency, inadequate security, violation of compliance, but also dissatisfaction and frustration among those affected. The current crisis is putting a spotlight on these issues, highlighting the scale of the challenge and the need for appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>Addressing the topic of first-line workers properly entails a variety of technologies, concepts, and products. These need to be combined to aggregate all the necessary information to enable workers to access whatever resources they need quickly and efficiently. This includes the management of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lc80063">employee identities and authorizations</a>, management of devices, Single Sign-On and Single Sign Off, adaptive and risk-oriented authentication, and proper and fast <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/bc80201">access to all necessary, often critical resources</a>. If the concept of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/search?q=zero+trust&amp;f=r&amp;s=d">Zero Trust Infrastructures</a> comes to mind, you are on the right track.</p>
 Connecting and enabling first line workers 
<p>Appropriate IAM concepts are necessary and essential, but without a comprehensive overall architecture model they cannot solve this problem on their own. The <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lb80204">KuppingerCole Identity Fabric</a>, however, is designed as an overarching paradigm for the design of service-oriented architectures to enable efficient and secure access by all users to all relevant resources. And it integrates identity and access into company-wide infrastructures both for the respective core business and for security, governance, and compliance.</p>
<p>On this basis, the required functionalities can be identified and defined with regard to usability, efficiency, and applicable policies. These well-defined services, which reflect the individual requirements of an organization and its specific first-line workers, enable the right software components to be selected. This includes end-point management, dynamic authorization management, and access management along with multi-factor authentication and others depending on the individual challenges. These building blocks can then be deployed and orchestrated wherever they are needed.</p>
<p>However, it must also be pointed out that technology is not the only obstacle. A common cause of problems in deploying such solutions are the highly unattractive licensing schemes used by many IAM system vendors when it comes to technical offerings for first-line workers. This is what makes it difficult to quickly extend IAM to this user group.</p>
 First-line workers deserve better (including user experience and security) 
<p>The current crisis, new and changing requirements in different industries, but also the preparation for upcoming crises and challenges, require us to provide both stable and agile architectures that support all work models in our organizations. The KuppingerCole Identity Fabric as a concept for key cybersecurity infrastructures in modern, hybrid IT environments allows us to meet today's requirements and the demands of the future. This applies especially to the continually changing way in which our employees, partners and customers communicate with each other and interact with company resources.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding specific requirements for access by first-line workers or generally regarding the management and monitoring of access in our fragmented work environments, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:mr@kuppingercole.com?subject=Managing%20First%20Line%20Workers%20-%20Let%20us%20talk">me</a> or <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/contact">us</a>. First-line workers deserve good and efficient tools, and their organization should provide them with the appropriate level of security and compliance.</p>

  <p>Okta is an Identity Management Platform that takes all the hassle out of authentication and authorization. It’s feature-packed with everything from workforce integrations for G-Suite to the latest version of OAuth 2.0 as-a-service for developers writing their own APIs.</p>

<p>It can sometimes be a daunting task for developers to get started with Okta because of how feature-rich it is.</p>

<p>Introducing the Okta CLI - made by developers for developers. Using the CLI tool, you can go from zero to running an application complete with auth (in the language and framework of your choice) in about five minutes. And, you don’t have to wade through any web-based admin consoles to do it.</p>

 Set Up the Okta CLI 

<p>The <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> is a native command-line application that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Installation on any of these OS’s is a snap, but there are some prerequisites:</p>


  
    
      OS
      Prerequisites
    
  
  
    
      macOS
      <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>
    
    
      Linux
      <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpack</a>
    
    
      Windows
      <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>
    
  


<p>There are simple install directions at <a href="https://cli.okta.com">https://cli.okta.com</a> for your platform.</p>

<p>Here, I show you the command to install on macOS:</p>

   <code>brew cask install oktadeveloper/tap/okta
</code>   

<p>Pretty easy, right?</p>

 Get Started in Under 5 Minutes 

<p>As a developer, in order to make use of Okta, you need an Okta Organization (fondly referred to as an org).</p>

<p>In order to integrate your application with Okta so that your users can authenticate, you need to register your application within Okta.</p>

<p>For your application to work with the registered Okta application, you need to drop in a library for the language (and framework) you’re using.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to configure the library to work with Okta.</p>

<p>In the past, that’s meant bouncing back and forth between the Okta Admin Console and your application as well as finding the right library and configuring it.</p>

<p>Now, it looks like this:</p>

   <code>okta start
</code>   

<p>I want to make this a little more challenging for myself, so I am going to use a .NET sample application since I am a Java developer. Here’s the output of the above command:</p>

 <code>Registering for a new Okta account, if you would like to use an existing account, use 'okta login' instead.

Run this application with:
    dotnet run --project okta-aspnetcore-mvc-example
</code> 

<p>There’s a lot going on here from the humble <code>okta start</code> command, so let’s break it down.</p>

<p>First I see a one-time requirement in order to provision the Okta org.</p>

<p>I put in some minimal information: name, email, and company. In about 20 seconds, a shiny new Okta org is allocated for me and the Okta CLI shows me my Org URL (<code>https://dev-159750.okta.com</code>).</p>

<p>Next, I need to prove that I own the email address I entered. A One-Time Passcode (OTP) is sent to my email address and the Okta CLI waits for me to paste that in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once my email address is verified, the Okta CLI displays a unique link to set my password.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The order-of-operations here is not important. You can set your password before you choose a sample or afterward. But, you should set your password in a timely fashion as that unique URL expires after 24 hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, I see a list of available samples. As of this writing, there are four samples, but we are expanding that list. And, the Okta CLI automatically makes any new samples available in the list. You can register as many samples as you like with your Okta Org.</p>

<p>I chose option 3: <code>ASP.NET Core MVC + Okta</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, I see information about the OIDC Application that was registered in my Okta Org along with instructions to run the downloaded app.</p>

<p>I’m going to follow those instructions and run this sample:</p>

   <code>cd okta-aspnet-core3-sample
dotnet run --project okta-aspnetcore-mvc-example
</code>   

<p>Here’s the output (abbreviated):</p>

   <code>dotnet run --project okta-aspnetcore-mvc-example

Welcome to .NET Core 3.1!

SDK Version: 3.1.402

      Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
...
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you know you could run .NET on macOS? What a world! Simply run: <code>brew cask install dotnet-sdk</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can browse over to: <code>https://localhost:5001</code> to see this basic app in action.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: You may want to use an incognito or private window to authenticate in a separate context. Also, you’ll see a certificate warning from the browser as it’s likely you don’t have a TLS cert installed for <code>localhost</code>. You can bypass this warning to view the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Click Sign In and you’re redirected over to Okta to authenticate. After authenticating, you’re redirected back to the app and it knows who you are!</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: If you didn’t set your password earlier, you’ll need to now. Follow the unique link shown in the Okta CLI output. In my case, it was: <code>https://dev-159750.okta.com/welcome/drp7UBGB_GVjeHp_5Jbs</code></p>
</blockquote>

 Looking Under the Hood of the Okta CLI 

<p>I don’t know much at all about .NET programming. I couldn’t tell you the difference between .NET Core and ASP.NET or the differences between 3 and 4 (was <a>.NET 5 just released?</a>). However, in less than five minutes, I had a running app that I could authenticate to using Okta!</p>

<p>The samples’ architecture is the secret sauce behind this capability. If you check out where the .NET sample lives, you can see the <a href="https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-aspnet-core3-sample/blob/master/okta-aspnetcore-mvc-example/appsettings.json">appsettings.json</a> template file:</p>

   <code>{
  ...
  "Okta": {
    "OktaDomain": "${CLI_OKTA_ORG_URL}",
    "ClientId": "${CLI_OKTA_CLIENT_ID}",
    "ClientSecret": "${CLI_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET}"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Part of the work that the Okta CLI does is to replace these values with the actual settings from your Okta org when the sample is set up and the Okta application is provisioned.</p>

<p>We wanted to keep the Okta CLI as flexible as possible, so it grabs the sample you choose from GitHub and walks all of the plain text files in the project looking for replacement parameters. The Okta CLI has no specific knowledge of a particular language or framework, which makes it easy to work with any language and framework.</p>

<p>Each sample also has some meta-information contained in <a href="https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-aspnet-core3-sample/blob/master/.okta/sample-config.yaml">.okta/sample-config.yaml</a>:</p>

   <code>oauthClient:
  redirectUris:
    - https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback
    - http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback
  applicationType: web

directions: |+2
  Okta configuration written to: okta-aspnetcore-mvc-example/appsettings.json
  Don't EVER commit okta-aspnetcore-mvc-example/appsettings.json into source control
  Run this application with:
      dotnet run --project okta-aspnetcore-mvc-example
</code>   

<p>For the .NET Core app, it describes the type of Okta Client needed, which in this case is an OAuth 2.0 Web application. It also lists the <code>redirectUris</code> Okta needs in order to integrate with the application.</p>

<p>The <code>directions</code> section is what’s output to the command-line once the application is provisioned in Okta and configured locally.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, you won’t have to deal with the sample code on GitHub directly, but it’s useful to understand what’s happening under the hood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New to OAuth 2.0? Check out this post to get started: <a>An Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOTE: When you run <code>okta start</code>, your Okta Org URL and API Token are stored in: <code>~/.okta/okta.yaml</code>. It’s the information in this file that the Okta CLI uses to perform operations on your Okta Org, like provisioning new OAuth 2.0 Clients.</p>

 More Stuff You Can Do with the Okta CLI 

<p>So far, this post has shown you how to get started with the Okta CLI. What if you already have an Okta Org? What if you already have code you’re working on and want to integrate it with Okta?</p>

 Running with an Existing Org 

<p>Want to hook up the Okta CLI to your existing Okta Org? No problem! Run:</p>

   <code>okta login
</code>   

<p>You’re asked to enter your Org URL and an API token. This information is then stored in <code>~/.okta/okta.yaml</code> and is used with other <code>okta</code> commands.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can create an API Token by following <a>these instructions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

 Configure Your Existing Application 

<p>Let’s say you have a Spring Boot Project you’ve been working on. You could easily integrate Okta into your project by doing the following:</p>

 
   Add the Okta Spring Boot integration to your project’s <code>pom.xml</code> file: 
 

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.5.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

 
   Put some placeholders in <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>: 
 

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=${CLI_OKTA_ISSUER}
okta.oauth2.client-id=${CLI_OKTA_CLIENT_ID}
okta.oauth2.client-secret=${CLI_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET}
</code>   

 
   Create a metadata file in your project at: <code>.okta/sample-config.yaml</code>: 
 

   <code>oauthClient:
  redirectUris:
    - http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta
  applicationType: web
</code>   

 
   Run <code>okta start</code>: 
 

   <code>Configuring a new OIDC Application, almost done:
Created OIDC application, client-id: 0oa6mv2tHQ1IPbG2r5d5
</code>   

<p>You can see that the placeholders in your <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file have been replaced:</p>

   <code>$ cat src/main/resources/application.properties

okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-159750.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oa6mv2tHQ1IPbG2r5d5
okta.oauth2.client-secret=tgIdHYX4EvRUlt0HnuRV-y_9qlr9C1IM4C9Z-g17
</code>   

<p>At this point, you could fire up your app as normal and have it fully integrated with Okta for authentication:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>The important bits to set up a project for use with the Okta CLI are:</p>

 
   Add the <code>OKTA_CLI_*</code> placeholder values to the configuration files that make sense for your language and framework 
   Add the <code>.okta/sample-config.yaml</code> file with the right application type for your language and framework 
   Run <code>okta start</code> to provision and Okta app and update all the placeholders in your config file(s) 
 

<blockquote>
  <p>The easiest way to see what configuration you need for your language and framework is to visit the samples found in the <a href="https://github.com/okta-samples">okta-samples</a> GitHub org.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, the available placeholder values are:</p>


  
    
      Placeholder
      Description
    
  
  
    
      CLI_OKTA_ORG_URL
      The base URL to your Okta Org
    
    
      CLI_OKTA_ISSUER
      The URL to your Okta OAuth 2.0 <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/">Authorization Server</a>
    
    
      CLI_OKTA_CLIENT_ID
      The client ID set by Okta for <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-auth-code/overview/">web</a>, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-auth-code-pkce/overview/">native</a>, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-auth-code-pkce/overview/">browser</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-client-creds/overview/">service</a> type apps
    
    
      CLI_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET
      The client secret set by Okta for <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-auth-code/overview/">web</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-client-creds/overview/">service</a> type apps
    
    
      CLI_OKTA_REVERSE_DOMAIN
      The reversed domain name, commonly used for mobile application redirect schemes
    
  


 Adding Samples for Okta CLI 

<p>We’d love your contributions! If you want to set up a new sample, create a new repo that has the naming convention: <code>okta-&lt;language and or framework name&gt;-sample</code>. Ideally, it’d be a language and framework that we don’t already have. But, if you want to submit a variation on an existing sample, we’d accept that too - just give it a unique name.</p>

 Watch the Okta CLI in Action 

<p>We’ve created a few screencasts to show the Okta CLI in action. The videos below show how to use <code>okta start</code> with Spring Boot, Angular, and React Native!</p>

<p>By now, you’ve probably read the announcement about the creation of the <a href="https://jans.io">Janssen Project</a> at the <a href="https://linuxfoundation.org">Linux Foundation</a>. This was the culmination of many months of collaborative planning–we started in early March 2020, before the pandemic. You may be wondering, why did we do it? What does it mean for Gluu? Following is a discussion of some of the thoughts behind the decision. </p>
 Doubling Down on Open Source 
<p>I’m a big fan of open source software development. But does it make sense to launch a business around an open source project? And if so, what is the best way to do it? To answer these questions, in 2018 I launched a podcast called <a href="https://opensourceunderdogs.com">Open Source Underdogs</a>. After publishing 55 episodes, I’m more convinced than ever that it makes sense for identity and access management software–an infrastructure based on open Internet standards–to leverage the open source development methodology. However, I also concluded that it was beneficial to make the boundary at Gluu more clear between what is open source, and what is commercial. Moving the project to the Linux Foundation helps to achieve this goal.  Companies or organizations can trust that the Janssen project will always be open source. And we’ll do our best to make sure that the community is vibrant enough to drive Janssen to maintain a leadership position among identity and access management platforms. </p>
 Better Code 
<p>The paramount goal at Gluu is to write the best open source identity platform in the world.  Increasing the transparency of the development process, aligning with the <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>, and adopting other best practices in the development of our software–out in the open–will help us improve the quality of the software. Yes we could do this on our own. But collaborative project governance will help to keep us focused on the things that are important. </p>
 Innovation 
<p>Digital identity and security are evolving as rapidly as the devices we use, and the weaknesses hackers seek to exploit.  Gluu Server 4.2 is already the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">most certified</a> OpenID Connect provider currently available. The <a href="https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-auth-server">Janssen Authorization Server</a>, a fork of Gluu Server 4.2, is starting from an advanced position. But this battle is not won. Victory will require a long sustained effort of many years. Innovation is the essential complement to quality. The open source development methodology results in faster innovation for core infrastructure. But simply changing the license on your software is not enough! To put a project into a higher gear, you need to engage the community. We’re hoping that the move to Janssen will more effectively accomplish this.</p>
 Community Governance 
<p>For the last ten years, the project has been governed through the equivalent of enlightened despotism. This made sense because the goals of the project, and the business goals of Gluu were roughly aligned.  However, for the long-term benefit of the project, we need to democratize. Other people and organizations who invest in the project should have a say in the direction of the project. The Technical Steering Committee is defined by the <a href="https://github.com/JanssenProject/home/blob/main/community/charter.md">Project Charter</a> to provide this governance. </p>
 Developer Engagement 
<p>The launch of the Janssen project is an opportunity for us to become more responsive to the needs of the developer community. How we build the software needs to become a more open and collaborative process. It’s going to take some work to get there, but we’re committed to make it happen. We plan to make more developer friendly choices. If you have any ideas for how to do this, please share! </p>
 Ecosystem 
<p>When it comes to the development of core infrastructure software, no company is an island. A group of organizations with an aligned economic interest provide a solid foundation to sustain an open source project in the long term.  Gluu will continue its mission to productize open source software, making it more consumable by enterprises. The Janssen project software is the critical component of that offering.  But other companies can develop a commercial value proposition that aligns with their business goals.  The more companies that have a stake in the success of Janssen, the better.</p>
 Cloud Native 
<p>Companies always have to look out for disruptive technologies. Cloud native is the most disruptive infrastructure technology since virtualization.  By nature and doctrines, the cloud native community prefers open source components. So if we want to position Janssen as the ideal authentication and authorization component of a cloud native stack, it has to be open source. And to the extent that moving the project to the Linux Foundation strengthens Janssen’s position as an open source platform, it helps us build trust with the cloud native community. At the same time, we have to recognize that there are still organizations that are not ready to make this leap. So while we are “all in” on cloud native, we also want to provide a bridge to get to the other side of the river. Janssen will implement cloud native design principles–many of which make sense intrinsically, no matter what kind of infrastructure you’re running. But at the same time, we are not dogmatic about how organizations can use the software. </p>
 Gluu 5 
<p>With the introduction of Janssen, the line between open source and Gluu becomes more clear. Gluu Server 5 will be introduced in the first quarter of 2021. This gives us an opportunity to do something we’ve been trying to do for many years: move to an open core business model, where a vendor adds value on top of an open source software distribution.  Gluu Server 5 will be the first Gluu distribution to feature the Janssen Auth-Server as the core security engine. It will also feature a new and improved admin web interface. The Gluu management team believes that licensing this new distribution will greatly improve monetization, which will result in more budget for open source research and development.  We will continue to patch Gluu Server 4.2.x until it’s end-of-life in December 2022. </p>
 Gluu Cloud 
<p>Janssen’s focus on cloud native design principles will come in handy, as Gluu is planning to launch a single-tenant hosted service called “Gluu Cloud.” People have been asking us to launch a hosted service for years. It’s not that we weren’t listening. Sometimes it just takes a while to act on all these good ideas. One of the benefits of launching Gluu Cloud is that the experience we gain will have a positive feedback loop for cloud native features in Janssen. Hopefully other vendors around the world will also launch a similar service in their markets–and join the Janssen Project!  Using the cloud native stack, and the new Janssen <a href="https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-config-api">config-api</a>, hosted providers can now automate the entire auth-server provisioning process, and build their own business specific, branded interfaces.  Look for Gluu Cloud Q2 2021.</p>
 Janssen VIP Support 
<p>Some current or future Gluu customers may not want to move to the commercially licensed Gluu Server 5. They may want to stick with the freedom afforded by the permissive license of an open source distribution.  The good news is that Gluu has got your back. We will continue to offer a VIP support package (for the Janssen distribution) so you can open private issues in our support forums, get an SLA on the response to support issues (e.g. one hour for severity one), communicate on our Rocket chat channels, and schedule ad hoc Zoom calls. </p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Here at Gluu we are grateful to the Linux Foundation for helping us to launch Janssen. It’s been a lot of work! I truly believe that by making the software more open, we’ll both have a more positive impact in the world, and that we’ll achieve Gluu’s growth objectives.

<p><a href="http://streetcred.id">Streetcred ID</a> is thrilled to announce we have joined the <a href="http://www.sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a> Network as a Steward. As a Sovrin Steward, Streetcred ID will collaborate with the <a href="http://sovrin.org/stewards">75+ other Stewards</a> who maintain the integrity of the Sovrin&nbsp;Network.</p><p>It isn’t a secret that trust on the internet is broken. There isn’t a way to prove who you are, claims about a product, or even exchange verified personal information online in a privacy-preserving and secure way — until now. With the advent of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and the Sovrin Network, individuals, organizations, and connected things can exchange digital identity credentials with the assurance that they are in control of their personal data, not a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>But the Sovrin Network is more than this. It is an identity metasystem that allows for ad hoc workflows and processes, making ‘identity’ in the digital world function, for the first time, similarly to the way it does in the physical world. Streetcred provides the best way to integrate the Sovrin metasystem into any application, allowing for flexibility of integration into any workflows and/or processes.</p><p>Sovrin Stewards play an important role in the maintenance and governance of the Sovrin Network which includes running the network’s validator nodes. The diversity among the Stewards — their geographic location, industry, and type of organization — ensures the Sovrin Network is not controlled by any one institution, government, or industry.</p><p>“The individuals that make up the Streetcred ID team include some of the earliest advocates of the Sovrin Network,” says Heather Dahl, Executive Director &amp; CEO of Sovrin Foundation. “The Streetcred team has been influential in providing significant code contributions to the Sovrin and SSI communities, and we are thrilled to include them as one of the Sovrin Stewards.”</p><p>Besides the contribution of core infrastructure to the Sovrin Network, we believe other contributions are vital to the growth of the self-sovereign identity community as well. In addition to the open-source code contributions Streetcred is known for, we are allocating resources to standards development, governance working groups, and other task&nbsp;forces.</p><p>We are a team of passionate self-sovereign identity advocates who believe that decentralized identity technology should be extremely easy to integrate into any application. It started back in 2018 when our CTO Tomislav Markovski built the Agent Framework (<a href="https://medium.com/streetcred-id/agentframework-for-net-joins-hyperledger-aries-14aba357da41">recently contributed</a> to the Hyperledger Aries project) which quickly became one of the most popular ways to build SSI agents. And we’re excited to share what we’re working on next, which we believe will become the most popular way to build SSI agents going forward! Stay&nbsp;tuned…</p><p>About Streetcred ID</p><p>Streetcred ID partners with innovators around the world to help them easily and rapidly integrate decentralized identity into any application. Run by a team of experts in self-sovereign digital identity, Streetcred’s unique combination of developer tools and advisory is trusted by industries from rural farming to global banks alike.

<p>Before the word ‘elephant’ was broadly used, how would one describe the big, leathery&nbsp;animal?</p>Source: J. Himmelfarb (artist G. Renee&nbsp;Guzlas)<p>Each of these people call the elephant something different because they each have a different perspective. When you think about it, an elephant really is like a big wall with a snake and spears coming out of its face, trees for legs, and a rope-like tail. Without a concise name for the sum of its parts, its meaning can be communicated, although imperfectly, by a description of each part individually¹.</p>The most reproduced cartoon in the history of the New&nbsp;Yorker.<p>Similarly, there is a new category of technology and business solutions that seeks to solve the proverbial “dog on the internet” identity problem for individuals, organizations, and connected devices. Most often called ‘SSI’ (for ‘self-sovereign identity’) or ‘decentralized identity’, these terms are often used in the same way ‘elephant’ is used — with a wealth of meaning and nuance not apparent to beginners. A review of the different terms used to reference SSI provides a helpful introduction.</p> Naming the&nbsp;Category <p>‘SSI’ is the noun I’m using throughout this post to reference this new category of solutions, although there are three primary candidates used in the market today, each with a different emphasis.</p> Self-sovereign identity <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a movement that claims digital identity should be just as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation. SSI is the combination of decentralized identity and trust over IP (both defined below) but also encompasses other technologies and business solutions to enable its purpose. ‘Self-sovereign identity’ was the first category-defining term to catch on, and therefore the most widely used today. But the first terms to catch on are not always the best nor the longest-lasting; groups at industry conferences² have even convened to try to come up with an alternative to ‘SSI’, to no avail. <a href="http://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> is a nonprofit that champions this name with its mission “identity for&nbsp;all”.</p><p>Many governments, actual sovereigns (noun), strongly dislike the term ‘sovereign’ (adjective). Businesses seeking to sell SSI solutions to governments often steer clear as well. While the name ‘SSI’ does a good job at describing the human application and aspiration of decentralized identity technologies, it isn’t clear to most people how B2B and IoT use cases fit in this framework. Finally, I’ve <a href="https://medium.com/@rileyparkerhughes/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">spoken before</a> about how the term is too tightly associated with the blockchain world.</p><p>Some of the problems associated with the word ‘sovereign’ could go away if ‘SSI’ becomes the de facto term as I’m using it throughout this post. As identity expert Drummond Reed frequently points out, we use acronyms every day whose full names we don’t know — ATM, SMS, HTTP, ROTC, AIDS, OTC, FAQ or even GEICO or AT&amp;T, for example (if you knew the full names for all of those, kudos&nbsp;😊).</p> Decentralized identity <p>‘Decentralized identity’ is the second most-used term to describe the category. Decentralized identity’s emphasis is much more technical in nature and seems to focus on traditional IAM use cases. <a href="http://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) is the primary industry association &amp; standards body championing this&nbsp;term.</p><p>The word ‘decentralized’ can feel a bit vague because it describes what SSI is not (ie, not centralized) but doesn’t explain what it is. For that reason, one needs to explain the benefits of decentralization separately:</p>  Locus of control: Accessing data from centralized databases, as occurs with other identity tech, requires access and permission from the database administrator — not necessarily consent from the subject of the data. Thus, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/software-vendor-says-data-breach-exposed-nearly-28-million-texas-drivers-license-records/ar-BB1b022l">data breaches</a> and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dmv-drivers-license-data-database-integrity-department-motor-vehicles-1458141">misuse of data</a> have led to people demanding <a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/01/21/we-need-to-own-our-data-as-a-human-right-and-be-compensated-for-it">ownership of their data</a>. With SSI, the data subject is the one with control to consent to sharing of their&nbsp;data.  Autonomy: As companies die and policies change, it’s helpful to avoid single points of failure. SSI wallets are transportable between different vendors, avoiding vendor lock-in. More on autonomy <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">here</a> and wallet portability <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">here</a>.  Public key infrastructure (PKI): Much of SSI hinges on public/private key cryptography. Trust in traditional PKI systems is rooted in certificate authorities. Identifiers are rented out by ICANN via the DNS system — a costly and centralized approach to PKI. Blockchains and other technologies enable decentralized PKI upon which SSI can be&nbsp;built.  <p>On one hand, ‘decentralized identity’ doesn’t capture the ideals of autonomy and existence that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">this blog post</a> and much of the industry appreciates about the term ‘self-sovereign’. On the other hand, organizations and connected devices don’t have their own autonomy — they must be controlled by people — so ‘decentralized identity’ may be a better fit for those use cases. In addition, while SSI decentralizes power associated with identity, it centralizes the storage and access to it (in a digital wallet instead of various databases across the web), which may make ‘decentralized’ a confusing word from a user experience perspective.</p> Trust over&nbsp;IP <p>Trust over IP (ToIP) is the newest term used to describe the category. It’s less focused on the traditional authentication/access management/directory services definition of digital identity and more focused on trustable data/credentials. This is a more attractive term than ‘sovereign’ for governments; John Jordan, ED of Trust Services for the government of British Columbia, coined the term and is the current leader of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a>, which focuses on building governance frameworks for trust ecosystems.</p><p>Just like ‘Voice over IP’ (VoIP) standardized a way to securely relay audio over the internet, so too does ‘Trust over IP’ seek to standardize a way to share trustable data over the internet. But the word ‘trust’ is fraught with baggage in today’s society and has caused pushback from the identity community and beyond. It’s too early to tell whether the term ‘ToIP’ will catch on more broadly and how the market will&nbsp;react.</p> Other terms for&nbsp;SSI <p>In addition to the category-defining names above, you may hear this technology referred to in a number of other, more niche ways. Like the elephant example I opened this post with, each of the following names refers to a specific characteristic of SSI which, taken together, give us a more complete&nbsp;picture.</p>The term used sometimes depends on which role’s perspective is being considered, as well as with whom that participant is interacting. Portable identity <p>SSI enables data portability, which has led to it sometimes being called ‘portable identity’. Portable comes from the Latin portare meaning carry, which is also behind the word transport or port. It really means that you can take something from one place or context to&nbsp;another.</p><p>Our real-world identity is portable. I can take my driver’s license from the DMV and the context of public roadways to the financial sector and get access to banking services. I can take my university transcript from the education domain to an employer to show my qualifications for a job. SSI makes this possible online. Issuers of credentials, in my experience, feel this dynamic most strongly; after all, anything they issue can be taken and shared with other parties by the holder if they so&nbsp;choose.</p> Multi-source identity <p>My physical, leather wallet has several credentials inside from a number of different sources. The SSI wallet on my phone is the same way; any number of organizations can issue credentials to it. I can then share information from any combination of them to prove things about myself; thus the identity I’m presenting can be comprised of multiple&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Despite its strengths, multi-source identity falls short of describing some of the other important properties of SSI. For example, a Facebook Wallet or other proprietary, centralized system could be used as the basis for a multi-source identity system that provides virtually no autonomy or control to the end-user³. For more on how ‘multi-source’ relates to ‘self-sovereign’, check out a great blog post<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Self-managed credentials <p>While ‘multi-source’ describes how credentials get into a wallet, ‘self-managed’ alludes to how credentials are controlled, stored, and shared. This shouldn’t imply that each end-user must hold their own keys or worry about storing their credentials locally — they could theoretically contract that out to a vendor or configure some AI to assist — but it does mean that the end-user is the one in the driver’s&nbsp;seat.</p><p>You may see ‘self-owned identity’ used instead of ‘self-managed’, but you won’t see that from me or most of my peers. Although many of the implications of ‘self-owned’ (possession, control, accountability) are common with ‘self-managed’ or ‘self-controlled’, the legal construct of ‘ownership’ (property rights, right to sell, exclusivity, etc) is a dangerous one in relation to identity⁴. Because of these nuances, ‘self-managed’ and its variations aren’t widely&nbsp;used.</p> User-controlled proofs <p>The term ‘user-controlled proofs’ is a yet unadopted term coined by Kim Cameron, author of <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">“The Laws of Digital Identity”</a>, seeking to be a bit more technically accurate than terms like ‘self-sovereign’. Indeed, in an SSI model, people not only collect credentials from multiple sources, but also share information from those credentials in the form of a ‘proof’. Those proofs can be verified independently, virtually, and instantly by anyone they’re shared with. While a verifier can specify their requirements in a request to a user, the user has control of whether and how they&nbsp;respond.</p><p>User-controlled proofs is a good term to describe the holder’s perspective of the interaction they have with the verifier. However it’s quite technical and would likely face adoption challenges when presented to the average identity&nbsp;holder⁵.</p> LESS Identity <p>Recently coined by <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/less-identity-65f65d87f56b">Tim Bouma</a>, Legally-enabled Self-sovereign (LESS) Identity <a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/can-less-be-more/">stands in contrast</a> to the ‘crypto-anarchist’ notion of a trustless self-sovereign identity⁶. LESS implies that the identity presented to a verifier is backed by a legal framework. Perhaps it’s a credential issued by a government or regulated institution. Or maybe there’s an existing legal framework that’s represented with a credential.</p><p>LESS enables verifiers to build trust beyond just the cryptographic assurance of a credential’s validity. Much of the work of the ToIP Foundation on governance frameworks is seeking to reinforce this notion. All of the projects I’m aware of with real traction are LESS identity.</p> Life-like identity <p>In <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">Trinsic’s introductory SSI post</a>, I explain how real-world human identity is the combination of intrinsic (Who am I? How do I identify myself?) and extrinsic (How does the state identify me? What does my university say that I have achieved?) factors. Because that’s how the real-world works, I love the name ‘life-like identity’ to describe SSI. To drive the point home, continue that logical train of thought to ‘login with Google’. Wouldn’t it be weird if instead of buying from a store directly, there was a Google representative at every register who authenticated you and mediated the transaction? Especially if they were also recording everything you say and do and sending it back to their boss to be reviewed and analyzed. That would never fly in the real world. And I don’t think it’ll be the norm online anymore in 10 years&nbsp;either.</p><p>Life-like identity is unfortunately not widely-used, but in many ways, it is a good umbrella term for everything else we’ve talked about in this post. This is really what we’re trying to create with this technology; solutions that respect human dignity in the interactions they have daily, just like exist in person. For more on this term, check out<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml"> this&nbsp;post</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>‘Self-sovereign identity’ is an imperfect name for an imperfect, but rapidly growing and promising new category of technology and business solutions. I think it’s the best term on the table; but ultimately, the way to refer to the category will be defined over time as the dust settles through real-world deployments. The name that will emerge will likely not be the first one, but the one with the least negative baggage that balances being specific to the technology but broad enough to encompass all its variations.</p><p>Taken collectively, each of the names listed in this post overlap with others in interesting ways, creating a more full picture of SSI. For example, could you have SSI without multi-source identity? Or without user-controlled proofs? Could this system ever work unless it was legally-enabled? And if we succeed at adopting SSI ubiquitously but it doesn’t bring more autonomy and dignity to our interactions online as we do in real life, did we really&nbsp;succeed?</p><p>If you enjoyed this post, reach out to me on LinkedIn and check out <a href="http://www.trinsic.id">Trinsic</a>, the easiest way to get started with&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>Thanks to Lynn Nichols, Anna Johnson, Phil Windley, Kaliya Young, Juan Caballero, Timothy Ruff, and Josh Welty for giving input on this&nbsp;post.</p><p>Footnotes</p>  The elephant example is fun, but this phenomenon isn’t just found in cartoons; examples are also found throughout the world. Look at religions for example. The central figure of Christianity is called a variety of names in the Bible, including Savior, Son of God, Shepherd, Messiah, and more. These names each communicate different aspects of the meaning assigned to the 5-letter word ‘Jesus’. In Islam, God is believed to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Islam">99&nbsp;names</a>.  <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">IIW 30</a>, book of proceedings, page 275 for notes on the discussion  Of course, Facebook could also build a wallet that supported individual privacy and autonomy if they wanted to! They’re just the boogyman for this&nbsp;example.  I own my car, so I can legally sell it (or parts of it) or rent it out in exchange for money. Can I sell my identity? Or rent out my driver’s license? No, I can’t. Nor should I be able to; identity and personal data are not property to be bargained with, but an intrinsic part of the self. Bodily autonomy is a closer metaphor for credentials than property ownership. Can you legally chop off and sell your arm? No, but you still generally have autonomy to act of your own volition with regard to your own body. So you don’t own your body; you use it, control it, etc. — likewise for your identity. For a better analysis on this, see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/06/26/why-data-ownership-is-the-wrong-approach-to-protecting-privacy/">here</a>.  One objection some people take to this term is the word ‘user’ which is seen in some circles as objectifying or dehumanizing. “Only two industries have users, drugs and tech,” so the saying goes. On the other hand, I’m using a keyboard to type this sentence. Any word has baggage if you look at it too&nbsp;closely.  In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzM_Brpk95E&amp;t=2352s">talk early this year</a>, Christopher Allen urges the community to keep the trustless identity in mind to keep in mind for more vulnerable populations who are disenfranchised by the legal regimes of which they’re a&nbsp;part.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/ssi-has-an-identity-problem-10b6f0617597">SSI has an Identity Problem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic">Trinsic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Given the interest blockchain has garnered over the last several years, claiming other things are more interesting is not an insignificant statement. And yet it’s true; as useful as blockchain is for SSI, it’s nowhere near as interesting as:</p>  The impact on the&nbsp;internet  The benefits of technical standards  The economic opportunity for early innovators  <p>At the end of this post, I’ll explain what blockchain is useful for, and how it catalyzed SSI.</p> The Impact on the&nbsp;Internet <p>Self-sovereign identity is a movement based on the premise that digital identity should be as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation.</p><p>Think of self-sovereign identity like a coin with a philosophical premise on each&nbsp;side.</p>  Intrinsic identity: As humans, we have an existence, dignity, worth, and an identity independently of anyone or anything. We have agency to act for ourselves to be who we&nbsp;are.  Extrinsic identity: We live not independently, but in the presence of other people, organizations, things, cultures, and environments with which we must interact to get along in the world. Some degree of trust is a prerequisite to interaction, and identification is a prerequisite of trust. Therefore, we need identification to get along in the&nbsp;world.  <p>Like the serfs of medieval Europe who depended on their feudal lords for existence, we too have relied on technology monoliths to provide our digital existence. Eventually, the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance"> Renaissance</a> broke down feudal structures and gave way to an ever-more egalitarian society. Likewise, self-sovereign identity gives people an independent digital existence wherein they have complete agency, and outside of which they negotiate as peers. In an age when<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322620145_Data_is_power_Towards_additional_guidance_on_profiling_and_automated_decision-making_in_the_GDPR"> data is power</a>, this is more important than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>For example, imagine a world where your physical wallet isn’t held by you, but by a corporation; using a card, license, or other document would require authentication and permission from that company. A representative from that company would need to be present everywhere you want to use your wallet, from traffic stops to bars, from your school library to the TSA, and everything in between. While this might sound ludicrous at first glance, this is the way we live online right now, and it’s the reason big tech is boiling in antitrust hot&nbsp;water.</p>Wallet by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@emkal?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Emil Kalibradov</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>Because we control our own real-world identity, we can independently engage in transactions with peers. With sufficient paper documents, ability to travel, and legal protections, just about anything I’m eligible for is accessible to me¹. This is the kind of place the internet can become, too, but with added privacy and convenience superpowers. It’s hard to overstate the impact of this change, and surely it will evolve in ways we can’t predict. But like the Renaissance’s effect in the West, SSI will surely empower people everywhere² and make the internet a better&nbsp;place.</p> The benefits of technical standards <p>Technical standards unlock vast amounts of value when adopted. Take the Bluetooth standard for example. How many different kinds of headsets, speakers, and connected devices have been created because of bluetooth? Bluetooth created a marketplace for cordless, connected devices, giving consumers choice of product and preventing a single monopoly from forming. We can also look at the SMTP standard that allows email to be sent to and from any number of different email providers. It’s hard to imagine the world without these and many more important standards.</p>Bluetooth devices by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Brett Jordan</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>Historically there’s been no standard way to exercise one’s extrinsic identity online. Think about it: How would you prove your legal name online? Or that you live at a certain place or graduated from a certain school? Or even that you’re a human? This is precisely the purpose of a new standard: verifiable credentials. But beyond providing a standardized way to prove things online, verifiable credentials actually have the potential to revolutionize the exchange of data globally, between all kinds of stakeholders.</p><p>In his recent piece on how verifiable credentials are really more like verifiable containers, <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">Timothy Ruff explains</a> how shipping containers standardized a container that could transfer seamlessly from boat to train to truck which reduced shipping costs astronomically (ie, interoperability between vehicles). Verifiable credentials promise to bring as revolutionary a transformation to the data economy as shipping containers brought to logistics. The sources, subjects, and recipients of data in an ecosystem enjoy interoperability and avoid being locked in to a particular vendor or&nbsp;process.</p><p>Standards always take some time to catch on, but when the infrastructure investments and adoption mechanisms reach their inflection point, there will be an explosion in innovation and adoption, which is the third awesome thing about self-sovereign identity.</p> The economic opportunity <p>Suppose you wanted to engage in a digital transaction wherein you’ll receive some special service if you can prove that you’re a veteran. How would you do it? The time and effort required to come up with such a proof, and the work by the counterparty to verify your claim is legitimate, are considered transaction costs. If transaction costs are greater than the perceived benefit of the service, the transaction will never be completed. But if transaction costs can be reduced, transactions will increase commensurately.</p><p>This is what happened to the ride-hailing industry when Uber &amp; Lyft entered the market. In 2010, taxis and limos controlled a $4.4B market in the USA. Uber entered the market to accomplish one purpose: reduce transaction costs to hail a ride. Uber made it easier to find a ride, increased the trust in the driver, made fares transparent/upfront, and took care of the payment, all of which reduced the transaction costs for getting from point A to point B. By 2019, the ride hailing industry exploded to a $44B industry — a 10x increase in total market size, just by reducing the costs to transact in that&nbsp;market³.</p><p>Likewise, when it’s easy to prove things about yourself and verify things about others, the already massive <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/identity-verification-market-worth--12-8-billion-by-2024--exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-300849572.html">$6B</a> identity verification market and <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/identity-and-access-management-iam#:~:text=The%20global%20Identity%20and%20Access,13.1%25%20from%202019%20to%202025.">$10B</a> identity &amp; access management market will explode into massive, multi-hundred billion dollar ecosystems.</p> Network effects <p>But the truly incredible opportunity lies in a little-understood theory about network effects. Network effects are typically understood as the increased network value provided to its participants as the number of participants increases.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law"> Metcalfe’s law</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%27s_law"> Reed’s law</a>, and other theories seek to explain this mathematically.</p><p>Dr. Sam Smith wrote a tremendous<a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586"> paper</a> that takes this analysis to another level; when two separate networks can cooperate, the combination of the two networks can be greater than the sum of each. In other words, if the networks can share a common utility, the growth of one network benefits the other. Let’s look at an example of&nbsp;this.</p><p>In the early days of the internet, the growth of<a href="http://match.com"> </a>Match.com, WebMD, and Yahoo contributed to the growth of Amazon. Why? Because Amazon’s biggest barrier to growth wasn’t the supply of books, but the number of people who were online⁴. As more users accrued to<a href="http://match.com"> </a>Match.com, many of those users would also end up browsing Amazon. The growth of one network (Match.com) contributed to the growth of another network (Amazon) because they share common utilities (internet connection, personal computer, etc.). And as the networks of each application grew, the underlying protocol network (the internet) grew as well, which caused new applications to appear. This is the power of building on a protocol with common utilities.</p>Applications grow as the underlying utilities are adopted and visa-versa<p>What this means for innovators</p><p>Any products that are built on top of SSI protocols today will gain value in two&nbsp;ways:</p>  Growth of the product&nbsp;itself  Growth of other&nbsp;products  <p>That means if you’re building an SSI app to optimize food supply chains, your app will benefit from the efforts of companies building more secure medical records management, and that will benefit from improved KYC in financial services, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Your business will grow just because it exists provided other businesses are built on SSI. The time to build the world’s next billion-dollar companies is now.<a href="http://trinsic.id"> Trinsic</a> is the best platform to get you started fast &amp; scale with&nbsp;you.</p> So How About Blockchain? <p>Blockchain is just a technology. Technology is not interesting in and of itself because it is a means to an end — the interesting question will always be what does this technology enable me to&nbsp;do.</p> What does blockchain do in&nbsp;SSI? <p>In well-architected self-sovereign identity architectures like <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a> and <a href="https://veres.one/">Veres One</a>, the blockchain is used primarily as a decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) for identifying credential issuers. Thoughtful skeptics point out that existing PKI systems could be substituted, and blockchain could be removed altogether — which is true. In fact, in a former <a href="https://medium.com/@rileyparkerhughes/immunity-passports-and-verifiable-credentials-a-response-to-critiques-142499fba4fb">blog post</a>, I explained:</p><blockquote>…the traditional DNS system complete with certificate authorities and ICANN could accomplish much of what is done with decentralized identifiers and the blockchain. But that infrastructure is decades old and comes with its own cost, scalability, performance, privacy, data protection, and governance implications. Using DIDs on a blockchain comes with a different set of trade-offs.</blockquote><p>Implementers can make their own decisions on tech stacks, and there is a reason so many choose DIDs. So the blockchain gives us useful functionality, but isn’t necessary for&nbsp;SSI.</p> So why the blockchain reputation? <p>I think there are three primary reasons why self-sovereign identity has a reputation for being tightly coupled with the blockchain/cryptocurrency community.</p>  Similar language: If cryptocurrencies give individuals control over their cash, rather than central banks (and their inflationary tendencies), SSI gives individuals control over their data, rather than big tech companies (and their surveillance tendencies). Because the problems are similar, the language is&nbsp;similar.  Confused projects: There are projects that call themselves SSI, but wouldn’t be considered so by SSI gurus because they centralize too much power or data in the hands of one organization (or one blockchain), put encrypted personal data onto the blockchain, etc. Many of these projects, although surely launched with good intent, could actually do much more harm than good by creating the ultimate public surveillance system.  Blockchain as fundraising mechanism: Self-sovereign identity really started picking up steam at the same time the ICO boom of 2016 was happening. Some SSI companies, including Civic, Evernym, and a long tail of other projects, raised tens of millions through ICOs, which married these parts of the SSI space to the crypto world. Although sometimes damaged by reputational and legal troubles, these firms have been able to spend large sums of money to develop pieces of SSI infrastructure that wouldn’t exist without&nbsp;them.   Blockchain’s most important contribution <p>As SSI technology and policy thinking has evolved over the last five years, so too has the role of the blockchain. With innovations in DID methods (peer DIDs especially), KERI, JSON-LD, etc. we take for granted the small role blockchain need play in SSI&nbsp;today.</p><p>I want to conclude by saying that blockchain’s contribution to SSI is immeasurably large but not because of its merits as a technology. Rather, blockchain reopened the identity conversation again, giving people hope in a better internet. Specifically, as co-founder of the Internet Identity Workshop and author of the book on digital identity Phil Windley put&nbsp;it:</p><blockquote>“Blockchain convinced many people, myself included, that decentralized identity was possible and practical. There was suddenly hope for a path to human dignity&nbsp;online.”</blockquote><p>So while blockchain’s relevance today is much less than it once was, its impact persists. We wouldn’t be talking about the impact on the internet, the standards, or the economic opportunity if it weren’t for blockchain. And now, with adoption all over the world, decentralized identity now seems inevitable.</p><p>Thanks to Phil Windley, Timothy Ruff, Anna Johnson, Juan Cabarello, and Kaliya Young for reading drafts &amp; giving feedback.</p><p>To learn more about Verifiable Credentials, visit <a href="http://trinsic.id">Trinsic</a>, the world’s most advanced SSI platform, built specifically for developers.</p>  For simplicity, this sentence assumes away complexities that reduce in-person accessibility for many people (ie., prejudice).  Advancements in guardianship, custodianship, and other accessibility-focused tech will make this statement more true over time. We should be careful to design for <a href="https://trinsic.id/digital-inclusion-covid-19-leaving-no-one-behind/">inclusion</a> while recognizing that <a href="https://thisisamos.com/2020/05/08/who-does-it-leave-out/">all technology excludes&nbsp;someone</a>.  To some degree, part of Uber’s ability to reduce costs was its ability to sidestep labor, licensing, and other regulations. I’m not trying to make a statement here about whether the ways they’ve reduced costs are ethical or not, as it’s still very much <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/uber-and-lyfts-california-labor-law-battle-is-far-from-over.html">unfolding</a>. I’m simply saying that the action of reducing transaction costs creates market&nbsp;value.  Many people, especially in my generation, take “being online” for granted. But think about all the inertia involved in getting a personal computer, buying internet from your cable company, downloading a browser, figuring out how to use it,&nbsp;etc.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">Blockchain is the Least Interesting Thing About Self-sovereign Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic">Trinsic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point of DataOps is to change how people collaborate around data and how it is used in the organization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, data and analytics leaders are increasingly applying DataOps techniques that provide a more agile and collaborative approach to building and managing data pipelines.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 What is DataOps? 
<p>Gartner defines DataOps as a collaborative data management practice focused on improving the communication, integration and automation of data flows between data managers and data consumers across an organization.</p>
<p>“The point of DataOps is to change how people collaborate around data and how it is used in the organization,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18810">Ted Friedman</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use DataOps to link “Can we do this?” to “How do we provide an optimized, governed data-driven product</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Rather than simply throwing data over the virtual wall, where it becomes someone else’s problem, the development of data pipelines and products becomes a collaborative exercise with a shared understanding of the value proposition.”</p>
 Successful DataOps practices 
<p>To implement DataOps successfully, data and analytics leaders must align DataOps with how data is consumed, rather than how it is created in their organization.</p>
<p>If those leaders adapt DataOps to three core value propositions, they will derive maximum value from data.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz0wNjkwNDI3MjMzZjgxMWViOTc1NTFkNGYxNTQ1MzFhZQ=="></a></p>
 
 Adapt your DataOps strategy to a utility value proposition by treating data as a utility that focuses on removing silos and manual effort when accessing and managing data. As such, data and analytics is readily available to all key roles. Because there are many relevant roles and not a single owner of the data, assign a data product manager to ensure data consumers’ needs are being met. 
 Use DataOps to support data’s use as a business enabler. For this value proposition, data and analytics supports specific use cases such as fraud detection, analysis of supply chain optimization or<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/data-sharing-is-a-business-necessity-to-accelerate-digital-business/"> interenterprise data sharing</a>. DataOps must drive collaboration with the business-unit stakeholders who are the customers for a specific product serving their use case. 
 Support the data and analytics driver value proposition. Use data and analytics to create new products and services, generate new revenue streams or enter new markets. For example, an idea for a new connected product emerges from your lab and must evolve into a production quality product for use by your customers. Use DataOps to link “Can we do this?” to “How do we provide an optimized, governed data-driven product to our consumers?” 
 
<p>The question you may have is, “Which type of DataOps value proposition is most relevant for my organization?” There is no single answer. Every business will have all three, either in a centralized or decentralized deployment model.</p>
<p>Delivering DataOps using each value proposition will foster collaboration between stakeholders and data implementers delivering the right value proposition with the right data at the right time.</p>

  <p>There has been a cut-throat competition between cloud hosts in the past few years - each attempting to earn the sympathy of developers and dev-ops by rolling out shiny new tools, plugins, and integrations. There are a gazillion how-to tutorials and guides in the community on using these tools. Sometimes when looking for a solution, it is hard to find the newest and simplest way. I never know if an article written last year is still valid using today’s tools. In this article, I’m going to walk you through the deployment of a .NET Core 3.1 application to the major cloud hosts (Microsoft Azure App Service, AWS Beanstalk, Google Cloud App Engine) in the simplest possible way. After deployment, I’ll take a few steps forward and configure Okta Authentication in the example application to show how to add a login flow at once.</p>

 How to Secure Your .NET App for Major Cloud Hosts 

<p>Okta is a cloud service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. Using Okta you don’t have to worry about implementing sign up, login, or logout flows manually.</p>

 Prerequisites 

 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer account</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">.NET Core 3.1 SDK</a> 
 

<p>Any preferred code editor, I’ll be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> for Mac 😱.</p>

<p>Azure deployment:</p>

 
   <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Microsoft Azure account</a> 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">Azure CLI</a> 
 

<p>AWS deployment:</p>

<p>*<a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS account</a></p>

<p>Google Cloud deployment:</p>

 
   <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud account</a> 
   <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk">Google Cloud SDK</a> 
 

 Preparing the .NET Core App for Cloud Host deployment 

<p>I have prepared an example application to play around with and see how the deployments work.</p>

<p>Start by cloning the repo to your local machine:</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-netcore3-deploy-to-cloud-hosts-example
</code>   

<p>Since there is Okta Authentication in the example application, you first need to update the related configs.</p>

<p>Log in to your <a href="https://login.okta.com">Okta Developer account</a></p>

<p>Navigate to Applications, then select Add Application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select Web as a platform:</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the next screen leave everything as is and select Done.</p>

<p>Scroll down and note your Okta Client Credentials:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open appsettings.json in your favorite code editor and add your credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can find your Org URL in the top right corner of the Dashboard:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now your app should be ready for deployment and to run locally. Let’s make sure there are no build or runtime errors. Open a terminal or command prompt, go to the project folder and run:</p>

   <code>dotnet run
</code>   

<p>Open your browser at <code>https://localhost:5001</code> to see the app running.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Login part of the app doesn’t work just now. We will set it up after the deployments.</p>
</blockquote>

 Deploying a .NET Core 3.1 App to Azure App Service 

<p>Let’s begin by deploying our app to Azure!</p>

 Creating an Azure App Service using Command Line 

<p>Open a terminal or command prompt and login to Azure.</p>

   <code>az login
</code>   

<p>A browser window will open asking for your Microsoft Account credentials.</p>

<p>First, we’ll have to add a Resource Group:</p>

   <code>az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westus
</code>   

<p>Run the following command to set the default resource group and location for all subsequent commands. So we won’t have to worry about adding them at each command.</p>

   <code>az configure --defaults group=myResourceGroup location=westus
</code>   

<p>Let’s create an App Service plan:</p>

   <code>az appservice plan create --name myPlan --sku F1
</code>   

<p>Finally, create the App Service itself:</p>

<p>Replace  with your preferred name. This will be the URL of your app, like: `http://.azurewebsites.net`</p>

   <code>az webapp create --name &lt;your_app_name&gt; --plan myPlan --runtime "DOTNETCORE|3.1"
</code>   

<p>Open a browser window at <code>http://&lt;your_app_name&gt;.azurewebsites.net</code> and make sure the App Service is running:</p>

<p></p>

 Deploying the App to Azure App Service using Command Line 

<p>It’s time to set your deployment credentials. Replace username and password with your azure credentials.</p>

   <code>az webapp deployment user set --user-name &lt;username&gt; --password &lt;password&gt;
</code>   

<p>Run the following command to retrieve the Git endpoint to which we want to push the app code:</p>

   <code>az webapp deployment source config-local-git --name &lt;your_app_name&gt;
</code>   

<p>Your output should look like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "url": "https://gergely.sinka@mydomain.com@&lt;your_app_name&gt;.scm.azurewebsites.net/&lt;your_app_name&gt;.git"
}
</code>   

<p>Now set the output URL without credentials as a remote for the local git repository:</p>

   <code>git remote add azure https://&lt;your_app_name&gt;.scm.azurewebsites.net/&lt;your_app_name&gt;.git
</code>   

<p>Finally, push the code to the new remote repository:</p>

   <code>git push azure master
</code>   

<p>Open a browser window at <code>http://&lt;your_app_name&gt;.azurewebsites.net</code> to make sure the app is running.</p>

 Configuring Okta for the Azure Hosted App 

<p>We need to add our application’s URL to Okta to be recognized as a redirect URL.</p>

<p>Going back to the Okta Dashboard Applications page, select the App you created in the first section.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the General tab, click Edit next to the General Settings section:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Set the following URLs:</p>

<p>Login redirect URIs: <code>https://&lt;your_app_name&gt;.azurewebsites.net/authorization-code/callback</code></p>

<p>Logout redirect URIs: <code>https://&lt;your_app_name&gt;.azurewebsites.net/signout/callback</code></p>

<p>Now you should be able to log in and log out in your web application using your Okta credentials.</p>

 Deploying a .NET Core 3.1 App to AWS Beanstalk 

<p>Next, we will go through the deployment process for AWS.</p>

 Creating the deployment package 

<p>Open a terminal or  command prompt, go to the project folder and run:</p>

   <code>dotnet publish -o my-app
</code>   

<p>Compress the newly created <code>my-app</code> folder to a zip archive. This will be our deployment package</p>

 Deploying the package 

<p>Visit the AWS <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk">Elastic Beanstalk</a> Console.</p>

<p>Go ahead and Create Application:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Give it a Name and carefully select the Platform as follows:</p>

<p></p>

<p>We’ll upload the deployment package by hand. So, set Application Code to Upload your code. Now press Choose file and upload the previously created .zip file.</p>

<p>Once the upload has finished, hit Create Application. You might have to wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete.</p>

 Configuring Okta for the AWS Hosted App 

<p>We need to add our application’s URL to Okta to be recognized as a redirect URL.</p>

<p>Going back to the Okta Dashboard Applications page. Select the App you created in the first part.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the General tab hit Edit by the General Settings section:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Set the following URLs:
Login redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;your_app_url&gt;/authorization-code/callback</code>
e.g.: <code>http://oktaexample-env.eba-evyiprzp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/authorization-code/callback</code></p>

<p>Logout redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;your_app_url&gt;/signout/callback</code>
e.g.: <code>http://oktaexample-env.eba-evyiprzp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/signout/callback</code></p>

<p>Now you should be able to log in and log out in your web application using your Okta credentials.</p>

 Troubleshooting 

<p>If you run into a Correlation Error after logging in, you’ll need to manually set the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute to <code>None</code>, and enable SSL (HTTPS) on your server. I have a detailed article and a guide coming soon on how to set up a Linux server to support Okta login in .NET Core 3.1 applications - be on the lookout for that! To get an idea of the basics, check out my post on how to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/11/25/how-to-install-dotnetcore-on-linux">Install .NET Core Apps on Linux in 5 Minutes</a>.</p>

 Deploying a .NET Core 3.1 App to Google App Engine 

 Preparing Google Cloud App Engine 

<p>Open the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com">Google Cloud Platform Console</a> and create a new Project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the welcome screen select Create Application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Choose any Region. Then add .NET as Language and Flexible as Environment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open a terminal or  command prompt, go to the project folder and run:</p>

   <code>dotnet publish -o my-app
</code>   

<p>Then go to the newly created folder:</p>

   <code>cd my-app
</code>   

<p>Log in with the Cloud SDK:</p>

   <code>gcloud init
</code>   

 Deploying the App to Google Cloud Engine 

<p>To deploy the application enter:</p>

   <code>gcloud app deploy
</code>   

<p>You might be asked a few questions while the deployment is running.</p>

<p>Once the deployment is finished you can go back to the Cloud Platform Console and click the service to see if the application is running:</p>

<p></p>

 Configuring Okta for the Google Cloud Hosted App 

<p>We need to add our application’s URL to Okta to be recognized as a redirect URL.</p>

<p>Going back to the Okta Dashboard Applications page, select the App you created in the first part.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the General tab hit Edit by the General Settings section:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Set the following URLs:
Login redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;your_app_url&gt;/authorization-code/callback</code>
e.g.: <code>http://oktaexample-289720.ew.r.appspot.com/authorization-code/callback</code></p>

<p>Logout redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;your_app_url&gt;/signout/callback</code>
e.g.: <code>http://oktaexample-289720.ew.r.appspot.com/signout/callback</code></p>

<p>Now you should be able to log in and log out in your web application using your Okta credentials.</p>

 Takeaways 

<p>There are quite a few ways to deploy .NET Core applications to major cloud hosts. I have introduced the simplest techniques using basic tools provided. This should be perfect for proof of concept apps and home projects. For simplicity these deployment techniques sometimes need manual steps. If you don’t want to repeat them with every deployment, I recommend automating these steps in your CI/CD pipelines. Hopefully I’ll have an article coming out in that topic soon!</p>

 The GiD Report#138 — The age of antitrust, Stripe is Windows for&nbsp;fintech <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-137-video-and-groups-rule-the-roost-post-covid-112a1d2870ac">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Three emerging narratives for this week — the building momentum around antitrust, crypto rising, and building fintech shovels for a COVID-accelerated digital&nbsp;reality:</p>  The age of antitrust  Crypto rising  Ben Thompson: Stripe is Windows for&nbsp;fintech  Aaron Schwartz hacker law revised + digital services&nbsp;tax  Tweet of the week: SSI is a 3-sided&nbsp;market  Stuff happens   1. The gravity, pull, and sway of large, powerful corporations has always been a reality — but today, we find ourselves at a point in the cycle where there seems to be a general consensus that it’s time for a correction. We’re seeing it in Big Tech (as we saw it with Too Big to Fail during the last financial crisis). We’re seeing it in payments Visa (and on the other side of the coin, the rise of&nbsp;crypto). <p>The pull of that gravity is often subtle early on, its impact only clear through hindsight — particularly around metrics concerning competition and innovation. But the stakes have never been&nbsp;higher.</p>“The Bosses of the Senate”&nbsp;(1889)<p>One example is Slack being bought out by Salesforce in response to competition from Microsoft (and Teams), the OG Big Tech antitrust case.</p><p>There’s also the recent news of Google and firing of a prominent AI ethics researcher is another reminder of that fact. Google, given its resources, expertise, and business alignment, is a leader in AI tech. They’re also known for a historically academic culture within the&nbsp;firm.</p><p>Sometimes, however, those two forces are in conflict. Sometimes business wins over academics. The fear, of course, is that the weight will continue to shift toward business. After all, we’re talking about a company that is taking a pivotal role in defining our AI&nbsp;future.</p><p>The waters are further muddied when plenty of voices believe that company is also a monopoly.</p><p>In that sense, antitrust isn’t just about taking down big and powerful companies. It’s about creating an environment, incentive structure and competitive landscape whereby society can evolve in ways we collectively believe best — rather than ways that benefit said companies at the expense of our&nbsp;future.</p><p>And so today, where seeing these little skirmishes across industries and across borders and across realities.</p><p>For instance, Facebook trying to take ownership over&nbsp;VR:</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/facebook-accused-of-squeezing-rival-startups-in-virtual-reality">Facebook Accused of Squeezing Rival Startups in Virtual&nbsp;Reality</a>  <p>Rulemakers waving Section 230 around as a&nbsp;threat:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/senators-offer-slip-section-230-changes-defense-bill-a09f3428-ce5f-468c-8127-5fc413c996a7.html">Senators offer to slip Section 230 changes into defense&nbsp;bill</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-defense-spending-social-media-inhofe-7db847bb-76fc-41a7-afc8-b87e84c9faa2.html">Senate Armed Services chair dismisses Trump threat to veto defense&nbsp;bill</a>  <p>Europe’s continued efforts to keep Big Tech in&nbsp;check:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-tech-giants-face-tighter-regulation-in-europe-11606991401">U.S. Tech Giants Face Tighter Regulation in&nbsp;Europe</a>  <p>The Dutch taking on Apple&nbsp;Pay:</p>  <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/04/apple-pay-iphone-dutch-antitrust/">Apple Pay limitations spark Dutch antitrust probe</a>  <p>And the DOJ’s ongoing battle with&nbsp;Visa:</p>  <a href="https://www.paymentssource.com/news/visa-defends-plaid-deal-to-doj-asserting-datas-vital-new-role-in-payments">Visa defends Plaid deal to DOJ, asserting data’s vital new role in&nbsp;payments</a>  <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata-4426a038-52b9-4b5d-923a-bc49e3f2551f.html">Axios on&nbsp;Visa</a>:</p><blockquote>Companies have two basic choices when faced with an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department: Fight or flee. Visa plans to&nbsp;fight.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: The credit card giant filed its legal response to DOJ’s efforts to block its $5.3 billion purchase of fintech “connector” company Plaid. Its primary arguments are that regulators gerrymandered an industry definition and conjured competition.</blockquote><blockquote>Industry: The DOJ believes that Visa is a monopolist in the online debit card space, arguing that its market share exceeds 70%. Visa doesn’t dispute that figure, but instead argues it’s arbitrary.</blockquote>  Visa claims that the relevant industry is online payments, which would include not just online debit, but also credit cards and services like Apple Pay. Or at least would include other methods of direct debit from bank accounts, such as PayPal and using routing numbers to satisfy utility bills,&nbsp;etc.  Also worth noting is that Visa’s overall debit card market share drops to 60%+ when in-person purchases are included (it increases for online since few e-commerce merchants accept PIN&nbsp;cards).  <blockquote>Competition: The DOJ argues that Plaid could become a major competitor in the online debit space, and that Visa’s acquisition is designed to extinguish that nascent&nbsp;threat.</blockquote><p>Imagine for a second that Facebook wasn’t allowed to take over Instagram and later WhatsApp (and in turn use Instagram to try and crush Snapchat). Imagine for a second that all of those platforms were independent companies today. Might it be reasonable to think that Facebook would be less inclined to try and push a singular, proprietary solution and that the industry at large would be more open to interoperable solutions?</p><p>Relevant: <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201201&amp;instance_id=24606&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=45768&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2F42260309-228f-5af1-a90b-f086a7e93acb&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">The NYTimes on why WhatsApp&nbsp;matters</a>.</p> 2.

<p>New Janssen Project seeks to build the world’s fastest and most comprehensive cloud native identity and access management software platform</p>
<p>San Francisco, Calif., December 8, 2020 – The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, today announced the Janssen Project, a cloud native identity and access management software platform that prioritizes security and performance for our digital society. Janssen is based on the Gluu Server and benefits from a rich set of signing and encryption functionalities. Engineers from IDEMIA, F5, BioID, Couchbase and Gluu will make up the Technical Steering Committee.</p>
<p>Online trust is a fundamental challenge to our digital society. The Internet has connected us. But at the same time, it has undermined trust. Digital identity starts with a connection between a person and a digital device. Identity software conveys the integrity of that connection from the user’s device to a complex web of backend services. Solving the challenge of digital identity is foundational to achieving trustworthy online security.</p>
<p>While other identity and access management platforms exist, the Janssen Project seeks to tackle the most challenging security and performance requirements. Based on the latest code that powers the Gluu Server–which has passed more <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID self-certification tests</a> then any other platform–Janssen starts with a rich set of signing and encryption functionality that can be used for high assurance transactions. Having shown throughput of <a href="https://www.gluu.org/resources/documents/articles/billion-authentications-per-day-2/">more than one billion authentications per day</a>, the software can also handle the most demanding requirements for concurrency thanks to Kubernetes auto-scaling and advances in persistence.</p>
<p>“Trust and security are not competitive advantages–no one wins in an insecure society with low trust,” said Mike Schwartz, Chair of the Janssen Project Technical Steering Committee. “In the world of software, nothing builds trust like the open source development methodology. For organizations who cannot outsource trust, the Janssen Project strives to bring transparency, best practices and collective governance to the long term maintenance of this important effort. The Linux Foundation provides the neutral and proven forum for organizations to collaborate on this work.”</p>
<p>The Gluu engineering teams chose the Linux Foundation to host this community because of the Foundation’s priority of transparency in the development process and its formal framework for governance to facilitate collaboration among commercial partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New digital identity challenges arise constantly, and new standards are developed to address them.&nbsp; Open source ecosystems are an engine for innovation to filter and adapt to changing requirements. The Janssen Project Technical Steering Committee (“TSC”) will help govern priorities according to the<a href="https://github.com/JanssenProject/home/blob/main/community/charter.md"> charter.</a>&nbsp; The initial TSC includes:&nbsp;</p>

 Rod Boothby, Head of Digital Trust at Santander

Exposing BioID’s capabilities via OpenID Connect makes sense in many cases, especially as part of the rollout for a large organization.&nbsp; The availability of a high quality open source implementation of OpenID Connect gives us more options to build products and to expand the options for our customers to deploy our technology,” said Alexander Werner, Software Engineer at BioID.</p>
<p>Couchbase</p>
<p>“The Couchbase database is supported today in the Janssen project for both caching and persistence. This makes sense given the distributed, elastic, in-memory requirements for a multi-cloud, hyper-scale identity service. Contributing to this project aligns with our goal to advance open source infrastructure software that results in more options for the Couchbase community,” said Ian McCloy, Principal Product Manager at Couchbase.</p>
<p>F5</p>
<p>“It’s an immense pleasure to join the Janssen Project, as it’s aimed to improve the performance, reliability and security on OAuth2 Components that are similar to NGINX Principles. Being part of Linux Foundation, the Janssen Project will be well governed and evolve with the open source community to achieve its goals,” said Rajesh Bavanantham, F5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IDEMIA</p>
<p>“I have been a part of the Gluu community for many years. I’m excited to see the project moving to the Linux Foundation where we can collaborate with an even larger ecosystem of individuals and companies,” said Will Cayo, IDEMIA.</p>
<p>About the Linux Foundation</p>
<p>Founded in 2000, the Linux Foundation is supported by more than 1,500 members and is the world’s leading home for collaboration on open source software, open standards, open data, and open hardware.

  <p>There’s never been a time when application leaders haven’t been under pressure to reduce costs and optimize spending. COVID-19 has only increased this pressure, as <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">organizations have accelerated digitalization</a> to maintain a viable, virtual business presence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investment in new application development is 17% of the total IT spend</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even so, some practical steps can be taken to help ensure that costs are kept in check — especially at the design and development stages of an application’s life cycle.</p>
<p>In many ways, the development stage is a natural place to first seek cost-cutting. “Investment in new application development is 17% of the total IT spend, making it a fruitful place to look for opportunities to cut costs, optimize spend or improve value,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/92082">Akis Sklavounakis</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>Gartner has identified four ways to cut costs and optimize spend during these critical stages.</p>
 Expand the talent pool 
<p>It’s always a challenge to find top development talent, especially if the search is limited to local talent only. But the COVID-19 lockdown highlighted recruitment possibilities to include a remote workforce.</p>
<p>A Gartner survey of 127 company leaders showed that 82% of respondents intend to permit remote working some of the time, and 47% intend to allow employees to work remotely full-time from now on. The fact is, a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/master-a-distributed-workforce-for-digital-transformation/">“talent anywhere” approach</a> is fast becoming the norm, and is likely to remain so long after the pandemic.</p>
<p>At the same time, application leaders are also harnessing the work of end users outside the IT function. This growing pool of citizen developers and business technologists can help build or customize data and technology solutions, while saving on IT costs.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/its-time-to-disrupt-the-application-organization/">It's Time to Disrupt the Application Organization</a></p>
 Accelerate the transformation to agile 
<p>The ability for organizations to rapidly adapt to the changes brought on by the pandemic have been remarkable. Organizations found that they had to<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-become-an-agile-superhero/"> accelerate agile</a> transformation plans and actions in order to be successful with digital business.</p>
<p>With a more agile operating model, time-to-value can be shortened, teams can more readily reprioritize activities and deliverables, and bureaucracy can be minimized by employing short-term incremental and iterative planning.</p>
 Reduce upfront application development costs with cloud 
<p>By using <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/software-as-a-service-saas">software-as-a-service (SaaS)</a> for commodity business functions such as human resources management, finance and procurement, organizations can reduce upfront costs significantly.</p>
<p>Additionally, by using <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas">infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)</a> instead of on-premises hardware, cloud-based development tools instead of licensed tools, and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/platform-as-a-service-paas">platform-as-a-service (PaaS)</a> application runtimes instead of licensed ones, application leaders can drive further cost reductions.</p>
 Lower total cost of ownership (TCO) with efficient application design for maintainability and change 
<p>Taking the long view of an application life cycle will help provide insight into the true costs of maintaining and managing a solution. With TCO as a key criterion, all direct and indirect costs for the lifetime of an application are taken into consideration. These include recurring, nonrecurring, future and go-live costs.</p>
<p>At the same time, incentivize development teams to “design for change,” and better manage technical debt throughout the application life cycle. The result is that application development teams will seek ways to design for long-term supportability, maintainability, reliability and scalability.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 brings higher demand for new application services as organizations accelerate digitalization while recovering and renewing their products and services,” Sklavounakis says. The key is to employ tactics that combine near-term savings with strategic long-term savings in application design and development.</p>

					 <p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> is an open source community hosted by the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a> that acts as a greenhouse for cross-industry, blockchain-based projects. There are three projects within Hyperledger that directly relate to SSI—Aries, Indy, and Ursa. The Trinsic platform is built upon these codebases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperledger Aries</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aries was created out of the Hyperledger Indy community due to a need for open source agents. The vision for Aries is that it’s a ledger-agnostic toolkit for managing verifiable credentials. A complete summary of Aries codebases can be found in the Hyperledger GitHub repository, but we’ll highlight a few here:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Aries Framework .NET: Trinsic’s entire product stack is based on <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>—a mature codebase for building interoperable, SSI agents that run on all platforms (cloud, mobile, IoT, etc.). Trinsic <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/agentframework-for-net-joins-hyperledger-aries-14aba357da41">developed the framework</a> and now <a href="https://trinsic.id/aries-openapi/">continues to maintain it</a> alongside the contributions of many other developers and vendors.  Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py): Similar to Aries Framework .NET, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">ACA-Py</a> is a mature codebase for building SSI agents, although it’s unable to be used in mobile environments. It’s maintained by the Government of British Columbia, Canada and a large community of developers.  Aries Framework Go: Another mature Aries initiative, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go">the Go codebase</a> leverages Hyperledger Fabric, not Indy, for its public key infrastructure.  Aries RFCs: The <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Aries RFCs</a> specify the protocols Aries agents will run. <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-commitment-to-interoperability-ahead-of-iiw/">Interoperability profiles</a> are based off a combination of several RFCs that must be proven to be interoperable with one another.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperledger Indy &amp; Ursa</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk">Hyperledger Indy</a> is a blockchain purpose-built for decentralized identity. It was the first production-grade SSI solution which is still run by <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a> today in a production network by nodes around the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a> is a library of cryptography-related code so that all Hyperledger projects can leverage existing, proven libraries.

					 <p>Individual vendors as well have codebases that apply to different levels of the SSI tech stack. Almost all SSI vendors have a GitHub repository full of a variety of codebases, from components (like Trinsic’s implementation of <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/did-key.rs">DID:key in Rust</a>) to more complete solutions (like this <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/github-did">DIF project</a>). Trinsic has a set of open source reference applications that developers can take advantage of, including:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/issuer-reference-app">Issuer reference app</a>  <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/verifier-reference-app">Verifier reference app</a>  <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/wallet-reference-app">Wallet reference app</a>  <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/provider-reference-app">Provider reference app</a>  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using these reference apps, developers can instantly have an out-of-the-box app that’s integrated with Trinsic and can choose to use it as a reference when building their own app, or they can simply take the app as is and customize it.</p>

					 <p>As you can see, there are many places a developer who is looking to build a self-sovereign identity solution can spend his or her time. Instead of having to focus on learning the ins and outs of different SSI codebases, developers can use Trinsic’s API to reduce the complexity of implementing self-sovereign identity and focus entirely on building their solution. Development time can be reduced from several months to weeks, and that’s because Trinsic simply makes SSI easy to implement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about Trinsic’s APIs, visit our documentation site at <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">docs.trinsic.id</a>.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Whether you’re a fan of MySQL or not, you cannot dispute the fact that it is <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking">the world’s most popular open-source database</a> by a large margin (incidentally, it’s also the second most popular database ever, behind only its owner Oracle’s flagship commercial product). 25 years after its inception, MySQL has evolved into an essential and truly ubiquitous component of every web application stack and cloud platform. Even though some database experts might frown upon it for lacking “enterprise capabilities”, it is widely used by the largest enterprises around the world, like Facebook, YouTube, or Siemens.</p>
<p>However, while MySQL is widely used for transactional processing (OLTP), its ability to perform analytical processing (OLAP) is quite limited. Because the database engine lacks certain optimization functions crucial for running queries on aggregated data, its performance on OLAP workloads is underwhelming at best. For years, the only option MySQL users had was to export their transactional data into a different database system optimized for analytics and run their queries there. Well, not anymore!</p>
 MySQL and analytics: the holy grail for developers! 
<p>Last week, Oracle has announced MySQL Database Service <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/mysql-analytics-engine.html">Analytics Engine</a>, a new incarnation of Oracle’s managed MySQL cloud service that’s optimized for high-performance analytics workloads. According to the company’s benchmarks, the new service can run typical analytical queries up to 400 times faster than “vanilla” MySQL.</p>
<p>Based on in-memory hybrid columnar technology (which sounds a lot like the stuff Oracle has already implemented in their commercial database), the engine is designed to directly access the transactional data from a MySQL database, create its in-memory representation optimized for OLAP processing and execute analytic queries, returning the results through the familiar MySQL programming interfaces. The engine supports near-linear scaling to a massive number of cores and thus can turn a MySQL database into a large and efficient data warehouse in the cloud.</p>
<p>Oracle is certainly not the first database vendor to take a popular open-source database engine and build an extended ecosystem around it. After all, AWS, its biggest competitor, has been doing similar things with its DBaaS services for years. Oracle’s latest offering however has a big and rather unique advantage: the OLTP and OLAP processing operates on the same data held within the same single database instance and all query optimization and execution is handled by the database core completely transparently. To a user or developer, the new OLAP-capable database looks and behaves exactly like a normal MySQL instance.</p>
 Less obvious benefits 
<p>Above anything else, this means that there is no need to create a separate copy of data for analytics, thus reducing the overall complexity and costs and increasing performance. A big part of Oracle’s presentation was devoted to direct comparisons to AWS’s Aurora and Redshift services, with both costs and performance ending up in Oracle’s favor.</p>
<p>As an analyst primarily focusing on cybersecurity, however, I was more impressed by the potential security and compliance benefits of an integrated OLTP/OLAP solution. Since the data (which for many types of transactional workloads is quite sensitive, containing personal, financial, and other regulated information) no longer needs to move between disparate data stores, this dramatically decreases the risks to its integrity and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Keeping the data in one place improves your company’s security posture, and in the end, helps avoid a data breach or compliance fine – and the best part is that it’s all just a free bonus to having much better data analytics.</p>
 So, where is the catch? 
<p>Doesn’t it somehow sound too good to be true? Surely there must be a catch? Well, the most obvious one is that Oracle’s solution does not extend the core MySQL engine; instead, it’s designed as an add-on service running on its own specialized infrastructure that integrates with Oracle’s managed MySQL service behind the scenes. Of course, it’s fully managed and thus transparent to users, but unfortunately, it means that the solution will remain an Oracle Cloud exclusive.</p>
<p>Of course, in Oracle’s case, being cloud-exclusive still means you can get the same service as a part of the company’s Cloud@Customer private cloud offering. Besides, the company’s announced the ability to replicate any on-prem MySQL instance to Oracle Cloud to enable transparent high-performance analytics on your legacy data. How is this replication supposed to handle data desensitization (anonymization) to ensure compliance with GDPR and similar regulations is still open, however…</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/meet-the-next-generation-oracle">earlier blog posts</a>, it took Oracle years to figure out a proper cloud strategy: instead of trying to beat the competitors on their terms, the company should focus on its unique differentiators and their added value for Oracle cloud customers. MySQL Analytics Engine is definitely one of those services no other CSP is currently able to offer, and while cost reduction is still a major factor, security and compliance should be considered as well. Incidentally, KuppingerCole is planning to publish a new edition of our <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc79015/database-and-big-data-security/">Leadership Compass on Database and Big Data Security</a> soon.

<p>Munich, Luxembourg, December 8th, 2020 – <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a> a leading provider for Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions,&nbsp;receives&nbsp;€15 million growth funding from European Investment Bank. Funds will support IDnow’s research and development and international expansion. Financing by EU bank is provided under Investment Plan for Europe.</p>
<p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) will provide €15&nbsp;million of growth funding to the German identity verification platform IDnow. IDnow is an expert in secure, remote auto and video identification and electronic signature services. This enables companies to acquire customers and manage transactions faster and easier, while complying with know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. The investment will primarily support IDnow’s research and development (R&amp;D) activities as well as its international growth.</p>
<p>This operation is part of the European Growth Finance Facility (EGFF), a product under the guarantee scheme of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI). The EGFF is designed to address quasi-equity gaps linked to structural market failures across the European Union in the provision of adequate risk capital to late-stage, venture-backed companies. Such European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and mid-caps often suffer from systemic shortages of large, non-dilutive financing options for growth investments, both tangible and intangible. The benefit of EFSI in this specific case is the clear enhancement of the risk capacity of the Bank.</p>
<p>EFSI is the central pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe under which the EIB and the European Commission are working together as strategic partners and the EIB’s financing operations are boosting the competitiveness of the European economy. It is accompanied by the advisory service, the European Investment Advisory Hub, which enables public and private project operators to structure their investment projects more professionally.</p>
<p>EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle, who is responsible for EFSI and the bank´s operations in Germany, said: “IDnow, a first-time borrower for the Bank, depends on significant R&amp;D and marketing investments related to commercialisation. The transaction is an excellent example of how the EU bank, with the support of the Investment Plan for Europe, can facilitate the development of innovaton, in particular in sensitive policy areas such as anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and cybersecurity, which are of utmost importance for the European Union and its economy.”</p>
<p>European Commissioner for the Economy, Paolo Gentiloni, said: “As ever more of our interactions move online, it’s more important than ever that we strengthen data security and fraud prevention. And it’s right that the Investment Plan for Europe contributes to those efforts. This support for German platform IDnow will enable it to expand its services for digital identity verification of customers and business partners alike. We are investing in a safer online business environment, an objective of our digital finance strategy.”</p>
<p>CFO of IDnow Joe Lichtenberger said: “IDnow has experienced overwhelming demand for its verification-as-a-service across multiple industries and countries, with COVID-19 significantly increasing the need for digital services. The flexible financing structure from the EIB will allow us to accelerate our investment in developing the platform to capitalise on these opportunities. The EIB is an ideal partner to support us in becoming Europe’s leading provider in identity verification.”</p>

 With the Senior Tech Lead of Decentralized Identity (DeID) Solution — Hu&nbsp;Ning <p>Ontology has always focused on creating a sustainable and effective method for implementing decentralized identity solutions in real enterprise case studies. This was highlighted by a recent event hosted by CAICT on “Blockchain: Connecting the Future — Digital Identity &amp; Decentralized Identifiers,” where our very own Decentralized Identity Senior Tech Lead, Hu Ning gave a keynote speech outlining how ONT ID works, as well as how multiple layers of trust are required amongst users, systems and organizations, before rounding things off with a few case studies. As with most large scale blockchain events, Hu Ning wasn’t the only expert there as several other DID experts from W3C, DIF, EEA, Consensys, Spherity and Evernym gave informative addresses as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Below is a quick&nbsp;recap:</p> How ONT ID&nbsp;Works <p>Hu Ning opened the keynote with a brief outline of the technical infrastructure which powers ONT ID and the Ontology blockchain. Including how it identifies and connects people with their data to create and enable a self-sovereign digital identity. Your ONT ID also communicates with other DIDs registered in other blockchains and systems, since it was all developed under the guidance of the W3C DID standard. This makes ONT ID part of the core Ontology solution as it provides transparency and ease of use combined security and credibility as its main features. All trust based technologies are closely connected to identity as their core, and DID is also adopted and connected across multiple ecosystems including BTC, ETH, NEO, and Chainlink.</p><p>Taking it a step further, ONT ID is really the underlying framework for a much anticipated addition, the OScore — a fully digitalized credit scoring system based on your history of asset transactions and holdings. The OScore will allow users to interact with each other on-chain based on both on-chain and off-chain assets histories, while lowering collateral requirements and interest&nbsp;rates!</p> Multi-Dimensional Trust <p>Up next, Hu Ning elaborated on the trust requirement that ONT ID solves from all sides. This includes the trust between decentralized applications, as well as businesses and users — not to mention everything in&nbsp;between.</p><p>One of the goals with ONT ID is to help users find and manage their social networks &amp; their web-apps, based on multidimensional trust endorsement. Another key area Hu Ning highlighted was the difference between Semantic, Syntactical and Object Abstraction Interoperability and how to build systems between for framework of operation, ultimately leading to&nbsp;trust.</p> Case Studies <p>To round things off, Hu Ning dove into two case studies, as well as possible applications in the medical and manufacturing industry. One that was recently completed with Daimler Mobility, and the other with&nbsp;OpenKG.</p><p>For Daimler Mobility, the Ontology team helped build a “Welcome Home” app on the MoveX platform. Through ONT ID, users were able to obtain and control the data for any Daimler vehicle on the road, and transfer these preferences into a new vehicle when they switched. Not only that, but all the data points including possible claims, wear and tear, and lighting choices were all recorded on the blockchain, binded with a user’s ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Other case studies, such as in the healthcare system were also introduced by Hu Ning. Given recent outbreaks, a more decentralized, robust healthcare system where a user’s health records were not only available, but also protected, would be invaluable. A user would be able to go into the hospital, and ensure that they only share relevant data with the clinician, while locking that data and granting access to insurance data when paying for the hospital visit. That way, not only can health practitioners rely on more accurate and immutable data, but patients can also feel more assured that something as private as your health records are protected and decentralized.</p><p>Hu Ning also discussed Ontology’s provision of full tech support for Open KG, an open-source data sharing platform to record knowledge schema on the blockchain, further empowering the knowledge industry with blockchain technology.</p><p>To wrap things up, Hu Ning summarized “Ontology will continue to dive into the research and development of blockchain technology as well as the optimization of core performances of the platform. This will provide blockchain solutions for enterprises, and bring highly efficient and easy-to-use development tools for developers. The ultimate goal is to let every blockchain user own their own data and apply credit technology and solutions to all types of industries, further promoting trust collaboration in our&nbsp;society”</p><p>These are the types of case studies that demonstrate not just applicable, but much needed decentralized identities such as ONT ID. At the end of the day, the blockchain was designed to give users more control and privacy over their own data — something ONT ID contributes towards in a big&nbsp;step.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/recapping-the-link-to-the-future-event-with-china-blockchain-dialogues-5263c68c5e76">Recapping the “Blockchain: Connecting the Future” Event hosted by CAICT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Social commerce and e-commerce: Not enough&nbsp;orders  Conversations with Africa’s platform&nbsp;sellers <p>These conversations took place between March, 2020 and September, 2020</p><p>Social commerce and e-commerce are increasingly becoming popular for young people running micro and small businesses to sell anything&nbsp;online.</p><p>While e-commerce platforms such as Jumia and Jiji were intentionally designed to help African micro-entrepreneurs sell online, selling on Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Twitter are becoming the norm in Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and&nbsp;Ghana.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has presented several new challenges that are now threatening the existence of many of these small home-based businesses.</p><p>A <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlobalStateofSmallBusinessReport.pdf">Facebook/World Bank survey</a> on the global impact of COVID-19 on small businesses was released in July. According to the report, 62% of microbusinesses generated lower sales in the previous 30 days compared to the same period in 2019, and approximately 30% of microbusinesses had been forced to close at the time of the survey, with female-led ones more affected.</p>Olive, a social commerce&nbsp;seller<p>Of the eight platform sellers I spoke to, five of the six women use social media exclusively to sell their products. They said it is more cost-effective than e-commerce websites that charge monthly subscription fees.</p><p>When Uganda went into lockdown on March 28 after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Olive’s shop in downtown Kampala was forced to close. She hoped she’d be able to sustain her business, selling African print hoodies and headwraps, via her Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Instagram channels. However, with people locked indoors and the increased uncertainty about the future, her online customers also decreased.</p><blockquote>“Online sales were reduced by 60% in March, to 40% in April to 0% in May,” Olive said last&nbsp;June.</blockquote><p>Olive decided to add masks with matching headbands to her product line, but most of her fabric was locked up in the shop so she couldn’t accumulate stock.</p><p>“However much I could still do business online, I couldn’t access my materials,” she&nbsp;said.</p>Olive’s hood collection<p>By September, most businesses in Uganda had been allowed to open. With fewer sales over the last months and less revenue, however, Olive was faced with rent arrears on the shop that she couldn’t pay. She took out a loan to pay some of the rent and is now considering finding a more affordable location for her shop. A few orders had started coming in by September. However, “I can’t take my things out of the shop until the arrears are paid,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>In Nigeria, 21-year-old Tosin’s shoe and handbag online business was thriving at the beginning of the pandemic.</p><p>“Most people were at home on their phones. I ran targeted ads and started getting customers. I reached many people and in March, April and May, I made some money,” she said in June. All that changed between June and September.</p>Tosin’s Instagram page<p>She thinks it is because there are now more businesses online and the competition is high. “The market is saturated. There are many people selling bags and shoes. We are all selling the same thing,” she said, adding that the last time she sold anything was in&nbsp;July.</p><p>Things were even tougher for Dorcas, 41, a baker in Kenya who lost most of her cake orders in June because people could no longer host events or gatherings. Dorcus relies on WhatsApp, Facebook, and logistic platforms to conduct most of her business as she is homebound due to suffering from&nbsp;lupus.</p><p>With no sales coming in, Dorcas had to get creative to diversify her source of income. She created a WhatsApp-based marketplace that brought together potential customers and anyone selling goods and services in the community where she lives. Even though her efforts to turn it into a revenue stream have so far been unsuccessful, she is glad she is helping people in her community to generate income this way. As she waits for her cake business to pick up, Dorcas is now selling shoes for children and teenagers online.</p><blockquote>“This has picked up more than the cake business. I am using Facebook, Facebook groups, Instagram, and WhatsApp groups. Every day I post in 20 different groups,” Dorcas told me in September.</blockquote>Dorcas E-commerce <p>Edwin, 20, in Nigeria and Robert, 30, in Kenya are both e-commerce sellers on Jiji and Jumia, respectively. They both faced serious stock issues at the beginning of the pandemic as borders closed, which affected the import of merchandise from China — solar products for Edwin and phones for&nbsp;Robert.</p><p>In June, Robert was only able to get half of the stock he usually gets and his sales also suffered.</p><blockquote>“People are not purchasing. They are at home and not getting any money. They would rather not spend the little they have on phones,” he said in&nbsp;June.</blockquote><p>In September, Robert told me that he plans to add health and beauty products to his catalogue so he can earn&nbsp;more.</p>Robert<p>Edwin registered a 10% increase in his business online in June but by September, his sales also went down, forcing him to rethink the monthly subscription fee he paid to Jiji. Customers are slowly coming back, but to his physical shop in a market in Abuja, not online. Most of his customers, he says, prefer to see the goods before they buy. He is looking forward to making more sales during the festive season. “It’s when people buy a lot and lighting is a priority for comfort,” he told me in September. However, he added that the dollar rate has left the Naira weaker, making importation of products more expensive.</p>Edwin<p>Damilola, 29, who sells mannequins, salon equipment, and fashion accessories on Jiji, Konga, and Jumia in Nigeria, completely closed her shop in May. She didn’t have that much stock and struggled to import it from abroad.

 Tough gigs: On-demand labour and freelancing  Conversations with Africa’s platform&nbsp;workers <p>These conversations took place between March, 2020 and September, 2020</p><p><a href="https://lynk.co.ke/">Lynk</a> is an on-demand local labour platform in Kenya, through which plumbers, painters, cleaners, carpenters and many other professionals secure paid&nbsp;work.</p>Stanley<p>When COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Stanley, a cleaner on the platform knew that his work days were numbered. The offices he, and many others on the platform, regularly clean had closed. Even homes were no longer accessible. “Clients are too conscious and everybody is afraid to offer us jobs to clean their homes or offices,” Stanley told me in&nbsp;June.</p><p>Stanley was part of an incubation program at Lynk, where workers were provided with a monthly salary and upskilling opportunities. In April, due to the high costs associated with the incubation program, Lynk transitioned workers out of these programs and into independent contractor roles. However for Stanley, not only did his incubation program end, but all cleaning services were discontinued on the platform due to lack of demand. Short-term relief came for Stanley when Lynk secured a contract with <a href="https://www.safehandskenya.com/">Safe Hands Kenya</a> to disinfect the slums in Nairobi but that ended quickly and by July, there was no more&nbsp;work.</p><p>When COVID started, Lynk ensured that all pros — including Stanley — were compensated with one month of pay regardless of whether or not their clients continued to engage them. Stanley also received a recommendation letter from Lynk to help support him in his job&nbsp;search.</p><p>A father of two, Stanley, 34, was eventually forced to leave Nairobi and relocate to the village with his family. He sold some of his belongings including his phone, to afford the transport costs. He and his family now temporarily live with his mother in the village and his landlord has since put a padlock on their house back in the city due to rent arrears. The family, he says, will eventually have to return to the house in the city when the children resume school. Stanley now earns a living by collecting grass for cattle keepers, and is paid mostly in food. “If you are lucky, you get cash but it is also very little. It is KES150 (USD 1.4) for each time someone needs grass. I have about three clients,” he&nbsp;says.</p> Lynk’s support interventions <p>In addition to the one month pay, Lynk rolled out a number of interventions to help their workers weather the storm. Akinyi Ooko-Ombaka who heads the Lynk Academy told us the platform provided a monthly transport allowance of KES 30000 (USD 30) to each worker, distributed PPE, conducted multiple sensitization training and even reached out to partners for additional support. “BuildHer, one of our recruitment partners, provided food packages to all workers in our shop,” Akinyi told us. They also partnered with an organisation to provide cash transfers to their most vulnerable workers.</p><p>“While the impact of COVID is ubiquitous, workers on the platform have been affected differently not only based on their socio-economic status, but their trade. For instance we’ve seen significant growth in our Furniture segment whereas services like Beauty were the most hard hit. Even before COVID, informal workers were vulnerable COVID has forced us to think more deeply about supporting our workers to build resilience.” Akinyi&nbsp;said.</p> Freelancing Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@flysi3000?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Simon Abrams</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/remote-work-africa?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">&nbsp;Unsplash</a><p>While the COVID-19 pandemic popularised freelancing (self-employed workers who take on contracts from various companies) globally as more people went online to find jobs they could do remotely, the demand side didn’t increase fast enough to meet supply. According to a <a href="https://pubs.payoneer.com/docs/2020-gig-economy-index.pdf">survey</a> by Payoneer, a global company that provides financial services to freelancers, close to 32% of freelancers reported that demand had greatly decreased after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in&nbsp;March.</p><p>Only one out of the seven freelancers I spoke to in June was getting more work due to COVID-19. Ainomugisha, 27, a Ugandan professional content solutions provider, said the pandemic was a blessing in disguise.</p><p>“It has created a huge content gap that companies and publications world over are scrambling to fill with informative articles, essays, blog posts, newsletters, etc about COVID-19 for their respective audiences,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>But for the others, hours were reduced and some long-running contracts were ended prematurely. Kwesi, a 30-year-old Ghanian virtual assistant on Upwork and Fiverr said he lost a long-term contract after the company he was working for told him they were restructuring.</p><p>“My income has gone down by more than 50%,” Kwesi told me in June. When we spoke again in September, Kwesi had just found a job as a radio presenter and now commits less time to finding online&nbsp;gigs.</p><p>Other freelancers in Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana shared similar stories. Some thought that they were getting less work because of increased competition- that there were more people joining the platforms in search of work. Another global <a href="https://pubs.payoneer.com/images/the-state-of-freelancing-during-covid-19.pdf">Payoneer survey</a> reported that freelance marketplaces had seen a rapid growth in new freelancers joining the platforms.</p> Need for new&nbsp;skills <p>With more freetime on their hands the freelancers recognised the need to upgrade their skills in order to compete more favourably in a now crowded world of online&nbsp;work.</p><p>Ama (not real name), 36, an Upwork virtual assistant based in Ghana had been doing clerical work since she joined the platform in 2015. She was making up to $800 a month pre-Covid, but her income reduced to $300 in June after one of her main clients ended the contract because of COVID. She’s since received requests from clients asking if she has other skills like WordPress, database management or app development.</p><p>“Those skills are mostly requested by the clients as part of the virtual assistant job,” Ama said. She now plans to start a course on one of the three in January next&nbsp;year.</p><p>Carol (not real name), 26, a Ugandan on Upwork who conducts market research on products for companies that sell on Amazon is adding data visualization to her skillset so she can also get more&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>And Kelechi, 33, a market researcher also on Upwork, has enrolled in a digital marketing course on Udemy. While he still has a daytime office job, Kelechi is keen to make online freelancing his main source of income, and to do so he realises he needs to make sure he has a set of strong skills to stand out from the&nbsp;crowd.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/social-commerce-and-e-commerce-not-enough-orders-conversations-with-africas-platform-sellers-a9e1963ddd91">In the last blog, we share the stories of those who sell goods and services through marketplace websites like Jumia, Jiji, and on social&nbsp;media.</a></p><p>The workers and sellers whose real names and/or photos are used in our blogs consented to their use. <br>These conversations were conducted with support from the<a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/"> Mastercard Foundation</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/tough-gigs-on-demand-labour-and-freelancing-conversations-with-africas-platform-workers-d6d22b3c030d">Tough gigs: On-demand labour and freelancing — Conversations with Africa’s platform workers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Conversations with Africa’s platform&nbsp;workers  Ride-hailing: Fewer customers, less&nbsp;income <p>Conversations took place between March, 2020 and September, 2020</p><p>Kwame (not his real name), 24, lives in Kumasi, Ghana. He started driving for Bolt just over a year ago. His plan was to make enough money to be able to continue his education beyond high school. He secured a car on hire purchase, and was paying it off weekly. All was going fairly well until the pandemic hit. Kwame went from making 25 trips per day, pre-COVID, to less than five. After paying the car rental fees and Bolt’s 25%, he earned 50–100 Ghana Cedis (USD 9–17) per day, far less than the 300 Ghana Cedis (USD 51) he was making daily&nbsp;before.</p><p>“I am working but I cannot even buy food. I have been eating roasted maize for the last three days. It is just hard for me,” Kwame told me in&nbsp;June.</p><p>He was also forced to move in with his sister because he couldn’t afford his own rent anymore. “At least there is food there,” he&nbsp;said.</p>Michael is an Uber driver in Nairobi,&nbsp;Kenya<p>Michael, an Uber driver in Kenya, has a similar story. Fewer rides left him barely able to take care of his family of four. With kids stuck at home due to school closures, he was spending more on printing study materials and buying food for the family. To close the gap caused by his reduced income, Michael borrowed KES 4000 (USD 37) from TALA, a mobile loans company, in May. By September, he was still unable to pay it&nbsp;back.</p><p>In Uganda, Ismail, 27, an IT graduate, joined Uber in 2018 when he failed to find a job after graduation. His trips were halved to five a day at the beginning of the pandemic. When Uganda went into complete lockdown on March 28, Ismail was left with no work due to <a href="https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/president-museveni-bans-private-cars-declares-curfew--1883252">new regulation</a>s prohibiting anyone, apart from a few authorized drivers, from being on the&nbsp;road.</p><p>Motorcycle taxis (locally known as boda boda), however, were allowed to make deliveries, which meant that Bob, a Ugandan <a href="https://safeboda.com/ug/">SafeBoda</a> rider, could continue earning some money during the lockdown. But when restrictions on vehicle movement were lifted in June, and people began to do their own shopping, Bob was left with little to no business, with bans still on place on carrying passengers.</p>Photo/SafeBoda.com<p>Bob eventually quit SafeBoda because, he said, the rates are too low and “It doesn’t make financial sense to continue using the app given the current situation.” He now only serves a few of his long-time customers. He is also doing deliveries for an agro-seed company, which he says brings in a little more, especially now that it is planting season for the farmers. Between September and November, farmers order seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, and other products in preparation for the planting&nbsp;season.</p><p>However, if the Uganda government’s plan to ban boda bodas from the Kampala Central Business District comes to pass on November 1, Bob will be left with no work at&nbsp;all.</p> Pivoting to&nbsp;delivery <p>In Africa, as was the situation globally during the pandemic, most ride-hailing companies pivoted toward deliveries. Unfortunately, this didn’t bring in enough for the majority of the drivers and riders we spoke to. Only Geoffrey who rides for a logistics company in Kenya — Sendy — was lucky enough to make decent money when the company launched <a href="https://businesstoday.co.ke/sendy-launches-home-delivery-service/">SendyGo</a> in May, a home delivery option in Nairobi. But even then, this decent money, Geoffrey said, was just enough to cover his rent, food, and other essentials without leaving much for anything else, prompting him to borrow money to meet his other&nbsp;needs.</p>Geoffrey/Sendy<p>“The work has increased. When COVID started, there was a shock but now people have adapted. They now use SendyGo to help get food and essentials delivered to their home,” Geoffrey told me in June. In September, things were still going well for him. He had even managed to pay off 95% of a loan he had taken out in May from the Sendy SACCO, a savings scheme for the&nbsp;riders.</p>Samuel<p>However, for the two <a href="https://max.ng/">MAX.NG</a> riders in Lagos, Nigeria, Samuel and Muhammed, doing deliveries did not pick up or pay off. To make things worse, the Lagos State <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1797369/lagos-okada-ban-sparks-protests-hits-bike-hailing-startups/">government banned</a> okadas (motorcycle taxis) from operating in the city in February, right before the pandemic. Both riders said that the ban was worse than the pandemic as they were dependent on the little money they made from deliveries.</p><p>“You cannot make more than 4 or 5 trips. It is not the same as it was when we had passengers,” Samuel told me in&nbsp;June.</p> Platform responses <p>While Africa-based platforms like Sendy, SafeBoda, and MAX.NG <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-african-gig-workers-and-what-needs-to-be-done-97301">ensured</a> that the riders had the information, hand sanitizer, and masks to operate safely during the pandemic, global platforms like Uber and Bolt did little beyond providing health and safety information, the drivers said. Buying hand sanitizer and masks became an additional expense for those who were already making less&nbsp;money.</p>Photo/MAX.NG<p>Fairwork, which has kept a close eye on labor platforms and their COVID-19 policies, <a href="https://botpopuli.net/covid-19-gigwork-precarity-platforms">found</a> a glaring gap between policy and practice. For example, Fairwork found that while Uber announced it would provide financial support for 14 days to drivers who have been diagnosed, a small print in the policy noted that <a href="https://fair.work/wp-content/uploads/sites/97/2020/09/COVID-19-Report-September-2020.pdf">paid leave is “conditional on producing a sick note,”</a> something that many drivers find difficult to&nbsp;acquire.</p><p>For the Africa-based Uber and Bolt drivers I spoke to, they had little to no knowledge of such policies and didn’t know how they would get in touch with the companies if they got&nbsp;sick.</p><p>Ismail said Uber asked them to send photos of receipts when they buy masks and hand sanitizer, but he said it was a time-consuming process. He preferred that Uber give them the items with no such conditions.</p><p>“At the moment, there is no cost that is bearable. Even spending Shs 10,000 (USD 2.7) on hand sanitizer is too much for me,” Ismail&nbsp;said.</p><p>The drivers also said they expected Uber and Bolt to reduce their commission but that didn’t happen. Instead, in trying to woo customers, the companies reduced fares and gave discounts to customers, leaving the drivers with less income but still expecting them to remit the 25% commission daily.</p> Future of platform&nbsp;work <p>In September, things were looking up for both riders and drivers. Still, with continuing restrictions on people and businesses, no one was getting as many customers as they used to before the pandemic. Ongoing curfews in some countries like Uganda and Kenya have reduced the drivers’ working hours. “The problem is that there is curfew. Many of the clients were people who would go out on weekends,” Michael told me in September.</p><p>The increased cost of living, high fuel prices, weekly car rental fees, and increased expenditure at home have become the characteristics of everyday life for most of the drivers and&nbsp;riders.</p><p>The precarious nature of gig work, combined with rising unemployment in all four countries — Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda — is forcing platform workers to think of ways to depend less on what used to be a good enough source of income. Some are contemplating abandoning it altogether if the situation doesn’t change for the&nbsp;better.</p><p>Kwame is one of those already planning a way out. He has applied to join the army. “I’m already buying small things like boots and khakis,” he says. As Kwame waits for the phone call from the army, he says he will continue driving as it is his only source of income for&nbsp;now.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/tough-gigs-on-demand-labour-and-freelancing-conversations-with-africas-platform-workers-d6d22b3c030d">In the next blog, we share the stories of freelancers and on-demand laborers.</a></p><p>The workers and sellers whose real names and/or photos are used in our blogs consented to their use. <br>These conversations were conducted with support from the<a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/"> Mastercard Foundation</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/conversations-with-africas-platform-workers-on-ride-hailing-fewer-customers-less-income-49973f8f5e8e">Conversations with Africa’s platform workers on ride-hailing: fewer customers, less income</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As part of Caribou Digital’s ongoing focus on emerging platform livelihoods, and with the support of the <a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/">Mastercard Foundation</a>, we spoke to 30 young African platform workers in March, June, and September about the effects of the pandemic. These young men and women from Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana, the majority of whom are below 35 years old, make their living through digital platforms as ride-hailing drivers, delivery drivers, freelancers, e-commerce sellers, and on-demand laborers.</p><p>While pegged to the pandemic, these conversations bring out similar experiences — both positive and negative — captured within the <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">12 elements</a> of Caribou Digital’s recently published <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-3258b05aa83d">platform livelihoods framework</a>. Through this framework, we map several kinds of platform livelihoods, uncover trends and identify cross cutting issues, based on our own original research and that of the wider digital development community.</p><p>With high unemployment rates in all four countries, platforms offer opportunities and, more importantly, access to work and markets and earnings, as you will read in the three blogs that&nbsp;follow.</p><p>It is interesting to learn how these workers and sellers often engage with several platforms, “multihoming” and working fractionally across one to augment another. Some on Upwork, for example, advertise their services on social media. Similarly, those selling on e-commerce websites like Jumia, often advertise or use their personal networks on social media to market their physical&nbsp;shops.</p><p>Additionally, even though the platforms provide access to a wider market, this doesn’t always translate into enough earnings. COVID-19 has forced some ride-hailing and delivery drivers to look ‘off-platform’ to find more work. One driver in Kenya said he would start buying farm produce when he makes longer trips to the countryside. He would then sell this produce in the city. Another driver in Ghana said he is considering starting a fabric business for his wife and delivering to customers himself, in between&nbsp;rides.</p><p>For these youth, platforms have offered a first entry point into work, whether as drivers, freelancers, or micro-entrepreneurs. Students are taking up driving and engaging in social commerce to raise money to pay for their education and other necessities.</p><p>Another thing worth noting is that of the eight digital commerce sellers we spoke to, six are women; of these, five use social media exclusively to sell their products due to the low barriers to entry as compared to e-commerce. They make enough to pay for Facebook or Instagram Ads but do not want to be burdened with subscription fees charged by platforms like Jiji and&nbsp;Jumia.</p><p>Hidden hierarchies are visible in the ride-hailing business. Most drivers we spoke to don’t own the cars they are driving, so paying weekly rental fees takes a big chunk of their income. They are driving to own; they dream of owning a fleet of cars and being bosses&nbsp;someday.</p><p>However, with the disruption caused by the pandemic, which led to less earnings across the board, the workers and sellers were exposed to the precariousness of platform work.

<p>We’ve had the privilege of observing companies across the globe successfully eliminate passwords for their customers and employees. These trailblazers have set the standard and <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/success-stories/">demonstrated the benefits</a> unlocked by passwordlesss authentication. Some of the key ingredients include a clear understanding of Why they are moving beyond passwords as well as a willingness to trust their partners in defining the How.</p>
      
<p>I’ve also seen less fortunate companies who have hit road blocks. </p>
      
<p>Despite having a strong desire to deploy next-gen security some organizations can’t seem to get out of their own way. Some developed massive RFI’s that went nowhere. Others had “passwordless initiatives” that began in 2018, got bogged down by identity orchestration projects, and are just now finally deploying 14-character complex passwords (seriously). </p>
      
<p>These unfortunate situations have some things in common. Here are the top 3 things we’ve seen get in the way of a passwordless deployment and how you can avoid them:</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 1. Expecting your Identity Provider to Get You There 
      
<p>If you think your incumbent Identity Provider (IdP) is going to eliminate all of your passwords, I’ve got news for you.</p>
      
<p>Legacy Identity Platforms were built on top of passwords and password-based MFA. While the IAM giants did an incredible job and revolutionized digital security, the elimination of passwords and shared secrets is not their core competency. In fact, authentication itself has always been an add-on feature for the IdP. There has been no need to invest significant resources in improving authentication. As a result, very little innovation has happened on that front.</p>
      
<p>Just look at the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for IAM. Why is the “Visionaries” quadrant empty? </p>
      
  
      
<p>The lack of focus and innovation is why we are seeing more and more businesses <a href="https://get.hypr.com/decoupling-authentication-from-identity">Decoupling Authentication from Identity</a>. After years of waiting for next-gen authentication to arrive and reading blog post after blog post about the benefits of passwordless, these customers are left scratching their heads when they realize their IdP is still using passwords… everywhere. </p>
      
<p>Fortunately, a growing number of organizations have wised up to <a href="https://www.hypr.com/comparing-passwordless-marketing-passwordless-mfa/">the differences between passwordless marketing and passwordless MFA</a>. Those who have succeeded at this mission are teams that realized that they cannot evolve beyond passwords if they simply rely on their incumbent Identity Providers.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 2. Letting Perfect Be the Enemy of Great 
      
<p>“We need everyone to be able to use the same authentication method everywhere, under all conditions, on day 1.” </p>
      
<p>This one-size-fits-all mindset often appears in large, complex organizations who are (rightfully) trying to eliminate passwords for all users. It is commendable to see project leaders striving to satisfy all use cases &amp; edge cases on day 1.</p>
      
<p>Unfortunately, carpet-bombing the password never works. The actual process is more like mowing a lawn, one section at a time, until all of the grass looks consistent.</p>
      
  
      
<p>For an enterprise, the Passwordless transformation is similar to a cloud transformation. It moves incrementally and addresses the needs of a diverse array of user devices, applications and edge cases. These variables manifest in a number of ways:</p>
      
  Users’ personal preferences will vary. Many people are glued to their smartphone. Some prefer to use their desktop for everything work-related.  Some users have an old phone, or no phone. Complex environments have widely different device populations and compliance requirements.  Highly regulated departments might disallow smartphones and require the use of a hardware security token.  And of course, many users simply do not want to carry another piece of hardware.  
      
<p>See why the one-size-fits all approach fails? Trying to solve every use case and edge case on day 1 is an absolutist pursuit of perfection.</p>
      
<p>These organizations take advantage of the various <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-login-methods/">passwordless login methods</a> that satisfy the needs of every situation. Your MFA strategy should allow for the use of <a href="https://www.hypr.com/mobile-initiated-authentication/">Mobile-initiated Authentication</a>, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/fido2-passwordless-yubikey-login/">FIDO2 Security Tokens</a>, and native authenticators such as Windows Hello:</p>
   




 
   
     
       
         
           
            
                       

                                   
              
                              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skprInx4tV4">
                  Play
                                      
                                  </a>
                           
          
                   
       
     
   
 
   
<p>The successful passwordless companies are those who focus on a progressive rollout as outlined in our <a href="https://www.hypr.com/password-elimination/">Free Guide to Password Elimination</a>.</p>
      
<p>Don’t let perfect be the enemy of great. Focus on mowing the password lawn.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 3. IT and Security Teams Who Are Not on the Same Page 
      
<p>The alignment of teams is critical to the success of a transformational project. Many IT initiatives have slowed down to a halt when departments don’t see eye to eye or have conflicting agendas. Any meaningful workforce transformation depends on your IT and Help desk becoming supportive champions of the project.</p>
      
<p>This is where my earlier point about emphasizing the “Why” comes into play. </p>
      
<p>Going passwordless brings a tremendous benefit in terms of user experience, increased security, and cost savings. These impacts are immediately felts across the organization as the drop in password-related support tickets improves the lives of IT, Help desk, and support teams. These groups are the foundation for any successful authentication initiative and they must understand why it is happening and how they can benefit.</p>
      
<p>The good news is Passwordless MFA has a habit of bringing departments together. Rarely do you see IT, InfoSec, Fraud, Compliance, and Line of Business teams come together with such a passion for a common goal. We have seen some of the most fragmented teams build long-lasting bonds over the success of a passwordless deployment. </p>
      
  
      
 To Get Rid of Passwords, You have to Think Like a Password 
      
<p>No, not really. But getting it right means adopting the passwordless mindset. Here is a summary of what the Passwordless Companies are doing:</p>
      
  Go passwordless on your terms. Don’t sit around waiting for your incumbent IAM provider to eliminate passwords (they won’t), and don’t let legacy vendors dictate <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-identity-management/">what passwordless identity should mean to you</a>.   Don’t let perfect be the enemy of great. Focus on quick wins with one user group at a time as you progress towards a passwordless state.  Align your teams towards a common goal. Passwordless MFA sells itself. Nobody wants to go back to passwords. Focus on why password elimination matters to your colleagues and it will naturally accelerate on its own.

  <p>By the end of 2023, more than 90% of infrastructure and operations (I&amp;O) organizations will have the majority of their staff working remotely. COVID-19 may have accelerated this trend, but it is also the result of the changing nature of infrastructure led by the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cloud-shift-impacts-all-it-markets/">shift to cloud </a>and edge.</p>
<p>“Trends like anywhere operations and core modernization have been moving to the forefront of the I&amp;O organization for years, but the pandemic rapidly accelerated them to the point where they’ll have a transformational impact in the near future,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/16025">Jeffrey Hewitt</a>, Research VP, Gartner.</p>
<p>Here are the six key trends that will impact I&amp;O in the next 12 to 18 months and the steps that IT leaders can take to implement them.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 Trend No. 1: Anywhere operations 
<p>The shift to remote work has forced enterprises to realize the benefits of flexibility. It has also revealed that the traditional structured processes of I&amp;O make the enterprise fragile in the face of disruption.</p>
<p>I&amp;O must be able to support the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/master-a-distributed-workforce-for-digital-transformation/">distributed enterprise’s</a> operations while working from anywhere. In addition to providing more flexibility, anywhere operations benefits organizations by broadening the talent landscape, as I&amp;O teams are not tied to recruiting from a certain geographic location. However, this will require a cultural change, as it challenges the traditional thinking of providing infrastructure and supporting operations from one central location.</p>
<p>To enable anywhere operations, I&amp;O leaders should assess its feasibility for each business unit. Determine where remote working makes sense, and develop plans to enable these teams to dynamically work both on-site and remotely.</p>
 Trend No. 2: Optimal infrastructure 
<p>Optimal infrastructure shifts I&amp;O from “infrastructure and operations” to “integration and operations.” Different infrastructure choices, such as cloud, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/edge-computing">edge</a> or newer technologies like computational storage, may apply to different locations and workloads. It has become a key responsibility of I&amp;O to determine the infrastructure that is the best fit for each scenario.</p>
<p>This trend supports I&amp;O and business alignment by ensuring strong returns for infrastructure investment. I&amp;O leaders should take a business approach to optimal infrastructure, using a cost-benefit view to justify infrastructure choices and to build business cases for change. Consider risk-return ratios as part of any proposed change scenarios.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz05ODYxNTA0MjMzZWUxMWViODhjYzJmMGZiNGYxN2RkYw=="></a></p>
 Trend No. 3: Operational continuity 
<p>IT services must be continuous, regardless of external factors. This expectation changes the traditional role of IT operations, requiring an increased dependence on automation and zero- or minimal-touch maintenance. The benefits of this include increased efficiency, faster workload deployment, reduced costs and consistency across processes.</p>
<p>However, operational continuity also presents challenges, as it requires the introduction of new tools and processes, it may increase complexity and it can be difficult to justify to the business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take contingency planning to the next level by considering the impacts of worst-case scenarios</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To shift the IT organization toward operational continuity, identify continuity requirements based on business priorities and begin planning accordingly. Take contingency planning to the next level by considering the impacts of worst-case scenarios and what can be done to ensure that operations can continue in such a situation. If there are time pressures, or if the team does not have the skills to implement a solution, consider service-based solutions for disaster recovery.</p>

 Trend No. 4: Core modernization 
<p>Today, organizations are doing more to update and modernize their core infrastructures. This process helps minimize legacy drag, maximize efficiency and ensure resiliency as legacy infrastructure experts retire. It ensures infrastructure evolves in lockstep with <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-trends-drive-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2020/">emerging technologies</a>, becoming more flexible to respond to digital business needs.</p>
<p>Modernization is not only a technical decision. It requires funding, and therefore I&amp;O professionals must have business acumen to make the case for it. Work with application leaders to identify the areas where modernization will have the greatest impact, and ensure these areas align with business priorities. Implement a modernization plan with realistic timelines. New skills requirements should be part of that plan.</p>
 Trend No. 5: Distributed cloud 
<p>Distributed cloud is the decentralization of cloud resources. It enables flexibility in the enterprise’s physical location, while also reducing latency and shifting the burden of support to the cloud service provider. Each of the many different models of distributed cloud offer a variety of benefits.</p>
<p>Distributed cloud also comes with challenges, including complex deployment models and increased risk of lock-in and high costs, and it remains an immature market.</p>
<p>I&amp;O professionals should have distributed cloud on their radar as a trend to watch as it continues to mature and emerge as a preferred infrastructure model over the coming 12-18 months. Identify potential use cases, and plan how it could be integrated into the organization’s hybrid cloud environment.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-distributed-cloud/">The CIO's Guide to Distributed Cloud</a></p>
 Trend No. 6: Critical skills vs. critical roles 
<p>I&amp;O organizations are shifting to a focus on critical skills rather than critical roles. This helps reduce risk and increase resiliency, as multiple people have with the skills needed for business-critical tasks. It also helps I&amp;O teams to align budgets more closely with business needs and move away from territorial thinking to a more collaborative approach.</p>
<p>This trend will require a shift in recruitment tactics, forcing enterprises to have a longer-range view when hiring. Identify the skills gaps, using the aforementioned trends as a framework for the future competencies that will be needed. Train current employees in new skills where that will be sufficient, and hire new talent early when possible.</p>

  <p>The microservice architecture pattern, in which business functionality is distributed among many small atomic applications as opposed to one or two monolithic chunks, is very powerful and in wide use across large and small tech companies. Each piece has a narrow, well-defined task and communicates with other services via a shared channel (usually REST APIs).</p>

<p>The benefits of adopting a microservice architecture include:</p>

 
   Easier maintenance and development of applications: developers and teams can focus on just one application resulting in more rapid development and reduced risk of unintentionally introducing bugs in the larger project. 
   Improved fault tolerance: in a well-designed microservice architecture, one service’s failure will not crash the entire project. 
   Flexibility: each service can be written in a language and framework that is appropriate to its mission, and each can be allocated the most appropriate hardware/infrastructure. 
 

<p>Spring Boot is a very popular framework for creating microservices quickly and easily. Due to its popularity, it is also extremely well-supported with plenty of technical guides and examples online.</p>

<p>It’s easy to create several, dozens, or even hundreds of microservices for your project with Spring Boot. One speed bump with this approach, however, is the configuration of all these services. Typically in Spring Boot, configuration is bundled with the application. This works fine for small, monolithic applications, but when dealing with dozens of services and potentially hundreds of configuration files, managing all of them can be a headache.</p>

 Spring Cloud Config to the Rescue! 

<p>This is where Spring Cloud Config, a framework integrated with Spring Boot, is useful. A dedicated “config server” is brought online from which each microservice can download its configuration data. This dramatically simplifies the management of many microservices by centralizing their configuration in one location and provides the ability to “live” refresh a microservice’s configuration without redeploying the service. As a bonus, Spring Cloud Config provides out-of-the-box support for storing/reading configuration from Git repositories, giving you a full audit history of changes in one location.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will:</p>

 
   Create a central configuration server using Spring Boot. 
   Create two separate microservices/applications using Spring Boot, which read their configuration from the server. 
   Secure the applications using OAuth 2.0 and Okta. 
   Demonstrate how to (securely) refresh a service’s configuration without redeploying. 
 

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<p>Prerequisites: <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">Java 11</a></p>

 Create a Spring Cloud Config Server 

<p>First, you will create a Spring Boot application that behaves as the configuration server. This application will provide configuration settings to your microservices.</p>

<p>Click <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.4.0.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.okta.dev&amp;artifactId=config-server&amp;name=cloud-config-server&amp;description=Configuration%20Server&amp;packageName=com.okta.dev.config-server&amp;dependencies=security,web,cloud-config-server">this link</a> or go to <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a> and select the following options in your browser:</p>

 
   Project: <code>Maven Project</code> 
   Language: <code>Java</code> 
   Spring Boot: <code>2.4.0</code> 
 

<p>Under Project Metadata, set the values to the following:</p>

 
   Group: <code>com.okta.dev</code> 
   Artifact: <code>config-server</code> 
   Name: <code>cloud-config-server</code> 
   Description: Configuration Server 
   Package: <code>com.okta.dev.configserver</code> 
   Packaging: <code>Jar</code> 
   Java: <code>11</code> 
 

<p>Select the following dependencies:</p>

 
   Spring Security 
   Spring Web 
   Config Server 
 

<p>Click Generate to download the project files. Unzip the file and import the project files into your favorite IDE.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open the project in your IDE and update <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> with the following key-value pairs:</p>

   <code>server.port=8888
spring.cloud.config.server.native.search-locations=/path/to/config/folder
spring.security.user.name=configUser
spring.security.user.password=configPass
</code>   

<p>The property <code>spring.cloud.config.server.native.search-locations</code> is the location where you store your configuration files. Replace the value with a folder on your filesystem where these files will be saved. For example, <code>file://${user.home}/config</code>.</p>

<p>Normally your configuration files would be stored in a remote location, for example, a GitHub repository or an Amazon S3 bucket. For instructions on how to store your config files in a git repository, see <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/#_git_backend">this section in the Spring Cloud Config documentation</a>. To keep this tutorial simple, you will use the “native” filesystem option above.</p>

<p>Open your application’s main class and add the <code>@EnableConfigServer</code> annotation:</p>

   <code>import org.springframework.cloud.config.server.EnableConfigServer;

@EnableConfigServer
@SpringBootApplication
public class CloudConfigServerApplication { ... }
</code>   

 Create an OpenID Connect Application 

<p>Sign up for a free developer account at <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">https://developer.okta.com/signup</a>. This will be used to secure your microservices using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC). After signing up, log in to your Okta account at https://your-okta-domain.okta.com.</p>

<p>Click Applications in the top nav menu.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Add Application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select Web and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In Application Settings fill in the following values:</p>

 
   Name: <code>My Spring Cloud App</code> (or another name of your choosing) 
   Base URIs: <code>http://localhost:8001</code> and <code>http://localhost:8002</code> 
   Login Redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:8001/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and <code>http://localhost:8002/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> 
   Logout Redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:8001</code> and <code>http://localhost:8002</code> 
   Group Assignments: <code>Everyone</code> (should be selected by default) 
   Grant type allowed: <code>Authorization Code</code> 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click Done.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Take note of the values for Client ID and Client secret. These will be necessary for securing your microservices with OAuth 2.0.</p>

<p></p>

 Configure Security for Your Microservices Architecture 

<p>Next, you’ll need to create the configuration files which will be used by your microservices. Create or open the directory specified above for <code>spring.cloud.config.server.native.search-locations</code> and add the following files:</p>

<p><code>service-one.yml</code></p>
   <code>server:
  port: 8001

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: https://YOUR_DOMAIN.okta.com/oauth2/default
    clientId: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
</code>   

<p><code>service-one-profile1.yml</code></p>
   <code>hello:
  message: "Service One Profile One"
</code>   

<p><code>service-one-profile2.yml</code></p>
   <code>hello:
  message: "Service One Profile Two"
</code>   

<p><code>service-two.yml</code></p>
   <code>server:
  port: 8002

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: https://YOUR_DOMAIN.okta.com/oauth2/default
    clientId: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
</code>   

<p><code>service-two-profile1.yml</code></p>
   <code>hello:
  message: "Service Two Profile One"
</code>   

<p><code>service-two-profile2.yml</code></p>
   <code>hello:
  message: "Service Two Profile Two"
</code>   

 
   Replace <code>YOUR_DOMAIN</code> with your Okta account’s domain. It should look something like <code>dev-0123456</code>, e.g. <code>https://dev-0123456.okta.com/oauth2/default</code>, 
   Replace <code>YOUR_CLIENT_ID</code> with the value of the <code>Client ID</code> you created earlier. 
   Replace <code>YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET</code> with your app’s <code>Client secret</code>. 
 

<p>Let’s take a moment to discuss the naming convention for the configuration files. The filenames are important and must be in a certain pattern for your microservices to pick them up:</p>

   <code>/{application}/{profile}[/{label}]
/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.yml
/{application}-{profile}.properties
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.properties
</code>   

<p>Where:</p>
 
   <code>{application}</code> is the name of your microservice specified via your microservice’s <code>spring.application.name</code> property. In this case, <code>service-one</code> and <code>service-two</code>. 
   <code>{profile}</code> matches the list of profiles your microservice is running via the <code>spring.profiles.active</code> property. In this case, <code>profile1</code> and <code>profile2</code>. 
   <code>{label}</code> is an additional descriptor usually corresponding to a version control branch, e.g. <code>dev</code> or <code>stg</code>. It can be manually set via the <code>spring.cloud.config.label</code> property in the microservice’s <code>bootstrap.properties</code> file or set on the command line (<code>-Dspring.cloud.config.label</code>). 
 

<p>In this tutorial, you have two sets of configuration files: one set for Service One (<code>service-one.yml</code>) and one for Service Two (<code>service-two.yml</code>).</p>

<p>Enter your config server’s project directory and run the application:</p>

   <code>cd /path/to/config-server
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=native
</code>   

<p>The <code>native</code> profile tells the application to server configuration files from the filesystem directory you populated above.</p>

 Create Spring Boot Microservice #1 

<p>Let’s create the first of your two microservices.</p>

<p>Open the <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a> or <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.4.0.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.okta.dev&amp;artifactId=service-one&amp;name=service-one&amp;description=Microservice%20One&amp;packageName=com.okta.dev.service-one&amp;dependencies=web,okta,cloud-config-client,actuator">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Select the following options:</p>

 
   Project: <code>Maven Project</code> 
   Language: <code>Java</code> 
   Spring Boot: <code>2.4.0</code> 
 

<p>Under Project Metadata fill in the following information:</p>

 
   Group: <code>com.okta.dev</code> 
   Artifact: <code>service-one</code> 
   Name: <code>service-one</code> 
   Description: Microservice One 
   Package: <code>com.okta.dev.service-one</code> 
   Packaging: <code>Jar</code> 
   Java: <code>11</code> 
 

<p>Select the following dependencies:</p>

 
   Spring Web 
   Okta 
   Config Client 
   Spring Boot Actuator 
 

<p>Click Generate and import the project files into your favorite IDE.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open the project in your IDE and update <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> with the following key-value pairs:</p>

   <code>spring.application.name=service-one
spring.config.import=configserver:
spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888
spring.cloud.config.username=configUser
spring.cloud.config.password=configPass
</code>   

 
   <code>spring.application.name</code> is the name of this microservice and must match the <code>{application}</code> parameter in the filename convention described above. 
   <code>spring.cloud.config.uri</code> is the location of the config server currently running. 
   <code>spring.cloud.config.username</code> and <code>spring.cloud.config.password</code> are used by your microservice to authenticate with the config server while retrieving configuration files. The values must match the values of <code>spring.security.user.name</code> and <code>spring.security.user.password</code> defined in your config server’s <code>application.properties</code>. 
 

<p>To secure your microservice using Okta and OAuth 2.0, open your microservice’s main class and add the following configuration class:</p>

   <code>@Configuration
public static class ApplicationSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    
    @Override
    public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .oauth2Login();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add a basic REST controller, which will respond with a message defined in your service’s configuration file (hosted on the config server):</p>

   <code>@RestController
@RequestMapping("/secure")
public static class SecureController {
    
    @Value("${hello.message}")
    private String helloMessage;

    @GetMapping
    public String secure(Principal principal) {
        return helloMessage;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The resulting application class should now look like this:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.serviceone;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

                .oauth2Login();
        }
    }

    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("/secure")
    public static class SecureController {

        @Value("${hello.message}")
        private String helloMessage;

        @GetMapping
        public String secure(Principal principal) {
            return helloMessage;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Enter your config server’s project directory and run the application with <code>profile1</code> set:</p>

   <code>cd /path/to/service-one
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=profile1
</code>   

<p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8001/secure</code>. You should be redirected to Okta for authentication. After successfully authenticating, you should see the following message:</p>

   <code>Service One Profile One
</code>   

<p>This is the same message defined in the <code>service-one-profile.yml</code> file you created earlier. Neat!</p>

<p>Next, you will switch your microservice’s active profile to <code>profile2</code> and observe a different message. Stop your application and re-run with <code>profile2</code> active:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=profile2
</code>   

<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8001/secure</code>. You should now see the message defined in <code>service-one-profile2.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>Service One Profile Two
</code>   

 Refresh the Configuration in Your Spring Cloud Config Server 

<p>Spring Cloud Config provides the ability to “live” reload your service’s configuration without stopping or re-deploying. To demonstrate this, first, stop <code>service-one</code> and add the <code>@RefreshScope</code> annotation to your REST controller:</p>

   <code>import org.springframework.cloud.context.config.annotation.RefreshScope;
...

@RefreshScope
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/secure")
public static class SecureController {

    @Value("${hello.message}")
    private String helloMessage;

    @GetMapping
    public String secure(Principal principal) {
        return helloMessage;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>When this annotation is applied to a Spring component (i.e., a <code>@Component</code>, <code>@Service</code>, <code>@RestController</code>, etc.), the component is re-created when a configuration refresh occurs, in this case giving an updated value for <code>${hello.message}</code>.</p>

<p>You can refresh an application’s configuration by including the Spring Boot Actuator dependency, exposing the <code>/actuator/refresh</code> endpoint, and sending an empty <code>POST</code> request.</p>

<p>The Spring Boot Actuator has already been included in your microservice’s dependencies. Edit your configuration files to expose the <code>refresh</code> endpoint:</p>

<p><code>service-one.yml</code></p>
   <code>server:
  port: 8001

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: https://YOUR_DOMAIN.okta.com/oauth2/default
    clientId: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "refresh"
</code>   

<p><code>service-two.yml</code></p>
   <code>server:
  port: 8002

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: https://YOUR_DOMAIN.okta.com/oauth2/default
    clientId: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "refresh"
</code>   

<p>Next, add a security class inside your main application class to secure the endpoint with basic authentication:</p>

   <code>@Configuration
public static class ActuatorSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .csrf().disable()
            .antMatcher("/actuator/*")
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/actuator/*").authenticated()
            .and()
            .httpBasic();
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("serviceOneUser")
            .password("{noop}serviceOnePassword")
            .roles("USER");
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Almost finished! Since your application is already authenticated with OIDC  using Okta, you need to make these two security configuration classes play nicely with each other. Add the <code>@Order</code> annotations to both so <code>ActuatorSecurityConfig</code> takes precedence. This will allow you to refresh the configuration via <code>/actuator/refresh</code> without triggering the OAuth 2.0 flow.</p>

<p>Your application class should now look like this:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.serviceone;

    }
}
</code>   

<p>Start your application using <code>profile1</code>:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=profile1
</code>   

<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8001/secure</code> and note the message still says <code>Service One Profile One</code>.</p>

<p>Open your configuration file at <code>/path/to/config/folder/service-one-profile1.yml</code> and edit the message:</p>

<p><code>service-one-profile1.yml</code></p>
   <code>hello:
  message: "Things have changed"
</code>   

<p>Save the file and refresh the page at <code>http://localhost:8001/secure</code>. Note that the message has not changed yet and still says <code>Service One Profile One</code>. To have your application receive the updated configuration, you must call the <code>/actuator/refresh</code> endpoint:</p>

   <code>curl -u serviceOneUser:serviceOnePassword -X POST http://localhost:8001/actuator/refresh
</code>   

<p>Refresh the page at <code>http://localhost:8001/secure</code>, and you should see the updated message!</p>

 Create Spring Boot Microservice #2 

<p>Next, you will create a second Spring Boot application, acting as a second microservice, which will also have its configuration provided by your configuration server.</p>

<p>Open the <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a> or click <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.4.0.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.okta.dev&amp;artifactId=service-two&amp;name=service-two&amp;description=Microservice%20Two&amp;packageName=com.okta.dev.service-two&amp;dependencies=web,okta,cloud-config-client,actuator">this link</a>.</p>

<p>Select the following options:</p>

 
   Project: <code>Maven Project</code> 
   Language: <code>Java</code> 
   Spring Boot: <code>2.4.0</code> 
 

<p>Under Project Metadata fill in the following information:</p>

 
   Group: <code>com.okta.dev</code> 
   Artifact: <code>service-two</code> 
   Name: <code>service-two</code> 
   Description: Microservice Two 
   Package: <code>com.okta.dev.service-two</code> 
   Packaging: <code>Jar</code> 
   Java: <code>11</code> 
 

<p>Select the following dependencies (the same list as <code>service-one</code>):</p>

 
   Spring Web 
   Okta 
   Config Client 
   Spring Boot Actuator 
 

<p>Click Generate and import the project files into your favorite IDE.</p>

<p>Open the project in your IDE and update <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> with the following properties:</p>

   <code>spring.application.name=service-two
spring.config.import=configserver:
spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888
spring.cloud.config.username=configUser
spring.cloud.config.password=configPass
</code>   

<p>Note the value for <code>spring.application.name</code> is different.</p>

<p>Make the same changes to your main application class as above:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.servicetwo;

            return helloMessage;
        }
    }
}

</code>   

<p>Note the different credentials for the in-memory user: <code>serviceTwoUser / serviceTwoPassword</code>.</p>

<p>Run the application:</p>

   <code>cd /path/to/service-two
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=profile1
</code>   

<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8002/secure</code> and authenticate with Okta. When you are redirected back to your application you will see the welcome message for <code>service-two</code>:</p>

   <code>Service Two Profile One
</code>   

<p>You’re done! You’ve created two microservices, secured by Okta and OAuth 2.0, which receive their configuration settings from a shared Spring Cloud Config server. Very cool! 😎</p>

 Learn More About Spring Cloud Config and Microservices 

<p>This tutorial showed you how to distribute your security configuration between microservices. There’s a lot more you can do with Spring Cloud Config, like encrypting the values you store, and using it with <a>Spring Vault</a> to store your secrets in a more secure location.</p>

<p>For in-depth examples and use cases not covered in this tutorial, see <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/">Spring’s official documentation for Spring Cloud Config</a>.</p>

<p>The source code for this example is on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-cloud-config-example">oktadeveloper/okta-spring-cloud-config-example</a> repository.</p>

					  Weinheim, Baden-Württemberg 04.12.2020. Heute Vormittag war es soweit, beim Get Started Gründerfrühstück des bitkom hatte ich die Ehre und das Vergnügen, in gemütlicher Runde mit Winfried Kretschmann, dem Ministerpräsidenten des Landes Baden-Württemberg, plaudern zu dürfen. <p>Moderiert von Jenny Boldt, bitkom, war außerdem der Unternehmerkollege Pascal Benoit, ENIT-Systems mit dabei. Zunächst drehte sich alles um Startup-Förderung am Standort Baden-Württemberg. Als im schönen Weinheim an der Bergstraße ansässiges Unternehmen muss ich sagen, dass wir uns in Baden-Württemberg wirklich wohl fühlen. Da wir ein 100 % digitales Produkt anbieten, ist für Mitarbeit, Zusammenarbeit mit Partnern und fachlichem Austausch aber eindeutig der Faktor Kompetenz für uns wichtiger als regionale Nähe. Trifft beides zusammen, wunderbar. Wir arbeiten – und das nicht nur aufgrund von Corona – überwiegend virtuell und weltweit vernetzt. Wobei comuny durchaus von regionaler Unterstützung profitiert hat: Anfang 2019 haben wir Up2B durchlaufen, den SAP-Accelerator der Region Mannheim, Heidelberg und Walldorf (<a href="https://up2b.io/">Up2B – Accelerator for IT Startups</a>) und auch zum Cyberforum in Karlsruhe (<a href="https://www.cyberforum.de/">CyberForum: Hightech.Unternehmer.Netzwerk.</a>) pflegen wir guten Kontakt.</p><p>Zur Bedeutung von Standort passt deshalb unser Credo: Virtuell agieren, hybrid Wirkung entfalten. Denn es wird immer stärker zu einer Verschmelzung von Online und Offline-Welt kommen.</p><p>Wir waren uns in der Runde einig, dass die Förderlandschaft für Wissenschaft und für die Entwicklung neuer Technologien gut aufgestellt ist. Nun bin ich eine Visionärin, die Technologie “nur” dazu nutzt, komplexe Probleme mit gesellschaftlicher Relevanz zu lösen. Technologie an sich birgt immer Chance wie auch Risiko – es ist an uns, Sinn und Nutzen ihres Einsatzes zu modellieren. Ich weiß wovon ich spreche, denn in den letzten 20 Jahren habe ich digitale Innovationen in der Gesundheitsbranche vorangetrieben. Hier kommt es entscheidend darauf an, welches Geschäftsmodell dahinter liegt. Idealerweise führt technische Innovation auch zu sozialer Innovation. Denn wohin wollen wir uns durch Digitalisierung transformieren? (Förder-)Politik hätte es in meinen Augen in der Hand, hier Gestalter klarer Ziele beim Einsatz von Technologie zu sein. Das ist für mich nachhaltige Technologie! Green-IT, ja auch. Stichwort: Daten nutzen ja – mit welcher Absicht? Zu wessen Vorteil? Ethik in künstlicher Intelligenz – Erkenntnisinteresse? Wer steuert wen? Deep Learning: Wer lernt eigentlich aus diesen Daten? Was wollen wir als Einzelner, als Unternehmen, als Gesellschaft, als Menschheit lernen?</p><p>Mir lag es deshalb am Herzen, folgenden Wunsch an Winfried Kretschmann zu richten: Es wäre großartig, wenn das Land stärker Startups fördert, deren digitale Geschäftsmodelle den gesellschaftlichen Fortschritt unterstützen. Die einen Beitrag dazu leisten, die digitale Kluft bei Bildung oder in der Gesundheitsversorgung zu verringern, die durch künstliche Intelligenz diskriminierungsfreier entscheiden als ein Mensch, die freie Datenflüsse und dezentrale Strukturen und damit eine Art Gewaltenteilung ermöglichen und die offen und nutzenstiftend sind für viele, weil sie Standards anwenden. Am Ende ist für unsere Demokratie und Freiheit entscheidend, dass Vielfalt am Markt erhalten bleibt. Dass sich coole Innovationen auch behaupten können. Ich gebe zu, dafür braucht es ausgeklügeltere Geschäftsmodelle. Aber das geht – und genau auf die wird es ankommen.</p><p>Immer wieder sprachen wir nämlich über Risiken von Startups und über mutige Entscheidungen. Ich meine: Wenn niemand mehr ins Risiko geht und den Mut zeigt, neue Lösungsräume zu erschließen, dann wird Innovation auf der Strecke bleiben.</p><p>Gerade das Land könnte sich hier protegierend und stärkend hinter die Modelle von frühen Startups stellen. Vielleicht sogar Spielregeln einbringen oder ausprobieren, damit Technologie für Menschen und die Gesellschaft positive Wirkung entfalten kann.</p><p>Winfried Kretschmann hat meinen Wunsch aufgegriffen und es selber zu Ende der Veranstaltung so formuliert: “Wir müssen es schaffen, dass wir vom verhindernden zum gestaltenden Datenschutz kommen. Wie macht man es so, dass man die Daten nutzen kann, ohne dass sie am Schluss missbraucht werden? Heute nutzen wir das Potenzial von Technologien nicht aus. Vielen Dank für den Wunsch, beides hinzubekommen, es zu nutzen und trotzdem aus niemandem einen gläsernen Menschen oder gläsernen Betrieb zu machen.”</p><p>Ich bin darüber sehr glücklich und danke Ihnen, lieber Herr Kretschmann, für diese Worte und den guten Austausch heute. Ich sage nur, Baden-Württemberg, Heimat von zahlreichen Hidden Champions.</p><p>#startups #dataeconomy #operator</p>

 Tokens Recovery 
<p>Through the T-REX protocol, control and compliance are added to the blockchain and in this case, if the tokens are lost, they can be easily recovered.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in October 2020.</p>   
	 
		 
			 Why Is Tokens Recovery Important? 
<p>According to a recent study (Chainanalysis), around 4 million bitcoins, approximately 20% of those in circulation today, have been lost since the invention of the crypto-currency. If a holder of Bitcoin loses their private keys and wallet-access credentials, the tokens are lost and cannot be recovered because bitcoin tokens are controlled by an algorithm, not by any identified and responsible party.</p>
<p>This highlights the stark difference between crypto-tokens and security tokens issued with the T-REX suite of smart contracts. Through the T-REX protocol, control and compliance are added to the blockchain and in this case, if the tokens are lost, they can be easily recovered.</p>
 How is this possible? 
<p>Through their digital investment passports ONCHAINID, investors can prove their identity to the issuer or their agent. After the identity is confirmed the Recovery function of the token smart contract is triggered under the full control of the Issuer and the lost tokens are transferred to the new wallet of the investor.</p>
 What does this mean? 
 
 Investors can self-custody their tokens without risk 
 Investors Recover lost tokens in minutes 
 Issuers can be sure the&nbsp; token’s compliance rules will continue to be enforced

   Why Tying the Knot Between IoT and Users Is a Three-Layer Wedding Cake 

 Is your Internet of Things (IoT) project stuck in device registration mode with seemingly no way to get out? Or have you been able to “break out” to realize greater business value by “marrying” your IoT to your human user profiles?

   Why Tying the Knot Between IoT and Users Is a Three-Layer Wedding Cake 

<p>Is your Internet of Things (IoT) project stuck in device registration mode with seemingly no way to get out? Or have you been able to “break out” to realize greater business value by “marrying” your IoT to your human user profiles?</p>

<p>Let me explain what I mean. When it comes to IoT strategies, too many organizations that I talk to are concerned about only finding, registering, securing, and then managing the lifecycle of their IoT devices (examples: door sensors, IP cameras, RFID equipment). This is a laudable goal to be sure. But they consider this a fait accompli. Game over. Next project.</p>

<p>But is this really the end state we should aspire to with our IoT projects? To merely discover and manage our devices? Or is there a higher business value for the&nbsp; organization?&nbsp;</p>

 A Three-Layer Wedding Cake&nbsp; 

<p>As you might suspect, I consider this&nbsp; to be an intermediate step towards a higher strategic goal. And that higher goal is joining and managing your devices together with the users who need to use them in order to have a “single pane” of intelligence and visibility that adds business context to every action that involves these devices and users. This will shatter your traditional IoT silos and lead to greater automation, intelligence gathering, and trust.</p>

<p>But I digress. Our new happy couple –<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot"> IoT</a> and our human user – are about to cut the cake! Here are the benefits they can expect from this compatible marriage.</p>

 First Layer: Automating Business Processes&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>The projections of IoT devices being added to our networks every day is simply staggering. According to <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45213219">IDC data</a>, there will be 41.6 billion connected IoT devices by 2025*.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s a mind boggling number that leads most IT professionals&nbsp; to immediately think about automation. How do you automate a tsunami of increasingly heterogeneous devices flooding your organization and give users timely access to the devices they need?</p>

<p>For starters, when you plan out your IoT strategy and you know which users need access to which IoT devices, you are in a perfect position to automate that access using some combination of rules-based and artificial intelligence (AI) methodology. The important thing is to start your IoT project with this holistic view to the future.</p>

<p>But there is more. Many IoT experts, including those at ForgeRock, envision a future where the combination of a user, a device, and an entity can actually unlock greater economic value for everyone in the chain, delivering a level of personalization and customization we’ve never seen before.</p>

<p>Here’s one common example. The scenarios most often discussed involve a patient (human) with a healthcare device (IoT) that informs a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/healthcare">healthcare</a> provider (entity) proactively about changes in the user’s condition. The measurable business value unlocked here: exceptional patient care and lower healthcare costs through early detection and treatment.</p>

<p>Another scenario is the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot/connected-car">connected car</a>. If you buy a car, you want to take care of it. Car manufacturers are banking on IoT to do that by alerting you to issues and where you can go to get them resolved. But they are going further, adding upgrade offers, facilitating bi-directional communications, safety notifications, and more. The measurable business value unlocked here is that loyal car buyers will stay with the same manufacturer for their next automobile purchase.</p>

<p>With all privacy and consent regulations being adhered to, an intelligent IoT system can provide a wealth of value-added services to the user.</p>

 Second Layer: Intelligence Gathering&nbsp; 

<p>What can your IoT devices tell you that would enable you to power your business forward? Quite a lot, in fact!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Devices vary, but even “dumb” IoT devices give you online/offline status. More intelligent ones provide data streams that are used to drive action, automate processes, and allow businesses to offer value added services. (See “First Layer: Automating Business Processes.”) These services are relevant for intelligence because the near real-time or real-time data they provide can be gathered to stop an attack, assess the risk of particular users, or even change the risk profile of a set of users requiring, for example, a greater level of authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But aggregating this data around your<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform"> identity platform</a> – as opposed to your security information and event management (SIEM) solution or security operations center (SOC) – is key. This is because the relationship data offered through a complete identity management view allows a complete 360-degree view of who these users are and how they are using IoT devices. Your organization can utilize additional insights to make business decisions for security, asset utilization, workforce staffing and more.</p>

 Third Layer: Trust in Your Devices&nbsp; 

<p>Trust is everything when it comes to IoT. A single breach of a single device in your organization can lead to catastrophic results.</p>

<p>On the other hand, having a reasonable assurance of&nbsp; security can lead to improved functioning in an organization. IoT devices can be managed as groups in the exact same way digital identities for human users are managed. This gives the IT department a single console to manage all digital identities in a consistent way. Identities for things are unique to each device and are anchored in a root certificate or any other identifier that allows the unique identification of devices. You know what users can have access to what devices and under what circumstances. Relationships among users, users and devices, and between devices are managed from a central console, making lifecycle management easy and robust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, we can allow user access by role. If you’re a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) technician, you can have access to certain restricted classes of devices (HVAC controllers, for example). Devices are treated as first-class digital identities and are allowed to act autonomously on their own behalf with fine-grained authorization sharing data only with authorized destinations or applications. We can enforce certain types of authentication and change it in an instant when the overall threat level rises (and make sure our users have pre-enrolled in methods to support step-up authentication). We can restrict access by time of day or day of week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Customized and relevant offerings make the difference between a world-class service and failure. Being able to scale such a process and potentially serve millions of users individually requires automated, data-driven decisions made in near real time. Device data is a key ingredient, but this data must be trustworthy and genuine. This drives the need for IoT to join together with human roles and profiles. To trust a device-user interaction, you must first identify the two to proceed with confidence.</p>

 You’re Cordially Invited 

<p>At ForgeRock, we’re already helping customers move beyond the first IoT level and prepare themselves for the connected IoT future. Our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/edge-security/identity-edge-controller">IoT Gateway and IoT software development kit (SDK) offerings</a> are helping customers gain control, secure devices, and pave the way to monetize, automate and streamline their businesses. Check us out at <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">https://www.forgerock.com/iot</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s wish our happy couple a long marriage. I’m looking forward to a toast, but I also know that a wedding is just the beginning – hopefully, the start of a very long, successful, and prosperous relationship! Hard work and partnering lie ahead. I wish you well on this journey!</p>

<p>At Spruce, we’re building a product suite to manage all aspects of the data supply chain. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> Tezos DID&nbsp;Method <p>The <a href="https://did-tezos-draft.spruceid.com/">Tezos DID Method</a> specifies how Tezos can be used for DID creation and management, compatible with the issuance, storage, and verification of Verifiable Credentials.</p>  We are actively implementing <a href="https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/tzip-19-draft/proposals/tzip-19/tzip-19.md">TZIP-19</a>, which is the smart contract interface necessary to implement the Tezos DID&nbsp;Manager.  Derivation from did:tz (tier 1/did-key resolution) has been fully implemented.  On-chain (tier 2) is in progress, the smart contract has been written, and now we are working on the integration between the resolver and the Tezos blockchain.  We are still continuing to iterate on the DID Method Specification and TZIP-19 based on multiple rounds of feedback.   DIDKit <p><a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/introducing-didkit-an-identity-toolkit-e0dfa292f53d">DIDKit </a>is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>  The HTTP server has been implemented, and it passes the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/tree/master/packages/plugfest-2020">VC HTTP API test&nbsp;suite</a>.  The CLI and HTTP server have been dockerized.  We now have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface">JNI</a> implemented.  We’ve expanded our documentation in order to provide a better developer experience.  We fixed a number of bugs discovered during our interoperability testing.   Credible <p><a href="https://medium.com/@sprucesystems/spruce-developer-update-2-484368f87ee9">Credible</a> is Spruce’s native credential wallet for the consumption, storage, and presentation of Verifiable Credentials on Android and&nbsp;iOS.</p>  We demonstrated a complete workflow integrated with one of our initial use-cases with <a href="https://hieofone.com/">HIE of One</a>, dealing with patient-directed health&nbsp;records.  The workflow noted includes a user being able to respond to a credential offer, save that credential to secure storage, and respond to a verifiable presentation request.  We continued to enhance our documentation efforts to further support the developer experience using the&nbsp;wallet.   Keylink <p>Keylink is Spruce’s tool to link existing enterprise accounts to keypairs.</p>  We’ve completed the integration of verifiable credential issuance for files using libssi (our native library), <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key</a>, and <a href="https://iscc.foundation/iscc/">ISCC&nbsp;ID</a>.   Intake <p>Intake is a smarter onboarding tool for businesses via secure document collection and processing.

<p>I didn’t get the appeal of podcasts before I started listening to them, but now I’m hooked. There are so many podcasts out there – comedy podcasts, activity podcasts, political podcasts etc. – that there’s something to listen to for any situation. Of course, that’s a little overwhelming if you don’t know where to start, so it’s always helpful to get recommendations (see below!).</p>
<p>But why the hype? The main appeal for me is that I can listen anywhere on-demand – standing on a train, cooking, running – where reading wouldn’t be practical. Sure, music is good for that stuff too, but podcasts are way more absorbing and I feel like I’m multitasking by learning cool stuff while doing what I need to do. </p>
<p>I think podcasts work especially well for business topics, like identity, because there’s so much content out there to read – trust me, I’m an identity content writer. So sometimes you just reach a limit as to what you can take in that way, and switching to this format stops my eyes going blurry 😵.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity 
<p>In around May 2019, we decided to launch our very own podcast, Let’s Talk About Digital Identity (LTADI). The idea was for our brilliant host, Oscar Santolalla, to interview an identity management leader in every episode, providing a platform for others to learn from their deep knowledge of the industry. 18 months on, I’m so happy to have published 33 episodes with amazing guests, with lots more exciting episodes on the way. Huge thank you to all participants!!!</p>
<p>Our guests hail from fourteen countries, from where Ubisecure has its roots in Finland, to Kenya, to New Zealand. They cover all kinds of identity topics – national and international identity schemes, public and private sector identity solutions, the future of digital identity, and lots more. I hope that we can continue to expand the diversity of our guests and their areas of expertise to provide a platform for global, thought (and action) provoking views of our industry. We love learning from every guest that joins the show, and know that our listeners love it too.</p>

  <p>In the words of Charles Darwin, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but rather the one most adaptable to change.”</p>
<p>A fundamental change is coming in the way businesses compose and consume software. This future relies on applications that can be assembled, reassembled and easily extended, in what’s known as the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable/">composable business</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest challenge application leaders face as they move to the composable business will be changing their organization’s culture</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Applications are the core of composable business, yet the application organization as it currently stands isn’t well-positioned to deliver on this promise. The application team is often centrally located and hierarchically structured, making it too slow and disconnected from the business it supports,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/7328">Matthew Hotle</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>This disconnect presents an opportunity for application leaders to help transform their organization for the future of composable business. Here’s how application leaders can build an adaptive approach to governance, funding, culture and organization design.</p>
 Go where the applications are 
<p>Many companies discourage any diffusion of application delivery, fearing a lack of governance or loss of control. However, such diffusion helps the organization redefine the boundaries of their control-oriented structure and move toward a composable business.</p>
<p>Actively work with the CIO and line-of-business leaders to encourage application development and delivery to be done where it’s the most optimal.</p>
 Deliver software via multidisciplinary teams 
<p>In enterprises that have begun the transition to composable business, software delivery is often done by “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-become-an-agile-superhero/">agile</a>” or “fusion” teams. These teams are staffed by individuals with both technology and business skill sets, and they benefit from having members with diverse personal and professional backgrounds.</p>
<p>Gartner research has found that such teams deliver business outcomes 20% faster than their peers. This multidisciplinary approach promotes a flexible and adaptable organizational structure.</p>
 Flatten the organizational structure 
<p>The shift to composable business presents an opportunity to reduce several layers of management, as teams are empowered to be more autonomous. Leading enterprises that have already begun this shift have teams organized around flexible and fluid management structures, not just formal reporting relationships.</p>
<p>However, many enterprises aren’t ready to fully overhaul established hierarchical structures. They are not comfortable with self-management, and still look for a single person to be held accountable for the team’s activities.</p>
<p>Application leaders in these organizations must begin to enable more autonomy on their teams. Build trust with senior leaders by piloting teams of individuals with both the right skill sets and the right culture to be autonomous.</p>
 Establish an adaptive governance framework 
<p>The distributed application function should be treated as an ecosystem. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/it-governance">Governance</a> provides connective tissue for the ecosystem by defining who has the right to make decisions, such as who is responsible for specific applications or who has the right to build, buy or compose a new application.</p>
<p>This ensures that individual contributors do not optimize their own work to the detriment of the entire ecosystem. The application organization of the future must democratize these decisions via an adaptive governance framework. This framework ensures that decisions are made where it’s most appropriate for them to be made.</p>
 Align funding to applications and products 
<p>In the composable business, each application function owns its own budget and dictates the order in which it delivers its roadmaps. The function also owns how it reports business outcomes and business values.</p>
<p>To achieve this, enterprises must change their funding processes from centrally held “governance boards” to distributing funds to product lines and product managers. These product managers can then make decisions as to how they will spend those funds and achieve intended business outcomes.</p>
<p>Democratization of the governance and funding process is crucial in enabling the application ecosystem to be adaptive, flexible and focused on delivering business value faster.</p>
 Understand and adapt culture 
<p>The biggest challenge application leaders face as they move to the composable business will be changing their <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/accelerate-digital-transformation-by-hacking-your-io-culture/">organization’s culture</a>. In conjunction with the CIO and other leaders, the application leader must first identify what the current culture is, create a vision for what it should be in the future and lead by example to form the new culture.</p>
<p>The high-powered teams that are essential to composable business require two key cultural principles:</p>
 
 Trust. Most leadership models are focused on the premise that the “higher” you are in an organization, the more trustworthy your decisions are. To truly democratize decision-making processes, this can’t be the case. Leaders must trust their employees, and employees must trust their leaders. 
 Accountability.&nbsp;To be trusted, people must be accountable. They need to believe in doing the right thing for their business. Accountability here doesn’t flow top down (“I want to hold you accountable”), but through the organization (“I am accountable to you”). 
 
<p>Using this framework, application leaders can work with senior business leadership to ensure that the application function is focused on providing the best experience that drives business results. Then, they must create an environment that empowers employees to form high-performing teams that are capable of delivering those business results.</p>

  <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to drive organizations to look for ways to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-ways-to-quickly-reduce-it-costs/">reduce spending</a>, projects that focus on cost optimization and operational efficiency will be less affected than those that focus on transformative impacts. IoT is generally an early-stage project that is counted as discretionary spending or represents an area of large capex, so it is particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Through 2020, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-cios-can-achieve-digital-business-transformation-in-healthcare/">healthcare IoT</a> will be the only sector that sees double-digit growth in IoT investments. Short-term investments by healthcare providers will focus on combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The expansion of crisis hospital capacity and equipment in temporary facilities, increased demand for ventilators and investment in <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/analysts-answer-how-will-coronavirus-impact-technology-investment-across-verticals/">telemedicine </a>to reduce the spread of infection are causing a temporary increase in IoT device sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz00ZWRmNzQ0YjMyZTQxMWViOGFhZGExYjUyMWU1ZWJlNQ=="></a></p>
<p>Telemedicine initiatives are likely to continue post-pandemic, and healthcare provider CIOs will need to develop <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-need-for-ai-governance-in-healthcare/">long-term plans</a> to identify which virtual care solutions improve patient experience, optimize costs and better manage the health of populations overall.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-succeed-in-healthcare-digital-transformation/">How Healthcare Providers Can Succeed in Digital Transformation</a></p>
<p>The most imminent need for healthcare is to expand capacity by adding more ventilators and patient monitors, many of which are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lessons-from-iot-early-adopters/">IoT-enabled</a> by default. To reduce the burden on healthcare centers, providers are investing in remote patient-monitoring solutions by adding the management, tracking and alerting of medical devices, such as those that monitor blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate. These solutions will allow patients to be monitored in their home environments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other verticals that have high IoT demand, such as automotive or manufacturing, will be hit harder by the crisis and will postpone some of their IoT transformation initiatives and production volumes due to revenue constraints.</p>
<p>This will impact not only product leaders’ immediate initiatives, but also their strategies for the next three to five years. But during the recovery, companies will invest in automation to protect themselves against future shocks.</p>

 Polkadot Decoded Recap — Li Jun’s&nbsp;Keynote  A quick recap of our Founder’s keynote speech on DeID, DeFi, and&nbsp;OScore <p>With Covid-19 keeping more and more of us indoors, we are turning to digital means as a method to keep us closer and to host tech conferences as we would’ve back in the days when the gathering was permitted. Nonetheless, the Polkadot Decoded event was a smashing success, regardless of it being held virtually. For this year’s event, our Founder Li Jun was cordially invited to give a keynote speech on Ontology’s current developments, specifically centered around DeID, DeFi &amp; OScore. Here’s a&nbsp;recap:</p><p>Li Jun opened, by stating how Ontology’s decentralized identity protocol &amp; decentralized data protocol will help build new trust collaboration between Ontology and the Polkadot Network before diving into ONT ID. Our decentralized identity protocol works for other blockchains such as Ethereum as well. This cross-chain feature allows users to control their accounts, wallet &amp; digital assets address — as well as traditional information like bank accounts and social&nbsp;media.</p><p>According to Li Jun, since you already manage your own identity, it is easier to perform data collaboration based on DDXF— so that no single platform controls your data. All personal data, value, and privacy will be controlled by yourself.</p><p>This includes our OScore, the first on-chain credit score based on Ontology’s data protocols. It accumulates different on-chain data points and information based on different blockchains, including Polkadot in the near future. The integration with different chains for both OScore and decentralized identity is the next phase, as we will build on our current collection of partners including Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, TRON, and Polkadot.</p><p>Succeeding the outline of cross-chain integration, Li Jun introduced a real use case for how DeID could work with Daimler Mobility’s “Welcome Home”&nbsp;feature.</p><p>When users use the car, they have control over any kind of data during usage. This data can then be used to buy insurance at a discount, for example, while being completely controlled by the user. It is important to note that no centralized party controls the data. While Daimler is in the auto sector, Li Jun highlighted that this can be used for other industries as well. In addition, other sets of data can be digitalized and rebuilt in a decentralized form as well, allowing every user to manage and own their&nbsp;data.</p><p>A short break was granted while a feature video of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPfxQfNlGY4">Drive With Ontology</a>” played&nbsp;next.</p><p>Credit Components &amp;&nbsp;DeFi</p><p>After the video, Li Jun shifted his attention to how staking is currently done in decentralized finance, which is based on how much you stake, rather than your reputation or your credit. This is not like traditional finance. In addition, a key point of highlight from Li Jun is that credit can accelerate the asset digitalization in blockchain — such as equity, real estate, and other physical goods. But by doing so, how can we confirm these assets are real, in addition to their ownership? Well, this would be something that decentralized identity would be able to solve with its flexible protocol to link to many different rules, laws, and offline requirements in order to verify the digitization of&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The final part of the keynote posed the question of how to create a link between traditional finance and DeFi. In reality, everything that we do online in the DeFi space can be also done with offline, traditional financial systems. According to Li Jun, Financial institutions shouldn’t have control over building your data, your credit, or any other part of your identity — rather, they should merely only have access to it when you grant it. The identity should be built by yourself, in a decentralized format.</p><p>To round off the keynote, Li Jun introduced the <a href="https://wing.finance">Wing Platform</a> — a decentralized lending platform that is built based on the vision we’ve highlighted above. With a combination of decentralized identity and credit lending, Wing has an opportunity to be an industry leader in the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/polkadot-decoded-recap-li-juns-keynote-4fba0dc6aaa7">Polkadot Decoded Recap — Li Jun’s Keynote</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In recent years, Cybercrime accelerated drastically and has become a business on its own. The amount of financial damage cyber fraud could cause is considered to be trillions of dollars in 2021.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Due to COVID-19, user behavior has changed, and digitization has taken a tremendous speed – unfortunately, so has cyber fraud. One problem with doing business over the internet is not being able to identify the users and their intention. To deal with this problem, measures have been taken against fraud actions in most countries with strict KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. Just earlier this year, the European Union’s fifth Anti-Money-Laundering Directive has come into force this year to fight against money laundering and bring more transparency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, identity fraud attempts have shown a massive increase since the first lockdown earlier this year. In the new IDnow Security Report, you will find a detailed information of the most common types of identity fraud, which countries are the main targets of fraud attacks, and how companies can mitigate cyber fraud.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Ivanti has completed its acquisition of MobileIron and Pulse Secure. Ivanti, headquartered in Salt Lake City, had its roots in desktop management (LANDESK), evolved into endpoint and patch management, and had added full IT asset, service, and workspace management, as well as IAM capabilities.</p>
<p>Though headquartered in North America, Ivanti had already become a global IT solutions provider. Pulse Secure, a strong secure access vendor, was spun-out from Juniper Networks in 2014. MobileIron was dedicated to mobile device management, mobile security, and authentication since it was established in 2009. Both Pulse Secure and MobileIron are global companies, with strong partner networks in both NA and the EU. Both had sizable shares of their market segments, including many enterprise customers.</p>
<p></p>
 Deal merges Zero Trust capabilities 
<p>This pair of acquisitions will result in a merger of capabilities that are central to the Zero Trust paradigm that prevails in IAM and cybersecurity today. Zero Trust, at its base, is granular authentication and contextual authorization for every request in an environment, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid, with runtime evaluation of user/device/app/data attributes against access control policies. It is the embodiment of the principle of least privilege.</p>
<p>These acquisitions bring together UEM and device security, VPN and ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access), and strong MFA. Each of these functions is essential for moving to a true ZTNA. Moreover, with the increased need for long term remote working and partnerships, consolidating secure mobile authentication and access control with VPN and comprehensive UEM will be a benefit to current customers. It will present an appealing alternative to additional enterprise and SMB prospects that are looking to improve security posture and user experiences.</p>
<p></p>
 No single product achieves 100% Zero Trust 
<p>While no single product or suite can make an organization fully “Zero Trust”, the move by Ivanti to pick up MobileIron and Pulse Secure should make it easier for this combination to satisfy larger subsets of business and security requirements related to Zero Trust.</p>
<p>Each company’s products have strengths that complement the others. There are some overlaps in their product offerings, and as usual in such situations, there will likely be some de-duplication of functions in their solution roadmaps. KuppingerCole has reported on these vendors previously and will follow upcoming developments in this space.</p>

Last month, the circulation of USDT, USDC, DAI, and TUSD increased by 2.414 billion, 33 million, 124 million, and 52 million. The circulation of the remaining stablecoins decreased slightly.  The circulation of DAI exceeded $1 billion, the circulation of USDC exceeded $3&nbsp;billion.  The stablecoin continues to outside the cryptocurrency market, and Circle used USDC to assist Venezuelan medical&nbsp;staff.  Libra may be available as soon as January&nbsp;2021.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past month(November 1, 2020, ~ November 30, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $2.540 billion to $25.25&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Among them, the main growth comes from Tether. Tether has additionally issued a total of 2.413 billion, specifically 1.313 billion on Ethereum and 1.100 billion on TRON. The circulation of USDC increased by $33 million, breaking through $3 billion on November 30. The circulation of TUSD increased by $52 million, and the circulation of DAI increased by $124 million, breaking through $1 billion, the circulation of PAX, BUSD, HUSD, and GUSD decreased by $26 million, $18 million, $36 million, and $1.41&nbsp;million.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Last month, the average daily active addresses of major stablecoins increased by&nbsp;3.73%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous month, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of 0.98%. Among them, the growth rate of USDC is remarkable, from an average of 33,400 daily transactions to 48,300, an increase of&nbsp;44.7%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins increased by $604 million, an increase of 13.97%. Harvest Finance was attacked and stolen $34 million, causing large fluctuations in on-chain transactions(the crest in the figure). Excluding the impact of data on the day, the increase can be revised to&nbsp;37.97%.</p> 2. Stablecoins are&nbsp;Booming <p>The entire stablecoin ecosystem is prospering and developing. The amount of funds has steadily increased, and DAI, the decentralized stablecoin has reached the milestone of $1 billion. Financial services are getting better and USDC, the compliant stablecoin plans to provide a deposit plan with the highest annualized return of 10.75%, benchmark products are about to come out, and Libra may be available as soon as January&nbsp;2021.</p> The supply of DAI exceeds 1&nbsp;billion <p>On November 13, 2020, the supply of DAI exceeded $1 billion, and only 71 days have passed since it exceeded $500 million. On the one hand, the rapid growth of data comes from the demand side, the demand for DAI continues to grow due to liquidity mining and rising market trends; on the other hand, it also comes from the supply side, the debt ceiling of ETH-A has been raised to $490 million. The USDC-A debt ceiling has also reached $485 million, and the utilization rate has exceeded 80%. USDC locked in the Maker Protocol has accounted for 13% of the total supply of USDC. In contrast, the contribution of newly-added collateral to the generation of DAI is limited. Since October, the total contribution of newly-added collateral assets COMP, LRC, LINK, BAL, YFI, GUSD to DAI is $26.30 million, accounting for 2.5% of the total, except for YFI, only 0.5%(Data source: <a href="https://daistats.com/">https://daistats.com</a>).</p> Circle announced a high-yield savings plan, up to&nbsp;10.75% <p>On November 5, 2020, Circle officially <a href="https://twitter.com/circlepay/status/1324413482662592512">announced</a> that it would provide USDC current and regular savings plans. According to <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/features/yield">the official website</a>, the current interest rate was 8.5%, and there were four types of regular plans: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The interest rate ranged from 9.5% to 10.75%. Circle would cooperate with Genesis Global Capital on the savings product, and the income would come from lending US dollars to institutional counterparties willing to pay interest.<br>At present, the savings product has not been officially launched. Users can fill in the information to apply for joining the waiting&nbsp;list.</p> ‘Financial Times’ said Libra may be available as soon as January&nbsp;2021 <p>On November 27, 2020, the British ‘Financial Times’ published an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cfe4ca11-139a-4d4e-8a65-b3be3a0166be">article</a> stating that Libra, a stablecoin project led by Facebook, may be available as soon as January 2021. According to relevant sources, only one stablecoin fully secured by US dollars will be launched initially, but other currencies and combination stablecoins will be launched later.<br>Three informants said that the specific launch date of Libra would depend on when the project is approved by the FINMA to provide payment services, but it may be January next year at the earliest. The FINMA said it would not comment on the application of&nbsp;Libra.</p> 3. Stablecoins accelerate the pace of outside the cryptocurrency market <p>The acceleration of stablecoins outside the cryptocurrency market has not only attracted the attention of more countries or international regulatory agencies but also gradually expanded application scenarios. In November, Circle announced the use of USDC to assist medical staff in Venezuela, showing that the application of stablecoins is not only limited to the world of cryptography. After the European Commission, the G20 joint FSB, and the International Monetary Fund successively released their regulatory reports on stablecoin in October, the UK Treasury Department stated that it would develop a regulatory framework for stablecoin, and the BIS also issued a supervision report of stablecoin.</p> Circle used USDC to assist Venezuelan medical&nbsp;staff <p>In November, the supply of USDC has reached $3 billion, and its application scope is gradually integrated with the real world. According to <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-partners-with-bolivarian-republic-of-venezuela-and-airtm-to-deliver-aid-to-venezuelans-using-usdc">Circle’s official website</a>, Circle has cooperated with local governments and <a href="https://www.chainnews.com/projects/airtm.htm">AirTM</a>, the financial platform to allocate funds to COVID-19 health care workers in South American countries, and this process is completed through USDC.<br>According to the <a href="https://www.chainnews.com/news/985851000440.htm">ChainNews</a>, the specific process can be simplified as follows: the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve released funds to Guaidó’s government account in a U.S. bank, the Guaidó government used these funds to mint USDC, and send them to Airtm, the Dollar-denominated blockchain payment platform, then distributed in the form of AirUSD to the accounts of Venezuelan medical staffs, who can withdraw to local bank accounts.</p> The UK Treasury Department will develop the stablecoin regulatory framework <p>In a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-sets-out-ambition-for-future-of-uk-financial-services">statement</a> issued by the UK Treasury Department on November 9, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sunak stated that after the UK leaves the European Union, the government’s attitude to financial services would be guided by the most productive and innovative industries. Financial Services in the UK should ‘leading the global dialogue on new technologies such as stablecoins and CBDC’, which will consolidate the leading position of the UK in the field of financial technology.<br>The statement mentioned that new technologies such as stablecoins might change the way people store and trade currencies, making payments cheaper and more convenient. To realize the potential value of stablecoins and manage the risks of consumers and financial stability, the government will propose regulatory measures for related stablecoin programs to ensure that they meet the minimum requirements for payment&nbsp;methods.</p> The BIS released a stablecoin report detailing risks, opportunities, and supervision <p>The BIS released <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work905.htm">a stablecoin report</a> on November 24-’Stablecoins: Risks, Opportunities, and Supervision’, detailing the potential role of stablecoins and their implications for regulation. The report outlined the market development of existing stablecoins and described their potential to embed powerful currency tools in the digital environment, and argued that stablecoins were designed to challenge existing e-commerce digital payment methods, including traditional bank payments, credit cards, and electronic wallets, etc. At the same time, stablecoins, especially the Libra project led by Facebook, also pose a challenge to the global financial system. The report analyzed and discussed the Libra project and related regulatory solutions, believed that the regulation of stablecoins should be based on the many conveniences it might provide, rather than being limited to the existing regulatory framework, and that the implementation of ‘embedded regulation’ could be considered, that is, directly embedding regulatory requirements into the implementation of a ‘global stablecoin’ system.</p> Tips <p>This is what we’re sharing in this MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report, welcome to stay tuned for follow-up crypto stablecoin reports.

Sounds familiar? It is at this stage where most organisations give up on the AI initiatives due to lack of value creation. Why is that, one might ask? The business case was already locked, among other aspects, where's the problem at? One word: Production. AI products and services are notoriously different in terms of production than any other SW, and traditional workflows do not work anymore. This is what we are going to talk about. I will share my vision, blue print and personal stories across telecom, manufacturing and automotive industries, including both corporate and start-up experiences. I will tell you how to go from a shiny proof-of-concept to AI production systems, what challenges we faced, and the best practices to avoid the pitfalls.<br>Key takeaways: 1) Vision and strategy to create value out of AI - The last mile<br>2) How to go from a shiny proof-of-concept to AI production systems<br>3) AI production challenges and pitfalls<br>4) Multi-industry use cases across corporate and start-up ecosystems</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybernetixworld2020_2020_11_25_rafique"></a>

Using machine learning approaches to mine and reason through masses of data is ineffective. In this session you will learn that while the first wave of AI involved many narrow applications, the next wave will help generate a dynamic understanding of relationships and patterns in a corpus of information.

   Cybernetix Is What Makes Things Move, From Production to Modern 5G Based Public Infrastructures 
<p></p>
<p>Cybernetix is not a new discipline. However, it appears being more important than ever before. It is ubiquitous when it comes to AI (Artificial Intelligence). And when AI meets industrial IoT (Internet of Things) and OT (Operational Technology) , it is about the cybernetic model. In contrast to past times, it is about hundreds of signals per second per thing, device, and machine, which needs to be processed and used for optimization. No way doing so without AI.</p>
<p>When looking at public infrastructures such as the ones making connected vehicles drive without (too many, too severe) accidents, when it comes to smart services (cities, utilities,…), it all is about immense amounts of signals that need to be delivered (5G) and stored (blockchains and beyond, e.g. IOTA), and processed (AI again).</p>

					 <p>In <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI), the securest way to share, issue, and verify credentials between two parties is to create a ‘connection‘ between them. When you create a connection, you create a secure, peer-to-peer communication channel between you and the other party. Through that communication channel, you can exchange credentials and messages to another party without the fear of man-in-the-middle or other attacks. To learn more about how connections in SSI work, check out our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/make-connections">documentation</a> on the subject.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this blog post, we will explain how to create connections in Trinsic Studio. Throughout the steps below, we will be referring to a fictitious person, Alice Smith, who is a recent graduate of Faber College and is applying for a job. Alice has <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">already received her digital diploma</a> in the form of a verifiable credential and is wanting to apply to work for a company called ACME Corp. In order to start the online job application, Alice must first make a connection with ACME Corp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow the steps below to learn how to create connections in Trinsic Studio!</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Sign up for a free Trinsic Studio account 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>To do so, go to <a href="https://trinsic.studio/">https://trinsic.studio/</a> and follow the instructions on the screen.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create an Organization 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Before Alice can create a connection with ACME Corp., ACME Corp. must exist as an Organization in Trinsic Studio. So let’s do that real quick!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Click on the “+Organization” button on the dashboard screen.  Create an Organization called ACME Corp. Feel free to upload a logo if you would like. For the Preferred Network drop-down, make sure you are on Sovrin Staging for this walkthrough. Click “Continue to Review”.  After making sure all the information is correct, click “Confirm”.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now that ACME Corp. is an Organization in Trinsic Studio, Alice can make a connection with it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create a connection 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>But in order for Alice to create a connection, ACME Corp. must first send Alice a connection invitation. Connection invitations are most commonly sent through QR codes or deep links. For our story, ACME Corp. might embed the QR code in Alice’s online job application or send her an email containing the code. Below are the steps that ACME Corp. would follow to create the connection invitation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  As ACME Corp. in Trinsic Studio, go to the “Connections” tab and click the “+ Invite Connection” button.  You should see a QR code appear in the panel. You can scan the QR code, send it via email to someone, or copy the URL.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Now, as Alice:<br><br></p>  Download the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streetcred-identity-agent/id1475160728">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.streetcred.apps.mobile">Android</a>. Use the Trinsic Wallet to scan the QR code.  When the connection invitation shows up in the wallet, tap&nbsp;Accept. And the connection will be added to your wallet.  <p>Alice has now created a connection with ACME Corp. which she and ACME Corp. can use to securely share, issue, and verify credentials between each other as Alice fills out the job application.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					In the Trinsic Wallet, click the "Scan Code" button to scan a QR code.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					Once a connection invitation has been received, the user has the option to accept or reject the connection invitation.
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							
																					Once the user accepts the connection invitation, the connection will appear under the "Connections" tab in the Trinsic Wallet.

					 <p>Although not covered in this post, Trinsic also enables you to create what are called <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/make-connections#multi-party-connection-invitations">multi-party connection invitations</a>—invitations that multiple users can accept to connect with the organization.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also important to note that a connection is not required for credential exchange to occur.

<p>Ascertia, the company behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.signinghub.com/">SigningHub</a>&nbsp;(the e-document signing and management service) announced that the October 2020 release now supports Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) inclusion and display for signatures created by LEI-enabled Qualified Digital Certificates.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Where a certificate used for document signing has a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) set as an extension, the LEI information now appears in the signature verification dialog in SigningHub. The LEI information in the verification dialog also provides a link to the LEI information at the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).”<br>
Victoria Allen,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.signinghub.com/signinghub-v7.7.9-release">SigningHub v7.7.9 release announcement</a></p></blockquote>
<p>An example of an e-document signed by an LEI-enabled Qualified Digital Certificate. Clicking on the LEI Number allows the relying party to view the Legal Entity identity record at the Global LEI System public database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are LEIs? 
<p>LEIs are unique 20 digit codes representing an organisation’s identity. LEIs are validated by a small number of accredited LEI Issuers (like Ubisecure via our <a href="https://rapidlei.com">RapidLEI</a> service) and then centrally registered in the Global LEI System (GLEIS) database.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why does embedding an LEI matter? 
<p>The LEI is standardised across all jurisdictions. It is endorsed by the G20 and the Financial Stability Board and regulated by the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF). It is essentially the only truly standardised global organisation identifier.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for a legal entity to change its legal name or address, to go out of business, or to change ownership. Such changes need to be understood by parties relying on the identity information.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the LEI code is a live, permanent reference to an organisation’s identity record – a record that includes any historical changes to the identity data itself. LEI data is publicly available and a record of changes are maintained and freely accessible to all relying parties. The LEI ensures that any entity or service that has reliance on the record has the critical ability to see both currently validated identity data and review historical changes.</p>
<p>When embedded within a digital signature, thanks to the signature’s timestamp, the relying party has the ability to verify the signer’s organisation identity at the exact point the signature was created. Because the LEI record maintains a full history of changes, the relying party also has full traceability of the organisation from that point of signing onwards should there have been any changes to the LEI record.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The LEI record for UK-based “Ubisecure Limited” – including display of the current data and record change history such as change to legal names, addresses etc.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Digital Signature + Live Data + Historical Changes 
<p>The ability to combine live data with a historical reference offers traceability and visibility advantages over the static identity data usually embedded within digital certificates and digital signatures. When relying on such a system, being able to include a signature with live identity data and access to a history of changes is the equivalent to having your cake and eating it! The best of all worlds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to embed your LEI 
<p>To embed an organisation’s LEI into the signature, the enterprise must use an&nbsp;<a href="https://rapidlei.com/lei-marketplace/">LEI-enabled Qualified Digital Certificate</a>&nbsp;such as those issued by FirmaPro. Because both the LEI and the Certificate holder’s right to include the LEI is validated, the inclusion of the LEI in the document’s digital signatures further enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the document and its author. It also ensures signed documents meet the new European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) regulation for documents regulated by the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inclusion of LEIs in digital signatures is excellent news for users of SigningHub, as well as anyone relying on the signatures a SigningHub user has embedded into their document.</p>

<p>By Wafa-Ben Hassine, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>I believe it can. And it must. As a human rights attorney, I come at this issue thinking about people&nbsp;first.</p><p>Whether its messaging a family member asking them to bring home a loaf of bread, or discussing next year’s business strategy with a colleague, secure encryption ensures we can have private conversations and guarantees the integrity of our communication. Users’ quick adoption of encrypted, private messaging speaks volumes of its importance: billions of users worldwide use encrypted messaging on a daily basis as an indispensable tool in their livelihoods.</p><p>While the examples above are innocuous, we know that encrypted messaging platforms can also be used for more nefarious purposes. And with these platforms’ breadth, reach, and the undetectable nature of the content of conversations, we are deeply concerned about the harms that their deployment creates. Examples include <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44856910">lynch mobs in India</a>, <a href="https://mediaengagement.org/research/encrypted-propaganda/">widespread disinformation</a> on the coronavirus pandemic in Mexico and the US, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/whatsapp-skewed-brazilian-election-showing-social-medias-danger-to-democracy">swaying election results</a> in Brazil, facilitating global <a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2019/9/13/20863489/encryption-stanford-conference-facebook-ncmec-ghq">child abuse</a>, and providing white supremacists the channels needed to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/karstenschmehl/whatsapp-groups-nazi-symbol-stickers-germany">spread Nazi propaganda</a> in Germany and the&nbsp;US.</p><p>But we can’t just blame encryption for these harms. Encryption is universally regarded as a <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&amp;id=p::usmarcdef_0000246527&amp;file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_832e8e2a-88a0-4df2-a332-c945a30d9f8f%3F_%3D246527eng.pdf&amp;locale=en&amp;multi=true&amp;ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000246527/PDF/246527eng.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A145%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C0%5D">prerequisite for the exercise of rights</a> like freedom of expression, and freedom to privacy online. It is a means to a fundamental end. With the Internet increasingly permeating every aspect of our lives, encryption is a technology that will not and should not go away anytime soon. Health and financial institutions also utilize encryption to ensure that individuals’ personal information is safe from identity theft and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>We need to disrupt the status quo that materially benefits the large tech companies that provide these platforms (often for free), who then turn a blind eye to the harms they can cause. Researchers, civil society groups, and governments should be able to have select information on how the technology is operated and used — e.g. market sizes based on geography, metadata about how information travels, peak use and dynamics, etc. — all appropriately aggregated so as to protect individual privacy — so they can better understand the nature, type and impact of these harms, and ultimately, help propose ways to fix them. And tech platforms who provide these services should be ultimately accountable for ensuring their safety and&nbsp;quality.</p><p>I joined Omidyar Network to lead and support the type of work that can change that status quo. Our goal is to work with our partners to advance a robust, evidence-driven, and sensible public conversation that ensures encrypted messaging is safe, trustworthy, inclusive, and doesn’t sacrifice encryption and privacy. One that, based on my professional background, respects and upholds human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>To do that, we must start by envisioning the kind of messaging we want to see. The debate around whether we should, or should not encrypt, is a non-starter. Instead, we should ask: What kind of information do researchers need to help understand and prevent some of the issues we see? What pressure points can we identify to tilt the balance with policymakers? What does accountability look like in an encrypted ecosystem that in some instances, verifiably led to rampant organized disinformation and propaganda campaigns? What can different stakeholders do to stop the exploitation of technological gains benefitting privacy?</p><p>Answers to these questions will help us collectively conceive of more effective ways to mitigate any harmful byproducts of private, secure messaging, and begin to truly enjoy all that it has to&nbsp;offer.</p><p>As social activist and author Alice Walker said: “Look closely at the present you are constructing: it should look like the future you are dreaming.”</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/">CIOs and IT leaders</a> now enjoy a deeper, two-way relationship with the business as a result of the changing business needs spurred by COVID-19. They are educating senior stakeholders on the value of IT, especially during times of crisis, and assuming leadership of higher-impact initiatives.</p>
<p>On the flip side, business leaders are also assuming more accountability for IT projects. The enterprise’s path to the future runs through IT, and boards and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-ways-cios-can-help-ceos-restore-growth/">CEOs </a>know it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of applications depends on the collaboration between IT and business units</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These new realities illustrate how traditional boundaries between business and IT are becoming increasingly blurred. After all, a composable enterprise is only possible when business capabilities are assembled and combined to meet changing business needs.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>This is especially true among application leaders: The future of applications depends on the collaboration between IT and business units.</p>
<p>As business leadership takes a more strategic role in sourcing, procuring, implementing, delivering and maintaining applications, application leaders must look to adopt a new, strategic approach to vision and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/future-proof-application-strategy/">strategy </a>that involves delivering a composable enterprise.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable/">The Future of Business Is Composable&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>A new Gartner survey reveals that most companies planning for the future of applications and composable enterprise are choosing to increase, rather than decrease, collaboration between central IT teams and lines of business (LOBs). This trend is further amplified by COVID-19 despite its financial and disruptive impact.</p>
<p>Here are three key take-aways for application leaders.</p>
 Collaboration between IT and business is instrumental to successful application delivery 
<p>Companies that succeed in digital business are rethinking the way they operate. Gartner research shows that effective organizations have set up “fusion teams” — multidisciplinary teams that blend technology and other types of domain expertise that are often designed to deliver products rather than projects.</p>
<p>This trend is consistent within application delivery, specifically, with 93% of survey respondents reporting moderate to comprehensive collaboration between central IT and other LOBs. Distributed, simultaneous digital business initiatives with broad-based involvement from both IT and LOBs yield better results than centralized, sequential approaches.</p>
<p>Fuse business and IT teams so that they have shared accountability for business outcomes by tying incentives and performance metrics to joint success criteria. Bring business-led IT out of the shadows by offering tiered engagement options for business partners who want to pursue their own technology initiatives. Taken together, these steps will accelerate digital business transformation.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/covid-19-accelerates-digital-strategy-initiatives/">COVID-19 Accelerates Digital Strategy Initiatives&nbsp;</a></p>
 Security, technology and integration are barriers to IT-business collaboration on application delivery 
<p>Even though IT-business collaboration is a growing and unstoppable force, it is not without its challenges. According to the survey results, security, technology and integration are the top three barriers to collaborations between LOBs and IT on application delivery.</p>
<p>“The increasing replacement of operational technology infrastructure with IT systems is opening new vulnerabilities and risks,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/56819">Saniye Alaybeyi</a>, Sr Director Analyst, Gartner. “As remote, cross-functional work rises, so too does the use of collaboration technology, which is not always met with employee satisfaction.”</p>
<p>Suggested recommendations for application leaders to tackle each barrier include:</p>
 
 Security: Create a single security governance structure to support both IT and LOB domains, and balance their requirements. 
 Technology: Address deployment challenges to ensure better visibility and connectivity between employees. 
 Integration: Address integration challenges using the most suitable integration products, including but not limited to enterprise service bus (ESB), integration <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/information-platform-as-a-service-ipaas">platform as a service (iPaaS)</a> and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/robotic-process-automation-rpa">robotic process automation (RPA).</a> 
 
 COVID-19 is likely to increase IT-business collaboration 
<p>The strength of IT’s connections with LOB stakeholders and the capacity for innovation with new solutions are fundamental to the reactivation of the economy, and indeed for the survival of many organizations during and after COVID-19.</p>
<p>A significant number of respondents (64%) indicate that IT leaders are collaborating more with their LOB counterparts during the COVID-19 crisis. In contrast, only 20% of respondents indicate they are experiencing or expect to experience reduced IT-business collaboration.</p>
<p>Gartner recommends leveraging the closeness that COVID-19 is driving. Continued digital transformation is best accomplished when technical and business values are considered together.</p>
<p>“The success of the future of applications depends on organizations’ ability to bring business and IT together for collaborative and continuous creative work,” says Alaybeyi.</p>

<p>As
we transition further into the digital age, new digital tools are being piloted
to improve the interaction of citizens with their state. Where digitalisation
enables greater transparency for citizens, it also allows for better democratic
accountability. In our ongoing series on how technology could be used to make the state more efficient and more
democratic, in this session we looked at what has happened to the promise of
blockchain and the state. </p>



<p>Our
first speaker, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkossow/">Niklas
Kossow</a>, had
just submitted his doctoral thesis at the Hertie School in Berlin on the use of
digital technology in the fight against corruption. He looked in particular at
civil society efforts in Ukraine to digitise public procurement.</p>



<p>Niklas shared with us his
research findings on the question: “Digital tools in the fight against
corruption – can DLT help to lower corruption risks?”</p>



<p>Strategies on how to fight
corruption have been developed around the world. Among them, the digitalisation
of public administration has gained increasing popularity in recent years. This
approach is seen as a means to decrease the discretion of civil servants over
public funds and to increase transparency and data availability to support
public oversight. </p>



<p>In recent years, distributed
ledger technology has also sparked some hope in this context. With its emphasis
on transparency and accountability it was hoped DLT could become a widespread
anti-corruption technology. The reality, however, seems to be a bit more
nuanced: DLT can be used to lower corruption risks, but only in specific
contexts and when embedded in a wider anti-corruption strategy, was the
conclusion from Niklas’ research.</p>



<p>Moving from the Ukraine and
Germany, we then had a conversation with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolfrauschenbach/">Rolf Rauschenbach</a> &nbsp;from <a href="https://procivis.ch/">Procivis AG</a>, who is the co-author of a study just completed for the Canton of
Zurich on the use of blockchain technology and public administration in
Switzerland. </p>



<p>These are some of the issues
we discussed: How it came about that this study was commissioned, how the study
was structured and what its main findings were.</p>



<p>One chapter in the study
contained a summary of all existing government-related blockchain pilot
projects in Switzerland, representing a valuable snapshot of projects. Another
chapter approached the topic of blockchain and the state from a political
philosophy/political theory point of view. That chapter suggested that
blockchain and the theory of the ideal state were not compatible. Since we do
not live in the realm of the ideal or imaginary state, though, the study
proposed four areas where blockchain might still be of use to an efficient,
democratic state. </p>

<p>With the holiday season in full swing, many are traveling to spend it with family and friends – despite the continued rise in COVID-19 cases. This trend led OWI to analyze how COVID-driven individual identity initiatives have changed the identification processes for air travel passengers and what the lasting effect on the travel industry may be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Covid Takes a Toll 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The travel industry is one of the areas most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significantly lower number of travelers due to travel restrictions and general fear of overexposure to the virus. During the Monday and Sunday of the Thanksgiving holiday week, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/thanksgiving-air-travel-rises-to-pandemic-high-but-still-less-than-half-of-last-years-levels.html">1 million people</a>, which was the highest number since March 16 and 40 percent lower than the number of travelers during last year’s Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To travel safely, travelers should aim to minimize contact between different parties and the time spent in crowds. Travelers need to exchange information when they check-in, go through security, enter lounges, and purchase items inside the airport. Implementing a holistic digital identity for travelers, airlines, airport operators, and government agencies can make the journey more seamless, efficient, and secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Identity Takes Flight&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first implementation of a digital identity solution for travelers was electronic boarding passes, which have been successful due to the high adoption of mobile phones. An&nbsp;<a href="https://airlines.iata.org/sites/default/files/DAY%202.FINAL-6.pdf">IATA study</a>&nbsp;showed that 74 percent of passengers in 2017 used an electronic boarding pass on a smartphone. Furthermore, over the past years, there has been an increase in self-check-in solutions, minimizing interactions between travelers. By utilizing each of these solutions, travelers can have a check-in and pre-flight experience that’s nearly contact-free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second implementation of digital identity, which has not yet been widely adopted, is a digital ID. While travelers can use their mobile phones for their boarding passes, they must use a physical form of ID to verify their identity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Eighty-two percent of respondents in the same IATA study stated that they would be willing to use a digital passport in lieu of their current paper passport.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Need for Speed, Safety &amp; Spending 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, TSA serviced over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202008/tsa-to-stand-up-airport-digital-id-app-as-aviation-sector-deploys-biometrics-and-temperature-checks">2.5 million travelers</a>&nbsp;each day on average, and roughly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202008/tsa-to-stand-up-airport-digital-id-app-as-aviation-sector-deploys-biometrics-and-temperature-checks">600 people</a> were found without an acceptable form of ID. While manual checks are currently leveraged, this method can result in human error in an area that needs to provide the highest security possible. With a holistic digital identity solution, travelers can have a more seamless experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first digital identity solution for airport security was implemented by CLEAR, which provides identity verification and security checks with the implementation of their proprietary machines. Currently, there are other digital identity solutions in testing, such as the one provided by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2020/11/lufthansa-launches-star-alliance-biometrics/">Lufthansa</a>, which allows travelers to enroll their biometrics in an app and create a digital identity. With this app, travelers can pass through security checkpoints and boarding gates without removing their masks, creating a safe experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>American Airlines, Delta, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idemia.com/press-release/idemia-and-resa-airport-data-systems-were-chosen-vinci-airports-come-world-first-wholly-contactless-and-biometrics-based-passenger-experience-lyon-saint-exupery-airport-2020-10-05">IDEMIA</a>&nbsp;are also working to implement an interoperable biometric identity and identification platform for travelers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202011/delta-pilots-digital-id-in-detroit-cbp-biometric-arrival-expands-to-houston">In collaboration with the TSA</a>, Delta launched a new biometric identification program for domestic travelers that matches facial recognition with a digital ID using the traveler’s passport number and TSA PreCheck membership.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nfcw.com/2020/11/02/368994/american-airlines-pilots-mobile-digital-identity-system/">American Airlines</a>&nbsp;is trying to implement a Digital ID with the collaboration of <a href="http://airsidemobile.com">Airside</a>. Both initiatives are currently being put in specific locations and are available to travelers who create an account registering their biometrics and face-ID. In addition,&nbsp;<a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/11/27/covid-19-travel-airlines-hope-new-digital-health-passport-app-will-revive-international-travel/">IATA announced</a>&nbsp;the development of a health passport called “Travel Pass”, for travelers to record their PCR test results for countries require this information for entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, using both a digital identity and a digital boarding pass provides a seamless experience and reduces friction. Going through the TSA security lines at airports can be a burden for travelers as these lines are usually long, slow, and crowded. The average wait time for standard lanes is 30 minutes, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2019/01/15/tsa-statement-checkpoint-operations-january-15#:~:text=For%20questions%20about%20terminal%20closings,longer%20than%20usual%20wait%20times.">TSA</a>. These long wait times not only negatively affect travelers but also result in lost revenue for airports. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A study by NEC showed that an extra 10 minutes in security reduces average passenger retail spending in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nec.com/en/global/solutions/safety/resourcecenter/pdf/digital_identity.pdf">US airports by 30</a>&nbsp;percent. </p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering that customers need to verify themselves when purchasing items at the airport or entering lounges, the actual percentage could be even higher. These digital identity initiatives can reduce the amount of time that travelers are exposed to large crowds and maximize passenger retail spending.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 The OWI Analyst Take 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advent of COVID-19 has encouraged governments and private entities to push forward biometric-based digital identity products that consumers can leverage for frictionless travel. These are incredibly nascent — emerging just over the past few months and set to launch into the future — but OWI believes this to indicate an intersection between the growing ubiquity of mobile identity across all verticals, as well as the growth in enterprise adoption of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acuant.com/blog/the-face-of-travel-today-smart-airports-biometrics-epassports-and-defining-a-secure-identity-token/">different authentication modalities</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, OWI anticipates that as this trend persists — namely, as travelers digitize more and more of their touchpoints across the travel lifecycle — airports and airlines might benefit immensely from an ability to aggregate and analyze these new data trails, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iata.org/contentassets/c1258b62226b43a0a0f46ce27daf820b/ai-lab-ads18.pdf">improved machine learning capabilities for Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) channels</a>.&nbsp;</p>

The big news right before the holiday was a series of tweets by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on rumors of impending legislation from the Trump administration regarding crypto wallets and identity. <p>Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1331744884856741888?s=20">the tweetstorm</a>:</p><blockquote>Last week we heard rumors that the U.S. Treasury and Secretary Mnuchin were planning to rush out some new regulation regarding self-hosted crypto wallets before the end of his term. I’m concerned that this would have unintended side effects, and wanted to share those concerns.</blockquote><blockquote>For those who don’t know — self-hosted crypto wallets (also known as non-custodial wallets or self-custody wallets) are a type of software that lets individuals store and use their own cryptocurrency, instead of needing to rely on a third party financial institution.</blockquote><blockquote>Self-hosted crypto wallets are important, because they allow anyone to use this new technology to access basic financial services — just like anyone can use a computer or smartphone to access the open internet.</blockquote><blockquote>The open nature of cryptocurrency is what makes it a powerful tool for innovation, and it is what levels the playing field globally. It is what is fueling innovation, such as in Defi. It has the potential to bring down the cost of financial services, and improve accessibility.</blockquote><blockquote>This proposed regulation would, we think, require financial institutions like Coinbase to verify the recipient/owner of the self-hosted wallet, collecting identifying information on that party, before a withdrawal could be sent to that self-hosted wallet.</blockquote><p>Armstrong goes on to <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1331745196887867393">offer a bunch of arguments</a> as to why these rumored regulations would be damaging to the industry — outlining issues everywhere from merchant processing to&nbsp;defi.</p><p>From the regulator’s perspective, you can understand their intention. KYC and identity parameters are instrumental in the fight against issues like money laundering and terrorist financing. The concern is that these rules are being rushed through. As always, there is always the risk that well-intentioned regulations can have the unintended consequence of stymieing a virant, innovative and open&nbsp;system.</p><p>The big picture, however, is that such concerns will eventually need to be addressed in a smart way — one that effectively deals with malicious activity while preserving innovation and openness.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-regulations-industry-pros">Industry Pros Weigh In on Rumors of New Crypto Wallet Regs — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-ceo-trump-administration-may-rush-out-burdensome-crypto-wallet-rules">Coinbase CEO: Trump Administration May ‘Rush Out’ Burdensome Crypto Wallet Rules — CoinDesk</a>   2. With multiple vaccines on the way, the issue of COVID credentials is again taking centerstage. <p>The latest news is that anyone flying Qantas Airlines will <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-55048438">need to be vaccinated, according to chief Alan&nbsp;Joyce</a>.</p><p>It’s another topic that’s become heated in recent times for similar reasons to the one we addressed above. Ultimately, this is about finding smart approaches so that we can preserve individual rights to privacy and sovereignty while ensuring health and&nbsp;safety.</p><p>What’s super cool is that we have the means and the technology to achieve that now and there will be a big opportunity in 2021 to start flipping that narrative with new approaches (as many of the current critiques are based on the status&nbsp;quo).</p><p>It’s maybe no surprise that China is again taking the lead in this regard (like they are with central bank digital currencies). The Chinese Communist Party is uniquely positioned given the power they have over their populace and also differing value&nbsp;systems.</p><p>For other governments to follow, it also becomes a case of implementing new digital approaches without “becoming China.”</p><p>Here’s the latest, via Vadim — <a href="https://chengdu-expat.com/health-code-guidelines-for-chinas-major-cities/">a required app for travel within&nbsp;China</a>:</p><blockquote>Whilst COVID-19 is not longer a BIG risk in China, you still often need a city’s specific health code if you plan to travel in China. Here’s the health code guide for you to go to these locations in China:If your health code is Ok, traveling to these cities shouldn’t be a problem for you to visit. However, we do recommend you to check with your hotel in advance, as some restrict foreigners, and others (especially in smaller cities) require a recent COVID&nbsp;test.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>The Health Kit (Jiankang Bao) mini-program is now online! Foreign nationals may find the mini-program by typing in “Health Kit” in the WeChat or Alipay search bar and check your registered health status.

The potential acquisition of Slack shows the importance of video and Groups post-COVID. Photo: Anna&nbsp;Schvets<p>Slack went public not too long ago but now might be getting swallowed up by Salesforce. The main reason? No&nbsp;video.</p><p>Here’s the&nbsp;WSJ:</p><blockquote>Microsoft has become a greater-than-anticipated threat to Slack, said Rishi Jaluria, an analyst for investment research firm D.A. Davidson &amp; Co. Slack, he said, “may be a little more vulnerable than we’d have expected since the pandemic.”</blockquote><blockquote>It didn’t have to be that way. Slack worked to add video features to its chat-based collaboration tool for years, acquiring Screenhero, a startup with a screen-sharing app, in&nbsp;2015.</blockquote><blockquote>Adding video features to Slack’s app proved difficult, said Jahanzeb Sherwani, Screenhero’s former chief executive, who left Slack in 2018. It took more than a year for the small team to launch the voice and video chat feature, much longer than the original estimate, he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>Slack launched video calling toward the end of 2016, and screen sharing became available in mid-2017, features that made up “Slack calls.” Video chat in Slack remains more basic than what rival Zoom has offered, limited to calls within an organization instead of letting a wider network of users jump on a virtual&nbsp;meeting.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s not controversial to say that Slack calls wasn’t a top priority,” said Mr. Sherwani, who now has a new collaboration-tech startup, Screen&nbsp;Inc.</blockquote><p>Of course, one community app that’s shone despite the lack of video is Discord. The difference? Discord’s voice + groups feature makes it truly unique especially in a time when creating that more casual sense of hanging out comes at a premium with everyone locked&nbsp;down.</p><p>All of which gives you the sense that video and Groups are the two most important features in a post-COVID world.</p><p>Which brings us to the age old question.</p><p>Why not&nbsp;both?</p><p>BONUS:</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/slack-missed-out-on-the-pandemics-zoom-boom-leaving-it-vulnerable-11606478401">Slack Missed Out on the Pandemic’s Zoom Boom, Leaving It Vulnerable</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-addiction-bubble-b39a3693-6919-426e-b8d3-d8bf9644e0a4.html">The Facebook “addiction” label may blind us to actual solutions to social-media problems</a>   4.

Wir haben Corona getrotzt! Wir hatten Spaß! Und wir haben viel gelernt.</p><p>Gestartet im ersten Lockdown im April, als alles losging, und wir uns alle nicht kannten, geendet im zweiten Lockdown Ende November. Man muss schon verrückt genug sein und lieben, was man tut. An beidem mangelt es uns nicht.</p><p>Seitdem: Unzählige Stunden in Coachings, in Workshops, miteinander vor den Laptops gesessen und gesprochen, diskutiert, intensiv gearbeitet, uns gegenseitig Feedback gegeben, Insights über die Versicherungsbranche gewonnen und unzählige Ratschläge bekommen, wie wir unser Geschäft noch erfolgreicher aufstellen. Denn nicht nur die Versicherer beobachten in diesem Accelerator die vielversprechendsten Startups der Szene. comuny hatte sich Anfang 2020 aus über 100 Startups in einer internationalen Auslese unter die letzten 17 gepitcht. Jetzt sind wir sind ready!</p><p>Wir haben einen weiteren spannenden Sprung hingelegt und sagen dem ganzen Team des InsurLab Germany ein herzliches Dankeschön für eure super Unterstützung!

There may be variations in: amount of funding, # teams funded, and action steps themselves.  <p>The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki">OceanDAO wiki</a> has the links and up-to-date information you will need, to participate as a project team member or as a community curator.</p> Project Types <p>OceanDAO funding is for projects of these&nbsp;types:</p>  Build / improve applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Outreach / community (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleash data  Build / improve core Ocean&nbsp;software   Project Criteria <p>When proposing a project, these are the two criteria to keep in consideration: (1) ROI towards growth (2) aligned with Ocean mission. Projects that fail (2) will not be considered for voting. Once voting opens, only criterion (1) remains. Let’s elaborate!</p><p>Criterion (1). On average, value added to the Ocean ecosystem must exceed the grant value&nbsp;spent.</p>  That is, the average “return on investment” (ROI) must be &gt; 1.0. Value added by a project is hard to know in advance. Some will fail; others will succeed and bring 10x value. But this must hold true on average across projects.  Motivation: We want a “snowball effect” for ecosystem growth, where more funds granted leads to more funds available for grants in the future. This will happen with more network revenue or a rise in&nbsp;OCEAN.  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/On-ROI">This page</a> has more information on Expected&nbsp;ROI.  <p>Criterion (2). The project must help to promote the Ocean’s mission &amp; values (or at least not work against&nbsp;them).</p>  Mission &amp; values. Ocean’s mission is to equalize the opportunity for people to access data. Ocean’s values, and further details, are&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">here</a>.   Minimum Proposal Requirements <p>Anyone can propose a project to OceanDAO. However, to be considered, you must have at least 5,000 OCEAN in the same Ethereum wallet as listed in your proposal by the time the proposal process ends (December 14th, 23:59 pm GMT). If selected for a grant, this will be the same wallet where you will receive your grant funding. This helps to filter towards people with a vested interest or “skin in the game” in OCEAN — that is, Ocean community members. Ocean Protocol team members will&nbsp;verify.</p> Discussion Venues <p>There are two main venues for discussion: text chat-based at Discord, and videochat Town&nbsp;Halls.</p><p>Discord: Navigate to the Ocean Protocol Discord and join the <a href="https://discord.gg/uvyQFWGBn8">OceanDAO channel</a>. Here we welcome all conversation and questions OceanDAO&nbsp;related.</p><p>Town Halls [<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Town-Hall">Link</a>]. These are regular videochat events among community members, open to all. It’s a great place to get to know the community. Here you can ask questions, share proposal feedback, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>The first Town Hall is Wednesday, Dec 2 at 16:00&nbsp;GMT.</p><p>See the Town Hall page for information on future&nbsp;calls.</p> Voting: Details <p>Voting will take place on: <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">vote.oceanprotocol.com</a></p> Implementation   At proposal deadline (December 14th at 23:59 pm GMT), Proposals that meet the “Minimum Proposal Requirements” and “Project Criteria” will be migrated to the <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">OceanDAO Voting&nbsp;Page</a>.  Vote with your OCEAN Tokens. 1 OCEAN = 1&nbsp;vote.  In order for your vote to count, you must have the OCEAN already in the non-custodial wallet you plan on voting with before the vote opens (December 15th at 12:00 pm GMT). This is so your existing OCEAN balance can be counted. Voting from exchanges is not supported.  Your wallet address can only vote on one proposal. If you would like to vote on more than one proposal, you will need to fund your multiple wallet addresses with the respective amount of OCEAN before the voting&nbsp;opens.  You can only vote with the OCEAN tokens in your wallet. You will be unable to vote with OCEAN that is deposited as liquidity in Ocean Market, Bancor, or otherwise. It is your choice if you would like to remove liquidity, vote, and re-add the liquidity back later. Risks come with removing liquidity (impermanent loss etc). This is up to you to manage. In the future, we aim to support voting without needing to remove liquidity (e.g. vote with&nbsp;BPTs).   How to&nbsp;Vote   Navigate to the <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">OceanDAO Voting&nbsp;Page</a>.  Once voting begins you will see the active proposals on the&nbsp;ballot.  Connect your Web3 wallet containing your OCEAN&nbsp;tokens.  Select the proposal you wish to vote&nbsp;for.  Click “Vote” and sign with your&nbsp;wallet.  Vote percentages will adjust accordingly as votes are&nbsp;counted.   Grant Details  Grant Recipients <p>In Funding Round 1, each winning project will receive 10,000 OCEAN from OceanDAO. There will be 5 winners: the top 5 highest voted proposals (additionally, to receive a grant you must also receive greater than 1% of the&nbsp;vote).</p><p>Funds will be disbursed to the grantees within 24 hours after voting&nbsp;ends.</p><p>Funds for OceanDAO currently come from Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF). Future funds are earmarked to also come from the 51% Ocean token supply (details&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">here</a>).</p> Non-Grant Recipients <p>If you were not selected for a grant in this Funding Round, we highly encourage you to continue to stay involved in the Ocean community. You are appreciated! There are future OceanDAO funding rounds on the first of every month starting in February 2021, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/fund">other opportunities</a> to receive&nbsp;funding.</p> On OceanDAO Evolution <p>The best practices and technology around DAOs are still evolving. OceanDAO’s strategy is to “bake slowly” — to ratchet up value-at-risk over time, to give space to learn and for technology to improve. Accordingly, the amount of funds per Funding Round may vary, and OPF reserves the right to make changes in general. The aim is: if OceanDAO creates positive value, then the funds allocated to OceanDAO will go&nbsp;up.</p><p>Shipping OceanDAO completes “Goal 4” in the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">2020 product plans</a>, on schedule. The label “V4” will be reserved for future software releases.</p> FAQ <p>Is voting from exchanges possible?</p><p>No. Make sure to have an OCEAN balance in a non-custodial wallet before voting opens on Dec&nbsp;15.</p><p>How does Ocean relate to other Ocean funding programs (Shipyard, Data Economy Challenge)?</p><p>They are complementary:</p>  Shipyard offers grants curated by the core Ocean&nbsp;team.  OceanDAO offers grants curated by the broader community of OCEAN&nbsp;holders.  Data Economy Challenge (DEC) offers prizes curated by expert judges from the community.  More information is at: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/fund">https://oceanprotocol.com/fund</a>  <p>Is Ocean a governance DAO? Can we use it to change parameter x?</p><p>No. OceanDAO is exclusively a grants DAO which gives funding for community-proposed projects. That’s&nbsp;it.</p><p>Is this Ocean V4? If no, does that mean you didn’t complete your&nbsp;roadmap?</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">roadmap</a> laid out shipping OceanDAO as Ocean Goal 4 / V4. In shipping OceanDAO, we are fulfilling Goal 4 and the promise of the roadmap. However, we are now reserving the label “Ocean V4” for future changes to Ocean smart contract software.</p><p>Why not <a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/quadratic-funding">quadratic funding</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">Quadratic voting</a>? <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475">Conviction voting</a>? <a href="https://twitter.com/gnosisPM/status/1330906217007509507">Futarchy</a>?&nbsp;…?</p><p>These are all great ideas. Currently we constrain ourselves to using readily-available tooling with a minimum of experimentation needed. None of the ideas listed fit that criteria. However as DAO tooling improves, we hope to be able to try out new&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Are there plans for a governance DAO?</p><p>Not at the present. This is also because, for Ocean, PRs or forks are generally more appropriate anyway, see below. Let’s see how things evolve. For changes&nbsp;to:</p>  Ocean Market code, then make a PR, or fork and make your own&nbsp;version.  libraries like ocean.js, then make a PR, or fork and make your own&nbsp;version.  the datatokens contracts: there is virtually nothing to change since they’re so simple. Basically just&nbsp;ERC20.  the pool contracts, fork it, change it, and deploy as your own version. We *want* more types of pools in&nbsp;Ocean.  <p>More OCEAN tokens are in circulation via the grant rewards. Does this really bring more value to the Ocean ecosystem? What are the benefits of OceanDAO?</p><p>OceanDAO is a grants DAO with the purpose of growing the overall value of Ocean Protocol. Investing in the Ocean ecosystem is a critical aspect of this goal. See <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">The Web3 Sustainability Loop</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>The OPF has Ocean tokens, will they use them to vote for proposals? Will it then be a centralized system where the OPF chooses what will get&nbsp;funded?</p><p>No. The OPF and BigchainDB will not be&nbsp;voting.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

As we head into the last month of 2020, this most extraordinary year, we’re delighted to announce a new partnership focussed on empowering work. <a href="https://vela.solutions/">VELA Solutions</a> has selected <a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> to power their workforce digital credentials platform.




 




Together, Meeco and VELA have created a secure digital credentialing platform to help individuals and businesses adapt to the changing work environment and modernise their HR practices.




 




The post COVID-19 world will be more digital. Whilst many digital technologies already existed, to support working from home, telemedicine or signing a contract, necessity accelerated adoption this year.




 




Now, as we look to 2021, with the promise of being able to work together again, there’s an opportunity to rethink the way we seek and start work in a more trusted and digital way.




 




New technical standards are emerging which focus on establishing trust in the digital world. One such standard is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>, the method by which credentials can be issued, verified and exchanged. This includes the ability to cryptographically prove that a credential is authentic, valid and trustworthy. The benefits for people and organisations of this technology include:




 





  Faster and more convenient to verify education and training records  Reduced risk and fraud  Credential portability and re-use               Verification and revocation  Improved compliance  Increased safety  Privacy management  








Founded by <a href="https://vela.solutions/about-us/">Andrew Scott and Michael Derwin</a>, VELA Solutions is the culmination of their extensive experience across workforce management, organisational development and HR Tech. Their motivation to build VELA draws on their personal stories.




 




For Andrew, the importance of identity was something he learnt at a much younger age. In his late teens whilst living away from home to study, the share house he was living in was destroyed by fire. He escaped only with the jeans he was wearing and with no way to identify himself. Without proof of identity, he was not able to access basic things like health services or his bank account. Living rough was the only option until he could get back on his feet. This experience has shaped his desire to ensure people can benefit from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralised identity</a>, also referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self Sovereign</a>, <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/mccom/en-us/issuers/digital-identity/digital-identity-restoring-trust-in-a-digital-world-final-share-corrected.pdf">Self-Managed</a> or <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/eIDAS-and-EUs-mission-to-create-a-truly-portable-identity">Portable Identity</a>.




 





<blockquote>We believe that this technology will fundamentally change the way businesses and employees work together – it’s just a matter of time.<p></p>Andrew Scott, Director – VELA Solutions</blockquote>




Michael has always had a passion for making technology work for people. He is no stranger to pioneering the change he wants to see in the world. His first foray was in the 1990s, using the early internet to support the education of Australian outback students using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Air">“School of The Air”</a>– something we now know as open learning.  More recently he co-founded the talent management software company, <a href="https://www.adepto.com">Adepto</a>, which was successfully acquired by <a href="https://degreed.com">Degreed</a> earlier this year.




<blockquote>We are now in the age where we can connect hardware and software technologies and truly empower individuals to take charge of their digital self. 

Michael Derwin, Director – VELA Solutions</blockquote>




The maturing of decentralised identity solutions underscored the decision to find an experienced partner. Enter Meeco. We have been pioneering the  collection, protection and exchange of personal data and identity since 2012.  The decentralised credentials technology developed for VELA draws on our expertise and uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable </a><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Credentials</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/"> Standard</a>, which means, we will deliver workforce solutions that are interoperable and globally supported.




 





<blockquote>“This is a significant achievement towards empowering people to securely collect, verify and share their workforce credentials. The mutual benefits of risk management and value creation demonstrates the power of human-centric technology. Adopting this approach gives mutual control over the collection and use of personal data, and give workforce eco-system partners a competitive edge.”&nbsp;  <p></p>Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder, Meeco</blockquote>





 









 





<blockquote>“The changing landscape around data privacy is putting the individual in charge of their data – this will fundamentally change the way companies need to operate.”









<p></p>Michael Derwin, Director, VELA Solutions</blockquote>





 




VELA and Meeco are united by our vision to get trusted workforce data into the hands of people so they can use their verified work data to get work, utilise their skills and experience, and progress their careers.




 




To support these workforce challenges, we have developed a secure platform with verified credential portability making it faster and easier to recruit, onboard and maintain employee and contractor professional credentials.




 




Our differentiator will be the ability to configure implementations to support both decentralised wallets and integration into existing enterprise systems. This is achieved with Meeco’s patented vault technology. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/developers">Meeco’s suite of APIs, SDKs and documentation</a> are available to our eco-system partners  to ensure integrations support corporate governance, risk tracking and reduction, improved safety and compliance outcomes, whilst always empowering people.




 




The VELA solution can be applied across a range of sectors such as health,  mining, education, aviation and government.  To find out more and register to keep updated on our progress, visit <a href="https://vela.solutions">VELA Solutions</a>.




 




Also stay tuned, in the coming weeks Meeco will announce our distributed ledger partner, along with our commitment to co-developing tools to support the issuers, verifiers and enterprises in this exiting new workforce eco-system.

   It’s over 13 years since we at Mydex Community Interest Company set up&nbsp;shop.  Back then, we had a vision and a mission: that every human being — every citizen in every country in the world — should have the right and ability to gather and use their own data for their own purposes, including exercising control over how others collect and use their&nbsp;data.

<p>It’s over 13 years since we at Mydex Community Interest Company set up&nbsp;shop.</p><p>Back then, we had a vision and a mission: that every human being — every citizen in every country in the world — should have the right and ability to gather and use their own data for their own purposes, including exercising control over how others collect and use their&nbsp;data.</p><p>At the time, this idea seemed so outlandish that most people simply ignored or dismissed our ideas as irrelevant.</p><p>But over the years the need for our mission has become ever more apparent, with mounting abuses and accelerating imbalances of power and reward, and with growing awareness that our society and economy is failing to <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">unleash the full potential of data</a> — especially personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Also, slowly but surely, the means of achieving this mission has also become clearer. Every citizen needs to have their own personal data store which enables them to collect, store, use and share their own data under their own control, independently of any other party or organisation that might have collected data about&nbsp;them.</p> Critical design principles <p>Particular details of how this system should work have also become clearer. Over the years, we worked hard to clarify the design principles that are critical for our mission’s success. We laid out the most important ones <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-a-new-data-infrastructure-22124e300f6c">in a blog back 2018</a>. Key amongst them&nbsp;were:</p><p>1. Public/social purpose and mission. The purpose of the new personal data infrastructure should not be to monetise data but to promote the public good e.g. benefits for citizens.</p><p>2. Independence. It should work for people — citizens — not for the profits of private corporations or for the&nbsp;state.</p><p>3. Neural and enabling The infrastructure should not be designed or used so as to favour one party’s vested interests over&nbsp;another.</p><p>4. Distributed, not centralised With each personal data store uniquely and separately encrypted, held by individuals for individuals (i.e. not creating yet another massive centralised database).</p><p>5. Zero-knowledge operations It should not look into or seek to influence how individuals use their data. Its job is to promote and enable their agency, not to seek to control&nbsp;them.</p><p>6. Aligned incentives The way it earns its money should be structured so that it has no financial incentives to monetise, manipulate or seek control over individuals’ data or their uses of this&nbsp;data.</p><p>7. Separation of storage from use The only way to achieve all the above is to create a structural separation of functions and roles: with one focused on the provision of infrastructure enabling citizens to collect, store and share their data, the other actually using the data (e.g. to provide financial advice, treat a medical condition, or assess an individual’s eligibility for a service).</p><p>8. Built to last — the infrastructure should have built-in safeguards against changes to its role, functions and priorities — for instance, in the case of a change of leadership, stock market listing, merger, sale, acquisition, bankruptcy etc.</p> The EU&nbsp;agrees! <p>This week, the EU published its new Data Governance Act, its core purpose being to “foster the availability of data for use by increasing trust in data intermediaries and by strengthening data-sharing mechanisms across the&nbsp;EU”.</p><p>A core part of its provisions are rules relating to data intermediaries that enable what it calls ‘C2B’ [consumer to business] data sharing. This is what the Act&nbsp;says:</p><blockquote>“These providers will have to comply with a number of requirements, in particular the requirement to remain neutral as regards the data exchanged. They cannot use such data for other purposes. In the case of providers of data sharing services offering services for natural persons, the additional criterion of assuming fiduciary duties towards the individuals using them will also have to be&nbsp;met.”</blockquote><p>Just as we had&nbsp;said.</p><p>Clause 23 goes on to say (in a rather long-winded paragraph):</p><blockquote>“A specific category of data intermediaries includes providers of data sharing services that offer their services to data subjects in the sense of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 [GDPR in other words]. Such providers focus exclusively on personal data and seek to enhance individual agency and the individuals’ control over the data pertaining to them. They would assist individuals in exercising their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular managing their consent to data processing, the right of access to their own data, the right to the rectification of inaccurate personal data, the right of erasure or right ‘to be forgotten’, the right to restrict processing and the data portability right, which allows data subjects to move their personal data from one controller to the other. In this context, it is important that their business model ensures that there are no misaligned incentives that encourage individuals to make more data available for processing than what is in the individuals’ own interest. This could include advising individuals on uses of their data they could allow and making due diligence checks on data users before allowing them to contact data subjects, in order to avoid fraudulent practices. In certain situations, it could be desirable to collate actual data within a personal data storage space, or ‘personal data space’ so that processing can happen within that space without personal data being transmitted to third parties in order to maximise the protection of personal data and privacy.”</blockquote><p>All this is pretty much what we wrote in our blog back in May&nbsp;2018.</p> One step forward&nbsp;… <p>It is incredibly positive that the EU has made this step, in many&nbsp;ways.</p><p>It’s very important that there is legal recognition of personal data services that work for and behalf of individuals; that are not traditional ‘data controllers’ that collect and use data for a particular organisation’s purposes.</p><p>It is very important that the two way nature of data sharing — both so-called ‘B2C’ [business-to-consumer] and ‘C2B’ [consumer-to-business] — be recognised. (We would rather that the ‘C’ refer to citizens rather than ‘consumers’, which is a derogatory term in our minds. But you can’t have everything).</p><p>And it is particularly important that the core design principles outlined above are recognised, embraced and enforced.</p><p>That said, there’s still a long, long way to go. Writing down some good principles is one thing. Interpreting them in the right way and actually implementing and enforcing them is something else entirely. The new Act makes progress easier, but in no way does it make progress inevitable.</p><p>There’s also the question of how the UK responds. Will the UK Government adopt a similar approach? With its own National Data Strategy consultation coming to a close next week, the UK Government has an immense opportunity to unleash the full potential of personal data for the nation’s citizens, society and economy. Has it got the vision and political will to do&nbsp;this?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/vindicated-cb897fb4e94b">Vindicated!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A recap of everything that has happened so far…and of what’s to&nbsp;come.  Intro <p>3 years can feel like an eternity at a time of relative normality, let alone in a year like 2020. In the blockchain industry, time travels so quickly that it can make you feel like you are travelling at lightspeed given just how much occurs in such a short amount of time. When Ontology officially launched in New York as 2017 was coming to an end, the world was witnessing global recognition of Bitcoin for the first time as the price jumped to almost $20,000, before crashing in January of 2018. At a time when the industry was plagued by scams, false pretenses and an overall lack of clarity, Ontology was able to seize the moment and establish itself as an industry leader that enterprises can rely&nbsp;on.</p><p>Not only has Ontology survived the bursting of the initial bubble; we have found our footing and thrived in the process. The first 3 years of Ontology have seen massive accomplishments both in terms of technical development and market adoption. Our focus has, and always will be geared towards the protection and control of individual user privacy and data rights, as stated by our Founder, Li Jun, in his earliest conception of the Ontology blockchain. In fact, Li Jun’s vision seems even more pertinent now than it was back&nbsp;then.</p><p>Today, concerns around user privacy continues to grow amongst all facets of society. Laws such as the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/#:~:text=The%20regulation%20was%20put%20into,tens%20of%20millions%20of%20euros.">GDPR, passed back in May 2018</a>, show governments attempting to address these concerns. It seems Ontology’s vision of a total decentralized identity solution such as our ONT ID is needed more now than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>However, we know that growth and progress isn’t always linear, as we have seen with the highs and lows the industry has experienced over the last 3 years. What is important though, is that we continue to move forward. We have compiled a recap of the things we have done to achieve our goals over the last 3&nbsp;years.</p> Year One: Systemic Construction <p>As with most long term projects, the first step is about building a solid foundation upon which the project can flourish. For Ontology, our initial phase saw the launching of our <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ontology-mainnet-ontology-1-0-has-officially-launched">MainNet</a> and the first version of our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/o-wallet-ontologys-official-desktop-wallet-version-0-8-0-release-notes-38b2ed8d1492">ONTO wallet</a>. Our MainNet serves as a high-performance public blockchain with a distributed ledger and smart contract system that also supports public chain customization and chain network collaboration. Notably, Ontology 1.0 was the first public chain capable of executing smart contracts with identity, setting the vision for decentralized identity in motion. To allow for better user interaction, we subsequently launched the first version of ONTO in the summer of 2018, which supported individual wallets, shared wallets, and the ledger hardware wallet. On top of that, in our first year we introduced a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-launches-vbft-a-next-generation-consensus-mechanism-becoming-one-of-the-first-vrf-based-91f782308db4">new consensus algorithm VBFT</a> for the Ontology framework and the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-introduces-the-triones-membership-system-5211294976bf">Triones Consensus System</a>, which laid the groundwork for an open governance model. With the first series of projects having launched on GitHub in March 2018, we moved further into the area of decentralized identity with the launch of <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-first-version-of-the-ontology-roadmaps-8760c96e50b5">ONT ID</a>, which includes the Ontology distributed identification protocol and verifiable claim protocol. To close off our system construction in year one, Ontology joined an array of internationally recognized blockchain based groups including the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation.</a></p> Year Two: Industry Recognition <p>Ontology’s second year revolved around developing our singular vision and ensuring our technical prowess within the broader ecosystem. Our goal was realized when Ontology was chosen to be part of the Microsoft Accelerator in December, 2018<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/onchain-wins-the-microsoft-accelerator-shanghai-third-cohort-graduation-award-acd28dcc22b5">,</a> as well as being officially listed as a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-is-now-an-official-google-cloud-partner-as-three-ontology-projects-are-accepted-to-the-935edeef3e64">Google Cloud Partner with three of our projects having been accepted</a> in their partner program shortly after in February of 2019. In June of 2019, Ontology celebrated its one year anniversary of our MainNet launch. Once we achieved a certain level of public trust in the technical expertise behind Ontology, launching our MainNet allowed us to build upon it for further Enterprise projects who were focusing on decentralized identity and data privacy. In addition, we launched the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-v1-8-0-goes-live-with-wasm-fa34e9f7f930">Wasm TestNet in May</a>, as well as the first ever cross-chain TestNet in the same month. The <a href="https://blockchain.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> also passed both of our proposed blockchain standards in&nbsp;June.</p><p>We wrapped up our second year with our Multi-VM launch in October, followed by the launch of our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-sharding-design-released-c900331f71fa">Sharding Design</a>. Our Sharding Design was specifically designed to provide effective linear stability and support for atomic cross-shard transaction processing.</p><p>During our second year, we also released the <a href="https://ont.io/Ontology-Infrastructure-White-Paper-EN-2.0.0.pdf">second version of our Whitepaper</a> in July. The whitepaper reiterated Li Jun’s original vision for decentralized identity and data privacy and highlighted our technical infrastructure and framework which put us ahead of the&nbsp;pack.</p> Year Three: Global Integration <p>In Ontology’s third year, our focus was to identify key ways in which we could become a cross-chain powerhouse in the blockchain industry, while also utilizing our ONT ID and data protection features in partnership with other leading companies. From a technical standpoint, we kicked off our third year with the launch of ONT FS, as well as our Blockchain SaaS Framework. Moving into 2020, our technical progress was demonstrated by the launch of Ontology Layer 2.0 — which included the launch of a brand new <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-wasm-jit-released-a-leading-smart-contract-virtual-machine-with-high-speed-and-519783fe5055">Wasm-JIT</a>, which provides high speed performance at low storage costs. Its launch was paired with the ONT ID 2.0 upgrade, which combines users’ decentralized identity with their ONTO wallet with one single login, while providing a framework that helps users control their identity and data. This further strengthened our position as a market leader in ensuring user privacy and data protection; a position reflected by the vast amount of external partnerships and media mentions we have achieved in our third year from leading outlets such as CoinDesk and Cointelegraph — the latter of which we are officially listed in as an Enterprise Solution Provider under their new consulting arm. We introduced a new governance and staking model in July, affecting both ONT and ONG, equipped with a <a href="https://node.ont.io/calculator/node">node and yield calculator</a> allowing users to easily estimate how much they can potentially earn from staking through ONTO. The launch of the <a href="https://www.poly.network/">Poly Network</a> in partnership with Neo and Switcheo enabled the support of cross-chain assets on Ontology. This allowed us to focus even more on providing decentralized identity solutions across different chains. It also enabled us to list ONT and ONG on Uniswap towards the end of the summer. With the turn of the leaves into Fall, we deployed our cross-chain DeID solution on Ethereum, Near, Neo, TRON, Klaytn, Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot. We partnered with Patract Labs late in November to accelerate smart contract ecosystem development on the back of our technical prowess.</p><p>As our third year draws to a close, we have been focused heavily on decentralized finance, otherwise known as DeFi. In September of 2020, the Ontology core team launched <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing.Finance</a>, a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi lending platform. Not only has Wing seen significant growth and engagement in its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with over ten governance votes passed already, but it is also primed to be the first ever DeFi platform to incorporate credit-based lending through Ontology’s unique OScore credit scoring solution. The Wing Inclusive Pool will allow users to under-collateralize assets and lower their interest rates. The Inclusive Pool is the first lending pool of its kind in the DeFi space, as well as the broader blockchain space as a whole. Not only is this incredibly exciting for Wing, but it will serve as an incredible opportunity for the demand of OScore as&nbsp;well.</p> Moving Forward. <p>We have accomplished a lot in our first three years. We tend to overestimate what we can accomplish in one day, but underestimate what we can accomplish in a year. So with that in mind, we want to ensure our community that we are adamantly and tirelessly working towards making the next three years even more successful than the last three years. Specifically, we continue to develop our core features such as ONT ID and OScore, we will seek more partnerships and collaborations with both public-chains and offline enterprises in an attempt to integrate Ontology’s technology and our underlying belief system. We will use Wing as a foundation to demonstrate how credit-based lending can catapult DeFi into the next era; an era of credit backed by&nbsp;OScore.</p><p>Still, throughout it all, we will focus first and foremost on the original vision laid out by our Founder, Li Jun — a vision of complete identity decentralization designed to protect users’ data and grant them the access, control, and autonomy that we believe every user deserves.</p><p>Thank you.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/3-years-in-the-blink-of-an-eye-the-ontology-story-so-far-e2b1298f89f4">3 Years In The Blink Of An Eye: The Ontology Story So Far</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Bitcoinist: Blockchain software development firm Jelurida is set to launch an on-chain version of the bridge, the strategy card game. The platform will be called Bridge Champ and will enable anyone to set up their own white-label bridge gaming environment. The game leverages the benefits of blockchain, including in-game tokens and cheat prevention. Players will be able to “mine” bridge tokens based on “proof of play” and their achievements record, which is also stored securely on the Ignis blockchain. Online bridge was already popular among the millions of bridge players worldwide. However, since the coronavirus pandemic has restricted social opportunities, online bridge has proliferated to the point where the American Contract Bridge League reported it had seen a fivefold increase in usage by June 2020. For the benefit of the uninitiated, bridge is sometimes referred to as the “chess of card games” due to its complexity and sophisticated gameplay.</p>

 Suomi.fi customer test environment patch is now available. 
<p>As we previously announced:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On 4.9.2020 Suomi.fi announced that the algorithms used in Suomi.fi authentication would be updated to harmonise security and protections to SAML2 authentications to be in line with Traficom’s SAML2 profile recommendations. Initially on 15.10.2020 these changes were applied to the Suomi.fi customer test environment. Then towards the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 the changes will be applied to the Suomi.fi production environment. Please find the original announcement from Suomi.fi&nbsp;<a href="https://palveluhallinta.suomi.fi/en/ajankohtaista/uutiset/5f51e6b9fc2bb907bbb64186">here</a>.”</p></blockquote>
 Resolution 
<p>This patch release permits the continued use of your integrated applications with the Suomi.fi customer test environment. Detailed information about the changes in this release can be found in&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20191/Identity+Server+2019.1+Release+Notes#IdentityServer2019.1ReleaseNotes-SSO8.4.2">SSO 8.4.2 change log</a>.</p>
<p>SSO 8.4.2 can be found in the following location:&nbsp;<a href="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/">https://downloads.ubisecure.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 SSO 8.3.9 – status 
<p>In our original <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/technical-announcements/suomi-fi-saml2-algorithms-are-changing/">announcement</a> in September we offered an estimate release date for the then supported versions of SSO.&nbsp; While we encourage all customers to update their installed applications regularly, we recognise that this is not always possible.&nbsp; At this time SSO 8.3.x is no longer supported, see our <a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/KNB/Supported+versions">Supported Versions</a> table, that said, if you require this patch for your SSO 8.3.x environment, we ask that you please open a ticket with <a href="https://support.ubisecure.com/service-desk/">Support</a> or contact your Account Manager.&nbsp; We will work with you to ensure your environment remains functional with Suomi.fi until such time that you can upgrade to a supported version of SSO.</p>

<p>Munich, November 26th, 2020 – IDnow (www.idnow.io), a leading provider for Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions, publishes the latest figures on changes in fraud methods within the digital environment in its “Cyber Security Report 2020”. The company sees a strong increase of 250% in fraud attempts. Technology and security systems remain ahead of the new trends.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, IDnow sees a general increase in the demand for digital services and processes. With this development, however, digital fraud methods have also changed and, in addition to new scams, show a dramatic increase over the year.</p>
<p>Between March and June, when many countries ordered a lockdown and processes had to move to the digital environment, IDnow saw new developments in identity fraud: Cases of Similarity Fraud increased by 231 percent during this period, Fake-ID fraud rose by 180 percent and Social Engineering attacks by 75 percent.</p>
<p>The fraud methods themselves also show new tricks that are adapted to the current pandemic situation. IDnow saw new cases, especially in social engineering: fraudsters use, for example, applications for government aid programs or, in the context of increased unemployment, false job advertisements as a lure.</p>
<p>“In the past few months, our security system has seen a sharp increase in fraud attempts and numerous new methods against which we protect our customers. We have invested in a comprehensive concept and early indicator detection to stay one step ahead of the fraudsters,” says Armin Bauer, co-founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow. “In addition to technical warning systems, we have set up an anti-fraud team here to do research in Darknet, test fake ads ourselves and exchange information with victims to study the exact approach of the fraudsters. In this way we can detect and avoid attempts of attacks at an early stage.”</p>
<p>Despite the new methods and an increase in fraud attempts, IDnow is pleased to report a constant False Acceptance Rate (FAR) compared to last year.</p>

<p>Ashton Addison&nbsp;speaks with Lior Yaffe, a long term Blockchain developer and founder of the Nxt, Ignis, and Ardor Blockchains. Ardor is a multichain blockchain platform with a unique parent - child chain architecture. The security of the whole network is provided by the parent Ardor chain while the interoperable child chains have all the rich functionality. We focus our discussion on the unique properties of the Ardor Blockchain, and the Ignis child chain, including discussions on scalability, decentralization, and security. We also discuss Ethereum’s Smart Contracts verse Ardor’s Lightweight contracts and how they differ.</p>

  <p>When COVID-19 caused a sudden and dramatic increase in the number of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ask-these-questions-before-deploying-remote-access-technology/">remote workers</a>, cloud offerings delivered on their promise of scaling to support business imperatives — including business continuity and disaster recovery and ensuring the availability of key workloads in the midst of change.</p>
<p>In fact, the pandemic and its subsequent business impacts continue to showcase the many benefits of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cloud-shift-impacts-all-it-markets/">cloud </a>services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cloud adoption will continue to accelerate as key workloads are needed to support remote workers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“By 2022, 75% of organizations that implemented work-from-home policies for their workforce during COVID-19 will retain the remote working options for their employees,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/41344">Ed Anderson</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/apac/symposium-india">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>. “Cloud adoption will continue to accelerate as key workloads are needed to support remote workers and maintain data center operations.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>In a post-pandemic world, there is opportunity to move key workloads to the cloud for the benefits it offers today and to prepare for the next unforeseen disruption.</p>
<p>Organizations of all types should prioritize<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-actions-from-gartner-hype-cycle-for-cloud-security-2020/"> public cloud environments</a> to host critical workloads, including seven key workloads that should be moved to cloud now.</p>
 No. 1: Mobility 
<p>Mobile devices and applications, including access to organizations’ key services and data, are indispensable to remote working. The demand variability related to mobile services is well-aligned with the adaptive cloud operating model, which makes cloud an ideal back end for supporting mobile solutions.</p>
<p>“Select a hyperscale cloud partner that offers robust capabilities in supporting mobile applications,” Anderson said.</p>
<p>Explore the full capabilities of the hosting cloud platform, including the incorporation of cloud-native technology implementations and operating models.</p>
 No. 2: Collaboration and content management 
<p>Microsoft Office 365, iWork and Google G Suite are just three examples of enterprise applications that facilitate <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-distributed-cloud/">collaboration</a>. The success of these applications is a testament to how well-suited cloud-based collaboration is for cloud delivery because of its broad, horizontal applicability to most organizations. Cloud-based collaboration also enables more remote access, and meets resiliency requirements.</p>
<p>In some instances, a complete shift of content management to cloud may not be feasible because of legal and governance concerns, but these are still the exceptions and not the norm.</p>
 No. 3: Videoconferencing 
<p>For remote workers around the world, videoconferencing is one of the most important tools. When COVID-19 hit, the demand for videoconferencing technology doubled and, in some markets, tripled. The highly variable usage patterns and the immense demand for networking bandwidth make hyperscale cloud providers well-suited to reliably deliver videoconferencing solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz05ZDc3MWIzODJhN2QxMWViYjQ1ZDlmNGE0OGE3MTgzZg=="></a></p>
 No. 4: Virtual desktops and remote workstation management 
<p>A virtual desktop solution, or desktop <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-cloud-providers-to-support-customers-through-covid-19/">virtualization</a>, is a tool used by IT administrators to separate the physical desktop system, including laptops, from the desktop environment and applications used by individuals. This is, in fact, one of the most important aspects of enabling remote working — individuals can access their applications and documents and stay connected from any location.</p>
<p>While often delivered as a data center service, cloud-based desktop virtualization has become mainstream and provides a more stable and scalable control point than traditional data-center-based solutions.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-keys-to-leading-large-scale-virtual-meetings/">3 Keys to Leading Large-Scale Virtual Meetings</a></p>
 No. 5: Scale-out applications 
<p>Scale-out applications are those that benefit from adding additional computing resources to satisfy increases in demand. The demand for scale-out applications has inspired organizations to migrate data center applications to cloud platforms.</p>
<p>The sudden shift in IT operating models has further accelerated this trend. The success of hyperscale cloud environments established a credible business case for cloud platforms and made cloud the preferred environment for hosting applications with variable usage or scale-out requirements.</p>
 No. 6: Disaster recovery 
<p>Gartner predicts that 50% of organizations will increase their budgets for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-trends-impacting-cloud-adoption-in-2020/">cloud-based disaster recovery</a> (DR) solutions by 2023</p>
<p>“The cost-effectiveness of using a pay-per-use environment to support unexpected failover requirements that cloud-based disaster recovery solutions offer is sought after in current times,” Anderson said.</p>
<p>Many solutions and approaches to support cloud-based DR services create not only demand from customers, but also many options for providers. Now is the time to deploy these solutions.</p>
 No. 7: Business continuity solutions 
<p>Business continuity ensures that business processes continue functioning before, during and after a crisis. In 2020, only 12% of respondents said their business operations were continuing as normal as a result of COVID-19, according to a recent Gartner survey.</p>
<p>Redundancies in the cloud operating environment mean that cloud environments are inherently resilient and offer availability guarantees greater than what most private data centers can support.</p>

 The GiD Report #136 — Apple’s App Store concession, Filecoin on the up and&nbsp;up <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-135-why-groups-is-the-future-of-the-internet-4e5d4e9f6007">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Apple cuts App Store&nbsp;fee  Apple v. Facebook on privacy and&nbsp;data  Filecoin is on the up and&nbsp;up  Congress v. Big Tech moderation  Stuff happens   1. Apple made news last week when it announced it would cut its App Store fee to 15 percent for most developers (via&nbsp;Mitja). <p>Objectively speaking, it’s a move that will have minimal impact on its bottom line. Apple makes most of its money from its top users — large companies that will still be paying 30&nbsp;percent.</p><p>As Mitja (<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>)&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>It’s not a big concession either: an estimated 98 percent of developers would be eligible for the 15 percent cut, but those developers generated just 5 percent of the App Store’s total revenue last year. So in total 2.5% out of&nbsp;$50B.</blockquote><p>And so Apple’s detractors will paint this as a PR move. What Apple critics are&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook online summit, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called his company’s effort an act of civil disobedience: “When a contract goes outside the bounds of the law, as Apple is doing, and has such a negative and pervasive impact on society, it’s everybody’s duty to&nbsp;fight.”</blockquote><blockquote>As for Apple’s rate cut, Sweeney said it was “a fantastic change” for many small developers. “Who it’s not awesome for is consumers,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson: “Trying to split the App Store opposition with conditional charity concessions, they — a $2T conglomerate — get to paint any developer making more than $1m as greedy, always wanting more. As clever as it’s&nbsp;sick.”</blockquote><blockquote>Coalition for App Fairness: “Apple’s announcement doesn’t even begin to rectify the abuse and monopoly behavior developers have to endure in the App Store. We need fundamental change.”</blockquote>Photo: Brett&nbsp;Jordan<p>From a more positive perspective: Baby&nbsp;steps.</p><p>It’s notable that Apple is conceding any ground at all — especially for a company that’s historically known to stick to its guns and double down in the face of even intense scrutiny over its product choices and company practices.</p><p>Apple’s in a different situation these days. Once a David to Microsoft’s goliath, Apple is now the 500 lb gorilla and so the underdog attitude isn’t as well received.</p><p>What’s clear is that Tim Cook and co. see this as a long term challenge that isn’t going away anytime&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1a046644-73d2-4df0-9ab3-bf87a1894e54">the&nbsp;FT</a>:</p><blockquote>Apple has for the first time warned investors that it faces a “material” financial risk from the regulatory pressure on its App Store, a sum that could potentially run into billions of dollars. The iPhone maker’s latest annual report, published on Friday, is peppered with new warnings and disclosures about the legal risks rising up around its business in a marked change from last year’s filing, as it was forced to acknowledge the growing political hostility against big tech companies.</blockquote><p>Ultimately, this is neither here nor there for GlobaliD.

In other Apple news, privacy continues to be a point of differentiation — particularly regarding updates to how advertisers can access user data on the iPhone. Here’s the latest. TL;DR: Facebook is not&nbsp;happy. <p>The Information:</p><blockquote>An Apple executive slammed Facebook for having a “disregard for user privacy” after the social media firm criticized ad targeting restrictions coming to the&nbsp;iPhone.</blockquote><blockquote>In an open letter to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other privacy watchdog groups, Apple’s senior director of global privacy, Jane Horvath, said Apple was making it harder for advertisers to track people across iPhone apps because “we simply think tracking should be transparent and under user control.” The coming changes, which Apple delayed in September after Facebook and others pushed back, will require an app to gain consent before using data about a user to inform ad targeting elsewhere.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook has been the most vocal critic of the change, pointing out that Apple’s own apps aren’t subject to the same rules, and arguing that restricting the ability to target will disproportionately impact small businesses that rely on companies like Facebook to reach consumers. In her open letter, Apple’s Horvath said the company doesn’t individually track users for ad targeting or work with third parties to do&nbsp;so.</blockquote><blockquote>“By contrast, Facebook and others have a very different approach to targeting,” she wrote. “Facebook executives have made clear their intent is to collect as much data as possible across both first and third party products to develop and monetize detailed profiles of their users, and this disregard for user privacy continues to expand to include more of their products.”</blockquote><p>Facebook’s response:</p><blockquote>In response, Facebook spokeswoman Ashley Zandy said in a statement that, “the truth is Apple has expanded its business into advertising and through its upcoming iOS 14 changes is trying to move the free internet into paid apps and services where they profit. As a result, they are using their dominant market position to self-preference their own data collection while making it nearly impossible for their competitors to use the same data. They claim it’s about privacy, but it’s about&nbsp;profit.”</blockquote><p>Here’s the thing, Facebook has a point. Apple’s motives around privacy might be genuine, but they’re ultimately also self&nbsp;serving.</p><p>What’s clear though is that the issue of privacy is now structurally making its way into our digital platforms, giving further credence to GlobaliD’s vision around self-sovereign identity.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/19/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit/">State, federal antitrust lawsuits likely to challenge Facebook for buying rivals and weaponizing data</a>  <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">How the U.S. Military Buys Location Data from Ordinary&nbsp;Apps</a>  <p>3. Filecoin is on the up and up since its launch (via&nbsp;Greg).</p><p><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/84121/filecoin-power-lending-block-rewards">The Block</a>:</p><blockquote>The total storage power on Filecoin has grown over 40% since a Chinese miners’ standoff in mid-October, which resulted in an upgrade to the network’s block rewards and a surge in FIL&nbsp;lending.</blockquote><blockquote>Data shows the decentralized storage blockchain, which went live on October 15, has now nearly 850 pebibyte (PiB) of effective storage, compared to 600 PiB seen around October 19 when a majority of Chinese Filecoin miners had either significantly slowed down or completely halted their growth&nbsp;plan</blockquote><p>Filecoin is cool because it’s one of the few big blockchain projects out there that promise real utility. It’s also a testament to totally new approaches to a very traditional problem in data&nbsp;storage.</p> 4. This week in moderation — we had part II of Congress v. Twitter and Facebook. <p>The Information:</p><blockquote>Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee took turns blasting Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey over their companies’ content moderation policies, the second time in less than a month that the two CEOs have testified before hostile lawmakers.</blockquote><blockquote>Democrats and Republicans were critical of the companies’ content policies for opposite reasons. Republicans want less moderation of false statements by President Trump and other sources of misinformation. Democrats want the platforms to do more to block unsubstantiated claims.</blockquote><blockquote>At the heart of the hearing is a debate over the future of Section 230, a provision of the Communications Decency Act which grants broad legal immunity to online companies — protecting them lawsuits over content posted by users. Both Zuckerberg and Dorsey said they would be open to some changes in the&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham also questioned whether the social media offerings were addictive and a threat to public health. Dorsey said one remedy would be to give users greater control over the algorithms that determine what they see online. Zuckerberg said Facebook is not built with the goal of making it addictive to&nbsp;users.</blockquote><p>In other Jack Dorsey-related news, Twitter is also getting into&nbsp;Groups:</p><blockquote>On a call with reporters, Twitter executives said the social network is also testing an audio-only group call feature called Spaces. The feature allows users to invite others to participate in or listen to audio chats — behavior that could lead to high amounts of time spent in the app. Clubhouse and a slew of other audio-based social media startups are working on similar experiences after seeing growing interest during pandemic lockdowns this&nbsp;year.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/senates-tech-ceo-interrogation-shows-parties-are-worlds-apart-822863bd-e007-4a52-8378-298995ef82c7.html">Senate’s tech CEO interrogation shows parties are worlds&nbsp;apart</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMqjvQlCOq4">Matt Stoller: Obama’s HYPOCRISY On Big Tech&nbsp;Warnings</a>   5.

<p>On November 24th, the&nbsp;<a href="http://know.oneworldidentity.com/">KNOW Identity Digital Forum</a> focused on eKYC expansion globally and cross-industry. In partnership with Mastercard, we hosted a candid <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/mastering-ekyc-globally/">discussion</a> on the progress made towards creating eKYC programs that can be implemented at scale and interoperate on a global level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This panel featured Sarah Clark, Senior Vice President, Digital Identity at Mastercard, Jonathon Thorpe, General Manager Digital Identity and myGov at the Digital Transformation Agency within the Australian government, and Lovlesh Chhabra, Managing Director, Head of Product Identity &amp; Access Management at Goldman Sachs. The conversation covered private and public-sector stakeholders’ respective roles and the evolving eKYC needs for both consumers, institutions, and governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Mastering eKYC Globally 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;Setting the stage on eKYC: Why is this important? Where is the landscape right now? Where has there been progress or delays in innovation? Why has it been difficult thus far to establish consistent practices?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard:&nbsp;Those of us in the industry have learned a lot about best practices by focusing on eKYC; it’s critical for every single digital player in the ecosystem, regardless of what your business is, whether you are a financial services provider or a digital commerce provider. You should be doing KYC as a competitive differentiator, and I would say most digital properties are. But how hard or easy it is to get through the process can make or break your relationship with your customer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether people go through the process early in their journey with your brand can be a competitive edge because you can personalize things for them. And ultimately, if your customers choose to buy something from you, you can make the payment more secure by having sound eKYC in place, even if you are in a financial institution. There are many reasons that it’s so important, and there’s been a ton of innovation in the space (like selfie biometrics, liveness, etc.). But by the same token, it’s still filled with friction. There’s so much more potential to make it easier and more pervasive, which is just a win-win for individuals and the security of payments and all digital businesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;Why is Mastercard interested in the identity space?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard:&nbsp;The worlds of digital identity and payments are not as different as you may think. Both fundamentally rely on networks of trust and verification. For more than half a century, Mastercard has worked with partners to develop a model for payments that brings together consumers, merchants, financial institutions, governments, and technology providers. There are clear parallels with our existing areas of expertise and the complex multi-stakeholder orchestration required by a global digital identity service. In payments, the mutual exchange of identity marks the beginning of the interaction between consumer and merchant. According to the World Economic Forum, the framework currently underpinning financial transactions worldwide is the closest thing we have to an interoperable system of authentication and identification. Digital Identity is a natural progression for Mastercard, given its experience here, its focus on financial inclusion, our sensitivity to data privacy, and our commitment to investing in global infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;Global eKYC offers the promise of benefits for institutions and consumers. However, localized data privacy barriers might deter this from being possible. What are your thoughts on establishing a global interoperable eKYC standard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital Transformation Agency:&nbsp;Obviously, KYC has a particular legal connotation with it and, in Australian contexts, compliance with regulations, and it could be to enable a bank account. But it also has much broader benefits. Doing KYC right creates a single view of a customer. If you’ve got that view, then you can create some great experiences. We’re trying to develop excellent service and understand the customer better to deliver those services, regardless of whether they’re public or private. We need to make sure there are some consistent standards in place because otherwise, you can’t achieve things like interoperability. And frankly, consumers don’t know what that is and that they need to. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s more about making sure that if they go through the effort of going through an onboarding process and creating a digital identity, it’s something they can use somewhere else. It’s something they keep and keep using. We do it over time, and we stop asking them the same things over and over again. That’s the opportunity with digital identity and doing KYC right.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs:&nbsp;I believe that the consent frameworks are evolving so that that standard is soon to get formed. Standards are being proposed around consent receipts and users managing consent across a broad set of products. I think that is an important key to unlocking this potential. If you go back in time a number of years ago, social login was the thing; that’s how you onboarded to everything. And we now know where that led us: data leaked in unexpected situations unintentionally, so nobody wants to do that anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What that means is as a user, I need to be fully in control of my data, i.e., of my privacy. If I allow you to share, I should also have equally easy access to disallow that sharing and that sharing should stop at the point when it is disallowed. Doing this digitally, i.e., enabling somebody to share my identity digitally with other businesses, one needs me to consent upfront and then requires me to be able to un-consent very easily. Today, if you attempt to unconsented anywhere, it’s a rabbit hole. It takes forever to figure out how you stop data sharing from party A to party B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;Solving these challenges isn’t just public or private but rather a collaboration between the two. We’ve seen success in Australia – what lessons could be learned or applied to other regions based on this work? How can the public sector resources and initiatives push the private sector towards a preferred digital identity system? How could that collaboration work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital Transformation Agency:&nbsp;The way that we’ve undertaken this journey from an Australian context is essentially creating a framework that has involved 5,000 pieces of feedback from all aspects of the community, industry, and government applying international standards and ensuring that we continuously iterate based on what we’ve learned. We’ve spent four years developing a trust framework. We’re part of a working group with the Australian financial services sector to develop a trust framework to do exactly what we’re describing, make sure it works for this particular use case, and be conscious that success with digital identity is for the whole economy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This needs to be something that works for everyone, regardless of whether they are opening a bank account, applying for a driver’s license, or getting government support. We’ve learned through that journey to iterate the framework based on particular KYC opportunities.&nbsp;We did that recently by introducing additional identity proofing levels to deal with certain AML compliance. Again, listening to feedback from particular sectors has been our success so far. I think it’s also important to understand what can be achieved as well. </p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve undertaken research here, and for us, the key thing was that opt-in is entirely voluntary. Our education piece with the community is about saying digital identity is entirely voluntary in the Australian context, and it just simply makes things easier for you.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;What are the emerging eKYC standards?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard:&nbsp;A collaborative approach is necessary to establish the core of a commercial, operational digital identity infrastructure, and this is particularly important concerning the technology used. Current regulation around privacy and open data provides a supportive framework for effective digital identity services, as does ongoing work at national and regional levels, such as with the European Union’s Electronic Identification Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States, and a number of other bodies. Regulators should ensure that they continue to accommodate the commercial involvement of an innovative private sector. In addition, we welcome the work of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) for distributed identifiers, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for verifiable claims, and the OpenID Foundation in driving open identity standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI:&nbsp;In thinking about what work remains to be done, do we feel the technology is already developed, or is the time more needed developing public-private partnerships? Which is the most pressing gap?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs:&nbsp;You need the critical mass of users to come along for any of these systems to be useful, usable, or meaningful. Secondly, you need a level of regulation or a level of support from regulators at a minimum for somebody to be a partner in this framework. You need the assurance from the regulatory frameworks that this isn’t like a violation of the citizen’s right. Second, I think you need strong support from the government regarding responsibility, almost fiduciary duty that the data or something close enough to that as you make trades in the market. Every broker that is involved, every brokerage account that you have, there is a lot of responsibility that those companies carry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technology is already there; I think we have the technology and the expertise within the industry to pull this off. The holdback is mostly the ability to establish relationships or those coalitions and establish somewhat of a standardization or some kind of open standard or framework for what this sharing could look like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard:&nbsp;One of the key challenges in a digital identity system of any kind is the chicken and egg problem of getting consumers signed up to the service alongside relying parties and others in the ecosystem. A service like this has to provide value to both – and numbers of sign-ups are the key and interoperability so the ID can be used among different relying parties and for other uses. The journey described is feasible – and could work if offered by one party to bring users into the network, registering them and helping verify them on the ID network, which can then be trusted by others. The value from such a scheme would come from its interoperability and ensuring others agree on it as an onboarding mechanism. Otherwise, it’s just going to result in a fancier version of the current system where a company can verify a user just for its systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s Next?

					 <p>Each of these people call the elephant something different because they each have a different perspective. When you think about it, an elephant&nbsp;really&nbsp;is like a big wall with a snake and spears coming out of its face, trees for legs, and a rope-like tail. Without a concise name for the sum of its parts, its meaning can be communicated, although imperfectly, by a description of each part individually¹.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Similarly, there is a new category of technology and business solutions that seeks to solve the proverbial “dog on the internet” identity problem for individuals, organizations, and connected devices. Most often called ‘SSI’ (for ‘self-sovereign identity’) or ‘decentralized identity’, these terms are often used in the same way ‘elephant’ is used—with a wealth of meaning and nuance not apparent to beginners. A review of the different terms used to reference SSI provides a helpful introduction.</p>

					 <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a movement that claims digital identity should be just as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation. SSI is the combination of decentralized identity and trust over IP (both defined below) but also encompasses other technologies and business solutions to enable its purpose. ‘Self-sovereign identity’ was the first category-defining term to catch on, and therefore the most widely used today. But the first terms to catch on are not always the best nor the longest-lasting; groups at industry conferences² have even convened to try to come up with an alternative to ‘SSI’, to no avail.&nbsp;<a href="http://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>&nbsp;is a nonprofit that champions this name with its mission “identity for all”.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many governments, actual sovereigns (noun), strongly dislike the term ‘sovereign’ (adjective). Businesses seeking to sell SSI solutions to governments often steer clear as well. While the name ‘SSI’ does a good job at describing the human application and aspiration of decentralized identity technologies, it isn’t clear to most people how B2B and IoT use cases fit in this framework. Finally, I’ve&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-ssi/">spoken before</a>&nbsp;about how the term is too tightly associated with the blockchain world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the problems associated with the word ‘sovereign’ could go away if ‘SSI’ becomes the de facto term as I’m using it throughout this post. As identity expert Drummond Reed frequently points out, we use acronyms every day whose full names we don’t know — ATM, SMS, HTTP, ROTC, AIDS, OTC, FAQ or even GEICO or AT&amp;T, for example (if you knew the full names for all of those, kudos ).</p>

					 <p>‘Decentralized identity’ is the second most-used term to describe the category. Decentralized identity’s emphasis is much more technical in nature and seems to focus on traditional IAM use cases.&nbsp;<a href="http://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>&nbsp;(DIF) is the primary industry association &amp; standards body championing this term.<br><br></p><p>The word ‘decentralized’ can feel a bit vague because it describes what SSI is&nbsp;not (i.e., not centralized) but doesn’t explain what it is. For that reason, one needs to explain the benefits of decentralization separately:<br><br></p>  Locus of control: Accessing data from centralized databases, as occurs with other identity tech, requires access and permission from the database administrator—not necessarily consent from the subject of the data. Thus, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/software-vendor-says-data-breach-exposed-nearly-28-million-texas-drivers-license-records/ar-BB1b022l">data breaches</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dmv-drivers-license-data-database-integrity-department-motor-vehicles-1458141">misuse of data</a>&nbsp;have led to people demanding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/01/21/we-need-to-own-our-data-as-a-human-right-and-be-compensated-for-it">ownership of their data</a>. With SSI, the data subject is the one with control to consent to sharing of their data.  Autonomy: As companies die and policies change, it’s helpful to avoid single points of failure. SSI wallets are transportable between different vendors, avoiding vendor lock-in. More on autonomy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">here</a>&nbsp;and wallet portability&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">here</a>.  Public key infrastructure (PKI): Much of SSI hinges on public/private key cryptography. Trust in traditional PKI systems is rooted in certificate authorities. Identifiers are rented out by ICANN via the DNS system—a costly and centralized approach to PKI. Blockchains and other technologies enable decentralized PKI upon which SSI can be built.  <p><br>On one hand, ‘decentralized identity’ doesn’t capture the ideals of autonomy and existence that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">this blog post</a> and much of the industry appreciates about the term ‘self-sovereign’. On the other hand, organizations and connected devices don’t have their own autonomy—they must be controlled by people—so ‘decentralized identity’ may be a better fit for those use cases. In addition, while SSI decentralizes power&nbsp;associated with identity, it&nbsp;centralizes&nbsp;the storage and access to it (in a digital wallet instead of various databases across the web), which may make ‘decentralized’ a confusing word from a user experience perspective.</p>

					 <p>Trust over IP (ToIP) is the newest term used to describe the category. It’s less focused on the traditional authentication/access management/directory services definition of digital identity and more focused on trustable data/credentials. This is a more attractive term than ‘sovereign’ for governments; John Jordan, ED of Trust Services for the government of British Columbia, coined the term and is the current leader of the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a>, which focuses on building governance frameworks for trust ecosystems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like ‘Voice over IP’ (VoIP) standardized a way to securely relay audio over the internet, so too does ‘Trust over IP’ seek to standardize a way to share trustable data over the internet. But the word ‘trust’ is fraught with baggage in today’s society and has caused pushback from the identity community and beyond. It’s too early to tell whether the term ‘ToIP’ will catch on more broadly and how the market will react.</p>

					 <p>In addition to the category-defining names above, you may hear this technology referred to in a number of other, more niche ways. Like the elephant example I opened this post with, each of the following names refers to a specific characteristic of SSI which, taken together, give us a more complete picture.</p>

					 <p>SSI enables data portability, which has led to it sometimes being called ‘portable identity’. Portable comes from the Latin&nbsp;portare&nbsp;meaning carry, which is also behind the word&nbsp;transport&nbsp;or&nbsp;port. It really means that you can take something from one place or context to another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our real-world identity is portable. I can take my driver’s license from the DMV and the context of public roadways to the financial sector and get access to banking services. I can take my university transcript from the education domain to an employer to show my qualifications for a job. SSI makes this possible online. Issuers of credentials, in my experience, feel this dynamic most strongly; after all, anything they issue can be taken and shared with other parties by the holder if they so choose.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Multi-source identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>My physical, leather wallet has several credentials inside from a number of different sources. The SSI wallet on my phone is the same way; any number of organizations can issue credentials to it. I can then share information from any combination of them to prove things about myself; thus the identity I’m presenting can be comprised of multiple sources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its strengths, multi-source identity falls short of describing some of the other important properties of SSI. For example, a Facebook Wallet or other proprietary, centralized system could be used as the basis for a multi-source identity system that provides virtually no autonomy or control to the end-user³. For more on how ‘multi-source’ relates to ‘self-sovereign’, check out a great blog post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">here</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Self-managed credentials
 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>While ‘multi-source’ describes how credentials get into a wallet, ‘self-managed’ alludes to how credentials are controlled, stored, and shared. This shouldn’t imply that each end-user&nbsp;must hold their own keys or worry about storing their credentials locally—they could theoretically contract that out to a vendor or configure some AI to assist—but it does mean that the end-user is the one in the driver’s seat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may see ‘self-owned identity’ used instead of ‘self-managed’, but you won’t see that from me or most of my peers. Although many of the implications of ‘self-owned’ (possession, control, accountability) are common with ‘self-managed’ or ‘self-controlled’, the legal construct of ‘ownership’ (property rights, right to sell, exclusivity, etc) is a dangerous one in relation to identity⁴. Because of these nuances, ‘self-managed’ and its variations aren’t widely used.</p>

					 <p>The term ‘user-controlled proofs’ is a yet unadopted term coined by Kim Cameron, author of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">“The Laws of Digital Identity”</a>, seeking to be a bit more technically accurate than terms like ‘self-sovereign’. Indeed, in an SSI model, people not only collect credentials from multiple sources, but also share information from those credentials in the form of a ‘proof’. Those proofs can be verified independently, virtually, and instantly by anyone they’re shared with. While a verifier can specify&nbsp;their&nbsp;requirements in a request to a user, the user has control of whether and how they respond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>User-controlled proofs is a good term to describe the holder’s perspective of the interaction they have with the verifier. However it’s quite technical and would likely face adoption challenges when presented to the average identity holder⁵.</p>

					 <p>Recently coined by&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/less-identity-65f65d87f56b">Tim Bouma</a>, Legally-enabled Self-sovereign (LESS) Identity&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/can-less-be-more/">stands in contrast</a>&nbsp;to the ‘crypto-anarchist’ notion of a trustless self-sovereign identity⁶. LESS implies that the identity presented to a verifier is backed by a legal framework. Perhaps it’s a credential issued by a government or regulated institution. Or maybe there’s an existing legal framework that’s represented with a credential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LESS enables verifiers to build trust beyond just the cryptographic assurance of a credential’s validity. Much of the work of the ToIP Foundation on governance frameworks is seeking to reinforce this notion. All of the projects I’m aware of with real traction are LESS Identity.</p>

					 <p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">Trinsic’s introductory SSI post</a>, I explain how real-world human identity is the combination of intrinsic (Who am I? How do I identify myself?)&nbsp;and&nbsp;extrinsic (How does the state identify me? What does my university say that I have achieved?) factors. Because that’s how the real-world works, I&nbsp;love&nbsp;the name ‘life-like identity’ to describe SSI. To drive the point home, continue that logical train of thought to ‘login with Google’. Wouldn’t it be weird if instead of buying from a store directly, there was a Google representative at every register who authenticated you and mediated the transaction? Especially if they were also recording everything you say and do and sending it back to their boss to be reviewed and analyzed. That would never fly in the real world. And I don’t think it’ll be the norm online anymore in 10 years either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Life-like identity is unfortunately not widely-used, but in many ways, it is a good umbrella term for everything else we’ve talked about in this post. This is really what we’re trying to create with this technology; solutions that respect human dignity in the interactions they have daily, just like exist in person. For more on this term, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">this post</a>.</p>

					 <p>‘Self-sovereign identity’ is an imperfect name for an imperfect, but rapidly growing and promising new category of technology and business solutions. I think it’s the best term on the table; but ultimately, the way to refer to the category will be defined over time as the dust settles through real-world deployments. The name that will emerge will likely not be the first one, but the one with the least negative baggage that balances being specific to the technology but broad enough to encompass all its variations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Taken collectively, each of the names listed in this post overlap with others in interesting ways, creating a more full picture of SSI. For example, could you have SSI without multi-source identity? Or without user-controlled proofs? Could this system ever work unless it was legally-enabled? And if we succeed at adopting SSI ubiquitously but it doesn’t bring more autonomy and dignity to our interactions online as we do in real life, did we really succeed?</p>

					   The elephant example is fun, but this phenomenon isn’t just found in cartoons; examples are also found throughout the world. Look at religions for example. The central figure of Christianity is called a variety of names in the Bible, including Savior, Son of God, Shepherd, Messiah, and more. These names each communicate different aspects of the meaning assigned to the 5-letter word ‘Jesus’. In Islam, God is believed to have&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Islam">99 names</a>.  <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">IIW 30</a>, book of proceedings, page 275 for notes on the discussion  Of course, Facebook could also build a wallet that supported individual privacy and autonomy if they wanted to! They’re just the boogyman for this example.  I own my car, so I can legally sell it (or parts of it) or rent it out in exchange for money. Can I sell my identity? Or rent out my driver’s license? No, I can’t. Nor should I be able to; identity and personal data are not property to be bargained with, but an intrinsic part of the self. Bodily autonomy is a closer metaphor for credentials than property ownership. Can you legally chop off and sell your arm? No, but you still generally have autonomy to act of your own volition with regard to your own body. So you don’t&nbsp;own your body; you use it, control it, etc.—likewise for your identity. For a better analysis on this, see <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/06/26/why-data-ownership-is-the-wrong-approach-to-protecting-privacy/">here</a>.  One objection some people take to this term is the word ‘user’ which is seen in some circles as objectifying or dehumanizing. “Only two industries have users, drugs and tech,” so the saying goes. On the other hand, I’m&nbsp;using&nbsp;a keyboard to type this sentence. I’m also&nbsp;using&nbsp;an operating system and&nbsp;using&nbsp;a word processor application. So I don’t mind referring to people who use SSI and/or digital wallet products as ‘users’. So although this name hasn’t caught on, I really like it.  In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzM_Brpk95E&amp;t=2352s">talk early this year</a>, Christopher Allen urges the community to keep the trustless identity in mind to keep in mind for more vulnerable populations who are disenfranchised by the legal regimes of which they’re a part.

<p>JK, that’s not what this post is about. </p>
      
<p>Actually that’s the title of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/we-cant-get-rid-of-passwords/">an article written in 2016</a>. </p>
      
<p>I enjoy reading stories like these. They remind us and reinforce just how far passwordless technology has come. We can’t knock the author for claiming that the world can’t get rid of passwords. Just think about the general mindset at the time. Password-based login was all the world really knew… Apple hadn’t even launched Face ID yet. Most people were still wary of using biometrics in general. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/fido2-web-authentication/">Was FIDO2 even a thing</a>?</p>
      
<p>2016 was a very different time. And despite the pessimistic tone, ZDNet managed to get a lot right. A few interesting things stand out from this piece.</p>
      
  
      
<p></p>
      
 No Mention of FIDO Authentication Standards 
      
<p>This is a key piece missing from the <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/puzzles">passwordless puzzle</a>. 2016 was still early for the passwordless movement and there were very few companies that had deployed FIDO authentication at scale. People were still exploring alternative approaches such as <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/standard/2410-2019.html">BOPS</a> and <a href="https://www.hypr.com/multiparty-computation-mpc/">MPC</a>. It wouldn’t be until 2018 when FIDO2 and WebAuthn became adopted as W3C standards. That’s when the world realized FIDO would usher in a global movement away from passwords.</p>
      
<p>Today FIDO standards are powering strong authentication for millions of users across billions of devices. Apple has introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301509/apple-safari-14-browser-face-touch-id-logins-webauthn-fido2">WebAuthn</a> into the iOS ecosystem. Android has embedded FIDO2 at the device <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/news-your-google-android-7-phone-is-now-a-fido2-security-key/">level</a>. The FIDO Alliance now boasts hundreds of members consisting of industry leaders such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and many more enterprises going passwordless.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Biometrics Were Not Meant to Replace Passwords 
      
<p>The article mentions that “In theory, you should be able to use your fingerprint or face or iris or something else like that to log in to third parties, and some of this has become realistic with Apple’s Touch ID and Windows Hello, but there are a lot of different potential biometrics and they’re available on different platforms and it will be a very long time before a user could use biometrics to the exclusion of passwords.”</p>
      
<p>This is spot on. At the time it was unclear (to most people) how biometrics were supposed to replace passwords. Some folks even thought that by simply activating Touch ID they had magically become “passwordless.” </p>
      
<p>It was unclear that mobile biometrics were primarily a passwordless user experience feature that would need to be married with open standards to actually eliminate passwords. We outlined this in our 2016 paper, introducing the world to <a href="https://get.hypr.com/true-password-less-security-white-paper">True Passwordless Security</a>. It has been a thrill to see this vision come to life as many organizations today are following this trend of combining Touch/Face ID with open standards and Public-Key Encryption.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Over-Analyzing the Role of SAML, OAuth, and OIDC 
      
<p>The article spends some time rationalizing the role of these standards for passwordless authentication. This thought process isn’t misguided, it just isn’t what these standards were meant to accomplish.</p>
      
<p>It’s true that since the widespread adoption of Single Sign On (SSO) standards such as SAML and OAuth/OIDC, the authentication industry successfully reduced the number of passwords people need to remember. Unfortunately, the popular Identity Provider (IdP) platforms have built their entire product lines on top of the password. We explore this concept in our white paper on <a href="https://get.hypr.com/decoupling-authentication-from-identity">Decoupling Authentication from Identity</a>.</p>
      
<p>The article is correct in scrutinizing the role of these standards, stopping just short of saying that authorization is NOT authentication. While it gets these ideas right conceptually, it fails to acknowledge the existence of strong authentication standards such as FIDO. We shouldn’t fault ZDNet for not “predicting the future” correctly — it’s just interesting to see how at the time the conversation was all about identity and not authentication. </p>
      
<p></p>
      
 There Were No Proof Points 
      
<p>Let’s be real about this. At the time there were no major <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/success-stories/">case studies of passwordless deployments</a>. Even HYPR was just rolling out at some of our earliest customers. Fast forward to 2020 and we have Microsoft proclaiming more than 150 Million people use passwordless login on Windows every month. That’s not even counting the billions of Android users with embedded biometrics, FIDO2 enabled devices, or the many iOS users who are using passwordless authentication every day. An Apple stat from <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/04/19/average-iphone-user-unlocks-device-80-times-per-day-89-use-touch-id-apple-says">2016</a> suggested people use Touch ID more than 80 times a day. That number is probably even higher today. </p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Calling Password Managers “a Hack” 
      
<p>The article gets this right in that it doesn’t suggest password managers will solve the password problem — only that they are a good enough band-aid for now. That is rapidly changing with some of the younger generations getting less and less exposure to the password manager. Just this summer we ran a study on password manager usage among millennials — with some <a href="https://www.hypr.com/study-password-manager-usage-millennials/">surprising results</a>. </p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Underestimating the User Experience 
      
<p>This is the only major flaw in the article that needs to be pointed out. The piece doesn’t mention User Experience (UX) at all. Not once. That’s not their fault as the common misconception at the time was that passwordless was purely a security initiative. </p>
      
<p>In reality it is the improved UX of password elimination is what has been driving its adoption and innovation. People want a faster and easier login. They want a consistent experience. They want to be extra secure without having to actually do anything extra. The reality is that the elimination of passwords has more to do with people’s desire for a better login and less to do with the actual security benefit. We can’t fault anyone in 2016 for missing this point, as it isn’t terribly obvious to everyone in 2020 either.</p>
      
<blockquote><p>So no, I don’t have a happy ending for you. I see password proliferation, password confusion and password breaches in our future as far as the eye can see. The best solution for now is a password manager, hack though it may be.</p>-ZDNet</blockquote>
      
<p>The article ends with this.</p>
      
<p>A lot can change in 4 years.</p>

 Polkadot’s ecosystem project, Patract Labs, will benefit from Ontology’s security and data management expertise <p>Ontology, the high performance, open-source blockchain specializing in digital identity and data, has announced a new collaboration with the <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> Ecosystem Project, a sharded blockchain that seamlessly connects multiple chains together in a single network. The joint venture will see Ontology develop the underlying infrastructure for <a href="https://patractlabs.com/">Patract Labs</a>, a developer of solutions for Polkadot’s Parachain Contract Ecosystem. Today’s announcement is the latest step in Ontology’s ongoing mission to build a parachain on Polkadot.</p><p>Commenting on the partnership, Li Jun, Founder of Ontology said, “The smart contract ecosystem is experiencing exponential growth — a boom that needs to be balanced with the development of comprehensive security solutions and high levels of performance in order to ensure its future success. As a result, we are proud to partner with Patract Labs to provide cutting-edge software to ensure that these requirements are met. In choosing to partner with Ontology, Patract Labs will not only benefit from our industry-renowned blockchain technology, but also from Ontology’s expertise in ensuring the highest level of security, scrupulous verification methods, and trusted data management technology. This especially applies to a Decentralized Identity (DeID) perspective. We look forward to working with Polkadot and the Patract Labs team to develop an industry-leading smart contract ecosystem.”</p><p>Patract Labs, which provides developer tools and builds solutions to grow the Polkadot Wasm-JIT smart contract ecosystem, was <a href="https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1306632441449394182?s=20">recently announced</a> as one of the first infrastructures to be funded by the Polkadot Treasury. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by Ontology and Patract Labs will see Ontology provide the Polkadot ecosystem with its underlying blockchain infrastructure Wasm-JIT, the smart contract virtual machine with high speed and performance developed in house by the company. Ontology will also help Patract Labs to integrate this Wasm-JIT technology into its Patract Network based on the existing FRAME Contracts provided by the W3F and Parity, to ensure successful technical development and implementation. Finally, Patract Labs will support Ontology in developing and deploying a transfer bridge pallet on the Patract&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Lipeng Yue, Founder of Patract Labs, said, “Joining forces with Ontology is a seminal development for Patract Labs. The technology and expertise Ontology can provide us with, in addition to the immeasurable help offered to us by Polkadot, will ensure our position as a highly competitive disruptor in the realm of smart contract solutions. We look forward to supporting Ontology in their business development efforts and building a comprehensive smart contract ecosystem with some of the best in the&nbsp;field.”</p> About Patract&nbsp;Labs <p><a href="https://patractlabs.com/">Patract Labs</a> provides solutions for Polkadot’s Parachain Contract ecosystem, provides developers with free development tools and services, supports smart contract parachains within Polkadot’s public blockchain network and the enterprise smart contract consortium blockchain based on Polkadot technology, and will also establish an ecological fund to promote the further prosperity of the Polkadot contract ecosystem.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-and-patract-labs-join-forces-to-accelerate-smart-contract-ecosystem-development-988de9978b9b">Ontology And Patract Labs Join Forces To Accelerate Smart Contract Ecosystem Development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A discussion with Markus Perdrizat, CEO of Swiss Crypto Vault and Head Custody at Bitcoin&nbsp;Suisse <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perdrizat/?originalSubdomain=ch">Markus Perdrizat</a>, CEO of <a href="https://swisscryptovault.ch/">Swiss Crypto Vault</a> and Head Custody at <a href="https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/">Bitcoin Suisse</a>, we learn about his long career in security, the importance of standards and his vision for Web3&nbsp;custody.</p> Markus, please introduce yourself and tell us about what you&nbsp;do. <p>Markus Perdrizat: I am the CEO of Swiss Crypto Vault and Head Custody at Bitcoin Suisse, responsible for more than $1B USD worth of crypto assets in highly secured custody for crypto assets. Prior to that, I was leading PwC’s Blockchain Competence Centre in Switzerland. We helped grow that over four years to help clients build secure custody and trading desks and also audit trading desks, brokerage and custody for our audit clients. At the beginning of my career, I was working at a major Swiss bank responsible for decentralized databases and data management. So I understand the challenges of having a distributed database around the globe — and what it means to provide secure, safe and high performance access to&nbsp;data.</p> What would you say was the biggest challenge in your career until&nbsp;now? <p>Markus: It’s about helping users, including professional users, understand the key properties of the system. Especially in the blockchain space, when can professional companies start using blockchain as a reliable store of financial assets or as a processing layer? How do you assess the quality of a project team working on a technology stack?</p><p>And that’s all saying that we spent a lot of time on both at PwC, but obviously also now at Bitcoin Suisse. We help our clients as a pathfinder make sense of what’s going on in decentralized finance and when it is the right time to make use of all these modern and new ways of transacting on the blockchain.</p> Decentralization versus centralization for data -, cyber — and crypto security. What’s your take on&nbsp;this? <p>Markus: What we see now is a changing society where people and commercial entities are becoming more decentralized, working from home around the globe, being more focused on the individual.And that is a change from the past, where it was more about society, family and corporate entities. This changing society also requires a change in technology and blockchain is very well positioned to support this change. And that’s why now for the last 12 years, we’ve all been talking about Bitcoin and blockchain and bringing more of the workloads into blockchain. However, we’re still at a very early stage and there are many very interesting projects out there, including Ocean.</p><p>There is a challenge in ramping up the workload that’s going into blockchain. And here we comeback to the biggest challenge I mentioned earlier, knowing where these blockchain projects are and are they ready to take on serious workloads. At the beginning, everybody will just dip their toe into these new projects, put in some tiny workload, run proofs-of-concept.</p><p>As the technologies mature, as the marketplace becomes bigger, as the security stacks or the security cracks get more experienced and build solutions up to years and tens of years, decades, trust will become&nbsp;bigger.</p><p>We see that the same shift has happened in the old world prior to blockchain, when the Internet first came on. IP-based communication started about 50 years ago. And it has taken 30 years to really come to the point where people know and trust running workloads over the Internet. And it has taken another 20 years for cloud computing to run computer workloads and storage in a more decentralized way over the Internet. And it is going to take blockchain-based computing and data processing a similar amount of time from the inception of having the first ideas about business models on top of blockchain to actually being a reliable and trusted provider of data and computing capacity.</p> What’s the main advantage of decentralization? <p>Markus: It’s obviously supporting changes in society, the shift in society that I mentioned. The main advantage of decentralization is that each participant in the decentralized economy is able to participate in exactly the way that they would like to participate. As a single person, I have a different use case, different access pattern, different requirements from a corporate entity and a small corporate entity has different use cases from a large corporate entity. And I can contribute and participate in exactly the way that fits me personally without any dependencies on&nbsp;others.</p> What’s your vision for changing custody requirements for&nbsp;Web3? <p>Markus: We’ve all been working as an industry in securing users’ private keys since the inception of Bitcoin, and this has been relying in turn on technology and processes that have been out there for a longer time, public infrastructures, hardware, security&nbsp;modules.</p><p>This is all known and familiar, but it’s also very static. When we secure a private key, when we take it offline — then the assets that are accessible through the private key are static and cannot change because of the way it’s protected. With Web3, this has to become a lot more dynamic. People have an expectation that when they own assets, with a blockchain protected by a private key, they can still participate in the economy on that blockchain.</p><p>We’ve enabled that with Staking in the Bitcoin Suisse Vault as a first step. We have Tezos staking on there and will support many more currencies with staking. With Web3, we have a large push into DeFi. Everybody’s crazy about DeFi right now. But how do you participate in DeFi with these smart contracts? That requires a bridging layer from the security of the vault to the agility of the decentralized economy. And as we move into Ocean’s value proposition, obviously, people need to be able to participate in the economy, the marketplace, the storage of their assets in real time. This means keys need to be available to sign transactions when needed, and they need to be protected from within the security of the&nbsp;vault.</p><p>So that’s bringing a challenge to us as a custody provider; that we need to provide top notch security, keeping the users’ private keys secure and offline at all times and at the same time give them the ability to sign transactions to participate in the marketplace in real time. We’re working hard, we’re putting a lot of resources into enabling that from a technology perspective. And we also work on assessing which of the projects are safe and secure and mature enough, so that we know that our clients can safely participate in these decentralized economies.</p> Can you elaborate on technical excellence for industrial and enterprise systems? <p>Markus: That’s really going back to the first part of my career in banking, and industrial systems have similar requirements. Here, it’s very important to have a long term stability and support period when a financial company or an industrial company is researching new technologies and looking to bring in new technology or products into their technology stack. They are obviously assessing the technical capabilities, they’re assessing the security of the system, but also assessing the long-term viability and stability of the platform.</p><p>When these companies build an application or an infrastructure in their environment, then there’s an expectation that typically it has to be there for three, five or even 10 plus more years. This means that having a proper track record and having a team that is able to guarantee stability is important because these kinds of companies would like to avoid having to spend immense amounts of money to just keep applications running.</p><p>They would like to focus their IT development efforts on actually writing new applications and supporting new business initiatives instead of keeping the old ones running. If the underlying infrastructure from hard operating systems and including blockchain based, decentralized infrastructures in the future is changing too frequently- or if the APIs change, if the economy changes, if the way they participate as a node changes then it always needs an update on their end, and this can be quite difficult. They can go through massive change management processes that are expensive, and they would like to avoid that as much as possible.</p><p>So as a startup, as a new technology provider going into the enterprise space, it’s important that you appeal both to the buyer, who is very eager to get technology capabilities, and also to the operator of the environment, who is very much concerned about the stability of the system, the APIs and the platform, because they will need to maintain this for up to 10 years, or more if you speak about the production line of a&nbsp;factory.</p> What do you think would facilitate the adoption for these very large and complex industrial enterprise systems? <p>Markus: The best way is when users and prospective users see and experience how it is going to improve their lives. We see the same thing with the Bitcoin Suisse Vault also on our end. That’s the best way to onboard them to your technology stack. We do this by demonstrating the Vault and by showing the capabilities of blockchain in a way that’s affecting the user. See, at Bitcoin Suisse, we’re pushing payment terminals across our market, Switzerland at this time, so that people can get first hand experience and we’re showing them how easy it is to use our high security Bitcoin Suisse Vault, including the storage for Ocean and the other coins. As a more industrial enterprise-oriented technology stack, you should have solved a problem that your clients have as part of their business or operations and be able to show that as a demo or use&nbsp;case.</p><p>You should have people who have experience doing this, including outside blockchain. And when you go to the clients, you need to speak the language of the people who solve the same problems. When you have a demonstration or use case that has a wow effect, and people immediately come to say ‘Yes, the Ocean team knows what my problem is, and they have a technology that solves my problem’, then you win. Plus, they also need to see that your platform provides the stability and long term guarantees that they need to solve the problem sustainably.</p><p>And as a side note here, “long term”, this can be 10 years plus in industrial solutions. And in many cases, maybe it’s also just two years. If you solve a shorter term problem that’s also good if there’s an expectation that it will be surpassed by yet another development later&nbsp;on.</p><p>But frequently, and that’s where I’m coming from in this industrial space and in the finance space, people do have a very long term focus and it’s always a challenge as a startup to demonstrate that you’re going to be around and that technology stack is going to keep working, even if things change in the founding team, for example, or in the industry.</p> Why are standards so important? <p>Markus: When you tackle the enterprise space, it’s important to show what security standards and what technology or ISO standards you follow, because that’s a tick the box exercise that many companies do when they evaluate which solution to onboard to. Especially in the area of security, but also in the reliability space. It’s not just about the technology expertise of the team implementing Ocean, but also having some level of familiarity with the traditional world. Because on one hand, the blockchain teams building applications on Ocean, they’re very familiar with blockchain and they will build on Ocean because of the technical excellence of the team and the protocol.</p><p>And when you go beyond blockchain projects and would like to market Ocean to people who are not yet convinced of blockchain — traditional enterprises, for example — then they need to be able to anchor that technology in terms and ways of thinking that they’re familiar with. And that frequently is along standards, i.e. for us as custodian these are cyber security standards for securing private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>There are also application development standards and programming paradigms, support paradigms, that will be important to hit. So that the commercial buyers and enterprises will be better able to relate to how the Ocean protocol works, understand the value proposition you bring and know they can rely on your&nbsp;product.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

<p>As the world deals with many challenges due to the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19, I talked to data protection expert Julian Hayes from Veneto Privacy regarding the prominence and development of contact tracing apps and how society can combat some of the privacy and data protection concerns that these platforms can entail.</p>
 <p>Julian Hayes</p> 
<p>Julian Hayes is Managing Director of <a href="https://www.venetoprivacy.ie/">Veneto Privacy Services</a>, a specialist data protection and security firm based in Dublin, Ireland. He has worked in the sphere of data protection for more than 16 years and is a specialist in app privacy &amp; security design for major consumer service industries.</p>
 Minttu: What are the main challenges you see with the uptake of contact tracing apps? 
<p>Julian: I think it is good that there is a healthy debate on the subject of contact tracing apps at this time as we have seen much analysis on the implications for users of the app and what plans authorities plan to use with the data. From the outset, we must be mindful that the main objective of such app analysis is to protect society from the risk of infection or transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp; With that in mind we must make sure that a balance is struck as much as possible to be able to protect individual citizens’ data, with that of protecting society from the virus.</p>
<p>There are two predominant models that are used for COVID-19 possible contagion detection that would be good to analyse from a security perspective.</p>
 
 De-centralised App Models: This model utilises Bluetooth or other common device-to-device based connectivity solutions, where there is no collection point of information other than on the users’ devices. &nbsp;A typical experience would be a confirmed COVID positive user would activate their status on the app as having currently or once tested positive for COVID.&nbsp; Other devices in the user’s proximity would then be alerted when and, importantly, where they had encountered a close contact with the tested-positive user’s device. 
 Centralised App Models:The centralised app model is a central point of storage for all COVID app users, detailing all close encounter contacts that the user has come in close proximity to, again via Bluetooth or other near field communication technology. Broadly speaking, it will again require an action by a user to enlist themselves on the app as having contracted COVID previously or presently, although in some models some data regarding temperature checks etc. may be processed in the service to automatically categorise individuals based on specific protocols.&nbsp;The centralised model would be the preferred model for those agencies tasked with fighting the pandemic as it will give them a detailed, holistic view as to the spread of infection. Centralised comprehensive models can be more effective but are also open to much criticism for overreaching in the data that they process or, in extreme cases, abuse of data that is processed surreptitiously for other purposes by the state or other third parties. 
 
 <p>Source: BBC News https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52355028</p> 
<p>Some points to note here:</p>
 
 Both models are likely to have better valid detection and performance in rural areas rather than urban areas due to spatial issues – i.e. less devices per square metre and generally reduced concentration of user interaction. 
 The de-centralised model is clearly more privacy friendly as it alerts from device to device, rather than through a central source, but we must consider how effective it is for reporting possible COVID infections. 
 The centralised model will have better detailed visibility for health authorities or intermediaries tasked with operating the detection tools. 
 GPS and Cell ID data (often available open source, see <a href="https://www.opencellid.org/#zoom=18&amp;lat=53.277066&amp;lon=-6.103126">here</a>)&nbsp;are really required for both solutions so as to allow geo-graphic identification of the user, even in the centralised model where it is not to be shared by the device. 
 Some research is needed into historical Bluetooth proximity – whether a device can recall Bluetooth device encounters&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to downloading the app. 
 
 M: Will these apps be the ‘silver bullet’ to combatting COVID-19?&nbsp; 
<p>J: I think it is important see this type of technology as part of the strategy to help fight this disease, along with the other more traditional methods such as social distancing, personal hygiene and the promising developments of vaccines recently. These solutions are only a part of the suite of tools that public health authorities are recommending.</p>
 M: What about concerns regarding data privacy and how the data will be used? 
<p>J: Clearly there are concerns regarding the approach of the centralised model relating to how data will be processed. However, we must remember that these state authority initiatives are undertaken with the objective to protect society in the detection of close encounters of people who have contracted COVID-19.&nbsp;We must also be cognisant that the apps in place are being developed on the basis that they will be downloaded voluntarily by people who will be informed on the permissions that are entailed in using the service.&nbsp;Provided that contact tracing apps provide good information to the user on what data is processed, for what purpose and why, and what controls they can utilise within the service, it should enable transparency and privacy-by-design.</p>
 M: What are some of the mitigations on a privacy engineering basis that can be put in place as a privacy safeguard?  
<p>J: There are many options regarding the protection of identities or processing of other personal identifiers that can be utilised in the development of these app services.</p>
<p>Some items would include:</p>
 
 Provide robust Privacy Notice and Consent upon download of the app, detailing its access rights to Bluetooth, GPS, Cell-ID or other positioning information required for effective use of the service. 
 Assigning a digital ID solution for app users that does not allow for direct identification of users of the app. This will allow for the users to share pseudonymous data rather than direct identifiers, bringing some privacy protection. 
 Digital IDs assigned to each individual user will allow for non-identifiable information to be processed as encounters occur, allowing users to pass each other and be informed of a contagion risk where necessary, whilst protecting each other’s identity.&nbsp;An example of this can be seen with <a href="https://koronavilkku.fi/en/">Finland’s contact tracing app</a>. 
 Rotation of digital IDs over a reasonable period will also add protection so as to not allow for retrospective analysis of encounters with other COVID tracing app users. Clearly there needs to be a balance struck between the efficacy of encounter detection and user privacy.

<p>Eine höhere Effizienz ist als Argument für
die Einführung von digitalen Identitäten inzwischen breit abgestützt und wurde
über die letzten Jahre mit entsprechenden Nachweisen aus Ländern in
verschiedenen Regionen der Welt untermauert i ii iii. Das Bedürfnis
nach digitalen Identitäten geht heute jedoch weit über einen Effizienzgewinn
hinaus. Digitale Identitäten werden praktisch zur Notwendigkeit, um öffentliche
Dienste ohne Unterbrechung aufrechtzuerhalten, wenn die Bekämpfung der
COVID-Pandemie über einen längeren Zeitraum ein Social Distancing erfordert.
Digitale Identitäten können E-Government-Dienste ermöglichen, die ohne
physische Präsenz rund um die Uhr zugänglich sind. Dies wurde in
Grossbritannien mit der elektronischen Identitätsplattform «GOV.UK Verify» gezeigt.
Der erste Lockdown-Monat im März 2020 löste einen zehnprozentigen Anstieg der Anzahl
neu kreierter digitaler Identitäten aus. Eine digitale Identität wurde benötigt,
um in der Startphase des Lockdowns aus der Ferne Anspruch auf einen
Universalkredit («Universal Credit») geltend zu machen [1]. Dies half dabei,
entscheidende finanzielle Unterstützung zu gewährleisten und so sicherzustellen,
dass tausende von Bürgerinnen und Bürgern inmitten der Krise Zugang zu
lebenswichtigen Dienstleistungen hatten.</p>



<p>Das «GOV.UK Verify»-Programm blieb indes nicht
von Problemen verschont. Die Adoptionsraten sind weit hinter dem Ziel von 25
Millionen Nutzern bis 2020 zurückgeblieben. Nachdem ein privatwirtschaftlicher
Ansatz gewählt wurde, haben die niedrigen Adoptions- und Nutzungsraten drei von
fünf Identitätsanbieter (sogenannte Identity Provider oder kurz IdPs) dazu
gezwungen, die Lösung aufgrund von Bedenken hinsichtlich Rentabilität nicht
weiter zu unterstützen [2]. Die Einführung eines erfolgreichen Digital
Identity-Programms ist eine langfristige Verpflichtung und es macht den
Anschein, dass der kurzfristige finanzielle Druck auf private Akteure bedeutet,
dass diese für die Rolle eines IdPs ungeeignet sind, sobald die Adoptionsraten
die Erwartungen nicht erfüllen. Während das privatwirtschaftliche IdP-Modell in
nordischen Ländern mit einer nahezu universellen Abdeckung grosse Erfolge verbuchen
konnte, hat dieser Ansatz in anderen Regionen gemischte Ergebnisse erzielt [3].
Industrieprognosen deuten nun darauf hin, dass die Pandemie möglicherweise den
Ausschlag zugunsten eines von der Regierung herausgegebenen Digital
Identity-Modells zu geben vermochte iv.</p>



<p>Unabhängig davon, welches Modell ein Land
gewählt hat, ist eines sicher: Es wird erwartet, dass digitale Identitäten in
den kommenden Jahren ein deutliches Wachstum erfahren werden und damit die Grundlage
für die nächste Welle von E-Government-Innovationen geschaffen wird. Die
Verbreitung digitaler Identitäten ist jedoch nicht Selbstzweck. Ziel ist ein
«Empowerment» der Bevölkerung. Es ist daher wichtig sich die Frage zu stellen,
was gute digitale Identität bedeutet. Als Anbieter von Digital
Identity-Lösungen orientieren wir uns bei unseren eigenen Produktentscheiden an
globalen Projekten und neuen Technologietrends. Dabei haben wir die folgenden Design-Prinzipien
übernommen, um die Interessen unserer Nutzer, sprich der Bevölkerung, in den
Vordergrund zu stellen.</p>



<p>«Privacy by Design»</p>



<p>Aufgrund des sensiblen Charakters von
digitalen Identitäten und den zahlreichen damit verknüpften persönlichen
Identifizierungsdaten ist das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit in eine Lösung von entscheidender
Bedeutung. Im Kern geht es darum sicherzustellen, dass bei der Konzeption einer
Lösung der Schutz der Privatsphäre der Bürgerinnen und Bürger höchste Priorität
hat. Procivis lässt sich von den Werten der «Self-Sovereign Identity»- sowie
der Blockchain-Bewegung leiten, die kryptographische Methoden einsetzen, um die
Kontrolle und Souveränität der Nutzer über ihre persönlichen
Identifizierungsdaten zu gewährleisten. In Übereinstimmung mit diesen Werten
muss jede neue Funktion die folgenden Merkmale erfüllen: Einwilligung und freie
Wahl, Zweck-Legitimität und Spezifizierung, Sammelbeschränkung und
Datenminimierung.</p>



<p>Anbieten von Anwendungsfällen
mit hoher Wertschöpfung</p>



<p>Von Regierungen herausgegebene digitale
Identitäten gibt es seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten. Einer der Hauptfaktoren, der
erfolgreiche Programme von anderen unterscheidet, ist der Zugang zu Diensten, die
den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern echten Mehrwert bieten. Neben der Primärfunktion
der Authentifizierung in der digitalen Welt haben Fallbeispiele rund um den
Globus gezeigt, dass die Akzeptanz stark mit der Verfügbarkeit von Diensten mit
hoher Transaktionsfrequenz korreliert. Ein solcher Dienst ist beispielsweise die
Bereitstellung von rechtsverbindlichen, digitalen Signaturen. In Estland haben
digitale Signaturen die handschriftliche Unterschrift fast vollständig ersetzt,
wobei jedes Jahr über 200 Millionen digitale Signaturen von einer Bevölkerung
von 1,3 Millionen Menschen eingereicht werden [4]. Weitere Anwendungsfälle, die
für die Einführung von digitalen Identitäten förderlich waren, sind Dienste für
den digitalen Empfang und die Verwaltung von offiziellen Dokumenten,
Zertifikaten und Lizenzen. Brasilien und Argentinien verzeichneten hohe Adoptionsraten
bei digitalen «Wallets» (Brieftaschen) für Identitätsdokumente, seit es für
Bürgerinnen und Bürger möglich ist, ihren Führerschein und ihre
Fahrzeugdokumente auf dem Smartphone zu speichern. Es waren unter anderem diese
Anwendungsfälle, die die Entwicklung unserer ersten drei Kernfunktionen – e-Authentication,
e-Signature und e-Documents – geprägt haben.</p>



<p>Nahtloses Nutzererlebnis</p>



<p>Es reicht nicht aus, Zugang zu wichtigen
Dienstleistungen zu bieten. Ebenfalls wichtig ist ein intuitives und nahtloses
Nutzererlebnis für die Bürgerinnen und Bürger. Eine Reihe von Ländern hat
beispielsweise Smartcards eingeführt, die es den Bürgern ermöglichen, Dokumente
elektronisch zu authentifizieren und zu unterzeichnen. Mehrere dieser Prozesse
setzten jedoch voraus, dass die Benutzerinnen und Benutzer über ein
Kartenlesegerät verfügten, was sich als zu komplex erwies und die Adoption behinderte.
Smartphone-basierte digitale Identitäten lösen dieses Problem, indem sie sich
auf handelsübliche Hardware und vertraute Nutzungsmuster stützen. Eine Reihe
von digitalen Behördendienstleistungen leidet zudem darunter, dass sie nur
bruchstückhaft digitalisiert sind. Beispielsweise kann in der Schweiz eine
Reihe offizieller Dokumente zwar über ein Behördenportal bestellt werden, die
Zahlungsprozesse jedoch laufen getrennt, so dass die Bürgerinnen und Bürger
nach Erhalt einer Rechnung separat eine Überweisung vornehmen müssen. Im Kanton
Schaffhausen kombinieren wir e-Payments mit e-Authentication und e-Documents in
einer Mobile App, so dass Bürgerinnen und Bürger den Prozess der Bestellung,
der Zahlung per Kreditkarte und des Empfangs ihrer amtlichen Dokumente nahtlos
durchlaufen können.</p>



<p>Interoperabilität
zum Aufbau eines Dienstleistungs-Ökosystems</p>



<p>Wie zuvor verdeutlicht, liegt der eigentliche
Wert einer digitalen Identität im Zugang zu den damit ermöglichten Diensten. Deshalb
ist es von entscheidender Bedeutung, dass die zum Einsatz kommenden Lösungen
auf offenen Standards beruhen, damit Drittparteien (des öffentlichen wie des
privaten Sektors) digitale Identitäten einfach in ihre Prozesse integrieren
können. Der Finanzsektor ist eine der Branchen, die einen enorm grossen Nutzen
aus der Verwendung von vertrauenswürdigen digitalen Identitäten ziehen kann. In
Dänemark zum Beispiel wurden von 70 Millionen monatlichen Transaktionen 40
Millionen für Banktransaktionen verwendet. Allerdings bildet eine von der
Regierung ausgegebene Identität die vertrauenswürdige Grundlage einer digitalen
Gesellschaft und kann in Bereichen Anwendung finden, die viel breiter gelagert sind
als zunächst vorhergesehen.</p>

In India, the Aadhaar electronic identity facilitated the opening of over 400
million new bank accounts. The government now transfers subsidies directly into
the bank accounts of beneficiaries, eliminating significant inefficiencies in
the country’s subsidy delivery mechanism. The Government of India reports a
cumulative saving of USD 23 billion dollars between 2013 and 2019.</p>

<p>As always, you are more than welcome to share this post, and\or <a href="https://identosphere.substack.com/welcome">subscribe for weekly updates</a> on the Self Sovereign Identity landscape, with a focus on implementations surrounding open standardization processes.</p><p>We would be grateful for your <a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere">support on Patreon</a>, which will ensure the sustainability of this project over the long-term.</p> Trust Frameworks? Standards Matter. <p>Tim Bouma <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/trust-frameworks-standards-matter-47c946992f44">makes the case that Trust frameworks</a> need standards to be trusted. He points at the NIST documents about it <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8149.pdf">Developing Trust Frameworks to Support Identity Federations</a> published in 2018. He also points at the Canadian government’s definition of standards.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“a document that provides a set of agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results. Standards establish accepted practices, technical requirements, and terminologies for diverse fields.”&nbsp; He goes on to highlight a lot of the work being done in Canada and where it all sits relative to being a standard - “In closing, there are lots of trust frameworks being developed today. But to be truly trusted, a trust framework needs to either apply existing standards or become a standard itself.”</p></blockquote> The Odyssey Hackathon was last week <p><a href="https://solutions.odyssey.org/#winningsolutions">See the winners across all 21 challenges</a>.</p><p>They are actually coming to the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Interoperability-WG-a42995c37e2a4511a10aea96cdbccc38">Interoperability Working Group</a> this coming week to share results. Here is what they had to say about SSI:</p><p>A Self- Sovereign Identity can unlock the full potential of the digital global economy. The identity of people, organizations and things is relevant to any transaction, while protecting Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is of increasing importance.</p><p>SSI enables the necessary exchange of verified data before committing to (proposed) transactions, which for high-value/high-risk transactions includes the identity.</p><p>The thing that stuck out to me <a href="https://www.odyssey.org/hackathon-2020-dutch-blockchain-coalition-ministry-of-the-interior-challenge-self-sovereign-identity-in-action/">reading the web page</a> about the event was this diagram.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc13a2fa0-d11a-4244-a8f8-086426f7b092_2560x1810.jpeg"></a>  <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/11/18/get-involved-with-dinz-this-november/">New Zealand </a>is working with Maori leaders on Identity <blockquote><p>Next week we’re celebrating our first Aotearoa Digital Identity Hui Taumata.&nbsp; We’re particularly excited to be bringing you a Kapa Kōrero session with Kaye-Maree Dunne, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janeretimana/?originalSubdomain=nz">Jane-Renee Retimana</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/belindaallennz/?originalSubdomain=nz">Belinda Allen</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-tairea/?originalSubdomain=nz">Ben Tairea</a>.&nbsp; The quartet will be exploring perspectives from Te Ao Māori, and the relevance of Te Tiriti in our collective work on digital identity.</p></blockquote><p>Digital Identity New Zealand is having it’s <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-nz-annual-meeting/">Annual Meeting</a> Dec 10th&nbsp;</p> CBOR is done!&nbsp; <p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2136">Mike Jones shares</a> that CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)&nbsp; is officially a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8943">specification at IETF</a> - woohoo! and it is a key part of <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45144.html">ISO’s mDL standard</a> (date fields must use it).&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as specified in RFC 7049, is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/show/federal-blockchain-news">Federal Blockchain News</a> - Podcast talking about SSI use at CBP <p><a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/13158652/ep8-cbp-vincent-annunziato">Vincent Annunziato</a><a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/13158652/ep8-cbp-vincent-annunziato">,</a> talks about his work with The Silicon Valley Innovation Program.

You can find a summary of the interview, and a link to the audio.</p><blockquote><p>Kaliya’s purpose is to answer this profound question: “How do we own, control, manage, and represent ourselves in the digital world, independently of the BigTech companies (Facebook, Google, etc.)?”</p></blockquote> How to Issue Credentials in Trinsic Studio <p>Trinsic has released some <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">tools to issue verifiable credentials</a>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>All verifiable credentials come from credential templates. These templates specify what information should be included in a credential. Faber College would most likely want the credential template of its digital diplomas to include a graduate’s first and last name, what they got their degree in, what year they graduated, and thier GPA. Let’s begin!</p></blockquote> Launch of CredentialMaster Student Pass Announced <blockquote><p>By issuing <a href="https://credentialmaster.com/student-pass/">StudentPass self-sovereign student ID</a> before any other VC, you do three big things for students:</p>  <p>You set an ID anchor for binding other VCs to that student (like skills and achievements).</p>  <p>You can eliminate passwords and personal questions, and Recognize Your StudentTM at every interaction.</p>  <p>You give students their first Verifiable Credential, show them the value of it, and how it works.</p>  </blockquote> Videos  [<a href="https://www.aceblock.com/2020/11/12/news-lecture-why-is-ssi-becoming-a-necessity-and-what-potential-it-holds/">LECTURE</a>] Why is SSI becoming a necessity and what potential it holds?&nbsp; <blockquote><p>Problem 1: CENTRAL AUTHORITY CONTROLS ALL DATA</p><p>Problem 2: NUMEROUS SIGNUPS WITH SAME DATA</p><p>Problem 3: INCONVENIENCE OF ONLINE FORMS</p></blockquote> <a href="https://diginomica.com/self-sovereign-career-identity-conversation-meg-bear-sap-successfactors">Self sovereign career identity</a> - a conversation with Meg Bear <blockquote><p>The Velocity piece is a way for me as an individual to own my credentials, to say, these are the things that I know.

In the past, that might have just been something that I built as reputation within a company, I can now make that a more dynamic and portable reputation I can take with me anywhere.</p></blockquote><p>Having a look at <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Velocity-Non-Technical-Whitepaper-091120-V1.15-Published.pdf">the Velocity Whitepaper</a> it does mention they are keeping an eye on the work developing in W3C and DIF.</p><blockquote><p>The Velocity Network is a blockchain-based open source verifiable credential exchange utility layer with its basic elements and token mechanics that provides standardized communication protocols, governance, compliance and payment rails, that enable trusted, private and secured exchange of career credentials between individuals and organizations.</p></blockquote> Decentralized-id.com Updates <p>Infominer has begun publishing <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/twitter/">weekly twitter collections</a> that support this newsletter, on decentralized-id.com. In addition to those weekly lists a <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/twitter/ssi-101/">Self Sovereign Identity 101</a> collection has been published there.</p><p>There is now a page for <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/government/canada/bcgov/">BCGov</a>, <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/government/europe/switzerland/zug/">Zug ID</a>, <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/blockchain/hyperledger/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>, <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/government/europe/eSSIF/">European Self Sovereign Identity Framework</a>, <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/web-standards/gs1/">GS1</a>, and……</p> First guest post submitted&nbsp; <p>Since the beginning of decentralized-id.com, I (Infominer) have been inviting others to participate in its creation, by submitting content, or editing what’s currently published. After 2 years, finally, the site has received its first guest submission.</p><p>Contacted about mentioning <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/blockchain/dragonchain-factor/">Dragonchain’s Factor Identity on decentralized-id.com</a>, I suggested they put some links in a shared doc, and whatever information they felt would be useful.

			 Shurong joined the team back in April 2018 as an intern and became Marketing &amp; Communication Manager after the internship.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Shurong Li. I’m from a small city, Kaiyuan (Yunnan), located in the southwest of China. After I graduated from university, I worked as a software engineer for over a year. I came to the realisation that the business sector interests me more than the technical side, so I came to France to study for a Master’s Degree in Management. Since I was a kid, I’ve always liked recommending and sharing fabulous stuff with my friends. I often ended up giving away all of my favorite candy to my friends back then because I also wanted them to experience the joy! And that is exactly what marketing does in business, and I take great pleasure in doing it. So here I am, I became a marketer sharing the joy of excellent and innovative products to those that need them.</p>

		 
	 
    Shurong and her husband took the photo at the train station of her hometown Kaiyuan     
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was looking for a six-month end-of-studies internship in 2018. As I have an engineering background, I was keen on looking for an opportunity to work in a company that involves new technology – blockchain was something that caught my eye. I came across Tokeny Solutions, a small team of eight people back at the time. I reached out to Luc, our CEO, on LinkedIn for the opportunity. Following a few interviews, luckily I got hired as an Intern!</p>
<p>There was one thing that held me back: I would need to work remotely from day one. Today, it sounds normal but a few years ago it was against the norm and I had never worked remotely before. I was worried if I would be able to do so. My family and friends were even telling me to be careful. “It wouldn’t be a fraud, would it?” one of my friends said.</p>
<p>I decided to ask an employee about how it feels working remotely, so I called Mathieu, our Business Developer. He immediately made me feel more comfortable with it. Not because he told me how good it is working remotely, but because he is the kind of colleague you would want to work with. Then I joined the team, and my intuition was right, not just Mathieu, everyone in the team is friendly and motivated. After my internship, I gladly received a long-term employment contract offer. And now it’s been almost three years since I started working at Tokeny. The only change is we grow much bigger, we have over 30 coworkers in the team, four times bigger than I joined, a truly international team with 13 nationalities.</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Challenging, exciting and fun. The thing I like the most about working at Tokeny is that you can be creative and bold to try new ideas and constantly learn new skills and knowledge, with a group of talented and smart people. When an issue arises, everyone works together effectively to solve it. As a result, you don’t feel alone as you know the team has got your back. Remote work requires more efficient communication digitally, so for those who work remotely we regularly organize visual meetings to keep track of what is going on in the team. In addition to this, there are visual coffee breaks where we can casually catch up with colleagues, which allows us to get to know each other.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I’m passionate about photography and art. My grandpa was a photographer and a filmmaker and he took me to work when I was a child. He taught me how to take good photos and videos. After a few training sessions with him, I was able to take some good pictures and videos, and since then I fell in love with photography. I find it tremendously exciting to be able to capture a beautiful and meaningful moment. I also love art and creative design, as your imagination can be visualised through paper or digital devices. Yet, I like the process of learning how to bring your imagination to life. For me, it’s a way to understand myself a bit more, and I enjoy the sense of accomplishment when I finish it.</p>

			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Have a great career, a happy family and to travel the world.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I’ve learned from The World Counts that around 9 million people die every year from hunger and hunger-related diseases. If I could, I would provide sufficient food to those who are suffering from hunger and save them from dying.</p>

<p>I think most of us are ready to put 2020 behind us, closing off final deals and crossing the finish line on projects we may never have expected to need to prioritise this year. We’ve all learnt a lot in a short space of time, not least the critical value of flexible digital infrastructure to support whatever the years ahead may bring for businesses.</p>
<p>Whilst we’re not entirely sure what’s in store for 2021 and beyond, we do know that three digital trends are likely to stay whatever happens next. The first is simply the increase in digital interactions as customers need to transact online, or now prefer its convenience. The second is the subsequent rise in cyberattacks as bad actors take advantage of the increased opportunity for manipulation. The third is the growth of remote working, which most agree is here to stay in some capacity, increasing the likelihood of privileged access over the public internet and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).</p>
<p>Here are three, important yet oft-forgotten, identity management principles to help guide us through the security, customer experience and operational efficiency challenges that these trends present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data collection – less is more 
<p>We’ve seen it with the media’s scrutiny of Covid tracing apps and social media’s role in the US election – more and more people are waking up to their right to privacy. Perhaps not all of us value our privacy as much as we should, but certainly awareness of data privacy is growing and transparency over data use is key.</p>
 <p>Screenshot: Instagram</p> 
<p>Best-practice identity management can help you practice the principle of data minimisation – essentially only asking for data that is absolutely necessary, and not keeping it for longer than needed. So if I’m signing up for a music streaming service, it may need to know some aspects of my identity – like my email address and bank details – but, according to data minimisation, would not need to know my gender. The service may prefer to know my gender so its marketing team can analyse demographics, but it is not necessary to my use of the service. Many apps, like Instagram, will make these fields optional to avoid registration abandonment.</p>
<p>It’s important to offer a self-service account management capability so that users can manage their own identity data and view what you know about them. It’s also important to be transparent around what you know and why you need to know it, in order to build trust with your customers. The good news is that many users are still happy to provide non-essential data if there is value for them in doing so. For example, if you let them know that this will enable you to personalise the service that you’re providing to them. This results in more loyal customers and more successful marketing/sales teams who can target their efforts based on up-to-date information – not information that’s been assumed or has expired in your CRM.</p>
<p>Speaking of your CRM, make sure it’s integrated with your app’s identity and access management. By integrating these systems, you avoid data siloes and wasting time and money on either updating each system individually or not leveraging the most up-to-date information for sales/other processes.</p>
<p>Finally, avoid asking your customers to provide identity credentials when it’s not necessary. By employing single sign-on (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/customer-sso/">SSO</a>) and step-up authentication, you can achieve the correct balance of robust security and seamless customer experience. SSO means that customers only need one set of login credentials to sign into all authorised services. If one particular service requires stronger authentication than the others, for example billing, then you can step up authentication for just that service (i.e. require another authentication factor, as we’ll see in the next principle).</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MFA is a basic requirement 
<p>Multi-factor authentication (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/authentication-mfa/">MFA</a>) is no longer a security gold standard; it is just standard. As a reminder, MFA is the use of more than one authentication factor (like a username/password plus a fingerprint scan). Customers generally fall into two camps – the camp that cares about their online security so will demand MFA availability, or the other camp who don’t really care and won’t go looking for it (and are therefore more likely to present a breach risk to your organisation). You must offer MFA to your users and, if you don’t enforce it, encourage them to set it up. If you don’t have MFA in place by the end of 2020, 2021 is the year you must find the time and budget for it. Not doing so may mean much more time and budget spent on dealing with a data breach down the line.</p>
<p>Remember that not all authentication factors are created equally. Some, like a password or social media login, are unlikely to be strong enough when used on their own as they can be hacked more easily than other methods. Others, like a bank ID or authenticator app time-based one-time password (TOTP), are stronger as they’re harder to hack. Whichever combinations you decide to enable for access to your application should reflect the sensitivity of the data you’re storing, the geographical location of your users and your regulatory context. It’s also a good idea to provide options, as only providing one choice will alienate certain users (e.g. some users may not have social media accounts or may be unable to provide certain biometric data).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Least Privilege 
<p>It can be hard to keep on top of which accounts have access to which systems internally, let alone with your (usually more numerous) external customers and/or partners. The principle of least privilege denotes that user accounts should only ever have the minimum access authorisation necessary to their role in the service. I’ll cover two examples.</p>
<p>The first example is with remote employees. When staff are in the office, it may be easy to identify anyone who should not be accessing your company systems and stop them before they do any damage. After all, they’d have to be sat in front of a team that knew them for an imposter. But with the increase in remote working, it’s more likely that bad actors could take advantage of the anonymity and gain unauthorised access to an account. If this does happen, you’ll want the hacked user’s account to have access to as little data as possible to minimise what information is visible/vulnerable to the hacker.</p>
<p>The second example is a business to business use case. Say you run an online service for your business partners, where several employees within the partner business need access to your service. The easiest thing to do is give everyone at the partner business an account with the same level of privilege. However, this would mean that if any of those accounts are hacked, the hacker also gains full access rights. But the accounts don’t all need access to every area, so this method presents an unnecessary risk. Perhaps only an administrator needs to have access to billing, while an ordinary member only needs enough access to upload documents. Here, different access rights levels reduce the risk of more sensitive areas being hacked. In this example, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/delegated-authority/">Delegated Authority</a> streamlines how you handle these access levels by giving the partner business administrator control over their own employee invitations. This saves both businesses time and, therefore, money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Final thoughts 
<p>With life online taking centre stage right now, digital identity is still firmly under the spotlight. How we protect and make life easier for our online users now will ultimately have a huge impact on business success, regardless of how long it takes to return to ‘normality’.</p>
<p>Of course, these principles above are only three out of a long list, but it would be wise to keep returning to these and asking yourself and your team if you continue to do enough on each.</p>

Vielmehr werden alltägliche Verbraucherdienste in großem Maßstab angegriffen, was Sicherheitsprobleme für Einzelhandels-, Reise-, Lebensmittel- und Medienunternehmen schafft. Wie sehen diese Angriffe aus? Wie lassen sie sich identifizieren? Wie schützen Sie Ihre Kunden und Ihr Unternehmen vor kompromittierten Konten und dem Verlust digitaler Vermögenswerte?

  <p>Homeoffice und remote Zusammenarbeit werden durch ein weites und attraktives Angebot von cloudbasierten Collaborations-Tools begünstigt. Die aktuelle Covid-19 pandemische Situation hat zu einem großflächigen Aussetzen der Präsenzzusammenarbeit geführt. Ein nicht unerheblicher Teil der digitalen Collaboration findet - unter Access Management Gesichtspunkten betrachtet - mäßig bis schlecht organisiert statt. Wie bekommt man solche Collaborations-Szenarien (wieder) unter Kontrolle? Wie verhält es sich mit ad-hoc Szenarien? Der Vortrag wirft einen kritischen&nbsp; Blick auf Cloud-Collaboration und stellt einige hilfreiche praxiserprobte Lösungsansätze und Patterns im IAM-Umfeld dar.</p>

  <p>Privilege Access Management (PAM) sollte ein Schlüsselelement in Ihrer Sicherheitsstrategie sein.

Erstens muss die Lösung schnell in Ihrer Umgebung implementiert werden können und möglichst wenig Reibung im täglichen Geschäftsbetrieb verursachen. Darüber hinaus muss sie sich nahtlos in andere Geschäftsvorgänge wie IGA, DevOps, Robotische Prozessautomatisierung und Active Directory integrieren, um Just-in-Time-Privilegien zu bieten, die Zero Trust ermöglichen. Außerdem muss die Verhaltensanalyse genutzt werden, um Risiken in Echtzeit zu beheben. Bevor Sie weitere Schritte mit Ihrem aktuellen PAM-Projekt unternehmen, nehmen Sie an dieser Sitzung teil, um zu sehen, wie das PAM-Portfolio der nächsten Generation von One Identity den Schutz, die Sichtbarkeit und den Umfang bietet, den Sie benötigen, um die schnellste Wertschöpfung und die niedrigsten Gesamtbetriebskosten zu erzielen.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cas2020_2020_11_18_bakos"></a>

  <p>Viele Organisationen stehen vor der Herausforderung Richtlinien für das Arbeiten aus dem Home-Office zu implementieren, um unter anderem eine stetig steigende Anzahl an Remote- und Hybrid-Mitarbeitern zu unterstützen. Während ein hybrides Arbeitsmodell eine interessante und aufregende Entwicklung darstellt, waren viele Organisationen nicht auf diese rasche, anfängliche Verlagerung der Arbeitsstruktur in Hybrid- oder Remote-Modelle vorbereitet. Die Nutzung einer Privileged Access Management-Lösung kann federführend dabei unterstützen, Sicherheitsauswirkungen dieser wachsenden Remote- und Hybrid-Belegschaft zu minimieren. Der Vortrag zeigt auf, wie diese neuen Arbeitsmodelle sicher supported sowie weiter ausgebaut werden können und legt dar, welche Rolle ein ganzheitlicher Privileged Access Management-Ansatz hierbei spielt.</p>
