<p>We are often asked by prospects evaluating open source identity and access management platforms about the difference between the Gluu Server and Keycloak.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, we have not deployed or operated Keycloak. However, at a high level, we can offer a few points of differentiation between the two platforms.</p>
 Product vs. Project 
<p>There is a big difference between a project and a product. There are long term and short term projects, but by nature projects are temporary and are often not suitable for mission critical production environments. Products, on the other hand, need to live in production for many years.</p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the Keycloak website (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RH-SSO product derives from a specific version of the Keycloak community and is maintained, patched, and supported by Red Hat commercially for as long as the terms of your support contract. The Keycloak community project, on the other hand, is never patched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, by RH’s own admission, Keycloak open source offering is a bleeding edge project that is never patched.</p>
<p>The Gluu Server Community Edition, on the other hand, is a product that is in production at many organizations.</p>
 Niche vs. Pure Play 
<p>Choosing an IAM platform is a long term decision. Once you start building the platform into your larger enterprise architecture, the switching costs become extremely high.</p>
<p>Keycloak and RH SSO contribute no meaningful amount to RH’s bottom line, and RH may or may not continue to invest in the software. We’ve seen in the past RH say “the liability of the product exceeds the revenue opportunity.” It’s not enough to patch a server. The SSO market is moving fast as new vulnerabilities and application development paradigms emerge. Is RH committed for the long term to not only support, but to innovate?</p>
<p>Gluu’s whole business is built around the Gluu Server. Gluu will never stop innovating (or end of life) our flagship product.</p>
 Support 
<p>Red Hat does not provide commercial support for Keycloak. They instead derive product offerings (i.e. RH SSO) from community projects (i.e. Keycloak) which are branded and maintained separately.</p>
<p>Gluu, on the other hand, makes a large investment in supporting our customers and the open source community alike. We do not hold back features for a commercial version. Everyone gets the same Gluu Server software bits.</p>
<p>We rely on large organizations with mission critical requirements to <a href="https://gluu.org/pricing">pay for support</a>, but that doesn’t stop us from helping the open source community of DIYers and small (and large!) businesses adopt and use this critical security tool.</p>
 OS specific 
<p>Gluu is committed to building packages for many popular Linux distributions, currently Red Hat, Centos, Ubuntu, and Debian.</p>
 Team vs. Company 
<p>Our experience is that developers ask a lot of hard questions, the criticality of support is high, and a fast response time is critical. As Keycloak / RH SSO is a small part of RH’s business, it may take time for Redhat to get the right team engaged on a production (or development) issue.</p>
<p>Gluu’s whole company is focused on the Gluu Server, and our business, support and developer staff is engaged in supporting and extending the product each and every day.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>As a pure play IAM vendor, Gluu will never end-of-life the Gluu Server, or waver from its commitment to support and innovate our open source platform.</p>
<p>Options are good for consumers, and we like to see other organizations offer open source identity and access management tools to the community. In fact, we make use of the good ones (like Shibboleth) in our stack!</p>
<p>Our recommendation: use Keycloak at your own risk… you may be locked into an obscure, end-of-lifed product in the not too distant future.[:]</p>

 The future of Web3 identity has&nbsp;arrived <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a brand new SDK for building with decentralized identity and user-centric data from the 3Box Labs team. IDX is in alpha but if you’d like to start experimenting, <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">join our discord</a> and jump into the&nbsp;<a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">docs</a>.</p> A new era for Web3 development <p>The Web3 vision for an internet that is open and interoperable, where users control their information requires a decentralized, cross-platform identity system. To this end, IDX is an open source JavaScript/TypeScript library that exposes high-level developer APIs to various meta-protocols and standards for decentralized identity. Not only is IDX powerful and flexible enough to meet all of your user and data management needs, but it wraps everything in an easy-to-use package that makes decentralized identity accessible to all Web3 developers.</p><p>Designed to be cross-platform and highly configurable, IDX is compatible with all blockchains, wallets, and a wide variety of user and application data storage options including <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, <a href="https://textile.io">Textile</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org">OrbitDB</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/">Secure Data Stores</a> — so you can seamlessly integrate decentralized identity with the rest of your Web3 tech stack. With IDX, developers can now build much more sophisticated and powerful Web3 applications that rival and even exceed what’s currently possible on&nbsp;Web2.</p> Why decentralized identity? <p>If you’ve ever asked yourself any of these questions, then you should definitely consider adding a decentralized identity system to your development stack.</p>  How can I create a universal identifier to associate data resources from a variety of platforms to a single&nbsp;user?  How can I improve my user experience with decentralized social profiles?  How can users create a unified Web3 identity that links many different accounts within and across various blockchain platforms?  How can users establish trust and reputation by connecting their Web3 identity to existing Web2 social accounts (i.e. Twitter), various anti-sybil systems (i.e. <a href="https://brightid.org">BrightID</a>), domain names (i.e. DNS, <a href="https://ens.domains">ENS</a>, <a href="https://handshake.org/">Handshake</a>), and identity verification services (i.e.&nbsp;KYC)?  How can users create a universal and portable social graph of followers, friends, and contacts?  How can I store user and application data in various centralized and decentralized data storage technologies in a way that isn’t siloed to my application, gives users ultimate control and portability over their data, and works with all of their existing wallets/accounts?  How do I discover and import data that a user has created on another application, platform, or network so that I can use it inside my&nbsp;app?   IDX: An open identity framework for&nbsp;Web3 <p>Decentralized identity and user-centric data management are complex, broad-ranging capabilities that touch almost every other aspect of your app architecture. IDX removes the all of the guesswork from implementing these in a scalable and future-proof way.</p> Build with unified digital identities <p>Using IDX, all applications can access a shared, globally-available identity layer that contains unified users identities. Built 100% on permissionless protocols, IDX enables users and their most important information to seamlessly flow and interoperate across platforms, while giving users the ownership and control they demand. In a way, the identity capabilities offered by IDX sort of function as a decentralized Keybase but with much greater flexibility and decentralization.</p>A unified digital footprint!<p>The core of each identity consists of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> which acts as a globally-unique ID and an <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/cip/idx/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">identity index</a> which keeps track of an identity’s information. IDX allows developers to deploy identities as well as create, read, update, and delete a variety of metadata and information related to the identity, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Multiple user profiles for different contexts or applications  Portable social graphs, from followers to contacts and&nbsp;family  Links to multiple blockchain accounts from different protocols (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, NEAR, Flow,&nbsp;etc)  Links to existing social accounts (Twitter, Github, Discord, Matrix,&nbsp;etc)  Links to domain names (DNS, ENS, Unstoppable, Handshake, etc)  <p>All DIDs, identity indexes, and metadata are securely stored on Ceramic’s permissionless document management network. Because all information is publicly available (but optionally encrypted) and linked via the identity index, any bit of information can be cross-resolved by querying based on any other information. For example you could lookup a user’s profile based on their DID, their Ethereum account, or their Twitter handle; or you could lookup a user’s Filecoin account based on their Polkadot account. We are working with <a href="https://thegraph.com">The Graph</a> on indexing these identity structures which will open up many new opportunities in this&nbsp;realm.</p> Integrate with data storage solutions <p>Unified identities are the gateway to a world of additional functionality for your application. If you also need a way of storing and managing user data, you have three main&nbsp;options.</p>  Use the IDX library to directly store documents on the Ceramic Network and add references to those documents in the user’s index. For this option, no additional software is needed; it works out of the box with&nbsp;IDX.  Store data in alternative data storage systems such as Filecoin, IPFS, Sia, Arweave, Textile, OrbitDB, Secure Data Stores, or Ethereum contracts and use IDX to add references to this data in your user’s index. For this option, you would need to separately install these technologies in your app alongside IDX.  Use a combination of the different data storage solutions above for your application, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, while mapping everything in your user’s&nbsp;IDX.  <p>Whichever data storage configuration you choose, IDX allows all data to be controlled by the user, discoverable by others, and portable across platforms. This is true regardless of where the data resides (servers or decentralized networks) or which application first created the&nbsp;data.</p>The identity index contains mappings to various data&nbsp;sources Share data across applications and&nbsp;silos <p>As described above, the key aspect of IDX that de-silos information, promotes interoperability, and enables user control is the identity index. It provides a standard interface which allows any application or developer to set and query all available data that belongs to a user so that they might make use of it within their application. The identity index serves as the information root for each user and makes everything discoverable.</p><p>To further promote interoperability, the identity index allows developers to:</p>  Publish schemas, names, and descriptions for data points they are adding to the index, so others can more easily consume this information  Publish endpoints for where this information can be found, whether a DocID on Ceramic, a CID on IPFS/Filecoin, a contract on Ethereum, or an endpoint for a hosted&nbsp;service  Request permission to access encrypted data points in the&nbsp;index   Developing with&nbsp;IDX <p>The following section outlines how to get started building with IDX. For more supporting materials, <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">read the&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> Installation <p>First, we’ll need to install the main IDX library and associated dependencies:</p> npm install @ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client @ceramicstudio/idx @ceramicstudio/idx-constants  Query an&nbsp;identity <p>Then we can use these libraries to connect IDX to a Ceramic network and interact with the documents associated to a given DID. This example shows how to simply query the basic profile for a given&nbsp;user.</p> import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client'<br>import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'<br>import { definitions } from '@ceramicstudio/idx-constants'  // Use Ceramic devnet<br>const ceramic = new Ceramic('&lt;https://ceramic.3boxlabs.com&gt;')  // Use IDX-provided definitions aliases<br>const idx = new IDX({ ceramic, definitions })  // Get the basic profile of a known DID supporting IDX<br>async function getProfile(did) {<br>  return await idx.get('basicProfile', did)<br>}  Save data <p>More advanced examples involving authentication and setting content can be found in the <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/guide-authentication">IDX documentation</a>.</p><p>Remember, IDX is still in alpha. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on what we’ve built or how to use it, please <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">reach out on&nbsp;Discord</a>.</p> About <p>IDX is an open source library that is built and maintained with 💜 by the 3Box Labs team, creators of <a href="https://github.com/3box/3box-js">3Box.js</a>, a leading decentralized identity and data storage solution for Ethereum that has been used by 30,000+ users and 1,000+ projects. IDX is a smarter, mature evolution of 3Box.js. All DIDs and profiles created using 3Box.js will be automatically migrated to IDX once the library goes into production. We are working on various solutions to migrate user data that has been saved in spaces and threads to other IDX compatible data storage systems including Ceramic, Textile, and OrbitDB.

<p>We are delighted to announce that we are building on <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot,</a> a sharded blockchain that seamlessly connects multiple chains together in a single network with the aim of accelerating the integration of both ecosystems and increasing levels of trust and data sovereignty for users across the industry. Parity Technologies, one of the drivers behind the Polkadot ecosystem, will provide Ontology with technical support to integrate its Decentralized Identity (DeID) solution, making it available on a range of other blockchains within the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>The integration of Ontology’s DeID is part of a wider effort for Ontology to build a parachain on Polkadot. We envision that the parachain will provide a series of credit-based services on decentralized identity and cross-chain communication. These credit services will include OScore as well, our newly launched credit scoring system designed to seamlessly accelerate the potential to borrow or lend based on a user’s cryptocurrency transaction and asset management history.</p><p>In addition, this parachain will bring cross-chain liquidity to the Polkadot network. Through this, we wish to further accelerate the development of the DeFi ecosystem and lower the barrier of entry for developers. An example of how this is implemented in the DeFi space is the recently launched Wing platform — a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi platform purely dedicated to the practices of lending digital assets governed by the Wing DAO community. This will in turn boost the liquidity of digital assets such as ONT, ONG and DOT. Ontology plans to bid on a parachain slot and create one of Polkadot’s first Initial Parachain Offerings (IPO).</p><p>Eric Wang — the Ecosystem Development Lead at Parity, stated that “Ontology is an industry leader in the development and deployment of decentralized identity solutions. We look forward to working closely with the Ontology team to increase the use of ONT ID 2.0 through Polkadot to realize the benefits of digital identity, privacy for DeFi projects and&nbsp;beyond”.</p><p>Parity’s Head of Engineering in Asia, Yaoqi Jia said “the Parity Asia team consists of talented engineers who are very excited to provide support to help guide Ontology in creating a truly impactful parachain.”</p><p>Developed over the past couple of months, the Ontology <a href="https://github.com/siovanus/DID-substrate">parachain</a> currently consists of a DID Substrate pallet, with plans for further integration of other custom components. Further plans for the Ontology parachain include:</p>  Ontology OScore — an off-chain DID authorization mechanism to manage wallet-identity relationships and provide ID-based credit scores for on-chain actions related to digital&nbsp;assets.  The integration of Ontology’s distributed data exchange framework (DDXF), permitting both token association and data tokenization.  Expanding DID’s use cases from users to also include data and resources, providing authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for DID based resource instances via on-chain data access control with data-tokens (tokenization), and association of its value. DDXF provides on-chain AAA for data interoperability cross&nbsp;systems.  <p>Through the integration of our bespoke digital identity and credit-based solution into the Polkadot ecosystem, along with the help of Parity’s leading engineering team, this collaboration will further accelerate user trust, privacy, and data sovereignty, as well as empower the development of the broader DeFi sector. Ontology looks forward to joining forces with more ecosystem allies to redefine trust and connect the missing pieces of a decentralized financial ecosystem.</p><p>About Polkadot</p><p>Polkadot is a sharded blockchain that seamlessly connects multiple diverse chains together in a single network, allowing them to exchange data securely and process transactions in parallel. In this way, Polkadot solves major scalability issues that have impeded blockchain development. Polkadot has also introduced a highly advanced open governance system that will allow the network to innovate and grow at a much more rapid pace than legacy networks. Applications from decentralized finance and energy to IoT and gaming will thrive on Polkadot, challenging the centralized platforms of Web 2.0.

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language">Security Assertion Markup Language</a>, more commonly known as SAML, is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties. Most commonly these parties are an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider_(SAML)">Identity Provider</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_(SAML)">Service Provider</a>. The primary use case for SAML has typically been to provide single sign-on (SSO) for users to applications within an enterprise/workforce environment.</p>

<p>Up until the past few years, SAML was considered the industry standard—and proven workhorse—for passing an authenticated user into applications while allowing these applications to defer authentication to a centralized identity solution. However, with the introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect">OpenID Connect</a>, which is an authentication layer built on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0">OAuth2</a>, SAML has become outdated. Furthermore, every year seems to bring new issues with SAML – in the form of newly discovered exploits – which is giving it a reputation of not being the most secure option. That being said, SAML is still considered a relevant option for single sign-on and there are still requirements for developers to support it in modern environments. If OpenID Connect is not an option, and SAML is a requirement, this blog will cover a simple approach to add SAML 2.0 support to an ASP .NET Core 3.1 application so that it can accept authenticated users from an Identity Provider and track that users authenticated state within the .NET middleware.</p>

 Prerequisites 

<p>Install <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1">.NET Core 3.1</a></p>

<p>Install an Editor/IDE such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> or <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a></p>

<p>Learn about <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/">Basic SAML Concepts</a></p>

 Getting Started 

<p>First, create an application to function as a SAML Service Provider. Open a command shell, <code>cd</code> to a preferred directory to create the project in and enter the following command:</p>

   <code>dotnet new webapp -o Okta_SAML_Example
</code>   

<p>This command will create a new web app from a template and put it in a directory called Okta_SAML_Example.</p>

<p>If this is your first-time using .NET Core, you may need to trust the development certificate. To do this, use the following command and enter your admin password if prompted:</p>

   <code>dotnet dev-certs https –trust
</code>   

<p>Next, enter the Okta_SAML_Example directory:</p>

   <code>cd Okta_SAML_Example
</code>   

<p>Finally, run the sample application to make sure that it works:</p>

   <code>dotnet watch run
</code>   

<p>Once the application has started, navigate to <a href="https://localhost:5001">https://localhost:5001</a> in your preferred web browser. Using <code>watch run</code>, instead of <code>run</code> by itself, allows the compiler to detect changes in the code and recompile every time it sees them. This is very helpful when iterating on the code. Type <code>CTRL + C</code> in shell to terminate.</p>

<p>Unlike .NET Framework, .NET Core is missing some XML and cryptology libraries that are very important when implementing SAML. Thankfully, there are some great open source solutions that exist for .NET Core 3.x, which reimplements these concepts and others to make supporting SAML easy. After evaluating multiple such solutions, I have found that working with <a href="https://github.com/ITfoxtec/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2">https://github.com/ITfoxtec/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2</a> was the most enjoyable experience for me.</p>

<p>Add the required packages by running the following commands:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2 --version 4.0.8
dotnet add package ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.MvcCore --version 4.0.8
</code>   

 Login With SAML 

<p>The first step is to configure the application to use SAML for authentication. Open <code>Startup.cs</code>. Start by adding the following using statements:</p>

   <code>using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2;
using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.Schemas.Metadata;
using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.MvcCore.Configuration;
</code>   

<p>Next, find <code>ConfigureServices()</code>, and add the following code below <code>services.AddRazorPages();</code>:</p>

   <code>public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRazorPages();

    services.Configure&lt;Saml2Configuration&gt;(Configuration.GetSection("Saml2"));

    services.Configure&lt;Saml2Configuration&gt;(saml2Configuration =&gt;
    {
        saml2Configuration.AllowedAudienceUris.Add(saml2Configuration.Issuer);

        var entityDescriptor = new EntityDescriptor();
        entityDescriptor.ReadIdPSsoDescriptorFromUrl(new Uri(Configuration["Saml2:IdPMetadata"]));
        if (entityDescriptor.IdPSsoDescriptor != null)
        {
            saml2Configuration.SingleSignOnDestination = entityDescriptor.IdPSsoDescriptor.SingleSignOnServices.First().Location;
            saml2Configuration.SignatureValidationCertificates.AddRange(entityDescriptor.IdPSsoDescriptor.SigningCertificates);
        }
        else
        {
            throw new Exception("IdPSsoDescriptor not loaded from metadata.");
        }
    });

    services.AddSaml2();  
}
</code>   

<p>Find <code>Configure()</code> and add the following after <code>app.UseRouting()</code>;</p>

   <code>app.UseSaml2();
</code>   

<p>Still within <code>Configure()</code>, find the <code>app.UseEndpoints()</code> method and add the following new code below <code>endpoints.MapRazorPages()</code>;</p>

   <code>app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
{
    endpoints.MapRazorPages();

    endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
        name: "default",
        pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
});
</code>   

<p>The application will now use SAML for authentication. Next, add a controller to handle the authentication routing. Create a new file in the root project folder called <code>AuthController.cs</code> and start by adding the following:</p>

   <code>using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2;
using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.Schemas;
using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.MvcCore;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Okta_SAML_Example.Identity;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;
using System.Security.Authentication;

namespace Okta_SAML_Example.Controllers
{
    [AllowAnonymous]
    [Route("Auth")]
    public class AuthController : Controller
    {
        const string relayStateReturnUrl = "ReturnUrl";
        private readonly Saml2Configuration config;

        public AuthController(IOptions&lt;Saml2Configuration&gt; configAccessor)
        {
            config = configAccessor.Value;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you have created the foundation of your authentication controller by referencing the required dependencies, adding the basic controller layout, and bringing in the configuration object for your routes to use.</p>

<p>The next step is to create a route for <code>Login()</code>. Add the following code right after the <code>AuthController()</code> method.</p>

   <code>[Route("Login")]
public IActionResult Login(string returnUrl = null)
{
    var binding = new Saml2RedirectBinding();
    binding.SetRelayStateQuery(new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; { { relayStateReturnUrl, returnUrl ?? Url.Content("~/") } });

    return binding.Bind(new Saml2AuthnRequest(config)).ToActionResult();
}
</code>   

<p>This route handles a user initiating login from your application directly. In SAML, this is called <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#planning-for-saml">SP Initiated</a> because the authentication request is starting from your Service Provider application. You will eventually call this route from a login button in your nav. During this process, a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#planning-for-saml">SAML Request Assertion</a> is generated and sent to the Identity Provider via a redirect to an Identity Provider URL. This assertion is just XML with basic information about the request. In SAML there is also a concept called <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#planning-for-saml">IDP Initiated</a>. This is when the user starts in an Identity Provider and clicks a link to get into your Service Provider application. The IDP Initiated flow simply bypasses the login route, and SAML Request, entirely.</p>

<p>Next, you will need an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#planning-for-saml">Assertion Consumer Service</a>. This is the route that your Identity Provider will send the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#planning-for-saml">SAML Response Assertion</a> to. Right after the <code>Login()</code> route, add the following:</p>

   <code>[Route("AssertionConsumerService")]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; AssertionConsumerService()
{
    var binding = new Saml2PostBinding();
    var saml2AuthnResponse = new Saml2AuthnResponse(config);

    binding.ReadSamlResponse(Request.ToGenericHttpRequest(), saml2AuthnResponse);
    if (saml2AuthnResponse.Status != Saml2StatusCodes.Success)
    {
        throw new AuthenticationException($"SAML Response status: {saml2AuthnResponse.Status}");
    }
    binding.Unbind(Request.ToGenericHttpRequest(), saml2AuthnResponse);
    await saml2AuthnResponse.CreateSession(HttpContext, claimsTransform: (claimsPrincipal) =&gt; ClaimsTransform.Transform(claimsPrincipal));

    var relayStateQuery = binding.GetRelayStateQuery();
    var returnUrl = relayStateQuery.ContainsKey(relayStateReturnUrl) ? relayStateQuery[relayStateReturnUrl] : Url.Content("~/");
    return Redirect(returnUrl);
}
</code>   

<p>This route is the meat and potatoes of your SAML implementation. This code receives the SAML Response from the Identity Provider, validates its signature via a signing certificate, decodes it, validates claims, creates an authenticated session with the middleware, and parses claims for later use.</p>

<p>Last, you will need a logout route to allow the user to logout from your application and kill the session with the middleware. Add the following below the Assertion Consumer Service route.</p>

   <code>[HttpPost("Logout")]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Logout()
{
    if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        return Redirect(Url.Content("~/"));
    }

    var binding = new Saml2PostBinding();
    var saml2LogoutRequest = await new Saml2LogoutRequest(config, User).DeleteSession(HttpContext);
    return Redirect("~/");
}
</code>   

<p>This route will be mapped to a logout button in your nav and it will delete the user’s session, logging them out. This is not a Single Log Out route, which could also be supported, that would also log the user out of the Identity Provider. Often it is not desired to log a user out of the Identity Provider when logging them out of the Service Provider, because the user may be using it for other applications.</p>

<p>In the Assertion Consumer Service route, there is a class called <code>ClaimsTransform</code>. This is a helper class that we need to implement to help parse the claims out of the SAML Response. Create a new file in the root directory of the project called <code>ClaimsTransform.cs</code>. Add the following:</p>

   <code>using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.Claims;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Claims;

namespace Okta_SAML_Example.Identity
{
    public static class ClaimsTransform
    {
        public static ClaimsPrincipal Transform(ClaimsPrincipal incomingPrincipal)
        {
            if (!incomingPrincipal.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return incomingPrincipal;
            }

            return CreateClaimsPrincipal(incomingPrincipal);
        }

        private static ClaimsPrincipal CreateClaimsPrincipal(ClaimsPrincipal incomingPrincipal)
        {
            var claims = new List&lt;Claim&gt;();

            // All claims
            claims.AddRange(incomingPrincipal.Claims);

            // Or custom claims
            //claims.AddRange(GetSaml2LogoutClaims(incomingPrincipal));
            //claims.Add(new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, GetClaimValue(incomingPrincipal, ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)));

            return new ClaimsPrincipal(new ClaimsIdentity(claims, incomingPrincipal.Identity.AuthenticationType, ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, ClaimTypes.Role)
            {
                BootstrapContext = ((ClaimsIdentity)incomingPrincipal.Identity).BootstrapContext
            });
        }

        private static IEnumerable&lt;Claim&gt; GetSaml2LogoutClaims(ClaimsPrincipal principal)
        {
            yield return GetClaim(principal, Saml2ClaimTypes.NameId);
            yield return GetClaim(principal, Saml2ClaimTypes.NameIdFormat);
            yield return GetClaim(principal, Saml2ClaimTypes.SessionIndex);
        }

        private static Claim GetClaim(ClaimsPrincipal principal, string claimType)
        {
            return ((ClaimsIdentity)principal.Identity).Claims.Where(c =&gt; c.Type == claimType).FirstOrDefault();
        }

        private static string GetClaimValue(ClaimsPrincipal principal, string claimType)
        {
            var claim = GetClaim(principal, claimType);
            return claim != null ? claim.Value : null;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to modify your nav to show the login/logout buttons. You also want to add a nav button to take the user to a secured page which will display their SAML claims. Open <code>_layout.cshtml</code> and find the Home button:</p>

   <code>&lt;ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"&gt;
    &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
            &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Index"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
    ~
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code>   

<p>Remove everything in the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> after the Home button. Between the <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code>, at the spot above indicated by the <code>~</code> in the snippet above, replace the existing code with the following:</p>

   <code>@if (((System.Security.Claims.ClaimsIdentity)User.Identity).IsAuthenticated)
{
    &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Claims"&gt;SAML Claims&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        @if (User.Identity.Name != null)
        {
            &lt;span class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello, @User.Identity.Name!&lt;/span&gt;
        }
        else
        {
            &lt;span class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;
        }
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;form class="form-inline" asp-controller="Auth" asp-action="Logout"&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
}
else
{
    &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-controller="Auth" asp-action="Login"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
 }
</code>   

<p>This code shows the login button and hides the logout and claims buttons when the user is not logged in. It shows the logout and claims button, hiding the login button, when the user is logged in.</p>

<p>The next step is to create the Claims page, which is a secure page that can only be accessed once a user has authenticated.</p>

<p>Create two new files in the <code>Pages</code> folder of the project. <code>Claims.cshtml</code> and <code>Claims.cshtml.cs</code>.</p>

<p>Claims.cshtml:</p>

   <code>@page
@model ClaimsModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
}

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;The users Claims (Iteration on User.Claims)&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            @foreach (var claim in User.Claims)
            {
                &lt;strong&gt;@claim.Type&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="padding-left: 10px"&gt;Value: @claim.Value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
            }
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Here you are simply iterating on User.Claims, which will contain all claims from the SAML Response.</p>

<p>Claims.cshtml.cs:</p>

   <code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Okta_SAML_Example.Pages
{
    [Authorize]
    public class ClaimsModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;ClaimsModel&gt; _logger;

        public ClaimsModel(ILogger&lt;ClaimsModel&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public void OnGet()
        {

        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This is the base model for your Claims page. The most important part here is the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute before the class initialization that indicates that this page will require a user to authenticate. If you navigate to the claims page directly before authenticating, you will be redirected to authenticate first.</p>

<p>Lastly, add your configuration settings to <code>appsettings.json</code>. This is where you are pulling your SAML configuration settings from. Open <code>appsettings.json</code> and add the following code before <code>"AllowedHosts": "*"</code>:</p>

   <code>"Saml2": {
    "IdPMetadata": "{IDP MetaData URL}",
    "Issuer": "Okta_SAML_Example",
    "SignatureAlgorithm": "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256",
    "CertificateValidationMode": "ChainTrust",
    "RevocationMode": "NoCheck"
  },
</code>   

<p>In this example, you are pulling your SAML settings from the IDP’s metadata. This is a great feature of SAML that allows you to pull a config from the source rather than having to copy each setting, and the signing certificate, into your code.</p>

 Configure An IDP 

<p>You have added all of the code that is required to implement SAML support to your Service Provider application. To test, you will need an Identity Provider. <a>Okta</a> is the single best identity platform on the market and supports SAML, as well as OpenID Connect and other standards. If you have not created a free Okta developer tenant, do so at <a>developer.okta.com</a>.</p>

<p>Log in to your Okta tenant, switch to the admin portal, and switch to the classic UI if you are in the developer UI.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Applications, Add Application, Create New App, and select the SAML 2.0 radio button before clicking Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Give your app a name and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In Single Sign on URL, enter <code>https://localhost:5001/Auth/AssertionConsumerService</code></p>

<p>In Audience URI, enter <code>Okta_SAML_Example</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select the I’m an Okta customer adding an internal app radio button and click Finish.</p>

<p>You will be taken to the Sign On tab of the newly created app in Okta. Click the hyperlink under View Setup Instructions that says Identity Provider metadata. This will open a new tab to your metadata. Copy the URL from this hyperlink and add it to your <code>appsettings.json</code> file in the IdpMetadata attribute. This will save you from having to copy all of the settings from Otka into your code.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Last, you’ll need to make sure that your user is allowed to use this app in Okta. Click on the Assignments tab, click the Assign button, and click Assign to People.</p>

<p>Click the Assign button next to your user, and then click Save and Go Back.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You are now ready to test your application.</p>

 Try It Out 

<p>Return to your command shell, type:</p>

   <code>dotnet watch run
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Navigate to <a href="https://localhost:5001">https://localhost:5001</a> in a private browser window once the application is running.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Login and login with your user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once redirected back to your application, you will see that your nav shows that you are logged in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Claims to see your claims within the secure page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Logout.</p>

<p>Close the browser and open a new private window.</p>

<p>Attempt to navigate directly to <a href="https://localhost:5001/claims">https://localhost:5001/claims</a> to ensure that you are forced to login before being allowed to access the page.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>You now have an, ASP .Net Core 3.1 web application functioning as a SAML Service Provider using Okta as the Identity Provider. As new secure pages are created, using the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute in the page model, or in a controller route, will ensure that only authenticated users are allowed access. The complete project code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/nickgamb/Okta_SAML_Example">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <p>Nearly half of CIOs say they now employ AI or intend to within the next 12 months. But how to make AI a core IT competency still eludes most organizations. Boards of directors, CEOs and customers want to use AI to power real improvements in customer and employee experience.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It might sound counterintuitive, but do as few proofs of concept (POCs) as possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Promoting positive habits to get the best value from the technology is an important way to make it more commonplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37038"]</p>
<p>“The idea that your habits are intentional is key to understanding how to address AI in this modern capacity,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/16534/Whit-Andrews">Whit Andrews</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during his session at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/symposium-us">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo 2020®</a>. “Think about these habits in a way that is strategic; it’ll make a huge difference.”</p>
 Habit No. 1: Use mixed-role AI teams for every AI project&nbsp; 
<p>Organizations that have the highest effectiveness in making AI an integral part of business strategy use mixed-role AI teams for all AI initiatives. These organizations strongly believe that aligning AI to business initiatives is a way to deliver value. Both the diversity of the team and how that variety is applied across all initiatives is key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/2-megatrends-dominate-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2020/">2 Megatrends Dominate the Gartner Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence, 2020</a></p>
 Habit No. 2: Invest in variety for the mixed-role teams (train members if you have to)&nbsp; 
<p>Organizations where AI has “significant value” have 14% more roles on AI teams. It’s most common to have roles like AI researchers and data scientists because AI always originates with data. Plus, it is key to have the technical acumen those roles bring on an AI team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, roles like project managers, strategists, application designers and others are vital to the diversity of thought and background this type of work requires. Different backgrounds and perspectives on AI will improve <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-prevent-ai-dangers-with-ethical-ai/">AI ethics</a>, an understanding of the value of AI to customers, how it should be used and where it can have the biggest impact. This will enable the team to deliver significant business value.&nbsp;</p>
 Habit No. 3: Include top executives in strategy and funding 
<p>Organizations that assign <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-budget-planning-hacks-for-ai-projects/">AI budget</a> to a corporate function at the C-level are almost two times more likely to reach maturity level 4. Associating the budget with a sponsor at a high corporate level means the executive offers a sense of what the organization needs, so the AI team can address that and be the voice that explains the value AI has for the organization. They are able to communicate, at a C-suite level, how data aligns to business strategy and corporate goals.&nbsp;</p>
 Habit No. 4: Do AI with a purpose and measure it&nbsp; 
<p>Organizations that measure financial or risk impact for AI projects are more likely to be successful than those that don’t. Embracing metrics enables organizations to showcase how AI can be used across the enterprise by highlighting its benefits and risks in certain areas. For example, the ability to analyze videos or images might start in the security realm, but with some maturity could be used to analyze organizations’ brand presence or understand how customers react to products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">The CIO's Guide to Artificial Intelligence</a></p>
<p>This is not to say that every project must guarantee a positive ROI, but regardless of outcome, it must be measured to see what is possible.&nbsp;</p>
 Habit No. 5: Limit the number of POCs 
<p>It might sound counterintuitive, but do as few proofs of concept (POCs) as possible. In past years, one of the key messages organizations heard surrounding AI was to try everything and see what works, then focus on maturing what worked. However, organizations now increasingly understand what AI can do for them and when the technology should be avoided.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations that are now exploring AI in their operations do about 20% fewer POCs than organizations that only plan to employ it. A deliberate approach to POC selection and deployment will deliver substantial benefits.</p>

Privileged accounts have traditionally been given to administrators to access critical data and applications. But changing business practices and upgrades to IT including cloud and other trends has meant that users of privileged accounts have become more numerous and widespread. An area in sharp focus is agile development teams such as DevOps and others that need secure access to privileged resources in the cloud; support for these has become essential to many organizations. Such teams need rapid access to privileged accounts, credentials and protected data, and PAM vendors are responding to this demand.</p>

  <p>In this post, I’m going to show you how to set up a light that will turn on when you’re in a Zoom call. The color of the light will show your mute status, red will indicate that you’re muted, and green if you are not muted.</p>





<p>Because Zoom doesn’t provide a native interface for determining mute status, I will instead use a tool called Hammerspoon to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Note: Unlike most software for macOS, Hammerspoon requires a bit of effort to get working. Be ready to use of your terminal and favorite text editor to get Hammerspoon configured.</p>

 What is Hammerspoon? 

<p>If you aren’t familiar with Hammerspoon, it can be a bit hard to describe. I think of it as a programmer’s multi-tool for modifying the behavior and extending the capabilities of macOS. Hammerspoon does this by exposing a large variety of macOS functionality via a clean <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a> interface.</p>

<p>The malleable nature of Hammerspoon gives it a lot of power, but it also makes it hard to describe. You can use Hammerspoon to configure hotkeys, act as a window manager, set timers, track your time, automate tasks, create desktop widget and more. I learned how to use Hammerspoon via the excellent blogs posts “<a href="https://prodtyping.com/blog/hyperkey-hammerspoon">Give your computer superpowers with a Hypekey and Hammerspoon</a>” and “<a href="http://evantravers.com/articles/2020/06/08/hammerspoon-a-better-better-hyper-key/">Hammerspoon: A Better, Better Hyper Key</a>”. I recommend these posts if you want to learn more about Hammerspoon after you read this blog post.</p>

 How to install Hammerspoon 

<p>If you use Homebrew, you should be able to install Hammerspoon via brew:</p>

   <code>brew cask install hammerspoon
</code>   

<p>Otherwise, review <a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/#how-do-i-install-it">“How do I install it?” on hammerspoon.org</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve installed Hammerspoon, you’ll want to make sure that you have a configuration file for it.</p>

<p>Do this by making sure that you have a <code>~/.hammerspoon</code> directory with a file named <code>init.lua</code> in it using these commands:</p>

   <code>mkdir ~/.hammerspoon
touch ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua
</code>   

 Install the Zoom Spoon 

<p>The next thing that you’ll need to do is install the unofficial Hammerspoon plug-in I wrote for Zoom. Hammerspoon calls plug-ins “Spoons” so I call this unofficial plugin the Zoom Spoon.</p>

<p>Spoons are installed into their own sub-directories in the <code>~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/</code> directory.</p>

<p>The code for my unofficial Zoom Spoon is stored on GitHub, so we’ll be using <code>git</code> to install the Zoom Spoon for Hammerspoon.</p>

<p>Start by making sure that you have a <code>Spoons</code> directory in your Hammerspoon configuration directory:</p>

   <code>mkdir -p ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons
</code>   

<p>Next, use <code>git</code> to check out a copy of my unofficial Zoom Spoon:</p>

   <code>cd ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons
git clone https://github.com/jpf/Zoom.spoon.git
</code>   
 Getting Familiar with Hammerspoon and Testing Out the Unofficial Zoom Spoon 

<p>At this point, you should have Hammerspoon and my unofficial Zoom Spoon installed. So now I’m going to show you how to test out your setup and make sure it’s working.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is to launch Hammerspoon. Note that Hammerspoon is a GUI app, so navigate to where you installed the Hammerspoon app and launch it.</p>

<p>After launching Hammerspoon, make sure that it has the “Show menu icon” preference selected. Do this by opening Preferences for Hammerspoon and selecting Show menu icon, or by running this command:</p>

   <code>defaults write "org.hammerspoon.Hammerspoon" "MJShowMenuIconKey" '1'
</code>   

<p>At this point, you should see a new icon that looks like a hammer with a spoon handle in your menu bar. You may need to restart Hammerspoon if you don’t see this icon.</p>

<p>When you can see the icon, click on the icon and select Open Config from the menu. This will open up the <code>~/.hammerspoon/init.lua</code> configuration for Hammerspoon in your favorite text editor.</p>

<p>Once the <code>~/.hammerspoon/init.lua</code> configuration file is open, use your favorite text editor to add the following lines to the file:</p>

   <code>hs.loadSpoon("Zoom")
spoon.Zoom:start()
</code>   

<p>Save the file, then click on the Hammerspoon menu icon, and select Reload config, then click on the the Hammerspoon menu icon again to select Console.</p>

<p>At this point, should see the Hammerspoon console, and it should look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, at first glance, this console appears to be just a message log. Not so! You can also interactively run Lua in this console, which is exactly what we’re going to do now.</p>

<p>To test out the unofficial Zoom Spoon, run this command in the Hammerspoon console:</p>

   <code>spoon.Zoom:inMeeting()
</code>   

<p>If Zoom is already open, and in a meeting, this command should return <code>true</code> otherwise, it’ll return <code>false</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>If the command returned <code>false</code> like in the image above, then quit and reopen Zoom, start a meeting, and re-run the command. This time around, it should return <code>true</code></p>

<p>If this doesn’t work, it probably means that you need to give Hammerspoon permission to control your computer. To do this, open System Preferences, and go to 
Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy &gt; Accessibility,
unlock the preference pane to make changes, then select the checkbox next to “Hammerspoon” to allow Hammerspoon to inspect the state of Zoom.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you get the <code>spoon.Zoom:inMeeting()</code> command working, two others for you to try are <code>spoon.Zoom:mute()</code> and <code>spoon.Zoom:unmute()</code> try out both while you have a live Zoom meeting running and see what happens!</p>

 Configure Hammerspoon to use the Zoom Spoon 

<p>At this point, you should be able to run the <code>spoon.Zoom:mute()</code> and <code>spoon.Zoom:unmute()</code> commands to mute and unmute a Zoom meeting. However, this isn’t really any more useful than what you can already do with Zoom, so in this section I’ll be showing you how to set up a mute indicator in your menu bar.</p>

<p>Note: Zoom provides a global mute and unmute hotkey out of the box! If all you care about is a global mute and unmute hotkey, I suggest using that!</p>

<p>Because I assume that most people don’t have a <a href="https://blink1.thingm.com/">blink(1)</a> USB LED already, I’m going to show you how to do the next best thing which is to simulate this LED in your menu bar.</p>

<p>To get this set up, use the Hammerspoon menu icon and select “Open Config” to open the <code>~/.hammerspoon/init.lua</code> file in your favorite text editor, then edit the file to look like this:</p>

   <code>-- This lets you click on the menu bar item to toggle the mute state
zoomStatusMenuBarItem = hs.menubar.new(nil)
zoomStatusMenuBarItem:setClickCallback(function()
    spoon.Zoom:toggleMute()
end)

updateZoomStatus = function(event)
  hs.printf("updateZoomStatus(%s)", event)
  if (event == "from-running-to-meeting") then
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:returnToMenuBar()
  elseif (event == "muted") then
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:setTitle("🔴")
  elseif (event == "unmuted") then
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:setTitle("🟢")
  elseif (event == "from-meeting-to-running") then
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:removeFromMenuBar()
  end
end

hs.loadSpoon("Zoom")
spoon.Zoom:setStatusCallback(updateZoomStatus)
spoon.Zoom:start()

hs.hotkey.bind('', 'f5', function()
  spoon.Zoom:toggleMute()
end)
</code>   

<p>After you’ve finished editing the configuration file, save it, then use the Hammerspoon menu icon to select Reload Config.</p>

<p>Now it’s time to test it out. After selecting Reload Config from the Hammerspoon menu icon, reload Zoom and start a meeting. Shortly after the meeting starts, you should see a new menu icon appear in your menu bar. The icon will be green if you are unmuted and red if you are muted. Pressing the <code>F5</code> key will toggle between the muted and unmuted states and then update the menu icon as appropriate.</p>

<p>Note: The status indicator light will only change if you use the Hammerspoon key (<code>F5</code> in this case). It should be possible soon to keep it in sync no matter how Zoom is muted or unmuted, just not at the time that I’m writing this.</p>
 Setting up a blink(1) USB LED (and a giveaway!) 

<p>Now that we’ve gotten a menu icon to show the mute status for a Zoom meeting, let’s take it one step further and set up a physical light to be a mute status indicator!</p>

<p>The light that I’m using is called a <a href="https://blink1.thingm.com/">blink(1)</a> and is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ThingM-Blink-USB-RGB-BLINK1MK3/dp/B07Q8944QK/">available on Amazon for about ~$30</a>. The nice thing about this light is that it doesn’t require any special drivers to get working, you just plug it in and start using it.</p>

<p>Win a blink(1) USB LED light! I’m raffling off three blink(1) USB LED lights. To enter the raffle follow <a href="https://twitter.com/oktadev">@oktadev</a> on Twitter and then post a tweet mentioning this blog post. On October 31st, I will search for tweets that mention this blog post that were made by people who also follow @oktadev on Twitter. Of those people, I will select three people at random and give each one a blink(1) USB LED.</p>

<p>Now, there are many ways to interface with the blink(1) light, but my programming language of choice is Python, that’s what I’m going to use in this post.</p>

<p>To use the blink(1) light from Python, you’ll need to install the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/blink1/"><code>blink1</code> Python SDK</a>. I use <code>virtualenv</code> to keep my Python packages tidy, so let’s start with that.</p>

<p>Start by creating a directory for this project. I’m suggesting a directory name in the command below, but you should change it to something that makes sense for you.</p>

   <code>mkdir ~/blink
</code>   

<p>Next, <code>cd</code> to the directory you just created and make a new virtualenv for Python.</p>

   <code>cd ~/blink
virtualenv venv
</code>   

<p>At this point, the virtualenv should be activated. Your prompt will contain <code>(venv)</code> if so. If you don’t see <code>(venv)</code> in your prompt, try running:</p>

   <code>source venv/bin/activate
</code>   

<p>Now you’re ready to install the Python SDK for the blink(1) light:</p>

   <code>pip install blink1
</code>   

<p>With the blink1 package installed, we’re ready to write some code that uses it. Below is the source code for a small Python program that I wrote to control the blink(1) light from the command line:</p>

   <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
from blink1.blink1 import Blink1
import sys
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("-r", "--red", default=0, type=int, help="Value for red (0 - 255)")
parser.add_argument("-g", "--green", default=0, type=int, help="Value for green (0 - 255)")
parser.add_argument("-b", "--blue", default=0, type=int, help="Value for blue (0 - 255)")
parser.add_argument("-d", "--delay", default=50, type=int, help="Light shift time in milliseconds")
args = parser.parse_args()

b1 = Blink1()
b1.fade_to_rgb(args.delay, args.red, args.green, args.blue)
</code>   

<p>Copy the code above into a file named <code>blink.py</code> and then try running it from the command line:</p>

   <code>python blink.py --green 128
</code>   

<p>This should turn the light green at about half brightness.</p>

<p>Turn it off with this command:</p>

   <code>python blink.py
</code>   

 Connecting Hammerspoon to the blink(1) USB LED 

<p>Now that you have a working Hammerspoon setup and a working Python script to control the blink(1) light, it’s time to tie them together!</p>

<p>Start by selecting Open Config from the Hammerspoon menu icon, then edit the <code>~/.hammerspoon/init.lua</code> file to look like the code below. Make sure to replace the path to the Python scripts with the path for your system!</p>

   <code>updateZoomStatus = function(event)
  hs.printf("updateZoomStatus(%s)", event)
  if (event == "from-running-to-meeting") then
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:returnToMenuBar()
  elseif (event == "muted") then
    hs.execute([["/Users/joel/Projects/mute/venv/bin/python" "/Users/joel/Projects/mute/blink.py" "--red" "128"]])
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:setTitle("🔴")
  elseif (event == "unmuted") then
    hs.execute([["/Users/joel/Projects/mute/venv/bin/python" "/Users/joel/Projects/mute/blink.py" "--green" "128"]])
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:setTitle("🟢")
  elseif (event == "from-meeting-to-running") then
    hs.execute([["/Users/joel/Projects/mute/venv/bin/python" "/Users/joel/Projects/mute/blink.py"]])
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:removeFromMenuBar()
  end
end
</code>   

<p>Once you’ve finished modifying the <code>updateZoomStatus()</code> function, save the file, then use the Hammerspoon menu icon to select the Reload Config menu item.</p>

<p>Try it all out by reloading Zoom and starting a meeting. If it’s all set up correctly, the blink(1) light should turn on shortly after the meeting starts!</p>

 Note for Zoom employees 

<p>If you are an employee of Zoom, I have a special message for you: I wish I could have made a mute indicator light without Hammerspoon.</p>

<p>My ideal way to integrate with Zoom would be to configure it to call a command line application every time the state changed inside of Zoom. In this dream scenario, I imagine opening up the Zoom preferences and putting the path to an executable file into a field somewhere. From then on, Zoom would call that executable file passing the event over the command line. In essence, I’d like to turn the <code>updateZoomStatus()</code> Lua function in my Hammerspoon configuration into a command line script.</p>

The company partnered with a digital media platform to distribute the movie. As a result, the media company earned $91 million and a share of advertising.</p>
<p>More than 40% of CIOs and IT leaders consider their relationship with <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-become-a-digital-dragon/">digital dragons</a> to be tactical and view them solely as technology providers. Less than 2% of businesses think of the digital giants as strategic business partners. These large enterprises can help scale cloud or provide payment and digital business platforms, but CIOs must first identify how they can be used to modify current business models.</p>
<p>It’s likely CIOs might shy away from partnering with their competition, but the reality is that many of these partnerships have proven successful for both parties.</p>
<p>Organizations can partner with digital dragons in five different ways:</p>
 
 No relationship: Organizations may choose to have no relationship with digital dragons for a number of reasons, including that the dragons are direct competitors, they don’t see the need for the benefits the dragons can provide or they deem the risk too high.&nbsp; 
 Customer-supplier relationship: This is the most common type of relationship. The organization is a customer of the dragon’s products and services.&nbsp; 
 Channel/platform relationship: Organizations use the dragon’s demand-side platforms and ecosystems, marketplaces and connections to the customer to increase reach. 
 New customer value partnership: The organization works with a dragon, each partner contributing specific assets and capabilities to provide new disruptive value to customers that neither could easily deliver alone.&nbsp; 
 Investment partnership: The organization invests alongside a dragon in researching and building new opportunities. 
 
 Leverage automation successfully&nbsp; 
<p>The loan application process can be cumbersome and complicated, which is not ideal for organizations looking for loans to fund the business during a pandemic. A bank in China invested heavily in automating its loan application process, leading to a supply chain product with online application review, verification, online lending and automated approval. This reduced the approval process time to 30 minutes, making it an attractive offering for businesses.</p>
<p>It’s not possible to automate every piece of the business, but look for vulnerable areas with frequent human error, slow completion time and tedious manual work. Once these areas are identified, work with business stakeholders to match them with the key automation technology. Focus on the three key technologies of robotic process automation (RPA), intelligent business process management suites (iBPMS) and integration platform as a service (iPaaS).</p>
<p>CIOs should consider several common areas of automation, including accounts payable, travel experiences, accounting, invoice delivery, sales operations, contract management and even payroll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For organizations looking to establish automation during COVID-19, recognize that hiring an entirely new team isn’t feasible. Instead, look to current employee skill sets. Focus on minimum viability automations over fully comprehensive automation and keep stakeholders looped into the process so the end result focuses on key business priorities.</p>

 Passwords are a burden on businesses and consumers. They’re expensive, insecure and difficult to manage — they must be eliminated. <p>Since the world went into lockdown, <a href="https://www.teiss.co.uk/covid-19-related-phishing-attacks-grew-by-600-worldwide/">hacking and phishing threats rose by over 600%</a>. With threats caused by compromised and weak credentials still rising by the day, one thing is clear: passwords are no longer able to fulfil the simple role they were designed&nbsp;for.</p> The problem with passwords  1. Stolen passwords are a top attack&nbsp;vendor <p>Stolen and weak passwords are one of top tools that criminals use when attempting to breach corporate networks. According to Verizon, stolen credentials and phishing attacks were the top cyberattack vendors last year, with at least <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/80-of-hacking-related-breaches-leverage-compromised-credentials/">eight in ten hacking incidents being tied back to compromised credentials.</a></p>Research from the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report 2020 found that stolen credentials and phishing attacks are still one of the top methods used by hackers to launch attacks on businesses. 2. Complex password policies are disregarded <p>To make matters worse,<a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/infographic-95-percent-share-6-passwords-with-friends.html"> employees often disregard password policies altogether,</a> with password sharing and reuse rampant in organizations. Unsprisingly, password sharing makes malicious actors coming across a set of company credentials extremely likely, giving them the power they need to launch large-scale attacks.</p> 3. Password costs skyrocketing <p>Organizations spend millions every year in a futile attempt to bolster the password. According to the World Economic Forum, a company with just 15,000 employees will spend <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">$5.2 million per year</a> for password resets alone, or a shocking $346 thousand per employee.</p> There is good news: 99% of all hacks can be eliminated with multi-factor authentication — <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/">Microsoft</a> <p>Yet according to a study by LastPass, only <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/57-percent-of-businesses-use-multi-factor-auth-mfa-says-lastpass/">57% percent of companies have implemented some form of multi-factor authentication.</a></p> Why are companies resisting strong authentication? <p>Multi-factor authentication solutions are not as widely adopted as they should be because legacy market solutions are too cumbersome on users and/or too expensive to deploy at scale. Making things even more complicated is the fact that there’s also major security red flags with some legacy multi-factor authentication solutions.</p><p>Legacy MFA solutions combine memorized secrets (passwords, PINs, secret answers), which are easily compromised, with secondary devices like (smartcards, hardware tokens or one-time codes sent via text to the user’s&nbsp;device).</p><p>While some MFA methods are indeed secure, others like those that rely on SMS-tokens, are not. For example, The Telegraph reports that over a five year period, UK customers<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/30/bank-customers-lose-91-million-five-years-sim-swap-scams/"> lost over £9 billion in sim swapping&nbsp;attacks.</a></p><blockquote>According to Verizon, human error is a top contributing factor to breaches and&nbsp;hacks.</blockquote><p>It should go without saying that human error and diligence play a major role in the effectiveness of legacy multi-factor authentication solutions. However, how diligent can a business expect its employees and users to be when attacks are becoming ever more sophisticated, and employees are under unprecedented amounts of pressure?</p> A simple, secure and passwordless alternative. <p>Keyless provides a simple, secure and interoperable authentication solution that allows organizations to solve the trade-offs between security, privacy and convenience.</p> Seamless user-experience combined with powerful&nbsp;security <p>At Keyless we combine seamless authentication with unparalleled security by providing a frictionless, passwordless solution for the workforce that is multi-factor by&nbsp;design.</p><p>Instead of relying upon memorized secrets to authenticate users, Keyless leverages advanced biometrics to authenticate a user in mere milliseconds — and all the user has to do is look into the camera of their trusted&nbsp;device.</p>The 3 authentication factors — knowledge (something you know), possession (something you have), inherence (something you&nbsp;are).<p>Replacing passwords with something the user is (their unique biometrics) not only greatly reduces friction during the authentication experience, but also eliminates threats caused by poor password management and human&nbsp;error.</p><p>Our solution is not dependent on third party vendors, which means it can be rolled out regardless of what platform and operating systems are being used, or what device a user&nbsp;owns.</p> Multi-factor by&nbsp;design <p>By leveraging the user’s device as a built-in second factor, Keyless provides seamless multi-factor authentication without the user needing to remember anything or carry additional devices (hard tokens, smart cards) with&nbsp;them.</p> Unparalleled privacy  Keyless is the only biometric, passwordless solution that combines the security of distributed systems with privacy-enhancing technology to store and process authentication data. <p>Keyless builds upon novel cryptographic techniques that allow our network to compare encrypted biometric templates — without decrypting them — in a matter of milliseconds. Because templates are never decrypted, they can be safely stored in the cloud where no personal information about the user can be extracted.</p><p>Storing encrypted, biometric data on our distributed network ensures that sensitive information is never stored on a user’s device, where there is risk of it being linked to a user’s identity if the device is lost or&nbsp;stolen.</p> Universal solutions for a global workforce <blockquote>True privacy, security and convenience can only be achieved with universal solutions that work from anywhere in the world, on any device, at any&nbsp;time.</blockquote><p>Our biometric multi-factor authentication solutions can be quickly integrated and deployed to a globally distributed workforce to enhance security and privacy — no matter what devices or operating systems employees use on their personal&nbsp;devices.</p><p>To ensure seamless and fast deployment, Keyless is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing identity management systems like ForgeRock, Okta and Ping Identity.</p><p>Since Keyless Solutions are device-agnostic and designed to integrate with existing systems, companies can save on costly and unnecessary overhauls to their current security infrastructure — meaning they can offer strong authentication quickly, at an affordable cost.</p><p>Keyless workforce multi-factor authentication solutions can be used&nbsp;for:</p> <a href="https://docsend.com/view/jcgqd8ppz8jzeuw3">Want to learn more about our workforce authentication solutions?

   Learn why the backbone of your IT stack may be overdue for an upgrade before it slows down productivity 

<p>The beautiful thing about IT is that it just runs. You open up your laptop, access your applications, and stay productive and focused throughout your day. The technology that goes on behind the scenes is somewhat irrelevant to your average user.</p>

<p>So when I say “directory services,” you may be tempted to move on and watch some cat videos on YouTube. Stay with me, humble reader, for herein lies an important message.</p>

 What are directory services? 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/directory-services">Directory services</a> are the databases that store some of the most essential information you need to do your job. They are often referred to as data stores, LDAP, and directories. The information stored in these vessels include your username, password(s), authentication preferences and enrollments, user preferences, application data and, more recently, information on devices such as mobile and Internet of Things (IoT). As you can see, much of this information is identity related.</p>

<p>What happens when you fire up an application? Whether it’s a cloud, mobile, or traditional application, and whether you’re using it for work or otherwise, the application is going to reach out to the one definitive source of identity truth in your organization – the directory. This is to validate that you’re still a legitimate user of the organization, that you’re authorized to access the application and to find out what you can do with it. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>But these days, directory services are under siege. Many organizations deployed their directory services many years ago, in the pre-cloud years, so they are running what we call “legacy” directories. While they still “work” in the traditional sense, there are reasons – both technical and non-technical – to believe we’re headed for a directory slow down.</p>

<p>The first reason is that the amount of information being put into directories is multiplying exponentially. Consider the “Things” in the Internet of Things (IoT). Estimates are that, in 2020 alone, the number of deployed Things will reach <a href="https://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/01/13/The-IoT-Rundown-for-2020.aspx?Page=1">31 billion</a>! That’s at least four times the number of people on the planet. And all this <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">IoT</a> data is being registered in directories.</p>

<p>The second reason directories are slowing down has to do with the ubiquitous nature of our work and home environments. Where do you work? If you’re like me, your work is anywhere you are. It’s certainly no farther away than your mobile phone or laptop in our hyper-connected world. This reality means directory services need to be distributed and highly available so that you can access the apps and services you need quickly. A slow link or an overwhelmed legacy directory sifting through millions of entries means you’ll wait to be authenticated and connected. Waiting is costly. Waiting is time. The result? Lost customers, decreased productivity for your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce</a> users, unhappy application owners, and a situation that will only get worse if not addressed quickly.</p>

<p>Directory services – the old iron of the business – need to go the way of the mainframe and green screen applications. They need to modernize!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that’s easier said than done. Modernizing directory services is probably not high on the list of projects for your IT database administrator this year. Or next year.</p>

<p>But there is a pathway, and real ROI to be realized by modernizing your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a> (IAM) solutions. It doesn’t have to be painful. ForgeRock has Accelerator toolkits that help organizations upgrade <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">legacy IAM</a> solutions in a prescribed way, so they can go at their own pace. Accelerators are a complete kit of everything you need to get started. They include documentation, reference architecture, and step-by-step processes that allow you to migrate one app at a time or 10 at a time, or many more.</p>

<p>Using a coexistence or just-in-time (JIT) strategy, you can run ForgeRock IAM alongside your existing directory to make sure there is no loss of data or lack of availability to applications. When you’re ready to cut the cord and move to modern IAM, you can disengage your legacy directory and say goodbye to those hefty maintenance costs.</p>

<p>ForgeRock has one of the few directory services on the market today that offers a deployment option to run in containers. A container is a ready-to-run software package that includes everything you need to run your directory service in a Kubernetes or Docker pod. They can run any cloud (or on premises) and use vastly fewer IT resources in your data center.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock</a> also natively supports all the apps you want, provides greater security, offers more fine-grained access control, and works both within and across your data centers.</p>

<p>For organizations to stay agile and productive, your directory services need to keep up with the growing needs or your users and customers. To learn more visit us online<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam"> at https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam</a>.</p>

  <p>2021 needs a reset.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/8-macro-factors-that-will-shape-the-2020s/">COVID-19 pandemic </a>disrupted businesses and global economies in unprecedented ways, but it also forced organizations to consider a different type of future. It became clear that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">businesses need a reset</a>, not only due to the pandemic, but because technological advances demand it.</p>
<p>“Technologies are being stretched to their limits,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/7521/Daryl-Plummer">Daryl Plummer</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/symposium-us">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>. “Nontraditional approaches will enable the next rebound of innovation and efficiency.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Plummer presented these Gartner top strategic predictions for 2021 and beyond.</p>
 Traditional technology tanks 
<p>By 2025, traditional computing technologies will hit a digital wall, forcing the shift to new computing paradigms such as neuromorphic computing.</p>
<p>As conventional silicon processors approach performance, economic and sustainability limits, they will limit digital initiatives and innovation, thereby limiting the growth of the business. New computing technologies, like neuromorphic computing — a computer that thinks and acts more like the human brain — will begin to take their place. As these new technologies mature, they will become increasingly available and more affordable for businesses to begin experimentation.</p>

 DNA storage becomes a reality 
<p>By 2024, 30% of digital businesses will mandate DNA storage trials, addressing the exponential growth of data poised to overwhelm existing storage technology.</p>
<p>People are collecting exponential amounts of<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/data-sharing-is-a-business-necessity-to-accelerate-digital-business/"> data</a>, more than has ever been collected before. Increasingly, the main challenge is not collecting the data — it’s storing it long term in a safe way. Right now, most data can be stored for a maximum of 30 years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of human knowledge could be stored in a small amount of synthetic DNA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DNA storage enables the storage of binary digital data in the double helix, taking binary coding and turning it into coding that fits in the human DNA strand. It would mean a year’s worth of human knowledge could be stored in a gram of synthetic DNA for thousands of years. In fact, all of human knowledge could be stored in a small amount of synthetic DNA.</p>
<p>Digital data (i.e., music, video, statistics) would be encoded in the nucleic acid base pairs of synthetic DNA strands. It sounds complex, but the technology is actually well-established and understood.</p>

<p>[swg_ad id="37663"]</p>
 Physical experiences expand 
<p>By 2025, 40% of physical-experiences businesses will improve financial results and outperform competitors by extending into paid virtual.</p>
<p>As the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual and augmented reality, digital twins and other technologies evolve, immersive experiences are now more affordable, and more fun. Businesses that provide physical experiences, like rock climbing or white-water rafting, must extend into paid virtual reality, offering virtual experiences that rival the physical ones.</p>
<p>At the same time, COVID-19 transformed attitudes about physical versus virtual, and changed the discussion about what people can do without physically being present or putting their safety at risk.</p>
<p>For example, a virtual bike ride through the mountains from the safety of your home gym or a roller coaster ride from your living room is more appealing to a larger audience. Beyond that, these immersive experiences enable people to relive in-person experiences long after they’re over or even share those experiences in real time with people who can’t join them.</p>
 Farms and factories face automation 
<p>By 2025, customers will be the first humans to touch more than 20% of the products and produce in the world.</p>
<p>Currently, a lot of people touch products and produce before they reach their ultimate destination, but automated factories and farms will soon do most of the work, including farming, picking, packing and shipping. New technologies are automating most processes, and that ability to automate will change how businesses operate and how they think about their business models.</p>
<p>Again, COVID-19 has acted as an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/prioritize-digital-business-initiatives-to-accelerate-into-the-future/">accelerator</a>, driving the industry to find new and improved ways of getting food and products to consumers. Additionally, as the technology continues to evolve, offering better automated factories — maybe ones that don’t squash the grapes — will one day act as a competitive advantage.</p>
 CIOs become chief operating officers (COOs) 
<p>By 2024, 25% of traditional large-enterprise CIOs will be held accountable for digital business operational results, effectively becoming “COO by proxy.”</p>
<p>A large percentage of end-user businesses do not have a COO, a vital role in digital acceleration. This is someone who understands the business and ecosystem and how to implement technology for greater impact.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has highlighted how CIOs can drive digitalization across the organization — and how CIOs who work across the business on digitalization instead of just focusing on IT are effectively working as COOs.</p>
<p>As a “COO by proxy,” the CIO will take on the organizationwide role and begin to close the gaps between what the technology can do, what the business can do and what the business wants to do. As they close these gaps, they can create business value and selectively create <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable/">composability in the business</a>.</p>
 Record work conversations drive change 
<p>By 2025, 75% of conversations at work will be recorded and analyzed, enabling the discovery of added organizational value or risk.</p>
<p>Every piece of technology, from smart speakers to virtual meetings to messaging platforms, now records conversations. Privacy is an illusion. Organizations need to begin to think about how to collect that data, how to analyze it and how to use it to improve the employee experience.</p>
<p>For example, it might be possible to measure — and work on improving — overall employee satisfaction. However, all this data collection comes at a risk. Create a board of ethics to ensure that the data is used responsibly,<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-principles-for-employee-privacy/"> people’s privacy</a> is respected and an opt-out option is included.</p>
 Freelance customer service experts increase 
<p>By 2025, customers will pay a freelance customer service expert to resolve 75% of their customer service issues.</p>
<p>Everyone has experienced the frustration of a bad customer service setup, and many turn to outside help (Google, YouTube, Facebook) to navigate tricky situations. In fact, Gartner predicts that through 2021, there will be a 15% rise in customers seeking outside help after being frustrated by traditional support channels.</p>
<p>The good news is that this means organizations will have reduced costs in certain customer service areas. The bad news is that more instances of outside help removes an important company-consumer touchpoint.</p>
<p>The best outside help will cost money, which means paying for a faster solution. Organizations should look to build a network of experts to help their customers, but also take the time to understand the legal ramifications of using third-party experts.</p>
 Voice of society metric matters 
<p>By 2024, 30% of major organizations will use a new voice of society metric to act on societal issues and assess the impacts to their business performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “voice of society” is the shared perspective of people in a community — one that works toward acceptable outcomes for all by advocating for fair and equal representation and adherence to ethical values.</p>
<p>Organizations must consider how society affects the performance of the business, and they have a responsibility to reduce or eliminate tone-deaf or insensitive racial and ethical concerns. Failure to do so can be damaging to the business.</p>
<p>Sentiment analysts, media metrics figures and contributions to society measurements will matter in 2021, and opinion metrics are now as reliable as click-through analysis. Organizations need to be able to measure what people are saying, and use composable solutions to react quickly.</p>

 On-site childcare entices employees 
<p>By 2023, large organizations will increase employee retention by more than 20% through repurposing office space as on-site childcare and education facilities.</p>
<p>Worker demand for childcare is still an unmet need, and the impact of COVID-19 on the number of available childcare centers is not to be underestimated. Gartner predicts that by early 2021, 20% of private childcare centers will have closed permanently, leaving a dearth of qualified providers. The impact of this will be especially hard on women in the workforce.</p>
<p>Accessible on-site childcare can increase retention, employee engagement and productivity. Plus, not having to choose between childcare and a job may result in more women in leadership positions over the long term. Organizations with on-site childcare will attract more candidates. This is also an effective way to use empty office space as businesses move toward more remote workers.</p>
 Malicious content takes over 
<p>By 2024, content moderation services for user-generated content will be surveyed as a top CEO priority by 30% of large organizations.</p>
<p>Any organizations that have an online presence, from social media to retailer platforms, face the challenge of how to deal with malicious content. Brand advertisers must neutralize polarizing content, and at the very least, show a balance between views. Eventually, industry standards for content moderation will emerge, but in the meantime, CIOs must invest in content moderation services, enforcement and reporting.<br>

<p>Digital identity innovation transpires in mysterious ways – and none seem as interesting as the recent conclusion of the 90-day experiment that the National Basketball Association ran to complete its season, popularly termed the “bubble”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some individuals (namely, fans of a historic franchise‚ it marked the joyous celebration of its first championship in ten years; for others, it was a somber day (i.e. game 5 Jimmy Butler hopefuls). For this OWI writer, it was mainly an opportunity to reflect upon the unique way in which the NBA chose to leverage digital identity — in particular, physical identity and access management (PIAM) — as well as the broad impact that the bubble will have on the sports industry and digital identity practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/07/16/nba-2020-return-disney-world-bubble-safety-aided-technology/5448594002/">A host</a> of <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/national-sports/sns-nyt-nba-bubble-life-coronavirus-20200806-qrby36mvffhlnkyot45hk7hqha-story.html">technologies</a>, designed to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spreading amongst the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29320883/inside-nba-100-page-safety-plan-big-questions-key-details">814 or so</a> NBA players, staffers, and coaches holed up in Orlando, were crucial to the bubble’s success. While among these, the most eye-catching tech may have been Oura, a $300 smart ring, (with a purported <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-bubble-oura-smart-ring-used-by-quarter-of-campus-2020-8">25%</a> of players, coaches, and staff wearing it), the wearable only acted as a small, optional asset to the larger system of physical identity and access management the NBA had set up in conjunction with Disney. In fact, I’d argue that the more important (and overlooked) technology, with broad ramifications for digital identity in everyday life, were the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2020/07/10/phoenix-suns-monty-williams-explains-essential-gadget-functions-orlando-bubble/5418966002/">Disney MagicBand </a>systems. Not only was it mandatory for every individual in the bubble to possess one, the bands were synchronized against <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/07/16/nba-2020-return-disney-world-bubble-safety-aided-technology/5448594002/">an individual’s health readiness</a> (i.e. forgetting to fill out symptom self-assessment denies entry) to allow entry to different access points. In essence, the NBA bubble created a stunningly successful PIAM system that managed and protected sensitive information and physical resources with appropriately tiered access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There and Back Again: Mapping OWI Predictions to the Present Moment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of our <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/product/the-perimeter-is-dead-148b-physical-access-market-to-lead-iam-growth/">predictions in 2018</a> about the PIAM market — including that border protection and terrorism/physical security would be tantamount as drivers for the market — may persist in being important for the general market. However, one might fairly conclude that during a pandemic seemingly without end in sight, PIAM’s future more closely resembles the NBA bubble: with digital credentials and wearables increasingly being leveraged against physical characteristics to broker access. Part of this shift has already happened with the introduction of old technologies in familiar places, such as <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2020/4/20/21228219/temperature-checks-coronavirus-testing-nyc-restaurants-reopening">temperature checks</a> for restaurants. Other parts of this shift have instead synthesized familiar products with newer contexts, including the use of <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/investigations/nbc-7-responds/artificial-intelligence-is-helping-usd-fight-the-pandemic/2424230/">facial recognition</a> alongside temperature checks to monitor mask usage and to <a href="https://www.usar.army.mil/News/Article/2381059/new-terminal-scanner-screens-temperatures-faces-to-improve-safety-at-usarc-fors/">trace the disease</a> across people to a limited capacity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, such a conclusion willfully ignores what is arguably the largest factor in determining PIAM’s growth – privacy. This concern is especially evident when observing the two technologies that have emerged as predominant modalities for access management: facial recognition and location/contact tracing. Facial recognition has long been somewhat of a hot-button topic for PIAM, and will likely be a bellwether for lasting change to PIAM adoption and public sensitivity. When, for example, Ticketmaster announced in 2018 that it had <a href="http://s1.q4cdn.com/788591527/files/doc_financials/2018/Q1/1Q18-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf">invested</a> in startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17329196/ticketmaster-facial-recognition-tickets-investment-blink-identity">Blink Identity</a> — which claims to be able to identify people walking by in “half a second” — musicians and fans alike were outraged. Numerous of the former called for a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/59n9yb/musicians-demand-ticketmaster-ban-facial-recognition-at-concerts">ban on the technology</a> at live events. &nbsp;Taylor Swift made headlines that same year for leveraging <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/13/taylor-swift-facial-recognition-stalkers-rose-bowl-concert">facial recognition</a> of concert attendees against a database of her known stalkers to administer stadium access. In the present moment, for school systems such as New York, <a href="https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/blog/data-privacy/2020/08/20/new-york-state-suspends-use-of-facial-recognition-in-public-schools">facial recognition technology</a> was placed under a moratorium to preserve privacy where possible. Similarly, contact tracing – spearheaded by nearly four dozen countries and large tech corporations to mitigate COVID-19 spread — has <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/17/contact-tracing-privacy-coronavirus-google-apple/">received significant backlash</a> in the United States for what some perceive to be privacy concerns around the government tracking their location or improper use of collected data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OWI Take</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve noted in our previous analysis that privacy will likely be an enduring issue for both vendors and regulators alike, and we anticipate this to persist even in light of COVID-19. The pandemic shift towards remote onboarding and digitized access has not offset any consumer sensitivity around data misuse or location tracking that have persisted with traditional PIAM products. With the bubble, residents were locked into participating for a few months and were more willing to shed concerns around potential privacy loss. PIAM enhancements were more easily accepted because residents bought into the integrity of the system and into the belief that the system was necessary as the best way to mitigate risk. And for those 90 days, the experiment worked to a tee. For many consumers in their day to day lives, however, the benefits aren’t as clear; some may even feel that because of their perceived ability to choose to engage with high risk environments (e.g. the grocery store), they don’t need enhanced PIAM as the best way to mitigate risk. As a result, consumers will likely continue to be guarded when it comes to their privacy, and the risk-benefit tradeoff for physical access — even during the pandemic — will not shift significantly.</p>

  <p>COVID-19 demonstrated how costly a fragile supply chain can be for organizations. When the pandemic became a global issue, organizations shut down, as did borders and governments, which left businesses scrambling for alternate supply chain options. Much of the challenges came from the speed at which things were delivered, with 51% of CIOs reporting a decrease in basic IT equipment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaders don’t expect that COVID-19 will be the last major disruption</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although slow speeds are not a trend CIOs expect will continue in 2021 — 51% foresee&nbsp; an increase in supply chain delivery speed — leaders also don’t expect that COVID-19 will be the last <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-digital-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming-in-the-next-5-years/">major disruption</a>. Moving forward, they are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/">preparing their organizations</a> and bracing for other potential hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1hYzcwNjQwYjEyZjcxMWViOWQ1OWU3ZTMxYjdiODBmYw=="></a></p>
<p>Top-performing companies are revamping supply chains to be more resilient; 40% say they will duplicate key suppliers to create more redundancy. Top performers are also bringing more businesses in-house as well as more sales and delivery. This is a shift from past years, when enterprises focused on developing the lowest-possible-cost supply chains to remain competitive.</p>
<p>Duplicating suppliers creates a more expensive supply chain, but also a more resilient one. Further pulling all those pieces back into the business, whether it’s sales, delivery or anything else, requires major business model changes — from talent shifts to contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line is that organizations don’t know what the future holds, but aggressive changes to business models at top performers reflect a desire to create an organization that can respond to whatever happens in the world. The goal is no longer the cheapest or highest-quality suppliers, but rather what will allow organizations to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">survive the next disruption</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 What to do 
<p>Creating a resilient supply chain will add cost, but CIOs can highlight technologies that will help mitigate some new expenses. For example, hyperautomation can enable manufacturers to locate factories closer to markets, yet remain competitive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider how other organizations are changing their supply chains and use crowdsourcing to create a platform where supply chain executives can submit their bold ideas. This will produce a diverse group of opinions, and reduce groupthink and tunnel vision.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>If you are familiar with any sort of real-time communications over the internet such as GoToMeeting, Google Meet, or Discord then chances are you have used WebRTC.  WebRTC is an open framework for handling real-time communications.  It supports video, voice, or any data between peers.  WebRTC is supported by Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, and many others.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a web application that allows a user to broadcast their video and voice in their room.  This room will be available for other users, called viewers, to join.  The viewers will be able to interact with the broadcaster via a chat functionality that will deliver messages to the entire room.</p>

<p>To create this application you will use Node.JS and Express for the server framework.  Web Sockets will handle the communication between peers in each room.  Okta will manage the authentication and identity for each user.  Finally, WebRTC will manage the broadcasting of the video and voice.</p>

 Create Your Okta Application 

<p>First, navigate to your Okta admin dashboard.  If you don’t have an Okta account yet you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up here</a>.  Once you’ve logged into the admin dashboard navigate to Applications and select Add Application.   On the next page select Web and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, on the Application Settings page, give your application a meaningful name.  You can leave the URLs as they are since you will configure your application to use port 8080 for development.  Click Done and Okta will create your application and bring you to the application page.  On the General tab make sure you note the Client ID and Client Secret as you will need these in your application.</p>

<p></p>

 Build the WebRTC Video Chat Application 

<p>You can now begin to build your application.  Open your favorite terminal and run the command <code>npm init -y</code> to initialize your node application in a folder where your application will live.  You will need some dependencies for your application.</p>

<p>First, Express will be the backbone of your application.  Express is one of the most popular web application frameworks for Node.js.  Also, you will want to install Express-Session at this time for session management.</p>

   <code>npm i express@4.17.1
npm i express-session@1.17.1
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need the Okta OIDC middleware and the Okta Node SDK.  Using these libraries you will be able to easily and quickly implement Okta’s sign-on provider.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@4.1.0
npm i @okta/oidc-middleware@4.0.1
</code>   

<p>You will use socket.io to manage the connections between peers.</p>

   <code>npm i socket.io@2.3.0
</code>   

<p>Pug will be the template engine for your views.  Pug is simple and easy to use.  Pug was previously known as Jade but has since rebranded so if you are familiar with Jade then you should have no trouble adapting.</p>

   <code>npm i pug@3.0.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, dotenv will store sensitive environment variables to keep out of your repository.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

 Create Your Node Server 

<p>Your server will consist of 4 files.  First, add a new file (if one hasn’t been created yet) called <code>index.js</code>.  Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>'use strict'

require('dotenv').config();

const server = require('./server')

const port = process.env.APP_BASE_PORT;

server.start({
    port: port
}).then(app =&gt; {
    console.log('Application is now running on port ' + port);
})
</code>   

<p>The index file serves as an entry point for your entire application.  Dotenv recommends you call require on the package as early in the app as possible.  The only other job of the index file is to start the server, which you will build shortly.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>routes.js</code>.  This file will contain the route definition for your application.</p>

   <code>module.exports = function (app, opts) {
  function ensureAuthenticated (request, response, next) {
    if (!request.userContext) {
      return response.status(401).redirect("/account/login");
    }

    next();
  }

  app.get("", (request, response, next) =&gt; {
    return response.render("home");
  });

  app.get("/dashboard", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {
    return response.render("dashboard", {
      user: request.userContext.userinfo,
      rooms: opts.rooms
    });
  });

  app.get("/broadcast", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {

    return response.render("broadcaster", {
      user: request.userContext.userinfo,
    });
  });

  app.get("/view/:room", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {
    return response.render("viewer", {
      user: request.userContext.userinfo,
      room: request.params.room
    });
  });

  app.get("/account/logout", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {
    request.logout();
    response.redirect("/");
  });

  app.get("/account/login", (request, response, next) =&gt; {
    return response.render("home");
  });
};
</code>   

<p>The routing information contained here includes handlers for logging in and out as well as providing routes for the views that you will display to users.  For routes that are under authentication, you are using the <code>ensureAuthenticated</code> middleware function at the top.  If the user isn’t authenticated they will be redirected to the login page.  The view route will take a parameter for the <code>room</code> that the user is joining.  The room will be named after the broadcaster.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>socket.js</code>.  This file will contain the bulk of your logic for managing the connection between the broadcaster and the viewers.</p>

   <code>module.exports = function (io, rooms) {
  io.sockets.on("connection", (socket) =&gt; {
    socket.on("broadcaster", (room, user) =&gt; {
      rooms.push({
        broadcaster: socket.id,
        room: room,
        user: user,
      });

      socket.join(room);
      socket.broadcast.emit("broadcaster");
    });

    socket.on("watcher", (room) =&gt; {
      var broadcast = rooms.filter((r) =&gt; r.room === room)[0];

      socket.join(room);
      socket.to(broadcast.broadcaster).emit("watcher", socket.id);
    });

    socket.on("disconnect", () =&gt; {
      var room = rooms.filter((r) =&gt; r.room === room)[0];

      if (room) {
        socket.to(room.broadcaster).emit("disconnectPeer", socket.id);
      }
    });

    socket.on("offer", (id, message) =&gt; {
      socket.to(id).emit("offer", socket.id, message);
    });

    socket.on("answer", (id, message) =&gt; {
      socket.to(id).emit("answer", socket.id, message);
    });

    socket.on("candidate", (id, message) =&gt; {
      socket.to(id).emit("candidate", socket.id, message);
    });

    socket.on("message-sent", (room, message, user) =&gt; {
      var broadcast = rooms.filter((r) =&gt; r.room === room)[0];
      io.to(broadcast.room).emit("message-received", user, message);
    });

    socket.on("end", (room) =&gt; {
      var broadcast = rooms.filter((r) =&gt; r.room === room)[0];
      rooms.splice(broadcast, 1);

      io.to(room).emit("end-broadcast");
    });
  });
};
</code>   

<p>There are three primary roles for the sockets.  First is managing the lifecycle of peer connections.  The broadcaster will create the room and admit viewers to the room.  When a viewer enters they should receive an SDP offer for the RTC connection.  An SDP offer contains information about the tracks already attached to the WebRTC session.  The broadcaster should also be informed if the user is leaving or entering.  Finally, the sockets will manage the chat functionality.  When a viewer wishes to communicate with the broadcaster they can type a message in their browser and it will appear on all clients.</p>

<p>Tying it all together you will need the server file.  This is the file that <code>index.js</code> runs when you first start the application.  The role of <code>server.js</code> is to register middleware, start the server, and delegate responsibility to the <code>socket.js</code> and <code>routes.js</code> files.  Add a new file called <code>server.js</code> and put in the following code.</p>

   <code>'use strict';

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const path = require('path');

const ExpressOIDC = require('@okta/oidc-middleware').ExpressOIDC;
const session = require('express-session');

const routes = require('./routes');
const sockets = require('./socket');

const start = function (options) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, p) =&gt; {
      console.log('Unhandled Rejection at: Promise', p, 'reason:', reason);
    });

    if (!options.port) {
      reject(new Error('no port specified'));
    }

    const app = express();
    const http = require('http').createServer(app);
    const io = require('socket.io')(http);

    var rooms = [];

    app.use(express.static('public'));
    app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, '/public/views'));
    app.set('view engine', 'pug');

    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

    app.use(function (error, request, response, next) {
      console.log(error);
      reject(new Error('something went wrong' + error));
      response.status(500).send('something went wrong');
    });

    const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
      issuer: process.env.OKTA_BASE_URL + '/oauth2/default',
      client_id: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET,
      appBaseUrl: process.env.APP_BASE_URL,
      scope: 'openid profile',
      routes: {
        login: {
          path: '/users/login',
        },
        callback: {
          path: '/authorization-code/callback',
        },
        loginCallback: {
          afterCallback: '/dashboard',
        },
      },
    });

    app.use(
      session({
        secret:
          'asd;skdvmfebvoswmvlkmes";lvmsdlfbvmsbvoibvms"dplvmdmaspviresmpvmrae";vm"psdemr',
        resave: true,
        saveUninitialized: false,
      })
    );

    app.use(oidc.router);

    routes(app, { rooms: rooms });
    sockets(io, rooms);

    const server = http.listen(options.port, function () {
      resolve(server);
    });
  });
};

module.exports = Object.assign({}, { start });
</code>   

<p>The <code>server.js</code> file does most of the work for the server-side of the application.  First, it creates a new instance of Express.  It also creates a new instance of socket.io for web sockets.  This file will also register the sockets class you wrote earlier.  To manage the rooms you are passing an array from this file into your sockets and routes.  You will set the view engine to pug and register any routes you may need.  Finally, you will need to register the Okta middleware for authentication and authorization.</p>

<p>One last thing you want to do is add a file called <code>.env</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>OKTA_BASE_URL={yourOktaDomain}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
APP_BASE_PORT=8080
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>Remember to add this file to your <code>.gitignore</code> file so you don’t push sensitive data into your source control.</p>

 Add Client Code to the Video Chat Application 

<p>Now it’s time to add the client-side code.  Create a new folder called <code>public</code>.  In that folder add two more folders, <code>views</code> and <code>js</code>.  First, start with the views.</p>

<p>The first file you want to add is called <code>layout.pug</code>.  Add this file to the <code>views</code> folder and insert the following code.</p>

</code>   

<p>The layout file is pretty simple. First, you are including any of your required javascript or style.  For this project, you are using bootstrap because it is nice and simple.  The layout also provides a header and footer for common elements that the entire site will use.  The header checks if the user is populated from the server and displays a login button if there is no user and a logout button if there is.</p>

<p>Next, add a view for <code>home.pug</code> in the <code>views</code> folder.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Home'

block content

    p Hey there, in order to access this page, please
      a(href="/users/login") Login here.
</code>   

<p>The home view extends the layout page you just created and delivers a message to the user that they must log in.</p>

<p>Add another view called <code>dashboard.pug</code>.  This view will simply give the user a list of available rooms to join and allow the user to start their broadcast.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Welcome to Broadcaster'

block content
  .row
    .col-lg-3
      h3 Broadcasters
      if rooms.length == 0
        span there are no broadcasters online
      else
        ul
          each room, i in rooms
            li
              a(href="view/"+room.room ) #{room.user}
    .col-lg-9
      .jumbotron
        h1 Broadcast yourself
        p.lead You can broadcast your own videos here.
        hr.my-4
        p.lead Give it a try
        a(href="Broadcast")
          button.btn.btn-primary Start Broadcasting
</code>   

<p>Finally, you can add the <code>broadcaster.pug</code> and <code>viewer.pug</code> views.  First, add the following code to <code>broadcaster.pug</code>.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Broadcast yourself'

block content
  div#message
  div#broadcast
    .row
      .col-lg-12.align-self-center.text-center
        video#localVideo(playsinline autoplay muted)
    .row.mb-2
      .col-lg-12
        table#chat-table.table.table-striped
          tr

  script(src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.3.0/socket.io.js")
  script(src="https://webrtc.github.io/adapter/adapter-latest.js")
  script(src="..\\js\\broadcaster.js")
  script.
      broadcaster('!{JSON.stringify(user)}')
</code>   

<p>The view has a local video that the user can see themselves on.  There is also a table that will display the chat messages as they appear from the viewers.  You will be including scripts for socket.io’s client library as well as webRTC’s adapter.  You will also include a file called <code>broadcaster.js</code> that you will add later.</p>

<p>The <code>viewer.pug</code> view looks similar.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Chat'

block content
  div#message
  div#broadcast
    video#remoteVideo(playsinline autoplay)
    .row.mb-2
      .col-lg-12
        table#chat-table.table.table-striped
          tr
    .row
      .col-lg-10
        input#chat-message(type=text placeholder="enter a message").form-control

</code>   

<p>Of course on this file, you are including <code>viewer.js</code> instead of <code>broadcaster.js</code>.  This view also includes a form for inputting the chat message and a button for sending it.</p>

<p>To bring these two views to life, you need to create the JavaScript files for each.  First, you can start by adding <code>broadcaster.js</code> to the <code>public/js</code> folder.  The code there follows.</p>

   <code>function broadcaster(data) {
  var socket = io();

  var user = JSON.parse(data);

  const peerConnections = {};
  const localVideo = document.getElementById("localVideo");

  const config = {
    iceServers: [
      {
        urls: ["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"],
      },
    ],
  };

  navigator.getUserMedia(
    { video: true, audio: true },
    (stream) =&gt; {
      if (localVideo) {
        localVideo.srcObject = stream;
        socket.emit("broadcaster", user.sub, user.name);
      }
    },
    (error) =&gt; {
      $('#broadcast').remove();
      $('#message').append('&lt;h3&gt;We were unable to detect a webcam&lt;/h3&gt;');
      console.warn(error.message);
    }
  );

  socket.on("watcher", (id) =&gt; {
    const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(config);
    peerConnections[id] = peerConnection;

    let stream = localVideo.srcObject;
    stream
      .getTracks()
      .forEach((track) =&gt; peerConnection.addTrack(track, stream));

    peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) =&gt; {
      if (event.candidate) {
        socket.emit("candidate", id, event.candidate);
      }
    };

    peerConnection
      .createOffer()
      .then((sdp) =&gt; peerConnection.setLocalDescription(sdp))
      .then(() =&gt; {
        socket.emit("offer", id, peerConnection.localDescription);
      });
  });

  socket.on("answer", (id, description) =&gt; {
    peerConnections[id].setRemoteDescription(description);
  });

  socket.on("candidate", (id, candidate) =&gt; {
    peerConnections[id].addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate));
  });

  socket.on("message-received", (name, message) =&gt; {
    console.log(name, message);
    $("#chat-table tr:last").after(
      '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="width:20%"&gt;' + name + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;" + message + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"
    );
  });

  socket.on("disconnectPeer", (id) =&gt; {
    peerConnections[id].close();
    delete peerConnections[id];
  });

  window.onunload = window.onbeforeunload = () =&gt; {
    socket.emit('end', user.sub)
    socket.close();
  };
}
</code>   

<p>This file does all the heavy lifting for the broadcaster.  First, it captures the stream from the client’s machine.  This will require the user grant permissions to your site.  It sends a message using the socket connection back to the server which initiates the room creation and lets the dashboard know that there is a new room available.  It also handles the incoming requests as viewers enter the room.  When a viewer enters the room, this sends a message to the server which then sends it back to the broadcaster letting the broadcaster know a new user is there.  The broadcaster page then handles the event by sending an offer to the viewer with the broadcaster’s streaming tracks.</p>

<p>The broadcaster file also handles the messages that are displayed in the chatbox.  When a viewer enters a new message this goes again, to the server then back to the broadcaster.  The broadcaster page then takes the name of the viewer and the message and adds a row to the table so the broadcaster can see the message.</p>

<p>Finally, this page handles what happens when the broadcaster leaves the page.  The <code>window.onunload</code> event is handled by sending a message to the server than the broadcaster has ended the stream.  The server will relay that message to the server.</p>

<p>Finally, you can add the <code>viewer.js</code> file.</p>

   <code>function viewer(room, data) {

  var user = JSON.parse(data);
  const socket = io.connect(window.location.origin);

  let peerConnection;
  const config = {
    iceServers: [
      {
        urls: ["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"],
      },
    ],
  };

  const video = document.getElementById("remoteVideo");

  socket.on("offer", (id, description) =&gt; {
    peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(config);
    peerConnection
      .setRemoteDescription(description)
      .then(() =&gt; peerConnection.createAnswer())
      .then((sdp) =&gt; peerConnection.setLocalDescription(sdp))
      .then(() =&gt; {
        socket.emit("answer", id, peerConnection.localDescription);
      });
    peerConnection.ontrack = (event) =&gt; {
      video.srcObject = event.streams[0];
    };
    peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) =&gt; {
      if (event.candidate) {
        socket.emit("candidate", id, event.candidate);
      }
    };
  });

  socket.on("candidate", (id, candidate) =&gt; {
    peerConnection
      .addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate))
      .catch((e) =&gt; console.error(e));
  });

  socket.on("broadcaster", () =&gt; {
    socket.emit("watcher", room);
  });

  socket.on("disconnectPeer", () =&gt; {
    peerConnection.close();
  });

  socket.on("end-broadcast", () =&gt; {
    $("#broadcast").remove();
    $('#message').append('&lt;h2&gt;This stream has ended&lt;/h2&gt;')
  });

  socket.on("message-received", (name, message) =&gt; {
    $("#chat-table tr:last").after(
      '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="width:20%"&gt;' + name + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;" + message + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"
    );
  });

  $("#chat-button").on("click", function () {
    var message = $("#chat-message").val();
    socket.emit("message-sent", room, message, user.name);
    $("#chat-message").val("");
  });

  window.onunload = window.onbeforeunload = () =&gt; {
    socket.close();
  };

  socket.emit("watcher", room);
}
</code>   

<p>Like <code>broadcaster.js</code>, this file will manage the connections between the server and this page.  It includes some logic for sending chat messages as well.</p>

 Run Your WebRTC Video Chat Application 

<p>To start your application you can run <code>node index.js</code>.  You should see a message in your console that the application is running on port 8080.  You can then navigate to localhost:8080 and see the home page.  Use the login button to log in with Okta.  From your dashboard you can click Start New Broadcast which will bring you into the Broadcast room.  To test the viewer I used chrome and opened a new incognito window.  Again login and, from the dashboard, select the room with your username.  Once you enter the <code>view</code> page you should see yourself, but that video is being streamed from your original browser window.  Send a message through the chatbox and switch back to see it.</p>

<p>The MATTR team is excited to announce a critical new addition to our product capabilities. We’re continuing to build out an extensive suite of features to support the exchange of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;(VCs), leveraging the best efforts of the open-source community along with a number of distinct product innovations. These innovations include our recent work related to using&nbsp;<a href="https://mattr.global/using-privacy-preserving-zkp-credentials-on-the-mattr-platform/">BBS+ signatures for privacy-preserving selective disclosure</a>&nbsp;and our earlier work on the<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">&nbsp;OIDC Credential Provider spec.</a>&nbsp;We’ve also been busy sharing new tools for&nbsp;<a href="https://mattr.global/new-to-json-ld-introducing-json-ld-lint/">checking the syntax of a JSON-LD credential</a>&nbsp;during development.</p>



<p>In this product release, we are focused on one of the fundamental capabilities in any credential-based system: the ability to provably revoke a credential when it’s no longer valid. Using verifiable data in combination with open standards not only improves the quality of the data exchanged in an ecosystem, it also enables the authority (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer">issuer</a>) on any piece of information to maintain that data throughout its lifecycle. In practice, this means that credential issuers can manage the status of a credential directly, using the same general mechanism as the one used for issuing VCs.</p>



<p>Credentials are typically stored by the user (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject">subject</a>) in some kind of digital wallet where they are able to manage their credentials and control when and how to share their data. When accessing services, the user may consent to present their VCs to a relying party (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifier">verifier</a>). The relying party needs to be able to be able to verify the credential is genuine and tamper free. They also need to be able to easily validate whether a presented credential has been revoked or not.</p>



<p>For example, say you’re issued a digital driver’s license, then you go and get several speeding tickets. The department that issued your license determines you have breached the terms of your license and consequently, suspends your license. In doing so, the credential status is changed, and next time a relying party checks the status they will be able to see that you are no longer entitled to drive. If a car rental office is checking your driving status in order to loan you a vehicle, they’d like to be able to verify if the digital license is still valid and legitimate.</p>



User journey viewing a credential &amp; presentation request with a revoked credential.



<p>In general, we want to accomplish all of these goals while minimizing the burden on data issuers and verifiers, and preserving the autonomy of credential holders in deciding how to store and disclose their data. We also want to remain flexible around where the revocation list is stored and managed, so we opted to implement an approach that’s extensible to different types of infrastructure supported by the issuer. The resulting solution contrasts with others that have tended to be tightly coupled with a particular kind of infrastructure such as a distributed ledger. We believe revocation should be built in a simple, transparent, and standardizable manner, which is why we built our approach on the W3C CCG’s&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-rl-2020/">Credential Revocation List</a>.</p>



<p>Practically, the information regarding whether a credential has been revoked is represented in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status">credential status</a> property of a VC, as defined in the W3C spec. When a credential is first created, the issuer can include in the credential status field a reference to a publicly available revocation list. This list can be updated by the issuer at any time, so resolving this reference will always get you the latest revocation status. The retrieved revocation list is in the form of a&nbsp;<a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>&nbsp;based verifiable credential, making it straightforward to validate. Holders and verifiers can simply check this revocation list to determine if a specific VC has been revoked or not. Since the revocation list contains the revocation status of many credentials, credential subjects get “herd privacy” with regards to the issuer, meaning the issuer doesn’t know where an issued credential is being used. This protects the holder against one form of surveillance and potential leakage of their personal data. Some use cases will require solutions that offer an even greater level of privacy for credential subjects, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_%28cryptography%29">cryptographic accumulators</a>. We are actively working on a number of improvements in this area which will offer enhanced privacy for credential holders when it’s required and simplify the process of relying parties validating a credential’s status.</p>



<p>We’ve implemented this functionality using a simple optional flag on our VC issuance API, allowing issuers to toggle between credentials that support revocation and those that don’t. On the holder side, our&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet App</a>&nbsp;automatically checks the revocation status when opened, alerting the user of any changes and giving them a warning if it’s revoked. For verifiers, validating credential status is a standard part of our VC verification API, so validation will automatically fail if the credential is revoked.</p>



<p>Integrating revocation into our platform brings us one step closer to building a fully realized verifiable data ecosystem, an environment where verifiers can have more confidence and trust in the decisions they’re making and people can participate in the sharing and exchange of information without eroding their basic privacy. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the community and gathering feedback from industry to enhance and extend different ways to accomplish revocation while respecting users’ digital rights.&nbsp;<a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">Sign up</a>&nbsp;on our website to get access to our platform and check out&nbsp;<a href="http://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/revocation/revocation-overview">MATTR Learn</a>&nbsp;to start issuing revocable credentials.</p>

 The GiD Report#131 — #IIW31, Filecoin’s launch, what the original iPhone teaches us about innovation <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-130-its-no-accident-that-big-tech-are-monopolies-63d518f05619">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>GlobaliD’s Dev Bharel and Alexis Falquier are taking part in the 31st annual Internet Identity Workship (the birthplace of self-sovereign identity) from today until Thursday. Stay tuned for a full&nbsp;recap!</p>#IIW31 with nearly 250 participants from around the&nbsp;world  Filecoin launch  WIRED on online&nbsp;parks  What the original iPhone teaches us about networks and innovation  Satya Nadella on Microsoft’s SSI initiative  Stuff happens   1. Filecoin’s hotly anticipated mainnet launched last week on Oct.&nbsp;15. Filecoin and IPFS creator Juan Benet, Photo: Protocol&nbsp;Labs<p>If you’ll recall, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> was one of the hottest ICOs of 2017, raising $205 million in its token sale. The vision was a decentralized storage alternative to centralized cloud solutions like Amazon Web Services built around the Interplanetary File System or IPFS protocol.</p><p>And though there were some early hiccups since the launch <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-price-first-trading-futures">around price volatility</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-miners-go-on-strike-one-day-after-mainnet-launch-prompting-early-reward-release">mining economics</a>, as you might expect with a much hyped release, Filecoin is now&nbsp;live!</p><p>If you’re curious about how IPFS works, Hacker Noon <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f">has a useful beginner’s guide</a>.</p><p>First off, the way we manage our data hasn’t really changed much since the birth of the&nbsp;Web:</p><blockquote>HTTP is great for loading websites but it wasn’t designed for the transfer of large amounts data (like audio and video files). These constraints possibly enabled the emergence and mainstream success of alternative filesharing systems like Napster (music) and BitTorrent (movies and pretty much anything).</blockquote><blockquote>Fast forward to 2018, where on-demand HD video streaming and big data are becoming ubiquitous; we are continuing the upward march of producing/consuming more and more data, along with developing more and more powerful computers to process them. Major advancements in cloud computing have helped sustain this transition, however the fundamental infrastructure for distributing all this data has remained largely the&nbsp;same.</blockquote><p>IPFS looks to change&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>IPFS attempts to address the deficiencies of the client-server model and HTTP web through a novel p2p file sharing system. This system is a synthesis of several new and existing innovations. IPFS is an open-source project created by Protocol Labs, an R&amp;D lab for network protocols and former Y Combinator startup. Protocol Labs also develops complementary systems like IPLD and Filecoin, which will be explained below. Hundreds of developers around the world contributed to the development of IPFS, so its orchestration has been a massive undertaking.</blockquote><p>The end&nbsp;result?</p><blockquote>IPFS provides high throughput, low latency, data distribution. It is also decentralized and secure. This opens up several interesting and exciting use cases. It can be used to deliver content to websites, globally store files with automatic versioning &amp; backups, facilitate secure filesharing and encrypted communication.</blockquote><p>Where Filecoin comes into&nbsp;play:</p><blockquote>Filecoin is a separate protocol designed to add economic incentives to file storage on IPFS, and foster a distributed storage market that rivals enterprise cloud storage (like Amazon S3, etc). Instead of centralized infrastructure with fixed pricing, IPFS + FileCoin offers storage on a global network of local providers who have the freedom to set prices based on supply and demand. Instead of a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm like Bitcoin, Filecoin uses Proof-of-Storage to ensure security and reliability. So anyone can join the network, offer unused hard drive space on their computing device, and get rewarded in Filecoin tokens for data storage and retrieval services.</blockquote><p>All of which is really neat and a reminder that there is a ton of really cool innovation continuing to happen in the space. What also sets Filecoin apart is how successfully they’ve been at getting the word out and drumming up interest in the project. At the time of this writing, their newly launched token has a market cap north of around $600&nbsp;million.</p><p>And as Greg Kidd has noted, you could see a future where GlobaliD employs Filecoin for our self-sovereign storage solution.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-mainnet-launch">Filecoin Confirms Long-Awaited Mainnet Launch for Next Month — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f">A Beginner’s Guide to IPFS | Hacker&nbsp;Noon</a>   2. So Filecoin is a really cool idea with a ton of potential. And in time when more and more of our lives happen online, we need more cool ideas. WIRED’s idea? We need more and better online&nbsp;parks. <p>It’s how we could fix the “broken internet,” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/to-mend-a-broken-internet-create-online-parks/">WIRED suggests</a> (via&nbsp;Mitja):</p><blockquote>We need public spaces, built in the spirit of Walt Whitman, that allow us to gather, communicate, and share in something bigger than ourselves.</blockquote><p>And private parks won’t do the&nbsp;trick:</p><blockquote>MUCH OF OUR communal life now unfolds in digital spaces that feel public but are not. When technologists refer to platforms like Facebook and Twitter as “walled gardens” — environments where the corporate owner has total control — they’re literally referring to those same private pleasure gardens that Whitman was reacting to. And while Facebook and Twitter may be open to all, as in those gardens, their owners determine the&nbsp;rules.</blockquote><blockquote>Venture-backed platforms make poor quasi-public spaces for three&nbsp;reasons.</blockquote><blockquote>First, as the legendary venture capitalist Paul Graham put it, “startups = growth.” The focus on growth — of users, of time spent, and then of revenue — is the defining trait that has made Facebook a $750 billion company. And the key to rapid growth is optimization to create a “frictionless” experience: The more relevant the content you see, the likelier you are to click, return to Facebook, and bring your&nbsp;friends.</blockquote><blockquote>But friction is essential to public space. Public spaces are so generative precisely because we run into people we’d normally avoid, encounter events we’d never expect, and have to negotiate with other groups that have their own needs. The social connections that run-ins create, social scientists tell us, are critical in binding communities together across lines of difference. Building a healthy community requires the careful generation of this thick web of social ties. Rapid growth can quickly overwhelm and destroy it — as anyone who has lived in a gentrifying neighborhood knows.</blockquote><p>Also, the challenges (the first of which is funding):</p><blockquote>Second, there’s a talent and research problem. People outside of tech generally underestimate how hard it is to build something seamless, intuitive, and irresistible that allows millions of people to interact. We need to rally a diverse, representative generation of builders to this cause. And given that digital products live and die by metrics, we need to identify signals that correspond to flourishing public digital&nbsp;spaces.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, there’s a problem of public imagination. Fixing our ability to connect and build healthy communities at scale is arguably an Apollo mission for this generation — a decisive challenge that will determine whether our society progresses or falls back into conspiracy-driven tribalism. We need to summon the creative will worthy of a problem of this urgency and consequence.</blockquote><p>Sounds like a potential use case for SSI and GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups.</p>  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/to-mend-a-broken-internet-create-online-parks/">To Mend a Broken Internet, Create Online&nbsp;Parks</a>   3. Apple unveiled the latest iPhone last week and it’s a reminder that for innovation to flourish, we need to push back against the networks and platforms that rule over&nbsp;us. <p>In the case of the iPhone, it was the cell phone companies — <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201015&amp;instance_id=23165&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=41130&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2F76e3cce1-c376-51de-9279-d23bd7ece429&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">from the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>In the pre-iPhone age, we had years of clunky mobile devices, and phone providers like AT&amp;T deserved a lot of the&nbsp;blame.</blockquote><blockquote>Phone companies dictated almost everything about flip phones and early smartphones, including their features, look and speed. People had to put up with crummy software from the phone company to surf the web or download songs and ringtones. (Remember ringtones?!) It&nbsp;stank.</blockquote><blockquote>One of the secrets to the iPhone’s success is Apple simply said no to all of that. Apple’s chief executive at the time, Steve Jobs, gave wireless phone companies an ultimatum: Stay out of every decision about the iPhone or lose a shot at selling a potential blockbuster.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple got its way, the iPhone was eventually a success and phone companies got rich from it alongside Apple.</blockquote><p>How times have changed as we now find Apple on the other side of the equation.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/apple-at-a-crossroads-an-interview-with-m-g-siegler-5d3fc71ac48e">Apple at a Crossroads: An Interview With M.G.&nbsp;Siegler</a>   4. The other week, we talked about how Microsoft was adhering to newly laid out principles regarding their app store — clearly a shot at what’s going on with Epic v. Apple and Google. Microsoft has also been one of the biggest brands/companies at the forefront of the self-sovereign identity SSI movement. <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoIOFEp2HiY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3228">Satya Nadella talking&nbsp;SSI</a>:</p><blockquote>We’re going further, working to create an open, decentralized identity system that is independent of any central authority or tech company even. Military veterans are already piloting these capabilities to jumpstart their&nbsp;careers.</blockquote><blockquote>Veterans now store their verified service records and transcript in a digital wallet on their phone, which they can share directly a university or an employee. Universities can validate it in seconds and never have to store the sensitive data. Veterans can add verified credentials to their LinkedIn profile to help them stand out and opening up new career opportunities.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/nationalism-threat-to-digital-identity-4/">Nationalism &amp; Its Threat to Digital Identity: Part 4 — One World&nbsp;Identity</a>  Deloitte: <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/annual-report-2020/stories/digital-identity.html">Digital identity: proving it’s&nbsp;you</a>  <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/93356-self-sovereign-identity-the-true-password-killer">Self-sovereign identity: The true password&nbsp;killer</a>  EFF: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/digital-identification-must-be-designed-privacy-and-equity-10">Digital Identification Must Be Designed for Privacy and&nbsp;Equity</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-reshape-internet">Self-Sovereign Identity in 2030 Explained — CoinDesk</a>   5.

  <p>Despite the rocky economic climate in 2020, IT leaders expect a 2.0% increase, on average, in the IT budget for 2021, according to the Gartner CIO Agenda. And they’re not deluding themselves. Boards of directors plan to increase spending on IT and technology by an average of 6.9% across the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At top organizations, CIOs face fewer constraints, with 28% saying that they have secured additional funding</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The investment makes sense, as organizational leaders intend to spend more resources more rapidly on digital acceleration to better adapt to the changing economic conditions caused by the pandemic. Despite the uncertainty created by COVID-19, top performers seized an opportunity to lean into the shift resulting from the pandemic and increase funding for digital innovation. They invested more quickly, and those investments mattered. Organizations that increased funding of digital innovation are 2.7 times more likely to be a top performer than a trailing one.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz0yNjBmMDM0MTEyNDQxMWViOTk5Y2U3ZTMxYjdiODBmYw=="></a></p>
<p>However, looking into the future, the gap starts to close for 2021 planning, with 69% of top performers planning to increase digital innovation funding compared to close to 68% of typical performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more telling is what differentiates the process of gaining additional IT funds in top versus trailing organizations. At top organizations, CIOs face fewer constraints, with 28% saying that they have secured additional funding specifically to support more experimentation/risk-taking in IT. That number is closer to 19% for trailing organizations.&nbsp;</p>
 What CIOs can do 
<p>Ensure that IT’s initiatives align with digital business acceleration and draft business cases around digital channels. Look for back-office projects for finance, marketing or HR that can be put on the back burner to reallocate funding to digital innovation.&nbsp;</p>

In fact, machines soon will know more about your physical well-being than you do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody can see the future exactly as it will happen, so we have to be prepared</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This raises a host of questions: Should a computer tell you about a potential medical issue? Can you sue the people who own the software if they don’t tell you and it results in something harmful? Is telling you that you have a serious medical condition the right thing to do?</p>
<p>This is called technological biohacking, and it’s one of seven digital disruptions that you might not see coming, and like the others on the list, it could change the world.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37663"]</p>
<p>“Nobody can see the future exactly as it will happen, so we have to be prepared. We have to proof against what might happen,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/7521">Daryl Plummer</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/symposium-us">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo™ 2020</a> . “We’re in for a decade of radical technology disruption. Now’s the time to get started.”</p>
<p>It’s important to know the different types of change:</p>
 
 
<p>Features: Continuous improvement of constant changes and add-ons.</p>
 
 
<p>Fads: Short-term, very exciting, high-impact things that fade quickly.</p>
 
 
<p>Disruption: Something that comes a little after a fad, but stays and changes business models. This is a fundamental change.</p>
 
 
<p>Organizations should focus on identifying the disruptions that will have long-term effects on the world. This, historically, has included things like streaming services to televisions or ride shares.</p>
 No. 1: Nontraditional compute technologies 
<p>Nontraditional compute technologies are technologies you can’t afford to ignore. As Moore’s Law approaches its potential breaking point, new technology will need to take over. And Moore’s Law is only one technological axiom at risk. Already, deep-neural networks, DNA storage, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-quantum-computing/">quantum computing</a> and other technologies are changing the way organizations think about compute styles and models, and how those styles will expand the limits of computational power.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021/">Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2021</a></p>
<p>Computing technologies are evolving from traditional to digital, and then to neuromorphic, which allows them to be more human-like. Chips are getting smaller and more dense, new materials and markets are evolving, and the cost of computing is changing. These technologies are also creating new selling opportunities and products.</p>
 No. 2: DNA data storage 
<p>DNA data storage tackles the challenge of massive data storage and longevity. This technology enables the storage of unprecedented amounts of technology for thousands of years in a small space and in a less corruptible form. It does this by encoding binary data in the base pairs of synthetic DNA. Storage of petabytes, exabytes or even yottabytes of data in mere grams of synthetic DNA is possible.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that 5 exabytes could store every spoken word ever uttered by humans. One single gram of DNA could store all the knowledge generated by humans in one year. That data can then be stored wherever it’s needed. For example, it could be stored in your car engine, for use with repairs. DNA data will radically change how humans handle, store and retrieve data.</p>
 No. 3: Distributed cloud 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-distributed-cloud/">Distributed cloud</a> is where cloud services are distributed to different physical locations, but the operation, governance and evolution remain the responsibility of the public cloud provider. This means the services are where the customer needs them, but are still the responsibility of the public cloud. In addition, reduced cost of data egress is supported for high-data-traffic applications like machine learning. Data sovereignty can be assured because the cloud services are kept in a specific geographic location but can still be in the public cloud.</p>
 No. 4: Digital twin of the earth 
<p>Traditionally, digital twins exist in a very specific, discrete context. But, “if we can see it, we can duplicate it,” said Plummer.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-digital-twins-simplify-the-iot/">digital twin</a> of the earth would afford a holistic view of how our climate is changing around the globe, how pollution is traveling from place to place, and even how ships are tracked from port to port. This changes how humans think about mapping, tracking, physical operations and emergency services.</p>
<p>For example, a digital twin of the earth would be able to alert authorities to the smallest brush fire before it burns out of control. The earth becomes a monitoring ground for low-earth-orbit satellites to help create simulations of everything from beach soil erosion to animal migrations to human behavioral tracking.</p>
 No. 5: Augmented humans 
<p>Right now, computers are able to translate thoughts into text and onto a screen. Next up? Pictures pulled from the mind; the same technology would enable people to put their memories or images back into their brain. Technology will also allow humans to augment themselves — from exoskeletons for superhuman speed to implants for superhuman hearing. This will change what it means to be human, but will also raise some serious ethical questions. However, augmentation also has the potential to help people live better lives.</p>
 No. 6: Technological biohacking 
<p>Everything is recorded. Computers are constantly listening, analyzing and storing data, but there are questions about the use of that information. This is especially important as computers begin to collect data that you’re unconsciously sharing, from physical health to verbal triggers, as seen in the intro example.</p>
<p>If a camera in a public park can identify something about your health that you didn’t even know, the concern is no longer maintaining privacy as much as it is understanding how your private information is used. However, when used in aggregate, biohacking can result in cheaper drug production and better medical options.</p>
 No. 7: Emotional experiences 
<p>Can you be fired if you’re not happy enough? Computers with cameras can now tell if you’re upset, sad, angry or distressed, which means theoretically organizations could evaluate your feelings or expressions and use them to make decisions. Inexpensive sensors are now able to track physical biometrics, leading to mood-oriented computing and hyperpersonalized experiences. In fact, Gartner predicts by 2024,<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/13-surprising-uses-for-emotion-ai-technology/"> AI identification</a> of emotions will influence more than half of the online ads you see.</p>

					 <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) has largely developed and matured thanks to the rich conversations at the semi-annual <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW)—one of the most important user-centric digital identity events on earth. Not only does IIW act as a place to iron out specs and bring communities together, but it acts as a forcing function for implementors to demonstrate the solutions they’ve built over the last six months. IIW’s unique focus on community drives vendors to emphasize interoperability in their demonstrations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxi-31-2020b-tickets-113035646662">IIW #31</a> starting this morning, it’s the perfect time to reflect on how IIW continues to be a part of the interoperability story of the SSI community.</p>

					 <p>Interoperability has always been of paramount importance to Trinsic. That story begins at an <a href="https://vonx.io/how_to/iiwbook">IIW #28 demo</a> with the Government of British Columbia where we demonstrated the first mobile app and enterprise SSI platform to comply with the Hyperledger Aries RFCs, achieving interoperability with the open source ariescloudagent-python. This was the first time two separate codebases demonstrated true interoperability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the Trinsic Wallet has been a standard tool for Aries developers to test the agents they’re building. In the Aries community, Trinsic became a leader of interoperability efforts, helping others debug when their implementations didn’t work with our wallet. In our view, spending time helping others in the community achieve interoperability was time well-spent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But this ad-hoc interoperability testing done via direct messages in RocketChat wasn’t scalable. As the number of Aries-based implementations grew, so too did the burden of maintaining and promoting interoperability. We are happy to say that only three IIW’s after the community’s first display of interoperability, a growing group of SSI vendors have convened to collaborate and hold each other to a high standard of interoperability through the formalization of vendor-to-vendor solution testing.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Formalizing interoperability between vendors 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>We are proud to work with the tremendous teams in our community to <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2020/10/19/trust-over-ip-foundation-introduces-a-new-tool-for-interoperable-digital-trust/">formalize vendor-to-vendor solution testing</a> according to test suites and interoperability profiles in the Technical Stack Working Group at the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a>. This group has been meeting weekly for several months, and we look forward to this group continuing to improve the interoperability requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meeting weekly for the last several months, we’ve formally tested the Trinsic platform with the products developed by the following projects. That means any developer that uses the Trinsic platform—including <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">Trinsic’s APIs</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>, and the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>—will inherit interoperability with solutions built using the following products:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a>  <a href="https://esatus.com/?lang=en">esatus AG</a>  <a href="http://doc.ibmsecurity.verify-creds.com/whats_new/">IBM</a>  <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a>  <a href="https://idramp.com/">idRamp</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Aries Cloud Agent Python</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .Net</a>  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you plan on attending IIW #31 this week, be sure to attend the session on ToIP interoperability profiles to learn more. As always, we encourage other vendors to join the cause with us so that three IIW’s from now, we will see dozens of interoperable SSI implementations that comply with the ToIP interoperability profiles.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Future interoperability efforts 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Our current and future interoperability efforts expand beyond the amazing work happening at the ToIP Foundation. We’re actively engaged in developing next-generation technologies including new zero-knowledge proof capabilities at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF), support for additional DID methods, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> compliant JSON-LD credentials. We will be leading a session this week at IIW #31 on some of our next-generation interoperability efforts, so stay tuned!</p>

					 <p>Focusing on interoperability has been at Trinsic’s core since we began, because we want to ensure that verifiable credentials are as accessible and useful as possible to people everywhere. Making sure that SSI vendors’ solutions are interoperable with one another is one of the major steps to achieving that vision.</p>

  <p>In response to the COVID-19 emergency, over 500 clinical trials of potential COVID-19 treatments and interventions began worldwide. The trials use a living database that compiles and curates data from trial registries and other sources. This helps medical and public health experts predict disease spread, find new treatments and plan for clinical management of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Data and analytics combined with <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-the-future-of-ai-technologies/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) technologies will be paramount in the effort to predict, prepare and respond in a proactive and accelerated manner to a global crisis and its aftermath.</p>
<p>“In the face of unprecedented market shifts, data and analytics leaders require an ever-increasing velocity and scale of analysis in terms of processing and access to accelerate innovation and forge new paths&nbsp; to a post-COVID-19 world,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/34319">Rita Sallam</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during her presentation at <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/symposium-us">virtual Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo™ 2020 </a>.</p>
 
 
 
 [swg_ad id="37066"] 
 
 
 
<p>Here are the top 10 technology trends that data and analytics leaders should focus on as they look to make essential investments to prepare for a reset.</p>
 Trend 1: Smarter, faster, more responsible AI 
<p>By the end of 2024, 75% of enterprises will shift from piloting to operationalizing AI, driving a 5X increase in streaming data and analytics infrastructures.</p>
<p>Within the current pandemic context, AI techniques such as <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/understand-3-key-types-of-machine-learning/">machine learning</a> (ML), optimization and natural language processing (NLP) are providing vital insights and predictions about the spread of the virus and the effectiveness and impact of countermeasures. AI and machine learning are critical realigning supply and the supply chain to new demand patterns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pre-COVID models based on historical data may no longer be valid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AI techniques such as reinforcement learning and distributed learning are creating more adaptable and flexible systems to handle complex business situations; for example, agent-based systems can model and stimulate complex systems - particularly now when pre-COVID models based on historical data may no longer be valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant investments made in new chip architectures such as neuromorphic hardware that can be deployed on edge devices are accelerating AI and ML computations and workloads and reducing reliance on centralized systems that require high bandwidths. Eventually, this could lead to more scalable AI solutions that have higher business impact.</p>
<p>Responsible AI that enables model transparency is essential to protect against poor decisions. It results in better human-machine collaboration and trust for greater adoption and alignment of decisions throughout the organization.</p>
 Trend 2: Decline of the dashboard 
<p>Dynamic data stories with more automated and consumerized experiences will replace visual, point-and-click authoring and exploration. As a result, the amount of time users spend using predefined dashboards will decline. The shift to in-context data stories means that the most relevant insights will stream to each user based on their context, role or use. These dynamic insights leverage technologies such as augmented analytics, NLP, streaming anomaly detection and collaboration.</p>
<p>Data and analytics leaders need to regularly evaluate their existing analytics and business intelligence (BI) tools and innovative startups offering new augmented and NLP-driven user experiences beyond the predefined dashboard.</p>
 Trend 3: Decision intelligence 
<p>By 2023, more than 33% of large organizations will have analysts practicing decision intelligence, including decision modeling.</p>
<p>Decision intelligence brings together a number of disciplines, including decision management and decision support. It encompasses applications in the field of complex adaptive systems that bring together multiple traditional and advanced disciplines.</p>
<p>It provides a framework to help data and analytics leaders design, compose, model, align, execute, monitor and tune decision models and processes in the context of business outcomes and behavior.</p>
<p>Explore using decision management and modeling technology when decisions need multiple logical and mathematical techniques, must be automated or semi-automated, or must be documented and audited.</p>
 Trend 4: X analytics 
<p>Gartner coined the term “X analytics” to be an umbrella term, where X is the data variable for a range of different structured and unstructured content such as text analytics, video analytics, audio analytics, etc.</p>
<p>Data and analytics leaders use X analytics to solve society’s toughest challenges, including climate change, disease prevention and wildlife protection.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, AI has been critical in combing through thousands of research papers, news sources, social media posts and clinical trials data to help medical and public health experts predict disease spread, capacity-plan, find new treatments and identify vulnerable populations. X analytics combined with AI and other techniques such as graph analytics (another top trend) will play a key role in identifying, predicting and planning for natural disasters and other business crises and opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Data and analytics leaders should explore X analytics capabilities available from their existing vendors, such as cloud vendors for image, video and voice analytics, but recognize that innovation will likely come from small disruptive startups and cloud providers.</p>
 Trend 5: Augmented data management 
<p>Augmented data management uses ML and AI techniques to optimize and improve operations.&nbsp; It also converts <a href="https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/metadata">metadata</a> from being used in auditing, lineage and reporting to powering dynamic systems.</p>
<p>Augmented data management products can examine large samples of operational data, including actual queries, performance data and schemas. Using the existing usage and workload data, an augmented engine can tune operations and optimize configuration, security and performance.</p>
<p>Data and analytics leaders should look for augmented data management enabling active metadata to simplify and consolidate their architectures, and also increase automation in their redundant data management tasks.</p>
 Trend 6: Cloud is a given 
<p>By 2022, public cloud services will be essential for 90% of data and analytics innovation.</p>
<p>As data and analytics moves to the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-trends-impacting-cloud-adoption-in-2020/">cloud</a>, data and analytics leaders still struggle to align the right services to the right use cases, which leads to unnecessary increased governance and integration overhead.</p>
<p>The question for data and analytics is moving from how much a given service costs to how it can meet the workload’s performance requirements beyond the list price.</p>
<p>Data and analytics leaders need to prioritize workloads that can exploit cloud capabilities and focus on cost optimization and other benefits such as change and innovation acceleration when moving to cloud.</p>
 Trend 7: Data and analytics worlds collide 
<p>Data and analytics capabilities have traditionally been considered distinct capabilities&nbsp; and managed accordingly. Vendors offering end-to-end workflows enabled by augmented analytics blur the distinction between once separate markets.</p>
<p>The collision of data and analytics will increase interaction and collaboration between historically separate data and analytics roles. This impacts not only the technologies and capabilities provided, but also the people and processes that support and use them. The spectrum of roles will extend from traditional data and analytics roles in IT to information explorer, consumer and citizen developer as an example.</p>
<p>To turn the collision into a constructive convergence, incorporate both data and analytics tools and capabilities into the analytics stack. Beyond tools, focus on people and processes to foster communication and collaboration. Leverage data and analytics ecosystems enabled by an augmented approach that have the potential to deliver coherent stacks.</p>
 Trend 8: Data marketplaces and exchanges 
<p>By 2022, 35% of large organizations will be either sellers or buyers of data via formal online data marketplaces, up from 25% in 2020.</p>
<p>Data marketplaces and exchanges provide single platforms to consolidate third-party data offerings. These marketplaces and exchanges provide centralized availability and access (to X analytics and other unique data sets, for example) that create economies of scale to reduce costs for third-party data.</p>
<p>To monetize data assets through data marketplaces, data and analytics leaders should establish a fair and transparent methodology by defining a data governance principle that ecosystems partners can rely on.</p>
 Trend 9: Blockchain in data and analytics 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-reality-of-blockchain/">Blockchain technologies</a> address two challenges in data and analytics. First, blockchain provides the full lineage of assets and transactions. Second, blockchain provides transparency for complex networks of participants.</p>
<p>Outside of limited bitcoin and smart contract use cases, ledger database management systems (DBMSs) will provide a more attractive option for single-enterprise auditing of data sources. By 2021, Gartner estimates that most permissioned blockchain uses will be replaced by ledger DBMS products.</p>
<p>Data and analytics should position blockchain technologies as supplementary to their existing data management infrastructure by highlighting the capabilities mismatch between data management infrastructure and blockchain technologies.</p>
 Trend 10: Relationships form the foundation of data and analytics value 
<p>By 2023, graph technologies will facilitate rapid contextualization for decision making in 30% of organizations worldwide. Graph analytics is a set of analytic techniques that allows for the exploration of relationships between entities of interest such as organizations, people and transactions.</p>
<p>It helps data and analytics leaders find unknown relationships in data and review data not easily analyzed with traditional analytics.</p>
<p>For example, as the world scrambles to respond to current and future pandemics, graph technologies can relate entities across everything from geospatial data on people’s phones to facial-recognition systems that can analyze photos to determine who might have come into contact with individuals who later tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider investigating how graph algorithms and technologies can improve your AI and ML initiatives</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When combined with ML algorithms, these technologies can be used to comb through thousands of data sources and documents that could help medical and public health experts rapidly discover new possible treatments or factors that contribute to more negative outcomes for some patients.</p>
<p>Data and analytics leaders need to evaluate opportunities to incorporate graph analytics into their analytics portfolios and applications to uncover hidden patterns and relationships. In addition, consider investigating how graph algorithms and technologies can improve your AI and ML initiatives.</p>

  <p>When employees at an industrial site returned to the workplace after it was closed during the<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/"> COVID-19 </a>pandemic, they noticed a few differences. Sensors or RFID tags were used to determine whether employees were washing their hands regularly. Computer vision determined if employees were complying with mask protocol and speakers were used to warn people of protocol violations. What’s more, this behavioral data was collected and analyzed by the organizations to influence how people behaved at work .</p>
<p>The collection and use of such <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/data-sharing-is-a-business-necessity-to-accelerate-digital-business/">data</a> to drive behaviors is called the Internet of Behavior (IoB). As organizations improve not only the amount of data they capture, but also how they combine data from different sources and use that data, the IoB will continue to affect how organizations interact with people.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37663"]</p>
<p>The IoB is one of Gartner’s nine strategic technology trends that will enable the plasticity or flexibility that resilient businesses require in the significant upheaval driven by COVID-19 and the current economic state of the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IoB is about using data to change behaviors</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The unprecedented socioeconomic challenges of 2020 demand the organizational plasticity to transform and compose the future,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/26081">Brian Burke</a>, Research Vice President, during virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/symposium-us">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo™ 2020</a>.</p>
<p>This year’s trends fall under three themes: People centricity, location independence and resilient delivery.</p>
<p>People centricity: Although the pandemic changed how many people work and interact with organizations, people are still at the center of all business. And they need digitaliized processes to function in today’s environment.</p>
<p>Location independence: COVID-19 has shifted where employees, customers, suppliers and organizational ecosystems physically exist. Location independence requires a technology shift to support this new version of business.</p>
<p>Resilient delivery: Whether a pandemic or a recession, volatility exists in the world. Organizations that are prepared to pivot and adapt will weather all types of disruptions.</p>
<p>As always, these nine strategic technology trends do not operate independently of each other, but rather build on and reinforce each other. Combinatorial innovation is an overarching theme for these trends. Together they enable organizational plasticity that will help guide organizations in the next five to 10 years.</p>
<p></p>
 Trend 1: Internet of Behaviors 
<p>As demonstrated by the COVID-19 protocol monitoring example, the IoB is about using data to change behaviors. With an increase in technologies that gather the “digital dust” of daily life — data that spans the digital and physical worlds — that information can be used to influence behaviors through feedback loops.</p>
<p>For example, for commercial vehicles, telematics can monitor driving behaviors, from sudden braking to aggressive turns. Companies can then use that data to improve driver performance, routing and safety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IoB does have ethical and societal implications depending on the goals and outcomes of individual uses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The IoB can gather, combine and process data from many sources including: Commercial customer data; citizen data processed by public-sector and government agencies; social media; public domain deployments of facial recognition; and location tracking. The increasing sophistication of the technology that processes this data has enabled this trend to grow.</p>
<p>IoB does have ethical and societal implications depending on the goals and outcomes of individual uses. The same wearables that health insurance companies use to track physical activities to reduce premiums could also be used to monitor grocery purchases; too many unhealthy items could increase premiums. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-balance-personalization-with-data-privacy/">Privacy laws</a>, which vary from region to region, will greatly impact the adoption and scale of the IoB.</p>
 Trend 2: Total experience 
<p>Total experience combines multiexperience, customer experience, employee experience and user experience to transform the business outcome. The goal is to improve the overall experience where all of these pieces intersect, from technology to employees to customers and users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This trend enables organizations to capitalize on COVID-19 disruptors</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tightly linking all of these experiences — as opposed to individually improving each one in a silo — differentiates a business from competitors in a way that is difficult to replicate, creating sustainable competitive advantage. This trend enables organizations to capitalize on COVID-19 disruptors including remote work, mobile, virtual and distributed customers.</p>
<p>For example, one telecommunications company transformed its entire customer experience in an effort to improve safety and satisfaction. First, it deployed an appointment system via an existing app. When customers arrived for their appointment and came within 75 feet of the store, they received two things: 1) A notification to guide them through the check-in process and 2) an alert letting them know how long it would be before they could safely enter the store and maintain social distance.</p>
<p>The company also adjusted its service to include more digital kiosks and enabled employees to use their own tablets to co-browse customers’ devices without having to physically touch the hardware. The result was a safer, more seamless and integrated overall experience for customers and employees.</p>
 Trend 3: Privacy-enhancing computation 
<p>Privacy-enhancing computation features three technologies that protect data while it’s being used. The first provides a trusted environment in which sensitive data can be processed or analyzed. The second performs processing and analytics in a decentralized manner. The third encrypts data and algorithms before processing or analytics.</p>
<p>This trend enables organizations to collaborate on research securely across regions and with competitors without sacrificing confidentiality. This approach is designed specifically for the increasing need to share data while maintaining privacy or security.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1kODJmMmM1MjBmZWIxMWViYTZhMzBhMWZhNjI3NTNkZg=="></a></p>
 Trend 4: Distributed cloud 
<p>Distributed cloud is where cloud services are distributed to different physical locations, but the operation, governance and evolution remain the responsibility of the public cloud provider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Distributed cloud is the future of cloud</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enabling organizations to have these services physically closer helps with low-latency scenarios, reduces data costs and helps accommodate laws that dictate data must remain in a specific geographical area. However, it also means that organizations still benefit from public cloud and aren’t managing their own private cloud, which can be costly and complex. Distributed cloud is the future of cloud.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-distributed-cloud/">The CIO’s Guide to Distributed Cloud</a></p>
 Trend 5: Anywhere operations 
<p>An anywhere operations model will be vital for businesses to emerge successfully from COVID-19. At its core, this operating model allows for business to be accessed, delivered and enabled anywhere — where customers, employers and business partners operate in physically remote environments.</p>
<p>The model for anywhere operations is “digital first, remote first;” for example, banks that are mobile-only, but handle everything from transferring funds to opening accounts with no physical interaction. Digital should be the default at all times. That’s not to say physical space doesn’t have its place, but it should be digitally enhanced, for example, contactless check-out at a physical store, regardless of whether its physical or digital capabilities should be seamlessly delivered.</p>
 Trend 6: Cybersecurity mesh 
<p>Cybersecurity mesh is a distributed architectural approach to scalable, flexible and reliable cybersecurity control. Many assets now exist outside of the traditional security perimeter. Cybersecurity mesh essentially allows for the security perimeter to be defined around the identity of a person or thing. It enables a more modular, responsive security approach by centralizing policy orchestration and distributing policy enforcement. As perimeter protection becomes less meaningful, the security approach of a “walled city” must evolve to current needs.</p>

 Trend 7: Intelligent composable business 
<p>An intelligent composable business is one that can adapt and fundamentally rearrange itself based on a current situation. As organizations <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">accelerate digital business strategy</a> to drive faster digital transformation, they need to be agile and make quick business decisions informed by currently available data.</p>
<p>To successfully do this, organizations must enable better access to information, augment that information with better insight and have the ability to respond quickly to the implications of that insight. This will also include increasing autonomy and democratization across the organization, enabling parts of the businesses to quickly react instead of being bogged down by inefficient processes.</p>
 Trend 8: AI engineering 
<p>A robust AI engineering strategy will facilitate the performance, scalability, interpretability and reliability of AI models while delivering the full value of AI investments. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-design-principles-for-artificial-intelligence-in-digital-business/">AI projects</a> often face issues with maintainability, scalability and governance, which makes them a challenge for most organizations.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/2-megatrends-dominate-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2020/">2 Megatrends Dominate the Gartner Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence, 2020</a></p>
<p>AI engineering offers a pathway, making AI a part of the mainstream DevOps process rather than a set of specialized and isolated projects. It brings together various disciplines to tame the AI hype while providing a clearer path to value when operationalizing the combination of multiple AI techniques. Due to the governance aspect of AI engineering, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-prevent-ai-dangers-with-ethical-ai/">responsible AI is emerging</a> to deal with trust, transparency, ethics, fairness, interpretability and compliance issues. It is the operationalization of AI accountability.</p>
 Trend 9: Hyperautomation 
<p>Hyperautomation is the idea that anything that can be automated in an organization should be automated. Hyperautomation is driven by organizations having legacy business processes that are not streamlined, creating immensely expensive and extensive issues for organizations.</p>
<p>Many organizations are supported by a “patchwork” of technologies that are not lean, optimized, connected, clean or explicit. At the same time, the acceleration of digital business requires efficiency, speed and democratization. Organizations that don’t focus on efficiency, efficacy and business agility will be left behind.</p>

  <p>When COVID-19 hit and Australia went into lockdown, many people lost their jobs. The result was a surge in welfare applications to Services Australia, which provides health, child support and welfare services to 25 million citizens.</p>
<p>There were so many applications, the site crashed.</p>
<p>But Services Australia rapidly pivoted to accommodate this surge in demand and made changes to how it traditionally operated. They shifted in-person appointments to phones or online, deployed voiceprint technology to 1.2 million users and saw a 600% increase in the use of digital assistants to orchestrate fast responses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Composable business means creating an organization made from interchangeable building blocks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The organization created resilience via the principles of composable business — a key feature of a successful business in 2020 and beyond — that enabled the agency to provide a safety net for citizens in need.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37208"]</p>
<p>“Composable business is a natural <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">acceleration of the digital business</a> that you live every day. It allows us to deliver the resilience and agility that these interesting times demand,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/7521/Daryl-Plummer">Daryl Plummer</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during the opening keynote at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/symposium-us">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo™ 2020</a>. “We’re talking about the intentional use of ‘composability’ in a business context — architecting your business for real-time adaptability and resilience in the face of uncertainty.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Composable means modularity 
<p>The pandemic highlighted vulnerabilities in businesses models that for years focused on efficiency. Organizations that were once efficient suddenly became fragile at a time when they needed to be flexible. Businesses that were smart <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/decide-now-how-much-to-recalibrate-it-strategic-plans/">pivoted</a> to a more modular setup, creating a composable business. Organizations were prepared for one type of future, but now must plan for multiple futures.</p>

<p>Composable business means creating an organization made from interchangeable building blocks. The modular setup enables a business to rearrange and reorient as needed depending on external (or internal) factors like a shift in customer values or sudden change in supply chain or materials.</p>
 The 4 principles of composable business 
<p>The idea of composable business operates on four basic principles:</p>
 
 
<p>More speed through discovery</p>
 
 
<p>Greater agility through modularity</p>
 
 
<p>Better leadership through orchestration</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/create-a-resilient-business-model-in-the-face-of-covid-19/">Resilience</a> through autonomy</p>
 
 
<p>This type of thinking enables a business to survive, and even flourish, in times of great disruption. From a technical perspective, this type of composability is not new to CIOs. It exists in familiar technology, from APIs to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-best-practices-for-creating-a-container-platform-strategy/">containers</a>. But, it is a new, or perhaps ignored, idea for a CIO’s business counterparts and board of directors. Composable business requires a foundational change in business thinking, architecture and technology.</p>
 The building blocks of composable business 
<p>The three building blocks of composable business are:</p>
 
 Composable thinking, which keeps you from losing your creativity. Anything is composable. When you combine the principles of modularity, autonomy, orchestration and discovery with composable thinking, it should guide your approach to conceptualizing what to compose, and when. 
 Composable business architecture ensures that your organization is built to be flexible and resilient. It’s about structure and purpose. These are structural capabilities — giving you mechanisms to use in architecting your business. 
 Composable technologies are the tools for today and tomorrow. They are the pieces and parts, and what connects them all together. The four principles are product design goals driving the features of technology that support the notions of composability. 
 
<p>When combined with the principles, the building blocks of composable business enable organizations to pivot quickly. For example, a Chinese appliance manufacturer pivoted from making dishwashers and wine coolers to distributing critical medical equipment during the pandemic. The company flexed beyond its core competencies, listened to what customers needed at the time and used its platform to move from an idea to a product launch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The building blocks of composable business enable organizations to pivot quickly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more these composable business ideas are integrated within your business model, the more flexibility and agility your organization will have. That means faster response time and more consistency in execution for this new type of business setup.</p>
 Leverage existing technologies 
<p>Organizations that embraced — and continue to embrace — the building blocks and principles of composable business were able to successfully leverage existing digital investments and, the best-case scenario, accelerate investment..</p>
<p>“Sixty-nine percent of corporate directors want to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/prioritize-digital-business-initiatives-to-accelerate-into-the-future/">accelerate enterprise digital strategies</a> and implementations to help deal with the ongoing disruption,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/10138/Tina-Nunno">Tina Nunno</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “For some enterprises that means that their digital strategies become real for the first time, and for others that means rapidly scaling digital investments.”</p>
<p>These strategies will help organizations handle the global industrywide volatility that will continue well into next year.</p>
<p>“You, the CIOs, can contribute to the evolution of a more powerful and adaptable form of business, architected to deal with continuing business disruptions — composable business,” said Nunno.</p>
 Key opportunities for CIOs 
<p>Look for the “moments of composability” and seize the opportunity they present. These moments could be geopolitical, like the pandemic and global recession, but they could also be societal, such as a change in consumer attitude. These are moments in which the CIO must recognize the need for an immediate change in the organization or risk having the business falter or fail.</p>
<p>“Throughout history, great leaders have faced turmoil and turned it into inspiration,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/38539/Don-Scheibenreif">Don Scheibenreif</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “Composing: being flexible, fluid, continuous, even improvisational — is how we will move forward.”</p>

 A framework to help uncover&nbsp;trends <p>Around the world, people and small businesses are working and selling in new ways, using digital platforms. News reports, heated policy debates, and perhaps especially our daily interactions with gig workers, freelancers, and virtual e-commerce storefronts all underscore a growing awareness that there is something essential and different about finding one’s way and earning a living in the platform&nbsp;economy.</p><p>This year, Caribou Digital has been working with <a href="https://qhala.com/">Qhala </a>and with the support of the <a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/">Mastercard Foundation</a> on a project exploring the “<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/segment-insights/">Quality of Youth Digital Livelihoods</a>” in Kenya. That research, with its particular focus on how young women in Kenya experience platform work and platform sales, is well underway.</p><p>As a way to connect to the ongoing research and policy discussions, and to help create our interview guide, we read everything we could — 75+ primary research studies of platform work and platform sales in the Global South. We excited to report that Caribou Digital and Qhala have just released v1.0 of that review in a <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QYDEL-v1.1.pdf">PDF</a>, and in a searchable, filterable, online resource in the form of an <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/evidence-gap-map/#tab-egm">evidence&nbsp;map</a>.</p><p>Underpinning these new resources is an emerging overarching framework for understanding platform livelihoods, our term for the broad umbrella encompassing both platform work and platform sales. This post, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">also a page on the platform livelihoods website</a>, is our most succinct (October 2020) version of the platform livelihoods framework.</p><p>More specifically, we define platform livelihoods as</p><blockquote>active human efforts, sometimes combined with tools or assets, deployed to create value outside of the constructs of a stable employer-employee relationship, mediated by the infrastructure and accompanying logic of digital platforms.</blockquote><p>From this definition, and drawing on that detailed literature review of 75 studies of platform livelihoods in the Global South, this framework addresses three broad questions for the digital development community:</p> What are the experiences of people with platform livelihoods? <p>We identify twelve elements — the kinds of experiences that individuals share and value when discussing their livelihoods with friends, family, and even the occasional researcher. They are a mix of economic, subjective, and broader human development experiences.</p>Platform Livelihood Experience Elements What are similarities and differences between platform livelihood types? <p>In the review, we offer a landscape of nine illustrative types of platform livelihood. Note that these are roles that individuals or small enterprises can fill, rather than “business models” or the names of specific platforms.</p><p>These are not the only roles that platforms are transforming or enabling, but these nine represent enough of the diversity in platform livelihoods to make two key distinctions. These types mix local and global (digital only) markets. Some of these roles are for individuals seeking work and offering their labor. Some of these roles are for small enterprises and even small farms, looking for new sales channels and new ways to connect with&nbsp;markets.</p><p>The early research and policy literature has been concentrated in platform work, especially ride-hailing, freelancing, and microwork. We feel strongly that platform work needs continued research and policy attention, as millions turn to platform labor amidst changing economies and a global pandemic.</p><p>At the same time, and in the longer run, platform sales (whether via marketplaces, social commerce, or search and discovery) may end up altering the livelihoods of millions&nbsp;more.</p><p>This this lens suggests that these two growing domains, platform work and platform sales, are supported by overlapping affordances of platformization — indeed it is often the same platforms supporting job seekers and microentrepreneurs alike. The lens invites synthesis of insights for policy and practice that draws on both domains, while retaining space for more comparative or specific inquiry into one livelihood type at&nbsp;time.</p>Platform Livelihood Types What kinds of technologies and business models support platform livelihoods? <p>Individuals and small enterprises use a mix of platform services and approaches to pursue their livelihoods.</p>  The most easily recognizable way via formal digital marketplaces — the formal “multi-sided markets” in labor, goods and services, though with individuals and small firms can find customers.  Informal social commerce — selling goods, services and even ‘influence’ via personal Facebook pages, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. is also growing in popularity and impact, even if the research literature here is still&nbsp;sparse.  And there is often (still), search and discovery. Millions of small businesses pay for advertising on Facebook and Google and other social media platforms, Many work to refine how they appear on maps or other digital databases and apps. Some have websites or social media pages or storefronts of their own. These activities, too, support platform livelihoods.  <p>These activities and services blur and intersect as digital platforms continually slice and recombine, mediating the connections between sellers and their markets in ever-changing ways.</p><p>One the one hand, the digitalization and platformization of economies seems to reward sellers and workers who have developed capabilities in more or more of these than one approaches.</p><p>On the other hand, it is simultaneously a critical matter for inclusive digital development policy that these mediated connections do not divide, dissuade, or discriminate against small scale sellers and the self-employed.</p><p>In the longer run, we may update the online evidence map and accompanying discussion with a per-technology filter to better reflect differences and similarities (in practice and in policy) across these technological approaches.</p>Platform Livelihood Practices How to use this framework <p>By providing a common language framework, and a map of several kinds of platform livelihoods, this framework can help uncover many trends and cross cutting issues. For example, In this first iteration of the literature review we used the framework to explore four durable themes: <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">gender</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/rurality/">rurality</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/youth/">youth</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19/">COVID-19</a>. We also outline four emergent dynamics worthy of scrutiny: <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/fractional-work/">fractional work</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/amplification/">amplification</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/hidden-hierarchies/">hidden hierarchies</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/contestation/">contestation</a>.</p><p>We hope that you might and use this framework in your own research, design, or policymaking activities.

 Get your OScore&nbsp;today! <p><a href="https://ocredit.io/">OScore</a>, the first credit score for the decentralized world built with Ontology’s Decentralized Identity has officially launched. For simplicity, consider OScore an on-chain reputational system that supports cross-chain interaction with verifiable credentials on the Ontology blockchain, hence eliminating third-party verification programs from the process. Once a user authorizes their digital financial data, Ontology’s OScore system automatically generates a quantifiable credit score while ensuring a user’s privacy is fully protected and controlled by themselves.</p><p>To begin, your OScore will be available once you log in and have connected your digital wallets and exchanges — this will allow the system to give you a real-time assessment of your OScore. Within the minimal and clean dashboard, users can authenticate assets to maintain a consistent OScore in accordance with their historical holdings, transactions, and current collection of&nbsp;assets.</p>Your Dashboard<p>In the world of Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, a credit-based scoring system that is both transparent and accurate has the potential to revolutionize not just individual users’ interactions amongst each other, but also the sector as a&nbsp;whole.</p><blockquote>“…These perks may include things like being able to under-collateralize assets…”</blockquote><p>A credit-based system in the DeFi space will bridge services with users by authenticating a certain level of trust so everyone can enjoy dApps, and DeFi projects with an ease of mind. Users with a higher OScore will enjoy positive externalities as a result. These perks may include things like being able to under-collateralize assets, therefore allowing for higher levels of liquidity and a more matrix-like decision tree for users who have consistently upheld their credit&nbsp;score.</p><blockquote>“…users can earn WING tokens as rewards for punctually returning borrowed assets or&nbsp;loans…”</blockquote><p>In addition, users can earn WING tokens as rewards for punctually returning borrowed assets or loans, as extra WING tokens will be distributed to reinforce positive behavior. This type of reinforcement can easily be replicated for other DeFi projects or tokens as well as long as they have OScore integrated into their systems. To take things even one step further, users can withdraw any assets which are connected through their wallet directly from the dashboard as well, removing a tedious step from the user journey for those who wish to withdraw assets. All of the features of OScore can be enjoyed through logging in the web browser, or through a user’s ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><blockquote>“…users can withdraw any assets which are connected through their wallet directly from the dashboard as&nbsp;well…”</blockquote><p>A user’s OScore will also allow for the refinancing and restructuring of mortgages and credit lending where users who demonstrate proper behavior in their lending and repayment practices may also be rewarded with lower interest rates and more generous financing options. A second key component of OScore is the underlying Decentralized Identity solution which protects not just the user’s identity but also their data — granting them full control over who may or may not access it. Users can bind their OScore to their ONT ID just as they could with their real names. We have previously written about the drastically wide array of use cases for ONT ID, so we won’t go into too many details&nbsp;here.</p><p>When combined, an OScore becomes a powerful indicator of a user’s trust variable — which essentially is what a credit score is designed for. Just like traditional finance, DeFi can’t reach its full potential without credit. The good news is that with OScore, DeFi platforms like Wing.Finance can improve their underlying market mechanisms to provide users more usability, ultimately leading to a more mature and transparent market for the borrowing, lending, and insuring of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The goal behind this launch is to redefine trust in the age of blockchain and elevating hundreds of millions of users to reach new financial heights. Not only will the OScore protect a user’s data privacy while providing full credit histories, but it will also be applicable across an array of real-life applications both offline and on-chain.</p><p>With the launch of OScore, Ontology’s mission to change the way we manage and transfer data while increasing security and protection will be realized one step further. As stated by our founder, Li Jun — “Ontology is providing a solution that connects users’ assets to their identity, providing increased security and trust to all parties, connecting the missing pieces of decentralized finance’s ecosystem.” A credit score, tied in with ONT ID and the ONTO Data Wallet, exemplifies the commitment that we envision.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="https://ont.io/?source=post_page---------------------------">Ontology website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">Ontology GitHub</a> / <a href="https://onto.app/?source=post_page---------------------------">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases?source=post_page---------------------------">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Telegram (English)</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/lower-your-collateral-requirements-loan-interests-with-oscore-fb2c835a9998">Lower Your Collateral Requirements &amp; Loan Interests with OScore</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When most people think of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en">GDPR</a>, they are reminded of the onslaught of emails they received after it passed. Any company or newsletter they had ever subscribed to–and yes, we really mean ever–was reaching out to them to reconfirm they wanted to stay on the mailing list and sharing their updated privacy policies. Companies they had perhaps long since forgotten about, companies they weren’t sure they had ever even subscribed to. But while most people today are familiar with the term, they don’t fully understand the legislation behind it.&nbsp;<br></p>



 What is GDPR 



<p>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It is a European regulation that was approved by the EU Parliament in 2016 and came into effect in 2018. At its core, it has three main purposes.&nbsp;<br></p>



  Harmonize – data privacy laws across Europe  Protect – and empower all EU citizens’ data privacy  Reshape – the way organizations across the region approach data privacy  



<p>The aim of the GDPR is to help EU citizens have full control over their personal data and to provide more transparency into the data collection and usage processes.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Under the GDPR, businesses must safeguard their customers’ personal data and use the highest possible privacy settings by default. Data must not be processed or made publicly available without the individual’s explicit and informed consent.<br></p>



<p>“Data controller” and “data processor” are the most important terms used in GDPR regulations and it’s important to clearly distinguish one from the other.<br></p>



  A data controller: determines the purpose and means of processing personal data  A data processor: is responsible for processing data on behalf of the data controller  



 Why Does it Matter?&nbsp;<br> 



<p>According to the European Commission, the value of personalized data will be <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/the-value-of-data/">1 trillion euros</a>, almost 8 percent of the EU’s GDP, by the end of 2020. Personal data is incredibly valuable, with many of the tech giants likening it to the new oil. With so much personal data on the internet, and so many companies looking to capitalize on it, the GDPR is a landmark piece of legislation.<br></p>



<p>Personal data can include anything and everything from someone’s full name, birthday, address both physical and IP, geotags, religion, race, political views, passport number, health records, and social media profiles.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>While it is an EU regulation, it has a global reach. The GDPR applies to any business that handles personal data of EU citizens, even if that business is located outside of Europe. Within the GDPR framework, controllers of personal data must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to comply with the seven data protection principles.<br></p>



<p>Oh, and before we get into the principles the fines are significant as well. It has generated an estimated <a href="https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-in-2020/">€114 million in fines in just two years</a>. Under the GDPR, companies can be fined up to €20 million or four percent of their annual revenues, whichever is higher. For less serious violations, the fine is reduced to €10 million and two percent of annual revenues, which is still no laughing matter.&nbsp;<br></p>



 The Seven Key Principles of GDPR 



<blockquote><p>Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency</p></blockquote>



<p>Data must be obtained, stored, and processed on a lawful basis, and the individual must be fully informed regarding the purposes, the means, and the time period of data processing. Data controllers and data processors must stay true to their privacy promises.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Purpose Limitation&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>The purpose of data collection must be specified, explicit, and legitimate. Data must only be used for the purpose for which the individual’s consent was received.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Data Minimization&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>GDPR is designed to reduce data collection to the minimum required to fulfill the purpose. The data collected must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed.</p>



<blockquote><p>Accuracy</p></blockquote>



<p>Personal data must be accurate and up to date. Any old and, or outdated data should be erased.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Storage Limitation&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Personal data must not be kept for longer than required by the legitimate business purpose to which the individual consented.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Integrity and Confidentiality&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Personal data must be handled in a way that ensures appropriate security and is protected against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Accountability&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>All policies that govern the collection and processing of data must be documented in a thorough manner, and in a way that can demonstrate full GDPR compliance to authorities when called upon.</p>

 Authenteq’s Compliance&nbsp; 



<p>Our compliance with the EU GDPR regulation was created in cooperation with, and is routinely reviewed by, expert legal professionals from the German branch of the global law firm DWF (<a href="http://www.dwf.law">www.dwf.law</a>)<br></p>



<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>



 How to Comply with the GDPR<br> 



<p>GDPR is actually a good thing overall, even if it feels intimidating to tackle. More control over personal data increases the end-users’ confidence in your product and with big data in general. The seven key principles can be translated into a few simple, actionable steps. You can also follow the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist/">GDPR checklist for data controllers</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>



  Gather clear, explicit consent. Keep your terms and conditions and privacy policies readable. Make it easy for anyone to withdraw from your service at any time.<br>  Communicate breaches. Even the world’s largest companies can be hacked, and while the initial reaction to a breach may be to deal with it behind closed doors, breaking this rule and failing to report a breach will result in a fine. According to the GDPR, you have 72 hours to report a breach so build that directly into your security protocols and measures.&nbsp;<br>  Provide access. If a customer or user requests access to their data, which they may do at any time, you must be able to provide them with a clear and detailed copy that outlines which data you have collected, where it has been stored, and how it has been used. And you must provide this for free.&nbsp;<br>  Forget them. Not only can personal data be requested at any time, but people can also request that it be deleted. While there are some specific grounds on which you could deny this request, generally you have one month to honor these requests.&nbsp;

  <p>In this tutorial, you will build your very own Nano Blogging Service (nabl for short) using a modern JVM stack. This includes using the Kotlin programming language, the Ktor web framework, and securing it with Okta.

The blogging service displays posts from the selected user or everyone in the chronological feed.</p>

<p>Kotlin is often considered a “better Java” and often becomes an easy, efficient substitution because it has excellent Java interoperability. That allows you to employ the largest ecosystem of existing JVM frameworks and libraries written and designed for Java in your Kotlin application and vice-versa. Kotlin works well with <a>Spring Boot</a>, Jersey, Dropwizard, and many others. “Kotlin-native” frameworks provide first-class language support, provide additional type-safety not available in the Java world, and often give competitive advantages.</p>

<p><a href="https://ktor.io/">Ktor</a> is one of the most prominent “Kotlin-native” web frameworks officially supported by JetBrains, creators of the Kotlin language, and IntelliJ IDEA. It’s an unopinionated highly-customizable modular framework that gives developers full control over implementation while providing sensible defaults.</p>

 Build a Ktor Application with Kotlin 

<p>As with any web application framework, Ktor provides several libraries and imposes some conventions. Don’t worry—it doesn’t tell you how to write your code. The conventions are mostly for the HTTP layer and you’re free to write other lower layers the way you want. A few of the most notable things include:</p>

 
   The web application is a pipeline processing incoming requests through features and route handlers. 
   Request handling is non-blocking; it relies on <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html">Kotlin coroutines</a>. 
   The configuration file format is <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">HOCON</a>. 
   Framework is employing DSL for the top-level declarations, e.g., modules setup, routing, etc. 
   Pluggable features are configured using <code>install(FeatureObject) { config }</code>. 
   Most of the functions and properties you use are <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html#extension-functions">extension functions</a>. 
 

 Ktor Project Structure 

<p>The application in this example depends on several libraries:</p>

 
   Kotlin programming language you use for this project 
   Ktor server with Ktor server CIO - server implementation and coroutine-based HTTP engine core 
   Ktor client with Ktor client CIO - client used to communicate to OAuth2 server 
   Ktor Auth module to handle authorization flow 
   kotlinx.html set of classes allowing to write type-safe HTML generators 
   Okta JWT Verifier library helps to parse and verify access and id tokens 
 

<p>You can bootstrap this tutorial by cloning our Git repository and starting with the <code>initial</code> branch:</p>

   <code>git clone -b initial https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-kotlin-ktor-example.git
cd okta-kotlin-ktor-example
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you want to see the completed app, with Okta already integrated, you can check out the <code>main</code> branch. See the project’s README for instructions on how to configure it to work with your Okta account.</p>

 Start your Ktor Application 

<p>Use IntelliJ runner or type <code>./gradlew run</code> in the command line to start your application, point your web browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>All the messages displayed are from the in-memory database. Note that at this stage, the user can’t log in; hence they can’t post messages.</p>

 Secure Your Ktor Application with Okta 

<p>Real-world applications often require users to log in to perform some actions or access information. User management and security are much more complicated than they might seem and it can be tough to make them right. If you have done it previously, you know what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>User management shouldn’t take much of your time because that problem is solved already, right? In this tutorial, you’ll be using Okta’s OAuth 2.0 authorization service along with OpenID Connect (OIDC). Okta provides many features for both enterprise and personal project needs - MFA, SAML, groups, policies, social media logins, and many more. We offer solutions for different size companies - from pet projects just for yourself to big enterprises such as FedEx, Box, HubSpot, Experian, and <a href="https://www.okta.com/customers/">many others</a>. Okta helps developers implement secure authentication, handles authorization, and can act as an identity provider with a minimum effort and lines of code.</p>

<p>If you haven’t created an Okta account yet, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up</a> first. It’s free, no credit card required.</p>

<p>Login to the Okta admin console. On the top menu select Applications → Add Application:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, configure your Okta application. Don’t worry, if you want to change anything it’s always possible to return to this screen. At the very least, you need to set the following settings:</p>

 
   Name - give it a meaningful name, for instance, <code>My Ktor nano Blogging Service</code> 
   Base URIs - put <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> there. Multiple URI can be provided; you can add more URIs if needed. 
   Login redirect URIs - set it to <code>http://localhost:8080/login/authorization-callback</code>. Upon successful login, the user will be redirected to URI provided with tokens in the query. 
   Logout redirect URIs - value <code>http://localhost:8080</code> allows you to provide a redirect URL on successful logout. 
 

<p>Click Done to finish the initial setup.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Take note of the following three values. You’ll use them in your Ktor application:</p>

 
   
    <p>Org URL: Hover over API on the top menu bar, and select Authorization Servers menu item, copy the value from Issuer URI</p>
   
   
    <p>Client ID and Client Secret as below:</p>
   
 

<p></p>

 Configure Ktor’s OAuth 2.0 Module 

<p>Ktor has an implementation of OAuth Client—it just needs to be configured. It’s always good practice to never insert any keys, tokens, or credentials directly into the code. Even for a demo project. To inject Okta parameters from environment variables, append a new block in <code>resources/application.conf</code>:</p>

   <code>...
okta {
    orgUrl = ${OKTA_ORGURL}
    clientId = ${OKTA_CLIENT_ID}
    clientSecret = ${OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET}
}
</code>   

<p>To start your application from IntelliJ IDEA or any other IDE, these environment variables must be provided. In the Run/Debug Configuration dialog, click on the Environment variables and specify them as I have below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, create a <code>src/auth-settings.kt</code> file to contain all Okta-configuration related functions.</p>

<p>You could also create an <code>okta.env</code> file with the following code:</p>

   <code>export OKTA_ORGURL=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
export OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
export OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
</code>   

<p>Next, run <code>source okta.env</code> before running your app.</p>

<p>If you’re on Windows, name the file <code>okta.bat</code> and use <code>SET</code> instead of <code>export</code>.</p>

<p>Add a generic configuration class for Okta services in <code>src/auth-settings.kt</code>.</p>

   <code>data class OktaConfig(
    val orgUrl: String,
    val clientId: String,
    val clientSecret: String,
    val audience: String
) {
    val accessTokenUrl = "$orgUrl/v1/token"
    val authorizeUrl = "$orgUrl/v1/authorize"
    val logoutUrl = "$orgUrl/v1/logout"
}
</code>   

<p>Create a configuration reader in <code>src/auth-settings.kt</code>. This takes a <code>Config</code> object, reads from it, and creates an <code>OktaConfig</code> object.</p>

   <code>fun oktaConfigReader(config: Config): OktaConfig = OktaConfig(
    orgUrl = config.getString("okta.orgUrl"),
    clientId = config.getString("okta.clientId"),
    clientSecret = config.getString("okta.clientSecret"),
    audience = config.tryGetString("okta.audience") ?: "api://default"
)
</code>   

<p>Finally, the <a href="https://ktor.io/servers/features/authentication/oauth.html">Ktor Auth module</a> is expecting configuration to be passed as <code>OAuthServerSettings.OAuth2ServerSettings</code>. For that, you need a mapping function in <code>src/auth-settings.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>fun OktaConfig.asOAuth2Config(): OAuthServerSettings.OAuth2ServerSettings =
    OAuthServerSettings.OAuth2ServerSettings(
        name = "okta",
        authorizeUrl = authorizeUrl,
        accessTokenUrl = accessTokenUrl,
        clientId = clientId,
        clientSecret = clientSecret,
        defaultScopes = listOf("openid", "profile"),
        requestMethod = Post
    )
</code>   

 Setup a Ktor Authentication Module 

<p>All authentication configuration and handling happen inside the <code>setupAuth()</code> function of <code>src/auth.kt</code> file. Start filling it with configuration. Use <code>oktaConfigReader()</code> to read configuration from the application file. Then, install the <code>Authentication</code> feature and configure it to use OAuth, provide it a redirect callback, the Okta OAuth2 configuration, and a default <code>HttpClient</code> for the Ktor OAuth client features.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demo.ktor
 
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
import com.okta.jwt.JwtVerifiers
import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.auth.*
import io.ktor.client.*
 
fun Application.setupAuth() {
    val oktaConfig = oktaConfigReader(ConfigFactory.load() ?: throw Exception("Could not load config"))
    install(Authentication) {
        oauth {
            urlProvider = { "http://localhost:8080/login/authorization-callback" }
            providerLookup = { oktaConfig.asOAuth2Config() }
            client = HttpClient()
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>To ensure that tokens provided are valid, they need to be verified. This can be done using the<a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-java">Okta JWT Verifier library</a>. Construct access token and ID token verifiers as follows:</p>

   <code>val accessTokenVerifier = JwtVerifiers.accessTokenVerifierBuilder()
    .setAudience(oktaConfig.audience)
    .setIssuer(oktaConfig.orgUrl)
    .build()
val idVerifier = JwtVerifiers.idTokenVerifierBuilder()
    .setClientId(oktaConfig.clientId)
    .setIssuer(oktaConfig.orgUrl)
    .build()
</code>   

<p>Next, configure three login-specific endpoints. Ktor DSL assumes the following structure:</p>

   <code>fun Application.setupAuth() {
    ...
    routing {
        authenticate {
            // Okta calls this endpoint providing accessToken along with requested idToken
            get("/login/authorization-callback") {
                // ⚫ handle authorization
            }
            // When guest accessing /login it automatically redirects to okta login page
            get("/login") {
                // ⚫ perform login
            }
        }
        // Perform logout by cleaning cookies
        get("/logout") {
            // ⚫ perform logout
        }
    }
}
</code>   

 Sign in with the <code>/login</code> endpoint 

<p>It’s the easiest one. Ktor will require user authentication for all endpoints located within the <code>authenticate</code> block. If a user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the authorization URL. Its value is taken from the <code>authorizeUrl</code> property from <code>OktaConfig</code>.</p>

<p>Since the Ktor Auth module is handling this itself, the implementation is a single line. The condition checks if a visitor has a session and, if so, redirects it to the root of the website:</p>

   <code>// When guest accessing /login it automatically redirects to okta login page
get("/login") {
    call.respondRedirect("/")
}
</code>   

 Authorization endpoint <code>/login/authorization-callback</code> 

<p>Upon successful authorization, the user is redirected to this URL. The Okta authorization service provides access and ID tokens as part of the login flow. If unsure, <a>read our Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OIDC</a>.</p>

<p>To extract information (aka, parse the JWT) about the user, you can use Okta’s JWT Verifier. In the code below, the user’s name is taken from the token’s claims and “slugified”, to create a URL-safe alphanumeric username. Finally, a new session is created and the user redirected to the <code>/</code>.</p>

   <code>// Okta calls this endpoint providing accessToken along with requested idToken
get("/login/authorization-callback") {
    // Get a principal from from OAuth2 token
    val principal = call.authentication.principal&lt;OAuthAccessTokenResponse.OAuth2&gt;()
        ?: throw Exception("No principal was given")
    // Parse and verify access token with OktaJwtVerifier
    val accessToken = accessTokenVerifier.decode(principal.accessToken)
    // Get idTokenString, parse and verify id token
    val idTokenString = principal.extraParameters["id_token"]
        ?: throw Exception("id_token wasn't returned")
    val idToken = idVerifier.decode(idTokenString, null)
    // Try to get handle from the id token, of failback to subject field in access token
    val fullName = (idToken.claims["name"] ?: accessToken.claims["sub"] ?: "UNKNOWN_NAME").toString()
    println("User $fullName logged in successfully")
    // Create a session object with "slugified" username
    val session = UserSession(
        username = fullName.replace("[^a-zA-Z0-9]".toRegex(), ""),
        idToken = idTokenString
    )
    call.sessions.set(session)
    call.respondRedirect("/")
}
</code>   

 Logout endpoint <code>/logout</code> 

<p>Users might have reasons to log out from the website—they might even simply erase cookies! Some people may consider that a little bit too technical. You can help them to do so by resetting the session on the server-side:</p>

   <code>// Perform logout by cleaning session
get("/logout") {
    call.sessions.clear&lt;UserSession&gt;()
    call.respondRedirect("/")
}
</code>   

 Start Your Kotlin + Ktor Application 

<p>Run your application, open your browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and click Login from the top menu bar. You will see an Okta login screen. After you type your credentials you’ll be redirected back to the app but as a user this time. Try to send some messages!</p>

<p></p>

<p>🎉 Congratulations, you just added authorization to your service!</p>

 Logout with Okta 

<p>Did you try to t̶u̶r̶n̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶f̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶a̶g̶a̶i̶n̶ logout and login again? You might observe an unexpected behavior. If you checked “remember me” box in the Okta screen, you virtually can’t log out—or at least it looks like that.</p>

<p>From the user’s point of view, they expect to see a login screen inviting to put login/password——not to automatically be logged in:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You might ask yourself: why is it done this way? Why doesn’t the Authorization server purge sessions?</p>

<p>What if you’re using Facebook instead of Okta as an Authorization and Identity Provider service? And you want to logout from some website and that website also destroys your session in Facebook. It doesn’t sound nice, does it?</p>

<p>If you intend to logout users from Okta, as well, you’ll need to use something called RP-Initiated Logout. You can read more about it <a>in this blog post</a>. The basic idea is straightforward - after you remove a session inside your app, the user needs to visit a specially formed <code>logoutUrl</code> with <code>idToken</code> provided as a <code>GET</code> parameter. Update your logout handler in <code>src/auth.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>// Perform logout by cleaning cookies and start RP-initiated logout
get("/logout") {
    val idToken = call.session?.idToken

    call.sessions.clear&lt;UserSession&gt;()

    val redirectLogout = when (idToken) {
        null -&gt; "/"
        else -&gt; URLBuilder(oktaConfig.logoutUrl).run {
            parameters.append("post_logout_redirect_uri", "http://localhost:8080")
            parameters.append("id_token_hint", idToken)
            buildString()
        }
    }

    call.respondRedirect(redirectLogout)
}
</code>   

<p>Restart your application and try to logout. Now the application behaves as you’d expect:</p>

<p></p>

 Manage Users With Okta 

<p>The Nano Blogging Service is more fun when different people can log in! You can create additional users from the Okta Developer Console. From the top menu bar, click on Users, then Add Person. You’ll be presented with a dialog to add a new user:</p>

<p></p>

 Enable User Registration 

<p>Okta also provides a self-sign up service. You can enable it by heading to the Okta Developer Console, hovering over the Users top menu item, and selecting Registration from the sub-menu. Okta will show a single button you need to click to activate the feature:</p>

<p></p>

<p>If desired, tune the default options and save.</p>

<p>Then, when you try to sign in to your service, you’ll see a “Sign up” link:</p>

<p></p>

 Ktor Secure App Code Review 

<p>Now that you have everything working, let’s take a look at the Kotlin code that makes it all possible.</p>

 Ktor Data Layer 

<p>Look at the basic data models of your application in the <code>src/entities.kt</code> file:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demo.ktor
 
import java.time.LocalDateTime
 
data class BlogRecord(
    val userHandle: String,
    val text: String,
    val createdAt: LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now()
)
 
data class UserSession(
    val username: String,
    val idToken: String
)
</code>   

<p>The <code>BlogRecord</code> class contains information about the <code>userHandle</code>, posted <code>text</code> and <code>createdAt</code> timestamp. <code>UserSession</code> is an object which contains information about a currently signed in user; see the authentication section for more details.</p>

<p>The <code>BlogRecordRepository</code> class is responsible for data manipulation. For demo purposes, data is stored in memory and initialized with some dummy records at startup time.</p>

<p>Your data repository is in the <code>src/BlogRecordRepository.kt</code> file:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demo.ktor
 
class BlogRecordRepository {
    private val records = mutableListOf&lt;BlogRecord&gt;()
 
    val all: List&lt;BlogRecord&gt;
        get() = records
 
    fun insert(userHandle: String, text: String) {
        records += BlogRecord(userHandle, text)
    }
 
    fun byUser(userHandle: String) = records.filter { it.userHandle == userHandle }
}
 
val blogRecords = BlogRecordRepository().apply {
    insert("kack", "Hello world!")
    insert("kack", "Keep messages short and sweet! 💬")
    insert("ann", "OMG it's a future unikorn 🦄!")
    insert("rux", "Chronological feed! It's just like the good old days! ")
    insert("kotlin", "Wise language selection")
    insert("whitestone", "We'd like to invest 💰💰💰")
    insert("cat", "🐈🐱🙀😼😻🐾")
}
</code>   

 Ktor Main Application Configuration 

<p>Before you get into the route handling and login flow, the web service itself needs to be configured. As per convention, Ktor services are configured by creating an <code>Application.module()</code> extension function. Look at the configuration sections in <code>src/application.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demo.ktor
 
import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.features.*
import io.ktor.request.*
import io.ktor.sessions.*
import io.ktor.util.*
import org.slf4j.event.Level
import kotlin.collections.set
 
fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;): Unit = io.ktor.server.cio.EngineMain.main(args)
 
@Suppress("unused") // Referenced in application.conf
@kotlin.jvm.JvmOverloads
fun Application.module(testing: Boolean = false) {
    // Sessions are stored in encrypted cookies
    install(Sessions) {
        cookie&lt;UserSession&gt;("MY_SESSION") {
            val secretEncryptKey = hex("00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff")
            val secretAuthKey = hex("02030405060708090a0b0c")
            cookie.extensions["SameSite"] = "lax"
            cookie.httpOnly = true
            transform(SessionTransportTransformerEncrypt(secretEncryptKey, secretAuthKey))
        }
    }

    // Respond for HEAD verb
    install(AutoHeadResponse)

    // Load each request
    install(CallLogging) {
        level = Level.INFO
        filter { call -&gt; call.request.path().startsWith("/") }
    }

    // Configure ktor to use OAuth and register relevant routes
    setupAuth()

    // Register application routes
    setupRoutes()
}
 
// Shortcut for the current session
val ApplicationCall.session: UserSession?
    get() = sessions.get&lt;UserSession&gt;()
</code>   

<p>Your application module configures the session handler to keep data in encrypted cookies and enable logging, which is very useful for debugging. Two of the functions - <code>setupAuth()</code> and <code>setupRoutes()</code>- configure OAuth 2.0 and setup web service routes.</p>

 Ktor Service Routes 

<p>This application registers two routes with Ktor DSL making it very expressive:</p>

 
   <code>POST /</code> takes a <code>text</code> parameter from the body and current <code>actor</code>(user handle) from the session and creates a new nano blog record. Both <code>actor</code> and <code>text</code> must be valid to create a new record; otherwise, an error is thrown. Upon a successful insertion, the user gets redirected to the <code>/</code>. 
   <code>GET /{username?}</code> effectively handles all <code>GET</code> requests and attempts to extract the <code>username</code> URL parameter if present. Then, it renders the main template with either global or requested user’s feed using the <code>feedPage()</code> method. 
 

<p>See <code>src/routes.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demo.ktor
 
import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.html.*
import io.ktor.request.*
import io.ktor.response.*
import io.ktor.routing.*
 
fun Application.setupRoutes() = routing {
    post("/") { root -&gt;
        val actor = call.session?.username
            ?: throw Exception("User must be logged in first")
        val text = call.receiveParameters()["text"]?.takeIf(String::isNotBlank)
            ?: throw Exception("Invalid request - text must be provided")

        blogRecords.insert(actor, text)

        call.respondRedirect("/")
    }

    get("/{username?}") {
        val username = call.parameters["username"]
        call.respondHtmlTemplate(MainTemplate(call.session?.username)) {
            content {
                val canSendMessage = call.session != null
                if (username == null) feedPage("🏠 Home feed", blogRecords.all, canSendMessage)
                else feedPage("👤 ${username}'s blog", blogRecords.byUser(username), canSendMessage)
            }
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The page-rendering function, <code>feedPage()</code>, takes three parameters: page title, list of the nano blog posts to render, and a boolean flag <code>canSendMessage</code> (if it’s true, the text submission form will be visible). The variable <code>canSendMessage</code> is set to true only when the current user has an active session, that is possible only after login.</p>

 Type-Safe Views with Kotlin 

<p>Kotlin syntax empowers developers to create type-safe DSL. This Nano Blogging Service is using the <code>kotlinx.html</code> library, which provides HTML-like syntax for HTML-rendering. All the views are in the <code>src/views.kt</code> file.</p>

<p>The primary and only template <code>MainTemplate</code> includes Bootstrap CSS library, renders the top navbar menu, and provides a basic layout for the frontend:</p>

   <code>/**
* Generic web page template, contains content placeholder where
* content should be placed
*/
class MainTemplate(private val currentUsername: String? = null) : Template&lt;HTML&gt; {
    val content = Placeholder&lt;HtmlBlockTag&gt;()
    override fun HTML.apply() {
        head {
            title { +"Nano Blogging Service" }
            styleLink("https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css")
            meta(name = "viewport", content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no")
            meta(charset = "utf-8")
        }
        body("d-flex flex-column h-100") {
            header {
                div("navbar navbar-dark bg-dark shadow-sm") {
                    div("container") {
                        a(href = "/", classes = "font-weight-bold navbar-brand") {
                            +"📝 𝓝𝓐𝓝𝓞 𝓑𝓛𝓞𝓖𝓖𝓘𝓝𝓖 𝓢𝓔𝓡𝓥𝓘𝓒𝓔"
                        }
                        div("navbar-nav flex-row") {
                            if (currentUsername != null) {
                                a(href = "/${currentUsername}", classes = "nav-link mr-4") {
                                    +"Hello, $currentUsername"
                                }
                                a(href = "/logout", classes = "nav-link") {
                                    +"Logout"
                                }
                            } else {
                                div("navbar-text mr-4") {
                                    +"Hello, Guest"
                                }
                                div("navbar-item") {
                                    a(href = "/login", classes = "nav-link") {
                                        +"Login"
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            main("flex-shrink-0 mt-3") {
                div("container col-xs-12 col-lg-8") {
                    insert(content)
                }
            }
        }
    }

<p>Confused about plus(<code>+</code>) sign in front of the string inside HTML elements? Don’t worry. It’s just a shortcut for the <code>text()</code> function which sets current tag content.</p>

<p>View blocks such as <code>feedBlock()</code>, <code>sendMessageForm()</code> and <code>feedPage()</code> are extension functions (I know, there’s a lot of them!) on <code>FlowContent</code>. That prevents global scope pollution with enormous HTML DSL elements and provides better encapsulation.</p>

   <code>/**
 * Displays feed block only
 */
fun FlowContent.feedBlock(feedItems: List&lt;BlogRecord&gt;) {
    feedItems.forEach { record -&gt;
        div("entity card m-4") {
            div("w-100 card-header") {
                h4("user font-weight-bold mb-0 pb-0 d-inline-block") {
                    a(href = "/${record.userHandle}") { +record.userHandle }
                }
                span("float-right text-secondary") {
                    +record.createdAt.format(timeFormatter)
                }
            }
            div("card-body") {
                h5 { +record.text }
            }
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Renders send message form
 */
fun FlowContent.sendMessageForm() {
    form("/", encType = applicationXWwwFormUrlEncoded, method = post) {
        div("mb-3") {
            div("input-group") {
                input(classes = "form-control", name = "text") {
                    placeholder = "Your nano message"
                    required = true
                    autoFocus = true
                }
                div("input-group-append") {
                    button(classes = "btn btn-success") { +"Send! 🚀" }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

/**

Data Sovereignty Now: unleashing the benefits of data in line with European values<br>Webinar: Thursday 22 October 2020 – 14:15:15 CET




 




On behalf of ourselves and our partners, <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org/2020/09/30/event-webinar-datasovereignty-now-political/">we are pleased to invite you to our webinar </a>debate on ‘Data Sovereignty Now: unleashing the benefits of data in line with European values’. The webinar is especially interesting for politicians and their staff in Europe.



It is the aim of the European Commission and local governments to unleash the full benefits of data usage for everyone in Europe in line with European values. Data sovereignty holds the key to achieving that.<br><br>It is a worthy ambition, but one that also raises a number of questions, such as what exactly is data sovereignty, how does it support European values, and how can organisations in the public/private sector help to accomplish this ambition?<br><br>These questions will be addressed in the webinar on 22 October.<br><br>Featuring:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arief-ernst-hühn-1721bb40/">Arief Hühn</a>, researcher at&nbsp;FreedomLab, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericpol/">Eric Pol</a>, founder of A New Governance and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a>, CEO &amp; Founder of Meeco.<br><br>Followed by panel discussion featuring&nbsp;the following experts: Eric Pol, Katryna Dow, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsinipuro/">Jaana Sinipuro</a> (project director at Sitra), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerardvdhoeven/">Gerard van der Hoeven</a> (director of&nbsp;the iSHARE Foundation) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/douwel/">Douwe </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/douwel/">Lycklama</a> (founder of&nbsp;INNOPAY).<br>

Die EU-Datenstrategie fordert verantwortungsvolle Ökosysteme für personenbezogene Daten – MyData-Operatoren sind die Antwort.  comuny ist nun offiziell eines dieser richtungsweisenden Systeme.<br> <p>Eine weltweite Bewegung führender Unternehmen und Experten stellt sich auf für das neue Normale beim Datensharing und zeichnet das Produkt Trust Data Operator des deutschen Security-Startups comuny GmbH mit dem bemerkenswerten Status “MyData Operator 2020” aus.</p><p>Die Auszeichnung wurde am 14.10.2020 an sieben weltweit führende Unternehmen aus sieben Ländern verliehen, die sich alle für einen ausgewogenen Umgang mit persönlichen Daten einsetzen. “Wir sind überglücklich und bekommen mit dieser Auszeichnung eine weitere Bestätigung dafür, wie innovativ und wertvoll der Einsatz unseres Produktes ist”, so Beatrix Reiß, die zusammen mit ihrem Geschäftspartner Dominik Deimel comuny zu diesem Erfolg geführt hat. “Dominik und ich kommen aus dem eHealth-Markt und wissen aus langjähriger Erfahrung, vor welchen Hürden Modelle für neue Services, Versorgung und Zusammenarbeit stehen. Das wollten wir ändern.”</p><p>comuny erhält diese Auszeichnung für den Nachweis, wie verifizierte Daten zwischen Unternehmen und Kunde, Diensten und Lösungspartnern unter Einbeziehung und zum Vorteil aller Beteiligten übergreifend fließen. Der comuny Trust Data Operator beweist als B2B-Komponente hier das enorme Geschäftspotenzial, welches aus dem verantwortungsbewusstem Umgang mit Daten durch einen Operator entsteht.</p><p>“Viele sehen heute einfach nicht die Chancen, die eine wertschätzende digitale Beziehung mit sich bringt: bessere digitale Prozesse, Kosteneinsparungen, höhere Kundenzufriedenheit und nicht zuletzt das positive digitale Image für’s Geschäft. Deshalb unterstützen wir Unternehmen hier und lösen quasi nebenbei ihre dringenden Probleme im Kundendatenmanagement” freut sich Dominik Deimel. Das beweist comuny gerade mit ersten Kunden, so ist über den comuny Operator der Zugang zur elektronischen Patientenakte oder die Ausgabe der elektronischen Gesundheitskarte nach PDSG komplett digital möglich. Für die elektronische Patientenakte arbeitet comuny mit einer der größten Krankenkassen Deutschlands zusammen, um die Nutzung der ePA für ihre Versicherten so komfortabel wie möglich zu gestalten. comuny wurde außerdem ins aktuelle Batch#20 des InsurLab Germany berufen – das ist wie ein Ritterschlag der deutschen Versicherer.</p><p>Die 7 Organisationen, denen der Status “MyData Operator 2020” verliehen wurde, repräsentieren verschiedenste Länder und Serviceangebote. Einige bieten breit gefächerte Dienstleistungen direkt für Einzelpersonen an, einige haben fokussierte Angebote in nur einer Branche, während wieder andere Technologien und Infrastruktur für Dritte bereitstellen, um stärker auf Bedürfnisse von Kunden ausgerichtete Dienste zu ermöglichen. Sie alle dürfen ab sofort das Logo “MyData Operator 2020” verwenden und erklären, dass ihnen “der Status MyData Operator 2020 von MyData Global in Anerkennung ihres Wirkens für eine menschenorientierte Infrastruktur zur Datenverarbeitung und -nutzung verliehen wurde”.</p><p>Einzigartig an MyData-Operatoren ist auch ihr Wille zur radikalen Zusammenarbeit für sichere Datenflüsse ohne Lock-In-Effekt. Die Preisträger arbeiten untereinander zusammen, um ein erfolgreiches, interoperables Ökosystem für personenbezogene Daten zu schaffen. Joss Langford, Co-Leiter der thematischen Gruppe MyData-Operatoren gratuliert den Preisträgern “für ihre Integrität, ihren Einsatz und ihre Offenheit bei diesem beispiellosen Informationsaustausch, der weit über die Anforderungen jeglicher Gesetzgebung hinausgeht.”</p><p>“Wir glauben, dass offene Ökosysteme, die den Menschen echte Wahlmöglichkeiten zwischen guten Alternativen bieten, die neue Norm für persönliche Daten und darauf gestützte digitale Dienste sind. Die gegenwärtige Situation ist sowohl aus menschlicher als auch aus Marktperspektive unhaltbar”, erklärt Teemu Ropponen, Geschäftsführer von MyData Global.</p><p>Weitere Information</p>  Diese Organisationen wurden jetzt mit dem Status “MyData Operator 2020” ausgezeichnet: <a href="https://mydata.org/operators/">org/operators/</a>  Weißbuch “Understanding MyData operators” herunterladen oder Neuigkeiten aller MyData Operatoren verfolgen: <a href="https://mydata.org/operators/">https://mydata.org/operators/</a>  MyData Global beitreten: <a href="http://www.mydata.org/join/">mydata.org/join/</a>  MyDataGermany LinkedIn-Gruppe beitreten: <a href="https://lnkd.in/dF_Jrxf">https://lnkd.in/dF_Jrxf</a>  Was ist der <a href="https://www.comuny.de/produkt/">comuny Trust Data Operator</a>?  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>#MyData #MyDataOperator #PersonalData #DataEconomy #future-of-trust #ecosystems #trust-services #operator #collaboration #MyDataGlobal #MyDataGermany #humanTec</p> Materialien <p>Pressemitteilung</p><p>Download als PDF <a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/20201016_MyData-Operator_awards_COMUNY_press-release_dt.pdf">20201016_MyData Operator_awards_COMUNY_press release_dt.pdf</a></p><p>Download als docx <a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/20201016_MyDataOperator_awards_COMUNY_press-release_dt.docx">20201016_MyDataOperator_awards_COMUNY_press release_dt.docx</a></p><p>Übersicht Preisträger PDF <a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/List-of-all-the-awarded-MyData-Operators.pdf">List of all the awarded MyData Operators.pdf</a></p><p>Übersicht Preisträger docx <a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/List-of-all-the-awarded-MyData-Operators.docx">List of all the awarded MyData Operators.docx</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bildmaterial &amp; Logos </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Logos aller am 14.10.2020 ausgezeichneten Operatoren weltweit</p><p></p><p>Logos aller bisher anerkannten MyData Operatoren weltweit</p><p>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bild von MyData mit Joss Langford (Co-Leiter der Themen Gruppe MyData-Operatoren und leitender Redakteur des Weißbuchs “Understanding MyData Operators)</p><p></p><p>Logo der MyData Themengruppe “Operatoren”</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Logo comuny GmbH</p><p></p>

  <p>Ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic, 10 large pharmaceutical companies — including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca and GSK — undertook collaborative efforts to train their drug discovery, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/understand-3-key-types-of-machine-learning/">machine learning</a> (ML) algorithms on each other’s data to promote drug discovery. The goal? To accelerate and reduce the cost of the discovery of drugs. They used digital trust technologies, including <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-reality-of-blockchain/">blockchain</a>, to share data without compromising confidential or commercial secrets.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2023, organizations that promote data sharing will outperform their peers on most business value metrics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rare example shows that organizations can deliver more value when they collaborate in sharing data externally — even with competitors — yielding comparatively increased value through efficiency and cost savings for each organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There should be more collaborative data sharing unless there is a vetted reason not to, as not sharing data often frustrates business outcomes and can be detrimental,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/65875">Lydia Clougherty Jones</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>Data and analytics leaders who promote both internal and external data sharing are more successful in demonstrating superior team and organizational performance. In fact, Gartner predicts that by 2023, organizations that promote data sharing will outperform their peers on most business value metrics.</p>
<p>Yet, at the same time Gartner predicts that through 2022, less than 5% of data-sharing programs will correctly identify trusted data and locate trusted data sources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The traditional “don’t share data unless” mindset has outlived its original purpose</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many organizations inhibit access to data, preserving data silos and discouraging data sharing. This unnecessarily undermines efforts to maximize business and social value from data and analytics — at a time when <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-communicate-important-covid-19-data/">COVID-19 is driving demand for data and analytics</a> to unprecedented levels. The traditional “don’t share data unless” mindset has outlived its original purpose.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-achieve-smart-data-sharing/">How to Achieve Smart Data Sharing</a></p>
<p>This default must be reversed to an approach of “must share data unless.” By recasting data sharing as a business necessity, data and analytics leaders will have access to the right data at the right time, enabling more robust data and analytics strategies that deliver business benefit and digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it’s not easy to change the status quo, data and analytics leaders must ask themselves what two areas to prioritize now to foster a data sharing mindset. The answer: Establishing trust-based mechanisms and preparing a data-sharing environment.&nbsp;</p>
 Establish trust-based mechanisms 
<p>If you do not introduce trust throughout your data-sharing process, you cannot achieve business value from the data you collect. Gartner predicts that through 2023, organizations that can instill digital trust will be able to participate in 50% more ecosystems, expanding revenue-generation opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Develop trust-based mechanisms that establish high levels of trust in the data source and separately in the trustworthiness of the data. This allows you to align appropriate data use with your business goals, both within and outside your organization.</p>
<p>It’s important to trust the quality of the data you collect, use and share to match your business context and requirements. Separately, organizations must trust their data sources so that they can rely on (and pass on to others) appropriate and enforceable rights to use, reuse, share and reshare data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Foster a data-sharing culture — not a data “ownership” culture — by identifying the emotional impacts and inherent biases that hamper data sharing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adopt digital trust technologies such as blockchain smart contracts, which enable a trusted data collection method, while also enabling the efficient transfer and sharing of any asset of monetary or nonmonetary value.</p>
<p>Overall, use data-quality metrics and augmented data catalogs to compile your data and data source trustworthiness evaluations. By 2021, organizations that offer users access to a curated catalog of internally and externally prepared data will realize 100% more business value from analytics investments than those that do not.</p>
 Preparing a data-sharing environment&nbsp; 
<p>To establish a data-sharing environment, work with your business leaders across business units to create a data-sharing mindset. Foster a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/create-a-data-driven-culture-by-influencing-3-areas/">data-sharing culture</a> — not a data “ownership” culture — by identifying the emotional impacts and inherent biases that hamper data sharing.</p>
<p>Within your IT department, distinguish your data management strategy between <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-best-ways-to-organize-your-data-structures/">data warehouses, data lakes and data hubs</a>. Gartner predicts that through 2020, organizations that adopt data hub strategies will achieve outcomes dependent on shared and governed data with at least 60% lower cost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create new and flexible data management practices that adapt to uncertain and changing environments. And, drive organizational enablement of data sharing, prioritizing use cases in which increased data sharing will yield maximum alignment with business outcomes — including increased costs savings, net new revenue or nonmonetary value creation, or improved risk mitigation decision making.</p>

<p>Couchbase, the creator of the enterprise-class, multi-cloud NoSQL database, today announced at the Connect Conference that Gluu was acknowledged with the Couchbase Independent Software Vendor Partner of the Year Award. Guest judges for the Couchbase Community Awards included Carl Olofson, Research Vice President at IDC, and Jon Reed, Co-Founder of Diginomica.</p>
<p>Open to Couchbase’s network of more than 300 partners, the award recognizes partners’ work in bringing differentiation and innovation to customers, and leading them to successful outcomes.</p>
<p>The Couchbase database is used for Gluu Server authentication and authorization requirements that requires extreme concurrency and “active-active” multi-datacenter replication. “Couchbase and cloud native technology has enabled Gluu for the first time to achieve true horizontal auto-scaling,” said Michael Schwartz, CEO of Gluu. “It’s a great honor to win this award, because it recognizes the sustained efforts of our combined engineering teams to make this accomplishment a reality. Couchbase has enabled Gluu to make performance into a competitive advantage. We’re crushing the competition in both transactions per second and total cost of ownership. You can’t do this stuff with ancient LDAP servers, no matter how much lipstick you put on them.”</p>
<p>Learn more from Gluu and Couchbase’s previous joint press release: <a href="https://www.gluu.org/resources/documents/articles/billion-authentications-per-day/"><br>Open Source Gluu Server and Couchbase Shatter Billion-Login-Per-Day Threshold</a></p>
<p>“We are excited to not only continue, but to strengthen our long-standing partnership with Gluu,” said Matt McDonough, Vice President of Business Development at Couchbase. “Through Couchbase and Gluu’s cloud native approach, we’ve been able to split services and workloads to support auto-scaling easily enough to surpass the 1B authentications in a single day milestone. Together, we will continue to optimize the Couchbase platform along with Gluu’s robust, industry-proven solution for single sign-on and two-factor authentication to deliver the next billion authentications in a day.”</p>

<p>The problem of trust over a network is longstanding. It has been addressed in a variety of ways since the internet blossomed, but never as yet solved.</p>



<p>Take, for example, Certificate Authorities (CAs), the organizations with the power to issue certificates to websites so browsers will recognize them as legitimate. These certificates function as a primitive identification for websites, where the CA is attesting to the identity of the website and the website can use this certificate to identify itself to browsers – because all browsers trust the CAs.</p>



<p>The flaw here though is obvious: what if a CA is compromised and begins issuing false certificates? No set of keys can be considered absolutely immune to compromise, no matter how powerful the controller.</p>



<p>The central problem here is that of trustless key distribution and attribution (more specifically, the implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/dkms-recommendations.md">Distributed Key Management System (DKMS)</a>. That is, how do we know that a key is truly controlled by an identifier and, given an identifier, how can we know which keys it controls? (It’s important to note here that CAs are not trustless mechanisms, but that browsers rely entirely on trusting that a CA has not been compromised.)</p>



<p>Decentralized digital identity using the technology of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) appears to remedy the issue. However, this <a href="https://mattr.global/overview-of-decentralized-identity-standards/">collection of related specifications</a> only defines a consistent interface for different DID methods to implement a DKMS in any way they see fit, as well as associated semantics to make them very flexible and useful.</p>



<p>The exact way that key distribution and attribution is addressed is different between DID methods. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and blockchains have proven effective for the purposes of designing decentralized DID methods and even centralized trust-requiring systems, such as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/github-did">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://github.com/did-twit/did-twit/blob/master/spec/index.md">Twitter</a>, have been used.</p>



<p>Most DID methods are still fairly young, but they often share certain characteristics:</p>



  Central registry-based: the infrastructure might be decentralized (e.g. a blockchain or other DLT), however the DID method is informationally centralized, i.e. registration and resolution involve the updating or reading of the shared state of a single network or infrastructure.  Canonicity: the central registry is considered to be the single trustworthy source of truth.  Availability provision: the central registry’s entire state can be queried at any time from anywhere (with a network connection).  



<p>The logical centralization of these kinds of methods provides an important, arguably more fundamental property: conflict resolution. The underlying consensus mechanism of these DID method implementations (e.g. the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">Bitcoin blockchain for did:btcr</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver/blob/develop/README.md">Ethereum blockchain for did:ethr</a>) prevents any conflicting states from being propagated on the network. And if this sounds similar to a cryptocurrency, that’s because it is.</p>



<p>Blockchain consensus mechanisms were and are designed to maintain some kind of invariant about the current state of the chain. In Bitcoin and other currency chains, this invariant is the amount of existing coins: the mechanism is designed to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spend problem</a>. It seemingly makes sense, then, to use this property of blockchains for identity. Or does it?</p>



<p>Interestingly, it actually does not. The invariant of single-spend leads to slow consensus time because it must be applied to the globally-shared state of the chain. In identity, however, we do not have a double-spend problem.</p>



<p>The invariant we care about in identity is different. It is only that an update to the state of the keys and other metadata associated with an identifier be valid. The crux here is that the state of accounts (i.e. identifiers) never overlap or depend upon each other.</p>







 So, where does KERI fit into this? 



<p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. It was initially conceived by Dr. Samuel Smith, distributed systems pioneer and founder of <a href="https://www.pro-sapien.com/">ProSapien</a>, and is now being worked on and implemented under the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). In a nutshell, KERI is a flexible, secure, minimal and privacy-preserving trustless DKMS.</p>



<p>In contrast to blockchain or central registry-based trust systems, KERI is based on a hash-chain data structure called a ‘key event receipt log’ (KERL). Conceptually, it’s similar in some ways to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DID Method specification</a>, except that its data model is a KERL rather than a DID document. And while KERI can be used as a DID method, it is fundamentally not reliant on any of the DID specifications and can be used in many other contexts as well. In particular, it is also useful for Internet of Things (IoT) networks and other security-conscious, low-resource use cases.</p>







System design trade space. (visual rework of the original graphics by <br><a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM">Samuel Smith</a>)



 Exploring events 



<p>A KERL is composed of a list of key events and witness receipts – more on these later. A key event, however, is a transaction signed by the controller of the identifier and indicates an update in the state of the identifier’s keys or other semantics. There are a few basic kinds of key events.</p>



  Inception: this event signals the creation of an identifier, and it cryptographically binds some information to the identifier. The result of an inception event is an identifier with two sets of keys: one for signing, another for controlling. The signing key set can be used to authenticate as the identifier, while the control key set (which is hashed and not visible in the event) can be used to create rotation events.  Rotation: this event signals the change of signing and control keys for the identifier. KERI relies upon a rule called pre-rotation for post-quantum security. Rotation events maintain this rule. Upon rotation, the control keys (used to sign the rotation event) become the new signing keys, while a new set of control keys is added. This ensures that no attacker can ever compromise the control keys because they are never used (or perhaps never even existed in the first place) until they sign the transaction which makes them no longer the control keys. A rotation event which has an empty set for the control keys is equivalent to abandoning the identifier (as no new control events are possible).  Interaction: these events simply contain a commitment to a piece of data. Within KERI they can be used by a delegator to commit to – and thus finalize – a delegated inception or rotation event.  Delegated inception: this event signals adding a new set of delegated keys to the identifier. Similar to the inception event, this new key set has an identifier created by cryptographically binding its inception data, and as such can be referenced by a “path” from the main identifier, e.g. identifier#delegated_identifier.  Delegated rotation: this event signals the rotation of a delegated key set, similarly to the rotation event. Much like the main identifier, the delegated identifier does not change when the underlying key set is rotated.  



 State update rules 



<p>Along with these event types, there is a set of rules for validating a list of these events. The result of applying these rules is an identifier and a set of keys which are proven to be controlled by the identifier. In simple terms, these rules are:</p>



  There can only be one inception event, and it must come first.  Each rotation event must be signed by the control keys established by the previous events and must set the new signing keys to be the previous set of control keys.  Each delegated inception or rotation event must be signed by the signing keys established by the previous events.  All events must have a monotonically-increasing counter.  All events must contain the hash of the previous event.  



<p>These rules, when applied to the key events, provide the conflict resolution mechanism which enables KERI to work independently of a central registry. A key event log or KEL (i.e. a log containing only events with no receipts) which is being updated will reject an incorrect event. By appending the first valid event, all other valid events for that place in the KEL are rendered invalid (i.e. the counter or backhash or some other semantic detail will be deemed incorrect).</p>



<p>The key event log validation rules provide a way to know the correct key state for an identifier, just as the consensus rules of the Bitcoin blockchain provide a way to know the correct balance of an account. In this sense, a KEL can be thought of as a “single-account blockchain” or micro-ledger. This is perfect for knowing a KEL is valid — but when presented with multiple different KELs for a single Identifier, how can one know which is the “true” KEL?</p>



 Witnesses 



<p>The witness system is the conflict resolution mechanism for KERLs (remember, a KERL is a KEL plus witness receipts), the same way that the validation rules serve as the conflict resolution mechanism for key events. In an inception event, the creator of the event can list several “witness” identifiers. Upon creation of a key event (every kind, not just inception), the entity must present the event to its witnesses and in return the witness gives a signature of that event. These signatures are compiled into a witness receipt for each event in the KEL. In the case of divergent conflicting KELs being detected, a validator can collect the KEL and the witness receipts into a KERL and prove which is correct via an algorithm called KAACE (KERI’s Agreement Algorithm for Control Establishment, see section 11 of the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI white paper</a> for more details).</p>



<p>The security mechanism here is subtle but very effective:</p>



  The witnesses are cryptographically bound to the identifier in the inception event.  The witnesses are assumed to be trusted (or at least not known to be malicious) by the creator of the identifier and give signatures which cannot be repudiated.  Any attacker must compromise both the control keys of the identifier (very difficult already because of pre-rotation) and all of the signing keys used by the witnesses. If there is more than one event, they will have to compromise the entire key history of each current and previous witness and the identifier. This is much more difficult than, say, compromising the single key pair used to secure a Bitcoin account.  



<p>With these security properties, a KERI-based identifier is at least as hard to compromise as most blockchain accounts, equivalent to compromising a single private key. What’s more, a KERI-based identifier is more difficult to attack, being equivalent to reversing several hash functions and compromising an arbitrary number of private keys held by different parties.</p>



<p>This makes KERI an incredibly flexible and powerful way of managing identifiers and keys without recourse to, reliance on, or vulnerability through any centralized or decentralized service or infrastructure.</p>



<p>KERI can even act as a bridging account, whereby key pairs for different ledger networks can be managed and linked under a single Identifier, due to its cryptographic flexibility. This is because KERI currently supports five signature schemes and can be extended to add more.</p>



<p>Ultimately KERI’s core value propositions are:</p>



  Enforced pre-rotation: ensures that the recovery keys are never exposed prior to use, so that even an attacker with a quantum computer can not crack the recovery key set.  Ambient verifiability: events being verifiable without reliance on a global state which must be kept synchronised allows for KERI to be effective on any scale and in any deployment environment, networked or not.  Flexible trust structures: the two-layer multisig combined with the rotatable witness set provides support for any imaginable arrangement of trust, or none at all.

   Demand for Online Voter Registration and Voting Doubles During the Pandemic 

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic made people – perhaps for the first time – consider if it is really worth it to leave their homes for many activities. Is picking the right apple at the grocery store worth the risk? As we near the U.S. presidential election, this same question remains, although the stakes are much higher. Constituents shouldn’t have to agonize between choosing their health&nbsp;over casting a vote, or vice-versa, because there’s a better solution. It’s time for the U.S. to bring e-voting to the American people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what’s stopping the U.S. from implementing e-voting? Creating a national system of voting online is very much within the realm of possibility today. We have all the tools and technologies available at our disposal today. Below, we address common myths and objections.&nbsp;</p>

 
 


 Myth #1: People don’t want to e-vote. 

<p>As the world remains in the grips of a global pandemic, people’s preferences towards digital activities are changing rapidly across industries. In fact, findings from ForgeRock’s <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/112194411/industry-brief/forgerock-consumer-behavior-report-the-new-normal.pdf">New Normal Report</a> show consumer preferences for online voting doubled across all regions. Almost two-thirds of consumers prefer to register to vote online as well. Inarguably, most voters want a modern and secure way to cast their ballot, which means the end of the paper ballot’s exclusivity is likely near.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At ForgeRock, we believe that <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">digital identity</a> has a huge part to play in this. Digital identity technology can be essential in securing registration, user identification, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">authentication</a> – all key steps in ensuring a trustworthy and accurate vote count.</p>

   Myth #2: E-voting will enable voter fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Today, verification of votes is utterly archaic. It relies on polling volunteers to compare signatures on voter cards, which seems absurdly low tech, given the digital world we live in. That said, it is challenging to compromise in-person voting at scale. Fraudsters would have to send pretend “voters” one by one to the polls to pass off the false votes – and that’s a federal felony. For the risk, the reward just isn’t there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>E-voting, on the other hand, would introduce a much stronger root of trust than we have in the existing voting system. Identity verification technologies, which are widely available on the market today, can quickly validate the authenticity that people are who they say they are. They use a variety of methods that are much stronger than today’s simple signature match. Technologies such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network#trust-network-bb">biometrics</a>, device reputation, behavioral signals, and other digital identity capabilities offer a much more accurate validation of a voter’s identity and avoid widespread voter fraud. These digital identity technologies would transparently put every voter through multiple layers of validation that would provide much greater security without adding friction to the voter experience. The Real ID system that has now been adopted in all 50 states in the U.S. is one step forward toward a minimum standard of identity information. Real ID state licenses are required to provide a core set of security and validation features that make state licenses a very strong level of identity validation.</p>

 Myth #3: E-voting will create a new attack vector for hackers and invalidate election results.&nbsp; 

<p>One of the reasons that the U.S. voting system is resistant to manipulation today is its decentralized nature. Town to town, state to state, voting methods vary. To create an e-voting system that is resistant to an external digital attack, it, too, must be distributed or decentralized. Blockchain, which is already being utilized for online voting in several countries, is one technology that could be critical. By making it difficult to manipulate individual votes, through containerizing the voting information, utilizing encryption, rotating keys, and leveraging distributed ledger technology, hackers will face a similar challenge to paper ballots – the effort to access a single vote means it would require too much effort to impact the larger voting pool.&nbsp;</p>

 Myth #4: There is no way to maintain anonymity in voting digitally.&nbsp; 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">Identity and access management</a> (IAM) solutions are used by the biggest brands every day with a need to balance both <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">privacy </a>and data integrity. A decentralized, blockchain-based recording of votes could be held as an unchangeable backup, similar to the paper backup approach used today, while the information aggregated and shared outside that blockchain removes personally identifiable information (PII).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital voting would likely need to be decoupled into several steps to maintain <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security</a> and anonymity simultaneously. A user would need to be strongly authenticated. A record that an individual voted would need to be stored in an immutable way that can’t be linked to their actual vote. The individual’s vote would need to be deposited in a different immutable system so that votes can be easily counted and never changed. Maintaining this strict separation ensures that the vote can’t be traced back and linked to the individual who cast it.&nbsp;</p>

 Myth #5: Online voting will disenfranchise those who do not have access to smartphones or computers.&nbsp; 

<p>With voters at risk of exposing themselves to COVID-19, or the potential risk of future pandemics increasing the need for voting alternatives, e-voting should replace in-person voting. While the vast majority would benefit, there would still be measures in place for those who can’t cast an e-vote. New approaches should be introduced to ensure that no one is left behind in the voting process, but providing an e-voting option quickly will give U.S. citizens an opportunity to balance the risks they face between health and patriotism without having to stand in historically long lines, which have already become an issue in the 2020 election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we move towards an e-voting future, the disenfranchised cannot be left behind. Rather, our focus should be on re-enfranchising these communities while ensuring alternative solutions are in place so that every voice is heard and the digital divide doesn’t become the civic divide. These efforts will be well worth the investment in the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At ForgeRock, we have a big hammer in our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>, but voting is a nail-shaped problem that is rooted in identity. The capability to securely identify a person, anonymize and secure their session, and then record their vote is, at its core, digital identity. While identity can't entirely make e-voting 100% viable, as lots of other factors will contribute to its ultimate success, e-voting can’t exist without identity. To create a safe option for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/government">citizens</a> to exercise their right and responsibility to vote, the U.S. must make e-voting a reality, starting with the 2024 election. The good news is that the technology is already here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>With <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/releases">Laravel 8’s release in September 2020</a>, the popular PHP framework continues to offer new features and improvements. After version 5, Laravel moved to semantic versioning and the more frequent releases have meant smaller changes between each one. That said, there are still several exciting updates in this version of the framework.</p>

<p>While Laravel will continue to offer security fixes for version 7 until early 2021, no more bug fixes will be released after October 2020, so you should upgrade to Laravel 8 as soon as possible. In this article, you’ll see all the new features and changes released in Laravel 8. After going through the new features, I’ll show you how to add authentication to your Laravel 8 application using Okta.</p>

 Jetstream 

<p>The biggest new feature available in Laravel 8 is an application scaffolding tool called <a href="https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/introduction.html">Jetstream</a>. Long-time Laravel users are probably familiar with <a href="https://spark.laravel.com/">Laravel Spark</a>, which adds authentication, billing, teams, and improved security options to Laravel for a small fee. Jetstream now offers almost all of Spark’s features (without the billing) for free.</p>

<p>While Jetstream won’t help you much if you’re upgrading an existing Laravel app, as you’ve probably already built the features you need, it will accelerate the process of building new applications. Developers who take advantage of Jetstream’s features won’t have to build user profiles, change password flows, API token generation, or team account creation from scratch. You can also integrate Jetstream into third-party authentication providers like Okta using its various <a href="https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/features/authentication.html#customizing-the-authentication-process">authentication hooks</a>.</p>

<p>That said, Jetstream isn’t going to be right for everyone. It’s opinionated so, while it gives you two options for scaffolding your frontend code (<a href="https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/stacks/livewire.html">Livewire</a> or <a href="https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/stacks/inertia.html">Inertia.js</a>), you won’t get much out of it if you’re already committed to another popular frontend framework like React or Angular. Jetstream also relies on <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a>, so users of Bootstrap or other styling libraries will have a lot of work to customize all the CSS elements.</p>

<p>Depending on your application workflow and priorities, Jetstream could save you a ton of time. You can also publish the package’s files and edit them, so it’s possible to customize everything it does to suit your needs.</p>

 Migration Schema Dumps 

<p>If you’ve worked on a Laravel application for a long time, you might have dozens or hundreds of database migration files in your project. Typically, you’ll only run the newest ones each time but, when a new developer joins your team or you want to refresh your database tables, you’ll have to run all those migrations in sequence again.</p>

<p>Laravel 8’s new <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/migrations#squashing-migrations"><code>schema:dump</code> command</a> fixes this problem. After you run the Artisan command, your existing migrations will be “squashed” and saved to a single SQL file. You can opt to set the <code>--prune</code> flag, which will also remove the original migration files from your project. Next time you run all your migrations, Laravel will just run the SQL file, followed by any newer migrations you’ve added since the squash.</p>

<p>To see the schema dump in action, <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation">create a new Laravel 8 project</a> and connect a MySQL or Postgres database. Laravel comes with a few default migrations, so once you configure your database, you can run the following:</p>

   <code>php artisan schema:dump --prune
</code>   

<p>You’ll see that Laravel has deleted your migrations in the <code>./database/migrations</code> directory and created a single SQL file in the <code>./database/schema</code> directory. Now, you can run all your migrations again, and Laravel will use the SQL file:</p>

   <code>php artisan migrate:fresh
</code>   

<p>Note that Laravel 8’s migration schema dumps only work when using a SQL-based database like MySQL or PostgreSQL. NoSQL databases like MongoDB can’t use this feature, and it doesn’t work for SQLite yet either.</p>

 Class-based Factories 

<p>Laravel has removed model factory functions in favor of <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/database-testing#writing-factories">class-based model factories</a>. This means that you can create an instance of a model for testing or seeding purposes using the new <code>factory()</code> method. For example, the following code will create five users and save them to your database:</p>

   <code>User::factory()-&gt;count(5)-&gt;create();
</code>   

<p><a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker">Faker</a> is always available to factory classes, so it’s really easy to generate nice-looking test data. If you need legacy support for factory functions, <a href="https://github.com/laravel/legacy-factories">Laravel released a package</a> that you can use to maintain the old method until you upgrade your code.</p>

 Rate Limiting Improvements 

<p>Before Laravel 8, the best way to add rate-limiting to your application was to use the <code>throttle</code> middleware. You could customize this middleware by <a href="https://bannister.me/blog/custom-throttle-middleware/">extending it or creating your own class</a>, but it wasn’t easy to do.</p>

<p>In version 8, Laravel added a new method to the <code>RouteServiceProvider</code> called <code>configureRateLimiting()</code>. Here you can use Laravel’s new <code>RateLimiter</code> facade to implement custom logic around rate limiting. For example, you could allow admins to make unlimited API requests while other users are limited to 60 requests per minute:</p>

   <code>...
    protected function configureRateLimiting()
    {
        RateLimiter::for('api', function (Request $request) {
            return $request-&gt;user()-&gt;isAdmin() ? 
                Limit::none() :
                Limit::perMinute(60);
        });
    }
...
</code>   

<p>Complex logic around rate limits can be compelling for API-based Laravel applications.</p>

 Improved Maintenance Mode Options 

<p>Developers typically put their Laravel apps into <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/configuration#maintenance-mode">maintenance mode</a> while running tasks like upgrading Composer packages or database migrations. In previous versions of Laravel, developers could use their IP address to bypass maintenance mode, but in Laravel 8, this method has been replaced with URL-based tokens.</p>

<p>For example, put your application into maintenance mode using the following command:</p>

   <code>php artisan down --secret="12345"
</code>   

<p>Users won’t be able to access the application unless they navigate to <code>&lt;YOUR_APP_URL&gt;/12345</code>. If they do this, they can bypass maintenance mode and see the application. This allows you to share a link with other developers or stakeholders who might need to bypass maintenance mode.</p>

<p>Another problem with maintenance mode in previous versions of Laravel was that it depended on Laravel being in a working state. In other words, if your <code>composer install</code> command broke your Laravel installation, the maintenance page would be broken too.</p>

<p>To get around this, Laravel 8 added an option to prerender a specific view that users will see while your app is in maintenance mode. For example, if you want to show the default Laravel 503 error page during maintenance mode, you can run the following:</p>

   <code>php artisan down --render="errors::503"
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>This feature ensures that maintenance mode is more robust. While you don’t want to spend too much time in maintenance mode, you want it to work.</p>

 Time Traveling Tests 

<p>Testing time-based code is always tricky. Applications that rely on time differences relative to <code>now()</code> will have difficulty testing their logic. Fortunately, Laravel 8 includes a new <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/mocking#interacting-with-time">time manipulation feature</a> that allows you to change the application’s perceived time during testing.</p>

<p>For example, you might have a method on your User model that returns <code>true</code> when a user’s account is more than 90 days old:</p>

   <code>...
    public function isExperienced()
    {
        return $this-&gt;created_at &lt; Carbon::now()-&gt;subDays(90);
    }
...
</code>   

<p>To test this, you can write a test that uses the <code>travel()</code> method:</p>

   <code>...
    public function testUserIsExperienced()
    {
        $user = User::inRandomOrder()-&gt;first();

        $this-&gt;travel(91)-&gt;days();
        $this-&gt;assertTrue($user-&gt;isExperienced());

        $this-&gt;travelBack();
        $this-&gt;assertFalse($user-&gt;isExperienced());
    }
...
</code>   

<p>This feature dramatically improves your ability to test time-based code and catch edge cases.</p>

 Other Improvements 

<p>In addition to the significant new features outlined above, Laravel 8 also includes many relatively small improvements you can read more about in <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/releases">the version 8 release notes</a>. For example:</p>

 
   Laravel now puts models into a new directory (called <code>Models</code>) by default. 
   Tailwind is being used for more of Laravel’s default styling, including pagination. 
   You can now batch background jobs using the <code>Bus::batch()</code> method. 
   The <code>php artisan serve</code> command now reloads your app whenever you update your <code>.env</code> file. 
   Event listening closures can now be run in the background using the <code>queueable()</code> function. 
 

 Adding Authentication to a Laravel 8 Application with Okta 

<p>If you’ve added authentication to your Laravel application <a>in previous versions</a>, you’ll notice some differences when using Laravel 8. The most significant change is that Laravel’s authentication UI code has been moved to <a href="https://github.com/laravel/ui">a separate package</a>, so you’ll need to either import this package or <a href="https://jetstream.laravel.com/">Jetsream</a> in addition to the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/socialite">Socialite package</a>.</p>

<p>In the remainder of this article, I’ll walk you through setting up a new Laravel 8 application using Socialite with <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a> as your Authentication provider. By the end of this section, you’ll be able to log into your Laravel 8 application using Okta.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: Please ensure you have already installed PHP and Composer. This tutorial assumes you have already <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation">created a new Laravel PHP application</a> and have signed up for a free Okta developer account.</p>

 Setting Up Your Okta Application 

<p>First, log into or <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">create a new Okta account</a>. From the Applications page, click “Add Application” to start the creation process.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select “Web Application” from the Platform menu.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Give your application a name, enter <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> as the Base URI, <code>http://localhost:8000/login/okta/callback</code> as the Login redirect URI, and <code>http://localhost:8000</code> as the Logout redirect URI. This will ensure that the Okta API recognizes and allows requests from your local Laravel application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done and copy the Client ID and Client secret shown on your app’s settings page. Finally, go to API &gt; Authorization Servers in the Okta admin and copy the Issuer URI (without the /oauth2/default part). You will use this as your <code>OKTA_BASE_URL</code> in the next section.</p>

<p>You’re done setting up your Okta application. The rest of this tutorial assumes you have an existing Laravel application without authentication set up. If you don’t have a Laravel application yet, refer to the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation">installation instructions here</a>.</p>

 Configuring Okta in Laravel 

<p>Next, you need to install the Socialite package, Okta Socialite provider, and the Laravel UI package using composer:</p>

   <code>composer require laravel/socialite socialiteproviders/okta laravel/ui
</code>   

<p>With the packages installed, you need to register them and your Okta credentials in your Laravel application. Add your Okta Client ID, Client Secret, Base URL, and Redirect URI to your Laravel application’s <code>.env</code> file:</p>

 <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID=**********
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=************
OKTA_BASE_URL=https://*****.okta.com
OKTA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/login/okta/callback
</code> 

<p>You’ll use these environment variables in your application’s configuration. Open up the <code>config/services.php</code> file and add a new array for Okta:</p>

   <code>...
'okta' =&gt; [
    'client_id' =&gt; env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'),
    'client_secret' =&gt; env('OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    'redirect' =&gt; env('OKTA_REDIRECT_URI'),
    'base_url' =&gt; env('OKTA_BASE_URL'),
],
...
</code>   

<p>You also need to register Socialite with Laravel. Add Socialite’s service provider to the <code>$providers</code> array in your <code>config/app.php</code> file:</p>

   <code>...
$providers = [
    ...
    SocialiteProviders\Manager\ServiceProvider::class,
    ...
]
...
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to make sure the Okta provider knows when Socialite is called to make the appropriate API calls. Open your <code>app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php</code> file and add the following listener:</p>

   <code>...
protected $listen = [
    ...
    \SocialiteProviders\Manager\SocialiteWasCalled::class =&gt; [
        'SocialiteProviders\\Okta\\OktaExtendSocialite@handle',
    ],
];
...
</code>   

<p>Your Okta application is now connected to Socialite and your Laravel application, but you need to update your user model and database migrations before you can test the login flow.</p>

 Update the User Model and Migrations 

<p>By default, Laravel creates a User model and database table with a <code>password</code> field and a database table for password resets. You won’t need these when you switch to Okta, so you can remove them if you’ve already created them. If not, you can simply remove the <code>CreatePasswordResetsTable</code> migration and update your <code>CreateUsersTable</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateUsersTable extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table-&gt;id();
            $table-&gt;string('name');
            $table-&gt;string('email')-&gt;unique();
            $table-&gt;text('token');
            $table-&gt;timestamps();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('users');
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the migrations from your command line using Artisan:</p>

   <code>php artisan migrate
</code>   

<p>Next, update the User model to reflect these changes. Open <code>app/Models/User.php</code> and add update the <code>$fillable</code> property:</p>

   <code>...
protected $fillable = ['email', 'name', 'token'];
...
</code>   

<p>This ensures that Laravel can write to the <code>token</code> column when a user signs in with Okta.</p>

<p>You can also remove the <code>$hidden</code> and <code>$casts</code> arrays as the <code>password</code>, <code>remember_token</code>, and <code>email_verified_at</code> fields are no longer used. Your User model and database table are now ready to connect to Okta for authentication. The next step is to update your routes and login controller.</p>

 Adding the Okta Authentication Routes 

<p>When you created your Okta application, you set a callback URL. After a user logs in, Okta will redirect them to this callback URL with a token, so your application needs to save that token and (if not already created) the user. You also need a route that directs users to Okta to login.</p>

<p>Open your <code>routes/web.php</code> file and add the following:</p>

   <code>...
Route::get('/login/okta', 'App\Http\Controllers\Auth\LoginController@redirectToProvider')-&gt;name('login-okta');

Route::get('/login/okta/callback', 'App\Http\Controllers\Auth\LoginController@handleProviderCallback');
</code>   

<p>Now that the routes are set up, you need to update the <code>LoginController</code> to handle these new methods. Assuming this is a new Laravel application without authentication installed yet, you need to run the Artisan command to <a href="https://github.com/laravel/ui#installation">generate the authentication scaffolding</a>. This will publish the authentication controllers and view files so you can edit them:</p>

   <code>php artisan ui bootstrap --auth
</code>   

<p>Next, open the <code>app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php</code> file and replace it with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\Auth;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Models\User;
use App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\AuthenticatesUsers;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Laravel\Socialite\Facades\Socialite;

class LoginController extends Controller
{
    use AuthenticatesUsers;

    /**
     * Where to redirect users after login.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $redirectTo = RouteServiceProvider::HOME;

    /**
     * Create a new controller instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this-&gt;middleware('guest')-&gt;except('logout');
    }

    /**
     * Redirect the user to the Okta authentication page.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function redirectToProvider()
    {
        return Socialite::driver('okta')-&gt;redirect();
    }

    /**
     * Obtain the user information from Okta.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function handleProviderCallback(Request $request)
    {
        $user = Socialite::driver('okta')-&gt;user();

        $localUser = User::where('email', $user-&gt;email)-&gt;first();

        // Create a local user with the email and token from Okta
        if (!$localUser) {
            $localUser = User::create([
                'email' =&gt; $user-&gt;email,
                'name' =&gt; $user-&gt;name,
                'token' =&gt; $user-&gt;token,
            ]);
        } else {
            // if the user already exists, just update the token:
            $localUser-&gt;token = $user-&gt;token;
            $localUser-&gt;save();
        }

        try {
            Auth::login($localUser);
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
            return redirect('/login/okta');
        }

        return redirect('/home');
    }

}
</code>   

<p>The <code>redirectToProvider()</code> method sends users to Okta to enter their login credentials, and the <code>handleProviderCallback()</code> method saves the token returned by Okta to the user’s account. It can also create new users or log them in. Your Laravel application is almost ready to authenticate users, but the last step is to update the user interface login link.</p>

 Updating the User Interface 

<p>Before you can test your new authentication flow, update the login link to point to the new Okta route. Open your Laravel application’s <code>resources/views/welcome.php</code> file, and find the line containing <code>@if (Route::has('login'))</code>.</p>

<p>Replace the entire <code>@if</code> block with the following:</p>

   <code>...
@if (Route::has('login-okta'))
&lt;div class="hidden fixed top-0 right-0 px-6 py-4 sm:block"&gt;
    @auth
        &lt;a href="{{ url('/home') }}" class="text-sm text-gray-700 underline"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    @else
        &lt;a href="{{ route('login-okta') }}" class="text-sm text-gray-700 underline"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
    @endif
&lt;/div&gt;
@endif
...
</code>   

<p>Install the frontend packages and run Laravel’s dev build command to create the necessary CSS files:</p>

   <code>npm i &amp;&amp; npm run dev
</code>   

<p>To test the entire authentication flow out, start the local development server:</p>

   <code>php artisan serve
</code>   

<p>Visit <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> in your browser. Click the “Login” link and enter your email and password. You should be taken to your dashboard.</p>

  <p>The evolution of cybersecurity protection demands a more nuanced response to providing access to a company’s sensitive resources. Policy-based access control (PBAC) combines identity attributes and context variables to enable sophisticated granting of access to corporate systems and protected resources based on centrally managed policies that ensure consistent access control decisions across the enterprise. Advancement in both business requirements and technology (such as growing use of micro-services), require a better way to control access. In a way that is consistent across all silos, dynamic enough to react to change in risk, and provides better control for the application business owners.</p>
<p>PBAC facilitates the application of consistent policy across all applications that use the PBAC authorization service. Furthermore, policies are evaluated in real-time against current attributes rather than having to wait for a nightly update of identity attributes before access control policy is correctly applied. PBAC also facilitates a risk management approach to access decisions. If access outside business hours represents a greater risk the authorization service could prompt for an additional authentication factor before access is granted.</p>

<p>There are currently several trends which are shaping mobility industries around the globe. As a result, the mobility sector has consented the future belongs to C.A.S.E Connected, Autonomous, Shared, and Electric.</p><p>Cars are experiencing a conjectural transition to become smart devices for drivers, just as how featured phones were replaced worldwide by smartphones. In addition, a decline in car ownership and a surge in shared mobility services have resulted in a call for more user-centric, integrated mobility service offerings for&nbsp;drivers.</p><p>According to Yun Xi, Senior UI/UX designer at Daimler Mobility, “We want to enhance trust between different mobility service players. The question was how to provide customized services to end-users based on their authorized data. You need to identify a way to ensure the user’s data privacy and security. That’s challenging as a diverse range of third-party service providers is participating in the process. And all of them provide an integrated and personalized user experience throughout different mobility offerings.”</p><p>This is the reason why Daimler Mobility — an industry leader that envisions the automobile as a home on the road — chose to collaborate with Ontology. This partnership, capitalizing on the latter’s digital identity and data life-cycle management technology via the blockchain, aims to create a trust-worthy, personalized, and secure experience for drivers. Customers should feel as comfortable and at ease as they would be at&nbsp;home.</p><p>The drivers of cars, who have access to the Welcome Home in-car system receive a couple of unique benefits, including:</p>  Your in-car and mobility service preferences are attached to your profile, not to any one particular vehicle, therefore you could transform any vehicle into your own, anytime, anywhere across the&nbsp;globe.  You can access third-party service providers integrated into the system with one-time verification, yet stay anonymous to all providers after the services are completed.  You will be authorizing your data for service providers to give personalized services, yet you retain full transparency and control of all access and usage of your data, which would allow you to stay anonymous.  <p>For a full outline over the 6 key steps of the “Welcome Home” journey, we’d like to demonstrate the example of a user named Julia who is traveling in Germany and needs to rent a car in Stuttgart, Germany.</p><p>To begin with, Julia would have gone through a one-time KYC (1) when she previously purchased her own automobile. Through Welcome Home, Julia would have bound her personal preferences from her own car with the platform, so that when she rents the car in Stuttgart, it would come tailored to her preferences (2).</p><p>Once inside the car, Julia would receive third-party provider suggestions through the Fleet2Share, a different platform hosted on a different blockchain. This is the primary value add for Ontology’s partnership since we offer cross-chain interoperability (3). The good news for Julia though is that she doesn’t need to re-register or sign-up for anything new since all of her data is already stored on the Welcome Home platform. All she needs to do is grant authorization and access to the 3rd party app providers suggested from Fleet2Share. The authorization to have access to this data is managed on the blockchain, making it both immutable and transparent. Once the journey begins, the car would be able to track data points including wear and tear, if there were any accidents, or more minute details like how heavy Julia steps on the breaks versus the gas&nbsp;pedals.</p><p>At the end of her journey (4), Julia can unpair her car profile settings from the car and choose to restrict her personal data from being accessed by third parties — while the blockchain grants data points that she previously allowed for things to do with the car, such as the tread on the tires or the amount of charge the battery it has left (5). And finally, Julia can choose to share this experience with her social circle, or grant access to her data in — either way, it is her decision&nbsp;(6).</p><p>In summary, the 6 key steps of a user’s journey through the Welcome Home platform&nbsp;are:</p>  User Onboarding &amp; Data Access&nbsp;Control  Setting Varied Profiles &amp; Data Management  Pairing Profile with Rental Interoperability  Ending the rental and having access to your&nbsp;Data  Profile Sharing &amp; trusted Data&nbsp;Sharing  Receiving your profile via Social deliveries  <p>At the end of the day, Welcome Home is designed to be a user-centric application granting us full control over when, where, and whom we share data with. It is designed for the perfect mobility experience, partnered with Daimler Mobility. We firmly believe that the control should belong to the user, and is something achievable through our decentralized Identity (DeID) protocol as well as our distributed data exchange framework (DDXF) — both powered by cryptographic algorithms on the blockchain.</p><p>Welcome Home is an excellent case of using blockchain to give us the option of benefitting from the perks and convenience of the digital economy while keeping our data private and secure. This also holds vast potential outside of mobility services such as wherever we are making compromises for this trade-off including on smartphones, in smart homes, and in smart&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Data sovereignty is what ultimately safeguards our&nbsp;freedom.</p><p>For blockchain enthusiasts, Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Protocol used underneath Welcome Home is the first of its kind seen in the industry where one-click verification and service integration could be made interoperable for applications on different blockchains, making the solution truly scalable.</p><p>Check out the video demo of Welcome Home on Startup Autobahn EXPO Day powered by Daimler Mobility AG&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/1LkPV7T4D94">here</a>.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="https://ont.io/?source=post_page---------------------------">Ontology website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">Ontology GitHub</a> / <a href="https://onto.app/?source=post_page---------------------------">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases?source=post_page---------------------------">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Telegram (English)</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/how-being-on-the-road-will-feel-just-like-home-with-ontology-daimler-mobility-93140d00d179">How Being On The Road Will Feel Just Like Home With Ontology &amp; Daimler Mobility</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Spring Boot is a ubiquitous and well-supported suite of tools for developing web applications in Java. Database authentication, in which credentials identifying authorized users are stored in a database accessible by the application, is maybe the most common and straightforward method of authenticating users. SAML is a well-supported open standard for handling authentication between identity providers and service providers.</p>

<p>Configuring SAML authentication in Spring Security is a common topic, and examples are easy to come by. It’s also well documented, with straightforward configuration options available, as in <a>this example from the Okta blog</a>.</p>

<p>However, what if you want to combine both database and SAML authentication methods within the same Spring Boot application, so a user can be authenticated using either way? We will discuss and implement a solution in this tutorial!</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

  <p>Acknowledgment: Much of the groundwork for the implementation of SAML 2.0 authentication used in this project was developed by <a href="https://github.com/vdenotaris">Vincenzo De Notaris</a> and can be found in <a href="https://github.com/vdenotaris/spring-boot-security-saml-sample">this project on GitHub</a>. For this project, some changes have been made to support dual DB + SAML authentication and use Okta as the SAML identity provider rather than SSOCircle.</p>

 SAML Authentication with Spring Security 

<p>There are several benefits to using SAML to handle authentication for your application:</p>

 
   Loose coupling between your application and your authentication mechanism increases independence between the two, allowing for more rapid development and evolution of application logic, with less risk of regression 
   Shifts the responsibility of authentication, which involves storing and retrieving sensitive user information, to the identity provider (e.g., Okta), which almost always offers less risk since identity management is their business model 
   Allows for an improved user experience via Single Sign-On while navigating between multiple apps 
 

<p>Okta is a very well established identity provider with robust features and a wealth of support. Managing users, accounts, and permissions with Okta is simple and straightforward. Simultaneously, it is still flexible and extensible enough to support your application no matter how much it grows (even as it grows into several applications). And the friendly, growing community is available to answer any questions you may have!</p>

<p>You’ll need to create a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">forever-free Okta developer  account</a> to complete this tutorial. If you already have a developer account, you should complete this tutorial by switching to the Classic UI in the top-left corner.</p>

<p>In case you need to support legacy systems or because you have strange security requirements, you may need to allow users to authenticate using either SAML or database credentials. The process to combine SAML 2.0 with DB auth in Spring Boot is what we’ll tackle here!</p>

 Set Up Your Okta Account with SAML and Run the Application 

<p>Please complete the following ten steps to see a working example.</p>

<p>Step 1: Clone the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-security-saml-db-example">okta-spring-security-saml-db-example repository</a>:</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-security-saml-db-example.git
</code>   

<p>Step 2: Sign up for a free developer account at <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">https://developer.okta.com/signup</a>. This is required to create SAML 2.0 applications in Okta.</p>

<p>Step 3: Log in to your Okta account at <code>https://your-okta-domain.okta.com</code>. If you see a developer dashboard like the screenshot below, click on Developer Console in the top left, and select Classic UI.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Admin.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Step 4: Create a new application via Admin &gt; Applications &gt; Add Application &gt; Create New App with the following settings:</p>

 
   Platform: <code>Web</code> 
   Sign On Method: <code>SAML 2.0</code> 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click Create.</p>

<p>Enter an App name like <code>Spring Boot DB/SAML</code> (or whatever you’d like). Click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter the following SAML Settings:</p>

 
   Single Sign-On URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/saml/SSO</code> 
   Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL: <code>YES</code> 
   Audience URI: <code>http://localhost:8080/saml/metadata</code> 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click Next.</p>

<p>Select the following two options:</p>

 
   I’m an Okta customer adding an internal app 
   This is an internal app that we have created 
 

<p></p>

<p>Then, click Finish.</p>

<p>Step 5: Navigate to Assignments &gt; Assign to People.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Step 6: Assign to your account with the custom username <code>samluser@oktaauth.com</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Step 7: Navigate to Sign On and copy the following values to your <code>/src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file:</p>

 
   <code>saml.metadataUrl</code> — Right-click and copy the URL from the Identity Provider metadata link below the View Setup Instructions button. 
 

<p></p>

 
   <code>saml.idp</code> — Click the View Setup Instructions button and copy the value in (2) Identity Provider Issuer. 
 

<p></p>

<p>For example, here are the values I used:</p>

   <code>saml.metadataUrl=https://dev-763344.okta.com/app/exk74c26UmANQ0ema5d5/sso/saml/metadata
saml.idp=http://www.okta.com/exkrmibtn3VG9S2Pa4x6
</code>   

<p>Step 8: Run your Spring Boot application in your IDE or via Maven:</p>

   <code>mvn spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Step 9: Navigate to your application’s home page at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>Step 10: For database authentication, log in using <code>dbuser@dbauth.com / oktaiscool</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should see a success message saying you’re logged in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For SAML authentication, sign in using <code>samluser@oktaauth.com</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should be prompted to select your identity provider.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, you should be redirected to the SAML Okta auth flow and returned to your application following successful authentication.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’re done! You’ve successfully configured your project to support authentication via both the database and SAML 2.0! 🥳</p>

<p>It’s nice to see everything working, but what about the code that makes it happen? Keep reading for a walkthrough of the code and how it works.</p>

 How to Combine Database and SAML Authentication in Spring Boot 

<p>To get a better understanding of how DB and SAML auth are combined in this example, clone the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-security-saml-db-example">repository</a> for this tutorial if you have not already:</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-security-saml-db-example.git
</code>   

<p>Open the project up in your favorite IDE or editor and take a look at the Maven POM file located at <code>/pom.xml</code>.</p>

<p>This application inherits from the <code>spring-boot-starter-parent</code> parent project. This provides you with Spring Boot’s dependency and plugin management:</p>

   <code>&lt;parent&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.3.4.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/parent&gt;
</code>   

<p>This project uses the following Spring Boot Starter dependencies:</p>

 
   <code>spring-boot-starter-web</code> provides support for building web applications 
   <code>spring-boot-starter-security</code> provides support for securing the application (e.g., Basic Auth, Form Login) 
   <code>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</code> provides support for the Java Persistence API, which is used to communicate with the database for DB authentication 
   <code>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</code> provides support for the <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a> templating engine, a simple and powerful way to create web pages for Spring Boot applications 
 

<p>The <code>spring-security-saml2-core</code> extension for Spring Boot provides the necessary SAML-related libraries. This extension depends on the <code>opensaml</code> library, which is contained in the <a href="https://build.shibboleth.net/nexus">Shibboleth repository</a> and is added to the <code>&lt;repositories&gt;</code> block:</p>

   <code>&lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;Shibboleth&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Shibboleth&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;https://build.shibboleth.net/nexus/content/repositories/releases/&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/repositories&gt;

&lt;dependencies&gt;
    ...
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security.extensions&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-saml2-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;1.0.10.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    ...
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
</code>   

<p>The following dependencies also make life easier:</p>

 
   <code>com.h2database:h2</code> to provide a simple in-memory database 
   <code>org.projectlombok:lombok</code> to reduce boilerplate code (e.g. getters, setters, <code>toString()</code>) 
   <code>nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf:thymeleaf-layout-dialect</code>, a useful add-on for formatting Thymeleaf templates 
 

<p>NOTE: Some IDEs have trouble digesting Lombok-ified code due to version and plugin incompatibilities. If you have difficulty compiling this project, consider removing this dependency and adding the missing boilerplate code, or just use Maven to build and run.</p>

 The SAML and Database Auth “Pre-Login” Page 

<p>You want to have an initial page in which a user enters their username for login. Depending on the username pattern, you either direct the user to a standard username-and-password page for authenticating against the database, or direct them to the SAML auth flow.</p>

<p><code>/src/main/resources/templates/index.html</code></p>
   <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html
        lang="en"
        xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"
        xmlns:layout="http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout"
        layout:decorate="~{layout}"
&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;section layout:fragment="content"&gt;
    &lt;h6 class="border-bottom border-gray pb-2 mb-0"&gt;Please Log In:&lt;/h6&gt;
    &lt;div class="media text-muted pt-3"&gt;
        &lt;form action="#" th:action="@{/pre-auth}" th:object="${username}" method="post"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;input type="text" th:field="*{username}" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;p th:text="${error}" style="color: red"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p><code>IndexController</code> is the backend <code>@Controller</code> defined to serve this page and handle requests:</p>

<p><code>/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/controller/IndexController.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.okta.developer.controller;

@Controller
public class IndexController {

    @GetMapping
    public String index(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("username", new PreAuthUsername());
        return "index";
    }

    @PostMapping("/pre-auth")
    public String preAuth(@ModelAttribute PreAuthUsername username,
                          Model model,
                          RedirectAttributes redirectAttributes) {
        if (StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase(username.getUsername(), Constants.OKTA_USERNAME_SUFFIX)) {
            // redirect to SAML
            return "redirect:/doSaml";
        } else if (StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase(username.getUsername(), Constants.DB_USERNAME_SUFFIX)) {
            // redirect to DB/form login
            return "redirect:/form-login?username="+username.getUsername();
        } else {
            redirectAttributes.addFlashAttribute("error", "Invalid Username");
            return "redirect:/";
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Within <code>IndexController</code>, you are checking whether the username matches a particular pattern and redirecting accordingly.</p>

 Authenticate with SAML and Spring Security 

<p>The <code>WebSecurityConfig</code> class, which extends the <code>WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</code> parent, defines much of the security settings, including:</p>

 
   The filter chains to handle SAML requests and responses 
   How and when to authenticate a user with either the database or SAML and Okta 
   Required permissions for URLs within the application 
   Logging out 
 

<p>When redirected to the <code>/doSaml</code> endpoint, the SAML flow is initiated by a custom authentication entry point defined in <code>WebSecurityConfig.configure(HttpSecurity)</code>:</p>

<p><code>/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/config/WebSecurityConfig.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.okta.developer.config;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter implements DisposableBean {
    ...
    
    @Autowired
    private SAMLEntryPoint samlEntryPoint;
    
    ...
    
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        ...
        http
            .httpBasic()
            .authenticationEntryPoint((request, response, authException) -&gt; {
                if (request.getRequestURI().endsWith("doSaml")) {
                    samlEntryPoint.commence(request, response, authException);
                } else {
                    response.sendRedirect("/");
                }
            });
        ...
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you can see if the requested URL ends with <code>doSaml</code>, the request is handled by the <code>SamlEntryPoint</code> defined in your configuration. This redirects the user to authenticate via Okta, and returns the user to <code>/doSaml</code> upon completion. To handle this redirect, a <code>Controller</code> is defined to redirect the user following a successful SAML auth:</p>

<p><code>/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/controller/SamlResponseController.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.okta.developer.controller;

@Controller
public class SamlResponseController {
    @GetMapping(value = "/doSaml")
    public String handleSamlAuth() {
        Authentication auth = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
        LOGGER.info("doSaml auth result: {}", auth);
        if (auth != null) {
            return "redirect:/landing";
        } else {
            return "/";
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>At this point, the user should be successfully authenticated with the app!</p>

 Authenticate with a Database and Spring Security 

<p>If the username matches another pattern, the user is redirected to a standard-looking form login page:</p>

<p><code>/src/main/resources/templates/form-login.html</code></p>
   <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html
        lang="en"
        xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"
        xmlns:layout="http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout"
        layout:decorate="~{layout}"
&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;section layout:fragment="content"&gt;
    &lt;h6 class="border-bottom border-gray pb-2 mb-0"&gt;Database Login:&lt;/h6&gt;
    &lt;div class="media text-muted pt-3"&gt;
        &lt;form action="#" th:action="@{/form-login}" th:object="${credentials}" method="post"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;input type="text" th:field="*{username}" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Password: &lt;input type="password" th:field="*{password}" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;p th:text="${error}" style="color: red"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The login submission is handled by a <code>@Controller</code> which calls on the <code>AuthenticationManager</code> built in <code>WebSecurityConfig</code>:</p>

<p><code>/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/config/WebSecurityConfig.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.okta.developer.config;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter implements DisposableBean {
    ...
    
    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.authenticationProvider(dbAuthProvider);
        auth.authenticationProvider(samlAuthenticationProvider);
    }
}
</code>   

<p><code>DbAuthProvider</code> is a custom component which performs standard DB authentication by checking the supplied password versus a hashed copy in the database:</p>

<p><code>/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/auth/DbAuthProvider.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.okta.developer.auth;

@Component
public class DbAuthProvider implements AuthenticationProvider {
    private final CombinedUserDetailsService combinedUserDetailsService;
    private final PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    ...

    @Override
    public Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication) throws AuthenticationException {
        if (!StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase(authentication.getPrincipal().toString(), Constants.DB_USERNAME_SUFFIX)) {
            // this user is not supported by DB authentication
            return null;
        }

        UserDetails user = combinedUserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(authentication.getPrincipal().toString());
        String rawPw = authentication.getCredentials() == null ? null : authentication.getCredentials().toString();

        if (passwordEncoder.matches(rawPw, user.getPassword())) {
            LOGGER.warn("User successfully logged in: {}", user.getUsername());
            return new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(
                    user.getUsername(),
                    rawPw,
                    Collections.emptyList());
        } else {
            LOGGER.error("User failed to log in: {}", user.getUsername());
            throw new BadCredentialsException("Bad password");
        }
    }

    @Override
    public boolean supports(Class&lt;?&gt; aClass) {
        return aClass.isAssignableFrom(UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.class);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The above class calls on <code>CombinedUserDetailsService</code> which is another custom component providing an appropriate <code>UserDetails</code> object depending on whether the user is authenticated using the database or SAML, by implementing <code>UserDetailsService</code> and <code>SAMLUserDetailsService</code> respectively:</p>

<p><code>/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/auth/CombinedUserDetailsService.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.okta.developer.auth;

@Service
public class CombinedUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService, SAMLUserDetailsService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    ...

    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String s) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        StoredUser storedUser = lookupUser(s);
        return new CustomUserDetails(
                AuthMethod.DATABASE,
                storedUser.getUsername(),
                storedUser.getPasswordHash(),
                new LinkedList&lt;&gt;());
    }

    @Override
    public Object loadUserBySAML(SAMLCredential credential) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        LOGGER.info("Loading UserDetails by SAMLCredentials: {}", credential.getNameID());
        StoredUser storedUser = lookupUser(credential.getNameID().getValue());
        return new CustomUserDetails(
                AuthMethod.SAML,
                storedUser.getUsername(),
                storedUser.getPasswordHash(),
                new LinkedList&lt;&gt;());
    }

    private StoredUser lookupUser(String username) {
        LOGGER.info("Loading UserDetails by username: {}", username);

        Optional&lt;StoredUser&gt; user = userRepository.findByUsernameIgnoreCase(username);

        if (!user.isPresent()) {
            LOGGER.error("User not found in database: {}", user);
            throw new UsernameNotFoundException(username);
        }

        return user.get();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The resulting <code>@Controller</code> to handle DB authentication looks like this:</p>

<p><code>/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/controller/DbLoginController.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.okta.developer.controller;

@Controller
public class DbLoginController {

    private final AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

    ...

    @GetMapping("/form-login")
    public String formLogin(@RequestParam(required = false) String username, Model model) {
        ...
    }

    @PostMapping("/form-login")
    public String doLogin(@ModelAttribute DbAuthCredentials credentials,
                          RedirectAttributes redirectAttributes) {
        try {
            Authentication authentication = authenticationManager.authenticate(new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(
                    credentials.getUsername(), credentials.getPassword()));

            if (authentication.isAuthenticated()) {
                SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
            } else {
                throw new Exception("Unauthenticated");
            }

            return "redirect:/landing";
        } catch (Exception e) {
            redirectAttributes.addFlashAttribute("error", "Login Failed");
            return "redirect:/form-login?username="+credentials.getUsername();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>When <code>doLogin()</code> is called via <code>POST</code>, the <code>AuthenticationManager</code> handles the username and password authentication and redirects the user if successful.</p>

<p>For ease of use, two users are defined in the database: one for DB auth and one for SAML. Both users are defined in our database, but only one of them is authenticated against the database:</p>

<p><code>/src/main/resources/data.sql</code></p>
   <code>INSERT INTO user (ID, USERNAME, PASSWORD_HASH) VALUES
('17e3d83c-6e09-41b8-b4ee-b4b14cb8a797', 'dbuser@dbauth.com', '(bcrypted password)'),   /*DB AUTH*/
('17e3d83c-6e09-41b8-b4ee-b4b14cb8a798', 'samluser@oktaauth.com', 'bcrypted password'); /*SAML AUTH*/
</code>   

 Learn More About SAML and Okta 

<p>Much of the complexity of this project comes from the need to combine both database and SAML authentication in one app. Normally you would choose one or the other. If you want to use only SAML for authentication (which is a fine idea, especially using Okta), visit <a>this blog post</a> using the standard Spring SAML DSL extension to integrate with Okta and SAML to secure your application.</p>

<p>The source code used in this example is <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-security-saml-db-example">on GitHub</a>.</p>

 The GiD Report#130 — It’s no accident that Big Tech are monopolies <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-129-what-we-learned-about-digital-identity-from-onlyfans-445b5eb8a875">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies  Justice Department could charge Google this&nbsp;week  Microsoft allows app store users to choose their own&nbsp;payments  Americans have hated monopolies for centuries  How Facebook screwed up by trying to get TikTok&nbsp;banned  The fintech&nbsp;wave  Stuff happens   1. Guess what? Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies according to the House Judiciary Committee. Photo Suzy Hazelwood<p>That much is outlined in their 450 page report, <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf">which you can check out&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>“No surprises here,” Greg Kidd <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1313876886796156928">tweeted</a>. (Also not a surprise if you’ve been following this newsletter.)</p><p>He added:</p><blockquote>“It’s the world we live in now. It didn’t happen by accident. We need to change the way antitrust and anticompetition law works so that it works for rather than against innovation, inclusion and neutrality.”</blockquote><p>Which is more or less spiritually aligned with the intentions of the report. These are some of the changes tol antitrust law proposed — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-5f6b5b5f-e83e-4615-8503-5317ba2c1e59.html">via&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p>  limiting companies’ ability to compete unfairly against third parties on their own platforms by either requiring online marketplaces to be independently run businesses or establishing rules for how such marketplaces can be organized;  blocking online platforms from giving themselves preferential treatment or playing favorites with other content providers;  requiring social networks to be interoperable so that people can communicate across platforms and carry their data over from one platform to&nbsp;another;  directing antitrust enforcers to assume that an acquisition by a dominant tech firm is anticompetitive unless proven otherwise; and  allowing news publishers to team up to negotiate against tech platforms looking to carry their&nbsp;content.  <p>Of interest here, the 16 month investigation outlined specifically how Apple and Facebook achieved and continues to wield its monopoly power — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-5f6b5b5f-e83e-4615-8503-5317ba2c1e59.html">via&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Apple: The report says Apple exerts monopoly power over software distribution to more than half the mobile devices in the U.S. It accuses the company of exploiting rivals by levying commissions and fees and copying apps, and says Apple gives preference to its own apps and services.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook: The social media network has monopoly power in the social networking space, the report finds, and takes a “copy, acquire, kill” approach to would-be rivals such as WhatsApp and Instagram, both of which it bought in the early&nbsp;2010s.</blockquote><p>First, we should just acknowledge that the conclusions of the report and various proposals are all an incredible validation of the work we’ve been doing here at GlobaliD the past few years. There will always be two ways to fix a systemic issue — from the top down and from the bottom up. Ideally, you have both happening in&nbsp;concert.</p><p>GlobaliD has been working on the bottom-up solution to the problem. Now the top-down approach is coming, and it’s great to&nbsp;see.</p><p>Ideally, regulations are timely but in practice, they are lagging indicators. Consumer preferences and demands are already changing.</p><p>(Anecdotal: My sister was telling me this morning that she doesn’t really use Instagram anymore or sees as much value in it for her personally. And isn’t that how these things usually go? Long before lawmakers jump through all the hoops in order to break up Facebook, the kids will have already found a new shiny&nbsp;toy.)</p><p>A bit of reality: This is really just the start of a potentially long and drawn out process.

This will be a long drawn out battle but there are already skirmishes abound. The Justice Department could charge Google as early as this week. (Top&nbsp;down) <p>That would amount to the biggest such action against a U.S. tech company in 20 years (since Microsoft).</p><p>It could mean forcing Google to sell off Chrome, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/10/feds-may-target-googles-chrome-browser-for-breakup-428468">reports Politico</a>.</p><p>A bit of context: This particular action is coming from the Trump administration. The point? This is truly a bipartisan issue.</p> 3. Microsoft’s app store now lets users choose their own payments systems. (Bottom&nbsp;up) <p>That’s part of 10 app store principles promoting “choice, fairness and innovation” <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/08/app-store-fairness-caf-interoperability-principles/">the company just published</a>:</p>  Developers will have the freedom to choose whether to distribute their apps for Windows through our app store. We will not block competing app stores on&nbsp;Windows.  We will not block an app from Windows based on a developer’s business model or how it delivers content and services, including whether content is installed on a device or streamed from the&nbsp;cloud.  We will not block an app from Windows based on a developer’s choice of which payment system to use for processing purchases made in its&nbsp;app.  We will give developers timely access to information about the interoperability interfaces we use on Windows, as set forth in our Interoperability Principles.  Every developer will have access to our app store as long as it meets objective standards and requirements, including those for security, privacy, quality, content and digital&nbsp;safety.  Our app store will charge reasonable fees that reflect the competition we face from other app stores on Windows and will not force a developer to sell within its app anything it doesn’t want to&nbsp;sell.  Our app store will not prevent developers from communicating directly with their users through their apps for legitimate business purposes.  Our app store will hold our own apps to the same standards to which it holds competing apps.  Microsoft will not use any non-public information or data from its app store about a developer’s app to compete with&nbsp;it.  Our app store will be transparent about its rules and policies and opportunities for promotion and marketing, apply these consistently and objectively, provide notice of changes and make available a fair process to resolve disputes.  <p>OK, sure, this is mostly a symbolic move (given Microsoft’s market share in the space) in order to get ahead of the news and to take some well-timed jabs at Microsoft’s rivals.</p><p>But it also gives you a sense of how companies in general are reacting to the new vibes of the&nbsp;times.</p> 4. A bit of history. TL;DR — Americans have hated monopolies for centuries. <p>A great longread from Ben Thompson’s Stratetchery — which is essentially<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/anti-monopoly-vs-antitrust/?utm_source=Memberful&amp;utm_campaign=cbfc41228d-daily_update_2020_10_07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-cbfc41228d-110987421"> a historical take on the American view of monopolies (and in turn antitrust)</a>.</p><p>First, here’s Ben quoting William Letwin in<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo3642778.html"> Law and Economic Policy in America: The Evolution of the Sherman Antitrust Act</a>:</p><p>Hatred of monopoly is one of the oldest American political habits and like most profound traditions, it consisted of an essentially permanent idea expressed differently at different times. “Monopoly”, as the word was used in America, meant at first a special legal privilege granted by the state; later it came more often to mean exclusive control that a few persons achieved by their own efforts; but it always meant some sort of unjustified power, especially one that raised obstacles to equality of opportunity.</p><p>And boy does that hatred go way back. Here’s a quick teaser from&nbsp;Ben:</p><p>As Letwin notes, American distrust of monopolies had its roots in England and 1624’s Statute of Monopolies, which significantly constrained the ability of the King to grant exclusive privilege; colonial and state legislatures similarly passed laws restricting grants of exclusive power by governments, and while the Bill of Rights did not have an anti-monopoly provision (contra Thomas Jefferson’s wishes), one of the most divisive political questions for the first several decades of the United States was over the existence (or not) of a national bank, in large part because it was a government-granted monopoly.</p><p>Check out Ben’s full piece:<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/anti-monopoly-vs-antitrust/"> </a><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/anti-monopoly-vs-antitrust/?utm_source=Memberful&amp;utm_campaign=cbfc41228d-daily_update_2020_10_07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-cbfc41228d-110987421">Anti-monopoly vs. Antitrust</a></p> 5.

<p>Decentralized identity—also known as self-sovereign identity—is earning a reputation as a silver bullet that can solve all of today’s identity problems. It promises to ensure perfect privacy, informed consent, user independence and control, and the ability to leverage the latest technology and cryptography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for those of us who’ve been in the identity industry for some time, these promises might seem far-fetched. We’ve seen too many other purported magical solutions rise and fall over our careers, and evaluating decentralized identity’s true potential is no easy task. Complicating matters is the fact that if you’re coming from a single sign-on (SSO) background of SAML, OAuth or OpenID Connect, you have likely encountered an entirely new glossary of unfamiliar terminology, often conflicting technical descriptions and a distinct lack of actionable standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s not really too surprising for new technology efforts, though it does make it more challenging to follow. So we thought we’d offer a friendly introduction—mapping concepts you’re already familiar with to the new ones, explaining where there’s a lot of overlap, highlighting some of the differences and demonstrating where decentralized identity is likely to go—without any hype.</p>

  <p>Fastify is just as the name implies, fast. Not just in terms of development speed—its low overhead means the server is fast as well. When writing APIs, speed on both sides is paramount. Fastify is a web framework for Node.js that was designed for efficiency. Fastify is fully extensible with hooks, plugins, and decorators. It is schema-based, meaning you can define your response and request objects in your routes and have Fastify do the data validation for you. This feature isn’t mandatory, but it is useful. On the request side, it adds easy data validation. On the response side, this means you can shape your data for even lower overhead by not pushing down extraneous data to the client. Fastify is also TypeScript friendly. However, in this tutorial you will use JavaScript.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, you will create a secure API that returns some information regarding employees. To authenticate users, you will use Okta as an authentication server which will produce a JSON Web Token (JWT) after authenticating the user. The client will then send that JWT as part of the request to the server which will handle the validation logic. You will use Okta’s JWT verifier to quickly set up the authentication on your server.</p>

 Create your Okta application 

<p>The first thing you will need to do is create an application in Okta to act as your authentication server. This highlights the simplicity and streamlined process Okta authentication provides. Navigate to your Okta Developer Console and click Applications. Next click Add Application. For application type, select Service Machine-to-Machine. Give your application a meaningful name and click Done. Once your application is set up you will be presented with a Client ID and a Client secret. Make note of these as you will need them in your web application.</p>

<p>Next click on API in the header and the navigate to Authorization Servers.  Okta will add an authorization server for you named default. This server is fine to use for development or testing. Click on Default and then click on Scopes. Click the button that says Add Scope and name it api. Click on Settings and note your Issuer URL as this is the base endpoint for requesting tokens.</p>

 Create your web server 

<p>Open your favorite IDE and navigate to the folder where you wish to store your project. Run the command <code>mkdir *folder*</code> where folder is your desired folder name. Next, run the command <code>cd *folder*</code> to navigate to your newly created project folder. Finally, create a new application by running the command <code>npm init</code>. Follow the wizard to help set up your project.</p>

<p>Now you will want to install your dependencies. You will only need a few for this project. First, you will need Fastify.</p>

   <code>npm i fastify@3.3.0
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need Okta’s JWT Verifier. As I mentioned, this will handle the internal logic of interpreting the JWT provided by Okta’s authentication server and determining if it is valid.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@1.0.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will want to get dotenv to store your sensitive data.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

<p>Once you have installed these, you should add a new file called <code>.env</code> to your root directory. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientID}
OKTA_ISSUER=https://{yourOktaOrgUrl}/oauth2/default
OKTA_AUDIENCE='api://default'
PORT=3000
</code>   

<p>Replace <code>{yourClientId}</code> with the Client ID from your Okta application’s settings page. Replace <code>{yourOktaOrgUrl}</code> with your Okta organization URL. This can be found on your Okta Developer Dashboard with the label Org URL.</p>

<p>To provide data to the client you will need data on your server. For this, add a new file called <code>sample-data.json</code> and add the following.</p>

 <code>{
  "Employees": [
    {
      "userId": "rirani",
      "jobTitleName": "Developer",
      "firstName": "Romin",
      "lastName": "Irani",
      "preferredFullName": "Romin Irani",
      "employeeCode": "E1",
      "region": "CA",
      "phoneNumber": "408-1234567",
      "emailAddress": "romin.k.irani@gmail.com"
    },
    {
      "userId": "nirani",
      "jobTitleName": "Developer",
      "firstName": "Neil",
      "lastName": "Irani",
      "preferredFullName": "Neil Irani",
      "employeeCode": "E2",
      "region": "CA",
      "phoneNumber": "408-1111111",
      "emailAddress": "neilrirani@gmail.com"
    },
    {
      "userId": "thanks",
      "jobTitleName": "Program Directory",
      "firstName": "Tom",
      "lastName": "Hanks",
      "preferredFullName": "Tom Hanks",
      "employeeCode": "E3",
      "region": "CA",
      "phoneNumber": "408-2222222",
      "emailAddress": "tomhanks@gmail.com"
    }
  ]
}
</code> 

<p>There’s nothing special about this data, but it gives you something to work with.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>server.js</code>. The code for this file follows.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

require( "dotenv" ).config();
const jwtVerifier = require( "./jwtVerifier" );

const fastify = require( "fastify" )( { logger: true } );
const fs = require( "fs" );
const util = require( "util" );

const readFile = util.promisify( fs.readFile );

fastify.route( {
  method: "GET",
  url: "/employees",
  schema: {
    response: {
      200: {
        type: "array",
        properties: {
          userId: { type: "string" }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  preHandler: async ( request, reply ) =&gt; {
    return jwtVerifier( request, reply );
  },
  handler: async ( request, reply ) =&gt; {
    const obj = JSON.parse( await readFile( "sample-data.json", "utf8" ) );
    return obj.Employees;
  }
} );

fastify.route( {
  method: "GET",
  url: "/employees/:userId",
  schema: {
    querystring: {
      userId: { type: "string" }
    }
  },
  preHandler: async ( request, reply ) =&gt; {
    return jwtVerifier( request, reply );
  },
  handler: async ( request, reply ) =&gt; {
    const obj = JSON.parse( await readFile( "sample-data.json", "utf8" ) );
    const employee = obj.Employees.find( r =&gt; r.userId === request.params.userId );

    if ( !employee )
      return reply.code( 404 ).send();

    return employee;
  }
} );

const start = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    await fastify.listen( process.env.PORT );
    fastify.log.info( `server listening on ${ fastify.server.address().port }` );
  } catch ( err ) {
    fastify.log.error( err );
    process.exit( 1 );
  }
};

start();
</code>   

<p>Here is the entire code you need to run an API with Fastify. First, you register <code>dotenv</code> with your application. Per their instructions, you should call the <code>config()</code> function at the earliest point possible in the application.</p>

<p>Next, you are defining two GET routes. The first will return all the employees and the second will return a specific employee. Both contain an option for <code>preHandler</code> where you will call your <code>jwtVerifier</code>. You will create this object shortly, but the trick here is that before the <code>handler</code> is called you will authenticate the user. In the route for <code>/employees/:userId</code> you are defining <code>userId</code> as a string however if your data was an integer or array you could define this argument that way. Also notice that since this is a GET you are defining the parameters in the <code>queryString</code> option. For POST or PUT, there is an option for <code>body</code> if needed. The handlers are straight forward. Both read the JSON data from your <code>sample-data</code> file and return the appropriate entity.</p>

<p>Finally, you start the server by calling <code>fastify.listen</code> on your desired port. Here you are using 3000 as defined in your <code>.env</code> file.</p>

<p>To verify the token you need to add a file called <code>jwtVerifier.js</code>. Add the code below to it.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

const OktaJwtVerifier = require( "@okta/jwt-verifier" );

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier( {
  issuer: process.env.OKTA_ISSUER,
  clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID
} );

module.exports = async ( request, response ) =&gt; {
  const { authorization } = request.headers;

  if ( !authorization ) {
    response.code( 401 ).send();
  }

  const [ authType, token ] = authorization.trim().split( " " );

  try {
    const { claims } = await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken( token, process.env.OKTA_AUDIENCE );

    if ( !claims ) {
      response.code( 401 ).send();
    }
    if ( !claims.scp.includes( "api" ) ) {
      response.code( 401 ).send();
    }
  }
  catch ( err ) {
    console.log( err );
    response.code( 401 ).send();
  }
};
</code>   

<p>This code is mostly just a wrapper around the <code>@okta/jwt-verifier</code> package. You are splitting out the header and obtaining the token from it. Then pass the token to the <code>OktaJwtVerifier</code> along with the desired audience. The verifier will throw an exception if the token is invalid and then it can be caught and a 401 can be returned to the client indicating it is unauthenticated.</p>

 Test your service 

<p>Run the command <code>npm start</code> and see your API come to life. You will want to run a few tests to ensure the data returned is correct and the request is being authenticated properly. Open your favorite rest client. I use Advanced Rest Client; Postman is another popular option.</p>

<p>First, try to call <code>GET http://localhost:3000/employees</code> without any authentication headers. You should receive a 401 Unauthorized as a response.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, call Okta’s authentication server token endpoint. You will need to set the <code>Content-Type</code> to <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> and include the following parameters: <code>grant_type</code> = <code>client_credentials</code>, <code>scope</code>= <code>api</code>, <code>client_id</code> = <code>{yourOktaClientId}</code>, <code>client_secret</code>=<code>{yourOktaClientSecret}</code>. Sending this request should return a JWT with some additional information about the token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now with the JWT in hand, you can call localhost:3000/employees/GET again, but this time include the access_token as an authorization header using the <code>Bearer</code> prefix. Now your request should be authenticated.</p>

   When it comes to today’s B2B technology buyers, how you market your technology has become as important, if not more so, than what you sell. As a seller, you have to navigate customers’ organizational politics and help them make the business case to others for purchasing your technology.&nbsp;

  <p>When it comes to today’s B2B technology buyers, how you market your technology has become as important, if not more so, than what you sell. As a seller, you have to navigate customers’ organizational politics and help them make the business case to others for purchasing your technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means you must understand who your buyers are and what they want. Who holds the buying and decision-making power? What’s the budget? Is there a COVID-19 impact to consider? If so, what does that look like post-purchase?&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When you can answer those questions you are better able to help your buyers buy,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/8341">Derry Finkeldey</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “As one B2B customer put it, ‘I appreciate a company that is able to create a customized experience to meet the needs of my company.’”</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37601"]</p>
<p>Gartner has identified three fundamentals of B2B buying behaviors that sellers must understand and adapt to in order to ensure more high-quality deals — those that leave the customer feeling they have received the value they expected from their technology purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more:<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/technology-ceos-create-valuable-buyer-urgency-for-shorter-sales-cycles/"> Technology CEOs: Create Valuable Buyer Urgency for Shorter Sales Cycles</a></p>
 Organizations buy technology in teams 
<p>B2B deals of any significance are bought by cross-functional teams, not individuals. This means organizational practices and perspective override individual stakeholder preferences. Selling technology to such teams can be tough to navigate given that the average tech purchase involves between 14-23 people, the majority of who (80%) are in senior operations or product roles. And, as the spend increases, so will the size of the buying team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appeal to the buying team, not the individuals on it. This is not to say you should discount central IT. That team remains vitally important. While the organization will be focused on outcomes, IT will be focused on how those outcomes are achieved. You have to sell to both dimensions.</p>
<p>“Although counterintuitive, having multiple stakeholders from multiple functions on the buying team makes for more high-quality deals — if you have done your job and satisfied them all,” says Finkeldey. “Your customers might not have figured this out, so encourage them to do so.”</p>
<p>Read more:<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-sales-should-know-about-modern-b2b-buyers/"> </a><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/technology-gms-adjust-your-product-strategies-and-vision-for-covid-19/">Technology GMs: Adjust Your Product Strategies and Vision for COVID-19</a></p>
 Nothing significant is bought without a business case 
<p>Within the enterprise, any tech purchase usually indicates cost and change. The majority of B2B buyers (93%) require a business case for all technology solutions. Organizations need to see that investments will have a measurable impact on their metrics. And although this has become extremely important amid the current crisis, don’t expect the enhanced level of scrutiny to ease off moving forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buyers are open and looking for help to develop the business case. In fact, successful B2B tech providers participate in business case development in nearly half of all deals. The easier you make it for the customer to buy, the more likely you’ll secure the win.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t just focus on winning the business. Focus on how to make the customer successful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start by helping your customers understand how your offering drives organizational-level objectives and why the investment needs to be prioritized now. You want to sell the value of your offering, not its capabilities. Doing so can also help unite diverse stakeholders on the buying team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Show them that your offering is worth any changes it causes,” says Finkeldey. “Most importantly, don’t just focus on winning the business. Focus on how to make the customer successful.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Organizations struggle to buy technology effectively&nbsp; 
<p>Organizations continue to increase their tech investments, but most struggle to do so effectively. They have difficulty building teams, managing complexity and dealing with competing priorities. According to Gartner research, 74% of B2B tech buyers found the buying process complex; only 27% reported achieving a high-quality deal.</p>
<p>Their challenges create an opportunity for technology service providers. The most successful help customers overcome their buying challenges by sharing these best practices, which reduce the complexities of purchase decisions:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Build confidence in the buying process</p>
 
 
<p>Visualize the steps to change to capture value from the investment</p>
 
 
<p>Encourage best practices in decision making and behave as though you are on the decision-making team&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>These best practices not only reduce the complexity of the B2B buying process, they inspire better buying that leads to renewal and growth opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

Wing had a promising start with a high TVL and APY, but the value of the WING token will be more visible to community members as it grows as a governance token. The Wing team will continue to take into account the community’s feedback to further improve the governance rules, simplify the process for member governance participation, perfect the governance protocol and enable the protocol to be applied to more scenarios.</p><p>- Ontology continued performance tests with bloXroute.

For DeFi to grow out of the current swamp, more types of assets need to be introduced to DeFi platforms, and the credit mechanism needs to be incorporated into the DeFi field to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and traditional finance.”</p><p>- On September 26 and 28 respectively, Jun LI was invited by Suanli Think-tank, a platform dedicated to the digital economy, on two occasions to elaborate on how to design an innovative DeFi platform based on credit and to brief the audience about “Super Oracle” and how oracles, as bridges in the data world, would connect on-chain assets with the real&nbsp;world.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-october-1-8-c21989f916e4">Ontology Weekly Report (October 1–8)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Okta is an Identity and Access Management platform. The TL;DR: you offload the responsibility for secure authentication and authorization to Okta so you can focus on the business logic of the app you’re building.</p>

<p>Okta and Spring Boot already go together like peanut butter and chocolate. Add in feature flags care of <a href="https://split.io">Split</a>, and you can test new capabilities for your app without having to redeploy. That’s testing in production the smart way! And, you can leverage Okta’s groups to easily manage who should see the new stuff and who sees the old stuff.</p>

<p>In this post, I start with setting up an Okta org and configuring an OpenID Connect app. Next, I integrate Okta into a simple Spring Boot and Spring Security app. Finally, I add feature flags to deliver a new UI experience for select users - those that belong to a particular group.</p>

 Get Started with Okta 

<p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) rides on top of OAuth 2.0 for a modern Single Sign-on, authentication and authorization standard. Okta provides these standards as a service. Don’t know anything about these standards yet? Good news - You don’t have to! By following some simple instructions to provision an Okta org and setup a hosted instance of OIDC, you can easily integrate a Spring Boot app with just configuration. Let’s get started with 3 easy steps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re interested in learning more about OIDC and OAuth 2.0, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-1">here</a> and <a href="https://oauth.com">here</a> are good places to start. Look for more links to posts on OIDC and OAuth 2.0 at the end of this post.</p>
</blockquote>

 Register for an Okta Org 

<p>Head on over to: <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">https://developer.okta.com/signup</a>. Fill out the form and click Get Started.</p>

<p>You’ll get an email from Okta to confirm your address. Click on ACTIVATE MY ACCOUNT. You’ll next see an onboarding page in your Okta Org. You can skip this for now.</p>

<p>Let’s add a few users and groups for use later in the Spring Boot app.</p>

 Add Users to your Okta Org 

<p>Click Users on the menu bar at the top. Here, you’ll see the user already created for you with the name and email you submitted to create the Okta org.</p>

<p>Click Add Person. This will bring you to the input form for adding a new user:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Change the Password field to Set by admin and uncheck User must change password on first login. Create the following users by filling out the form and clicking on Save and Add Another for each:</p>


  
    
      First name
      Last name
      Username
      Primary email
      Password
    
  
  
    
      Bob
      Belcher
      bob@belcher.com
      bob@belcher.com
      123456aA$
    
    
      Linda
      Belcher
      linda@belcher.com
      linda@belcher.com
      123456aA$
    
    
      Tina
      Belcher
      tina@belcher.com
      tina@belcher.com
      123456aA$
    
    
      Gene
      Belcher
      gene@belcher.com
      gene@belcher.com
      123456aA$
    
    
      Louise
      Belcher
      louise@belcher.com
      louise@belcher.com
      123456aA$
    
  


<p>Next, you’ll add some groups and assign some users to those groups.</p>

 Add Groups to your Okta Org 

<p>Choose Users &gt; Groups from the top level menu. Here, you’ll see the built in <code>Everyone</code> group. As you might imagine, every current and new user is automatically added to this group.</p>

<p>Click Add Group. This will bring you to the input form for adding a new group:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter BETA_TESTER in both the Name and Group Description fields. Click Add Group.</p>

<p>Click the link to the newly created BETA_TESTER group. Click Manage People. Click on each of Tina, Gene, and Louise on the left. Notice that those users are moved from the left to the right, indicating that they will be members of the group. Click Save to finalize these changes.</p>

<p>Now, you’re Okta org is configured with five users (the Belcher family), 3 of whom belong to the BETA_TESTER group.</p>

 Create an OIDC App in your Okta Org 

<p>Next up, you’ll create an OIDC app that the Spring Boot app uses below. A deep dive into how OIDC works is outside the scope of this post, but check the links at the bottom if you’re interested in learning more about OIDC.</p>

<p>Click Applications from the top menu bar.</p>

<p>Click Add Application. Choose Web from the available app types and click Next. Update the Name field. Change the Login redirect URIs to: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code>. Leave all the other fields as their defaults and click Done at the bottom.</p>

<p>At the top of the General tab, you’ll see the Client Credentials section at the top. Copy the values for Client ID and Client secret. You’ll use these values below to configure Spring Boot.</p>

 Configure the OIDC App to Return Groups 

<p>The last Okta configuration step is to make sure that the list of groups a user belongs to is returned when a user authenticates. You’ll see below that this integrates very easily with Spring Security.</p>

<p>Click API &gt; Authorization Servers from the top menu bar. Click the default link under the list of Authorization Servers (it should be the only one right now).</p>

<p>Click the Claims tab. Click Add Claim:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Fill the form in with the following (leave anything not named as default):</p>


  
    
      Field
      value
    
  
  
    
      Name
      groups
    
    
      Include in token type
      ID Token Always
    
    
      Value type
      Groups
    
    
      Filter
      Matches regex .*
    
  


<p>Click Create to finish.</p>

<p>Your Okta org is all ready to go to provide authentication and authorization services to your application. This is the great thing about Okta - with a little bit of configuration, you get all the services you need for auth allowing you to focus on the primary mission of your app.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All of the configuration you did in this section can be done via the Okta Management API. If this is something that interests you, check out the documentation <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next up, you’ll wire up Spring Boot with Spring Security to your Okta org. When you see how easy it is, your mind might just get blown.</p>

 Get Started with Spring Boot 

<p>The Spring team over at Pivotal has done an amazing job of making getting started with Spring Boot super easy. The Spring Initializr project over at <a href="https://start.spring.io">https://start.spring.io</a> allows you to select everything you need for the app you want to build.</p>

<p>For our purposes (and to keep things simple), you just need:</p>


  
    
      Component
      Description
    
  
  
    
      Spring Web
      RESTful APIs and Spring MVC
    
    
      Thymeleaf
      Server-side Java templating engine
    
    
      Okta
      Easy integration with Okta; includes Spring Security
    
  


<p></p>

<p>Spring Initializr even makes it easy to load a pre-configured project from a <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.3.4.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.okta.examples&amp;artifactId=okta-split-example&amp;name=okta-split-example&amp;description=Feature%20Flags%20with%20Okta%2C%20Split%20and%20Spring%20Security&amp;packageName=com.okta.examples.okta_split_example&amp;dependencies=web,thymeleaf,okta">direct link</a>.</p>

<p>And, you can download the project from the command line with:</p>

   <code>curl -G \
--data 'type=maven-project' \
--data 'language=java' \
--data 'bootVersion=2.3.4.RELEASE' \
--data 'baseDir=okta-split-example' \
--data 'groupId=com.okta.examples' \
--data 'artifactId=okta-split-example' \
--data 'name=okta-split-example' \
--data 'packageName=com.okta.examples.okta_split_example' \
--data 'packaging=jar' \
--data 'javaVersion=11' \
--data 'dependencies=web,thymeleaf,okta' \
--data-urlencode 'description=Feature Flags with Okta, Split and Spring Security' \
https://start.spring.io/starter.zip  \
-o okta-split-example.zip
</code>   

<p>Expand the downloaded zip archive and open it in the IDE of your choice.</p>

<p>You can also find the completed application over on the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-split-example">Okta Developer GitHub repo</a>.</p>

 Integrate with Okta 

<p>In order for this Spring Boot app to connect to your Okta org you need to set up an <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code> file with just three configuration parameters:</p>

   <code>okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: &lt;yourOktaDomain&gt;/oauth2/default
    clientId: &lt;oidc client id&gt;
    clientSecret: &lt;oidc client secret&gt;
</code>   

<p>At this point, the Spring Boot app is ready to run! Execute:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Navigate to: <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You should immediately be redirected to Okta to authenticate. After authenticating, you should end up with a <code>404</code> error, as you haven’t added any content to your app yet. You’ll do that next.</p>

 Create a Basic Thymeleaf Template 

<p>The last two pieces that are needed for a basic Model-View-Controller (MVC) app are a controller and a view in Spring Boot.</p>

 Create a Controller 

<p>Add a file called <code>HomeController</code> with the following:</p>

   <code>@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("username", user.getPreferredUsername());
        model.addAttribute("roles", user.getAuthorities());
        return "home";
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Using the <code>@AuthenticationPrincipal</code> annotation, the authenticated <code>OidcUser</code> is autowired into the home method. A <code>Model</code> object is passed into the method as well.</p>

<p>The <code>Model</code> object is updated with the authenticated user’s username and a list of the Spring Security authorities associated with that user.</p>

<p>Since the project is configured with the Thymeleaf templating engine, returning a <code>String</code> at the end of the controller method will automatically return a template with that name. In this case, Thymeleaf will look for a template named: <code>home.html</code>.</p>

 Create a View 

<p>Create a file called: <code>src/main/resources/templates/home/html</code> with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;span th:inline="text"&gt;Hello, [[${username}]]!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p/&gt;
        Here are your roles:
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;ul th:each="role : ${roles}"&gt;
            &lt;li th:inline="text"&gt;[[${role}]]&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>This template displays the <code>username</code> from the model. It then uses the Thymeleaf construct <code>th:each</code> to iterate over the list of <code>roles</code> from the model.</p>

<p>Restart the application, navigate once again to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and login as: <code>tina@belcher.com</code>.</p>

<p>Amongst a number of default roles and scopes, you should see that she has the <code>BETA_TESTER</code> role.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this point, the Spring Boot + Spring Security application is fully functional (such as it is).</p>

<p>Next, I talk about feature flags with Split and then I bring Spring and Split together.</p>

 Get Started with Feature Flags 

<p>Split is a platform for combining feature flags and experiments with data, giving you more confidence in releases of your app.</p>

<p>In the example for this post, you integrate a split treatment such that a select group of users sees a new ‘beta’ interface for your app while ordinary users see the current production interface.</p>

<p>When our imaginary beta testing is complete, you can enable the new interface for all users.</p>

<p>Best of all, you could repeat this process, creating new beta experiences to be tested by your group and eventually making that generally available.</p>

<p>Getting setup with a free developer account for Split is as easy as 1, 2, 3:</p>

 
   Go to: <a href="https://split.io">https://split.io</a>, click: Free Account 
   Fill out the registration form and click: SIGN UP 
   Follow the link you receive in email and set a password. 
 

<p></p>

 Create the Treatment in Split 

<p>Treatments allow you to define settings and behaviors for what you want to test. For my example, we want to setup a treatment that will return on or off depending on whether or not you are part of the beta tester group.</p>

<p>To start, click DE in the upper left. Choose Admin Settings and API Keys. Copy the value for sdk Type in the prod-default Environment. You’ll need this in the Spring Boot app shortly.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: If you’re new to using Split and/or on the free tier, the button in the upper left will say <code>DE</code> for default. If you’ve set up multiple workspaces, then the button will be labeled with the first two letters of the workspace name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, Click Splits on the left-hand side and click Create Split. Give it a Name. Leave the other defaults and click Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click Add Rules on the Targeting Rules tab. Split automatically adds on and off treatment definitions and sets off as the default.</p>

<p>For the use-case in this example, we want to add a group for which the treatment will return a value of on.</p>

<p>Click Add Rule in the Set Targeting Rules section. Here, we want to have the treatment return on if the user is in the group of beta testers. To accomplish this, enter groups in the Add attribute field. From the Select matcher dropdown, choose Set &gt; has any of and enter BETA_TESTER in the field. Change the serve dropdown to on.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This now makes it read like an english sentence: “If the user has an attribute called groups and the groups list contains the value BETA_TESTER, then serve ‘on’ for the treatment”</p>

<p>Click Save Changes</p>

<p>Click Confirm on the summary screen.</p>

 Integrate the Treatment with Spring Security 

<p>Edit the <code>pom.xml</code> file in the project. Add the following dependency:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.split.client&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;java-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;4.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>You can get the complete application, including the integration with Split over at the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-split-example">Okta Developer GitHub repo</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This brings the Split Java SDK into scope for the project.</p>

<p>Next, add a configuration to the project to make the Split Java Client available to the application. Here’s <code>SplitConfig.java</code>:</p>

   <code>@Configuration
public class SplitConfig {

    @Value("#{ @environment['split.api-key'] }")
    private String splitApiKey;

    @Bean
    public SplitClient splitClient() throws Exception {
        SplitClientConfig config = SplitClientConfig.builder()
            .setBlockUntilReadyTimeout(1000)
            .enableDebug()
            .build();

        SplitFactory splitFactory = SplitFactoryBuilder.build(splitApiKey, config);
        SplitClient client = splitFactory.client();
        client.blockUntilReady();

        return client;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code> file:</p>

   <code>split:
  api-key: &lt;your Split API Key&gt;
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Notice that it’s using the <code>@Value</code> annotation to pull in the Split API Key from the environment. This is a best practice. You should never hardcode an API Key into an application nor commit it in a git repo. In this case, <code>application.yml</code> is listed in the <code>.gitignore</code> file to ensure it’s not added to the git repo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the key line that sets up the Split Client for use elsewhere in the code:</p>

   <code>SplitFactory splitFactory = SplitFactoryBuilder.build(splitApiKey, config);
</code>   

<p>Let’s set up a new template called <code>home-beta.html</code> (It’s mostly copypasta from the original template and should be located in: <code>src/main/resources/templates</code>):</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;WELCOME TO THE BETA EXPERIENCE&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;span th:inline="text"&gt;Hello, [[${username}]]!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p/&gt;
        Here are your roles:
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;ul th:each="role : ${roles}"&gt;
            &lt;li th:inline="text"&gt;[[${role}]]&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is in the <code>HomeController</code>. I want to have the app render the new <code>home-beta</code> template if the authenticated user is in the <code>BETA_TESTER</code> group. Here’s the updated controller:</p>

   <code>@Controller
public class HomeController {

    SplitClient splitClient;

    public HomeController(SplitClient splitClient) {
        this.splitClient = splitClient;
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("username", user.getPreferredUsername());
        model.addAttribute("roles", user.getAuthorities());

        List&lt;String&gt; groups =  user.getAuthorities().stream()
            .map(GrantedAuthority::getAuthority).collect(Collectors.toList());

        String inBeta = splitClient.getTreatment(
            user.getPreferredUsername(),
            "BETA_UI_EXPERIENCE",
            Map.of("groups", groups)
        );

        return "on".equals(inBeta) ? "home-beta" : "home";
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The first thing to notice is that I am injecting the <code>SplitClient</code> using constructor dependency injection.</p>

<p>The real magic happens with the <code>splitClient.getTreatment</code> call. The first parameter is the username provided by Spring Security for the authenticated user.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that in much of the Split documentation, this first parameter is referred to as a <code>key</code>. Don’t confuse this with the API Key, which should NEVER be used as the first parameter to the <code>getTreatment</code> call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second parameter is the name of the treatment in Split that we want to target.</p>

<p>The third parameter sends a map where the key is groups and the value is the list of group names that the authenticated user belongs to. In the case of our user linda, this will be Everyone (among some other defaults). In the case of our user louise, this will be Everyone and BETA_TESTER.</p>

<p>The last line of the controller method now returns the home-beta template if the result of getTreatment is on and the home template otherwise.</p>

<p>Fire up the app and try to login as linda in an incognito window. You should see the same home template as before. Kill that incognito window, open another one and login as louise. You should see the new beta template.</p>

<p></p>

 Make Your New Functionality Generally Available 

<p>Now that we have different treatments of our home template for regular users and beta testers, you may be wondering how to go about making the beta template available to everyone?</p>

<p>Split makes it easy-peasy. Go back to your Split definition for BETA_UI_EXPERIENCE and switch the serve setting in the Set The Default Rule section from off to on. Save and Confirm the change.</p>

<p>Without restarting the Spring Boot application, login as linda again. You should now see the same page that you saw for louise earlier.</p>

<p>Pretty cool, eh?</p>

 How to Repeat the Beta / Release Cycle 

<p>With this architecture in place, it’s now very easy to set up a new beta cycle. The steps would be something like this:</p>

 
   Copy the <code>home-beta.html</code> template to <code>home.html</code> (now that it’s ready for production) 
   Create a new <code>home-beta.html</code> template 
   Set the default rule back to off in Split 
   Redeploy the app 
   Let your beta testers test the new experience 
   When ready, set the default rule back to on in Split 
   NO NEED TO REDEPLOY 
 

<p>You could do this over and over again and never touch the controller code. The only thing that’s changing are the templates and the settings in split.</p>

<p>This approach also lends itself to changing who is in your beta test program without having to change your code.</p>

<p>In a real application, you’d be working with a database or an Identity Management system where you could add and remove users from the BETA_TESTER group. With Okta, you can easily manage who belongs to the group from the admin console or via the Okta Management API. Those users would always see the latest and greatest beta while ordinary users would see only the current release.</p>

<p>JSON-LD, based on the ubiquitous JSON technology, is rapidly gaining&nbsp;<a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld">adoption</a>&nbsp;on the web.&nbsp;<a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>&nbsp;is an innovation relevant to both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/02/25/why-is-json-ld-important-to-businesses/#565e8546e1bf">business minds</a>&nbsp;and developers alike. For those unfamiliar with this technology, this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vioCbTo3C-4">short video</a>&nbsp;is a great introduction. At MATTR we use JSON-LD in a variety of ways. For example, the platform generates credentials using this technology so that they can be inherently understood and referenced.</p>



<p>Despite it’s growing adoption, the success of standards based technologies like JSON-LD tends to depend on how quickly and easily developers can understand it. Developers rely on tools such as compilers, IDE’s (integrated development environments) like visual studio code and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">linters</a> to provide them with guidance and feedback as they code. These tools are essential for facilitating developer productivity and education.</p>



<p>When it comes to JSON-LD, many have observed that there are limited educational tools and resources available. The lack of training wheels in the space creates a barrier to entry, or results in developers breaking things along the way.</p>



<p>Having been on this journey ourselves, we want to make it easier for developers to pick up JSON-LD. That’s why we have developed a linter, which we are open-sourcing today.</p>



<p>Specifically, we are open-sourcing a mono-repo of packages (“JSON-LD Lint”) designed to lint/process JSON-LD documents. These packages are:</p>



  JSON-LD Lint Core – A typescript/javascript library containing the core linting engine for JSON-LD documents  



  JSON-LD Lint CLI – A command line tool for linting/processing JSON-LD documents   







  JSON-LD Lint VSCode Extension – A VS Code extension aimed at providing an improved development experience within VS Code when dealing with JSON-LD documents (coming soon to th VSCode marketplace).   







<p>We hope that these packages will help more developers to understand and adopt this technology. As always, we appreciate your feedback and welcome your involvement in progressing this project further! Head along to our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-lint">GitHub</a> to get involved. You can also <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">gain access</a> to MATTR’s sandbox platform to issue your own JSON-LD credentials today.</p>



 FAQ 



<p>What is JSON-LD and why is it on the rise?</p>



<p>The rise in popularity of javascript (due to its natural language monopoly in web-browsers) led to a mass exile from XML and shift over to JSON as the prefered data representation format. In the process, certain valuable features of XML were lost, in particular those that provide a standardised semantic syntax. JSON-LD defines this missing layer of syntax, which improves semantic reasoning around data. This is critical for maintaining data quality and trust in data, which is particularly important as we increase our reliance on digital infrastructure, IOT and AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is a Linter?</p>



<p>Developers are renowned for building tools that make their job easier – whether it be through automating previously manual processes or designing tools that help to catch their mistakes. The number of tools available has grown in tandem with the open source movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general a linter is a tool that analyzes some input (often source code) and flag errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. It provides developers with feedback around detected issues with their code/input and often includes information on how it could be fixed.</p>

  <p>We’ve all experienced the turbo-charged acceleration in digital transformation in the past six months of the pandemic. Working from home, banking from home, shopping from home, and eating your favorite restaurant meals at home are the new normal. We are also living this experience at ForgeRock. We’ve moved to a nearly 100% remote work environment and&nbsp;supported our customers who have relied on us for a seamless and secure <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/connect-everyone">online experience</a> over the years. Enabling this transformation for our customers is what drives us as a company. It is also why we are all immensely proud to be recognized by Forrester Research as a Leader in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-wave-ciam-2020">The Forrester Wave</a>: Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM), Q4 2020.&nbsp;</p>

 Innovation and Execution Matter Most&nbsp; 

<p>Forrester evaluated the 13 most significant identity and access management (IAM) companies against 32 different criteria spanning three categories: current solution offerings, strategy, and market presence.&nbsp; The evaluation of each company included in-depth reviews of product functionality, demonstration of capabilities, and customer references. ForgeRock was named a Leader in this CIAM evaluation which recognizes both the strength of our current offering as well as having the highest score in the strategy category amongst all vendors evaluated.</p>

 Strong Security and a Great User Experience Are Essential for CIAM 

<p>One&nbsp; prominent theme in this report is the shift in CIAM from “just” a security technology to becoming a key component of the online user experience. Forward-looking organizations are seeking identity partners to help acquire and retain customers while providing them with the security, fraud protection, and personalization capabilities to engage and transact across all consumer channels including web, mobile, call center, or in person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a company strongly focused on <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">CIAM</a>, we’ve invested heavily in designing, building, and continually improving our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> to meet the needs of our customers. We’ve emphasized the importance of capabilities such as data orchestration and user management, customer identity verification and registration, and consumer self-service. We’ve also invested in high performance and scale because they directly impact the user experience. We enable our customers to securely manage hundreds of millions of identities – with demonstrated performance in excess of 3.6 million authentication transactions per minute – and ensure a seamless user experience.</p>

 Looking Ahead 

<p>Forrester emphasized future strategy, investment, and execution roadmap as important criteria in their evaluation. It’s all about cloud choice and enabling hybrid <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">deployments</a>. At ForgeRock, we have known this for a while. It serves as a driving force behind our strategy, product, and go-to-market plan. And, it’s what drove our decision to raise <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-surpasses-100m-arr-raises-935-million-fuel-next-wave-growth-cloud">$93 million</a> in the first half of the year to continue to invest in our business and the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We believe recognition by Forrester Research is a testament to our momentum and validation of our future&nbsp; strategy and direction. Increasingly, our platform is becoming mission-critical to the largest organizations in the world – and we take our responsibility to deliver on their expectations seriously. We are incredibly proud that Forrester has named us a leader in CIAM.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>It’s October and it means that we are having the <a href="https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/">European Cybersecurity Month</a> again. ECSM is the European Union’s annual campaign dedicated to promoting cybersecurity among EU citizens and organizations. To be completely honest, I do not remember it being much of a thing in previous years, but apparently, in 2020, cybersecurity awareness is much more important for the European Commission and not without, ahem, a very big reason.</p>
<p>I have always had mixed feelings about the whole notion of “awareness”. On one hand, raising awareness is basically <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybersecurity_awareness_training">what we analysts do</a> on a daily basis: spreading the word about new security challenges and innovative products that solve them is a major part of our job. On the other hand, it does not really help, does it? We still hear about major data breaches and ransomware attacks every day: I suspect that many people have long become completely desensitized to that news. Well, perhaps learning about <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/09/a-patient-dies-after-ransomware-attack.html">the first death of a patient</a> in a clinic hit by ransomware (in my city of all places!) was a notable and unfortunate exception…</p>
<p>So, what are we doing wrong? Are we not putting enough effort into cybersecurity awareness? Should we do it differently somehow? I wish I had a clear-cut answer to these questions… Alas, I don’t think anybody does. However, there are several points we could address. First and foremost, cybersecurity culture should obviously not be limited to a special month. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble, and if people are not constantly reminded of the dangers, they will forget and focus on more relevant aspects of their daily jobs.</p>
 Awareness should be about solutions, not problems 
<p>Another critical aspect is that awareness alone never amounts to much. People (and organizations) should learn not just about potential troubles: they need to be given concrete solutions for those. For cybersecurity, this includes not only specific security tools but also giving actionable recommendations: how to improve your computer’s security, how to defend against account takeover, how to prepare for a phishing or ransomware attack and where to seek assistance after being hit… Ideally, cybersecurity hygiene has to become a routine part of your daily life like brushing your teeth or locking the front door.</p>
<p>One simple example: how many times have you heard about the dangers of using the same simple password between multiple online services? I’d argue that the public awareness of the issue is very high, and yet, the worldwide most popular password is still “123456”. How about suggesting using a free password manager instead, like <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> or <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a><a></a>? In enterprise environments, of course, one should look for solutions with centralized management and additional capabilities like <a href="https://www.passwordsafe.com/">Mateso Password Safe</a>. Using such a tool completely changes your “password routine”, making re-using an old password more cumbersome that generating a fresh strong one each time.</p>
<p>Even better, of course, is activating multi-factor authentication whenever available. Alas, there is still no single convenient tool to support all online services, but a combination of a hardware security key like <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikey</a> and an authenticator mobile app like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> will have almost all your bases covered. And by the way, forget about changing your passwords regularly and using security questions – these have long been proven useless and are no longer recommended by reputable organizations like <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp800">NIST</a>.</p>
 Awareness in times of Corona 
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic that forced so many people to work from home for months has also completely changed the scope of enterprise cybersecurity. For years, strict segregation of work and personal activities has been enforced by security and compliance policies, even for Bring Your Own Devices. Nowadays, when so many employees resort to using their home PCs for remote work, this approach no longer works.</p>
<p>Even worse: the same devices are often used by remotely schooled children, blending the line between home and work security even further and introducing new, unexpected challenges to corporate security departments. Will raising awareness among elementary school students help? Who is supposed to do this job: Teachers? Parents? Parents’ employers? Governments? Or maybe the companies that develop the software used for remote communications?</p>
<p>One thing is certain though: the situation is not going to sort itself out. I believe, some kind of government-backed incentive is necessary<a></a>, not just for providing consistent guidance and governance across industries, but for supporting private initiatives and sanctioning negligence. Awareness campaigns like ECSM are a useful first step in that direction but other steps must follow soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the only sensible way to secure people working from home (including their families, because malware, like COVID, does not differentiate) is for organizations to expand the focus of their cybersecurity efforts beyond just BYOD. Cybersecurity Awareness Training should be an important and perhaps the first step in that direction. However, it has to focus on concrete, actionable, easily understandable guidance delivered in a way that actually makes people want to participate. A popular example of this approach is gamified phishing training. Not only people learn about the dangers of opening suspicious emails or clicking on unverified links, they are naturally incentivized to compete, learn more and apply their knowledge more often.</p>
 Expanding the scope of cybersecurity 
<p>However, organizations should not stop there. Securing their employees’ home devices should become a part of the corporate cybersecurity strategy. Of course, old-school tools like firewalls and VPNs are not suitable for such scenarios, but this is where security solutions delivered from the cloud come to the rescue. It is obvious that communications security (including not just email, but videoconferencing and online collaboration tools) should not differentiate between company-owned and personal devices. However, the same approach should apply to other fields as well, such as web security or endpoint detection and response. Even though such solutions are more “invasive” in terms of potential privacy issues, modern cloud-native products from companies like Akamai, Cisco or Zscaler offer a range of privacy-enhancing controls to overcome the compliance challenges.</p>
<p>Last but not least, government-issued guidance does not have to be your only source of expertise and best practices. Independent and strictly neutral research from industry analysts can be quite valuable as well, especially when it comes to selecting the most appropriate product for your specific risks and requirements.

<p>This is the fourth and final piece in our series focused on nationalism and its threat to digital identity. If you missed it, read the first three parts (1,2,3), now for the full story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 #ICYMI 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This series was initiated after the E.U. announced it had revoked the Privacy Shield, a transatlantic agreement that enabled the legal transfer of data between itself and the United States (U.S.). Since that ruling, we have also seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/impact-swiss-privacy-shield-inadequacy-decision">Swiss Data Protection Authority</a>&nbsp;conclude the EU-U.S. Swiss Privacy Shield was no longer a valid method of transferring personal data between the two countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This news, and subsequent follow-up, sparked our OWI team to take a step and ask ourselves if there was a broader trend around the rise of nationalism, both political and economical, and its role in disrupting international data sharing agreements. For digital identity enthusiasts like ourselves, we acknowledge that international cooperation and data sharing are essential pillars in furthering inclusive digital identity infrastructures and preventing bad actors from causing undue harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This series intends to capture what the roles and positions of the major economies — the E.U., China, and the U.S. — are in the data economy, and illustrate why the current trend towards centralization is counterintuitive to more effective digital identity strategies. In this finale, we will look at how the U.S.’s inability to lead the international community towards a unilateral digital economy infrastructure — by prioritizing companies’ free will over individual rights over its people — indirectly stifles the possibility for interoperable and secure digital identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, we will examine how, while the CCPA can be seen as a bellwether for future U.S. data privacy policy, it is still insufficient in governing how U.S. companies handle and process personal data. This position stands in stark contrast with countries abroad, who recognize data privacy as a global concern and who take concerted action to prioritize individual privacy protection and develop robust digital identity frameworks. Moreover, these issues are compounded by the fact that the U.S. has taken drastic steps over the past few years to remove themselves from several high-profile trade and political agreements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This retrenchment from the national community has forced countries to implement new mandates or remove existing agreements targeted at U.S. technology companies operating abroad. We believe the rise of nationalistic policies is hurting cooperative approaches to interoperable and inclusive digital identity frameworks. To that end, we will conclude with alternative methods forward and offer some examples of companies pursuing digital identity systems that do not necessitate centralized authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Influence of CCPA 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, October 1st, 2020, the U.S. does not have a central federal level privacy law. Data privacy is instead under the purview of several&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osano.com/articles/data-privacy-laws">industry-specific laws</a>&nbsp;(e.g., HIPAA, U.S. Privacy Act, Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), etc.) and championed by several privacy-forward states, most notably California with the&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Data Privacy Act (CCPA</a>), in addition to&nbsp;<a href="https://rampedup.us/maine-privacy-law-impact/#:~:text=On%20July%201%2C%202020%2C%20Maine,Internet%20Service%20Providers%20(ISPs).">Maine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insideprivacy.com/united-states/state-legislatures/nevadas-new-consumer-privacy-law-departs-significantly-from-the-california-ccpa/">Nevada</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>California’s economic size, political influence, and role as the de facto technology hub of the U.S. have made CCPA a global conversation topic. And it serves as the closest example of what we could expect a federal mandate to reflect. CCPA’s scope and territorial reach are more limited than the GDPR. Additionally, the extent of the Act is restricted to&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1121">two main categorie</a>s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first applies to for-profit businesses operating in California. A business must collect California citizens’ data and determine the&nbsp;purpose and means&nbsp;of their personal data, meaning that they slice and dice it for commercial purposes. Additionally, the law has specific qualifications for these businesses. They must:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Have at least $25 million in annual gross revenue 
 Buy/sell or received the personal information of at least 50,000 California consumers, households or devices annually 
 50 percent of your annual revenue comes from selling California consumers’ personal data 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This data privacy law continues to be contested by several big tech companies in the United States, contending that they are selling access to data instead of selling data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second category encompasses entities that control or are controlled by an entity that meets the first set of criteria or shares common branding with the parent entity. This makes the CCPA targeted as companies are in the personal data business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Users as End-Products&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of a federally-administered data privacy law or of any unified governance over the private-sector’s collection and use of personal data has allowed companies to act at their discretion. This freedom to optimize the user’s experience while maintaining a free business model has made the user the end-product. However, these same business practices are not being received well in countries abroad, creating mounting geopolitical tensions that manifest themselves in events such as the revoking of the Privacy Shield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Countries abroad recognize that their citizens’ personal privacy is being infringed upon for a foreign entity’s monetary benefit. Moreover, countries have legislation maintaining that personal data privacy is an individual human right (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/06/eu-general-data-protection-regulation">GDPR</a>), and U.S. companies are not abiding by that principle. It would be the equivalent of parents not teaching their children any concept of right and wrong, and during a playdate, the friend’s parents having to ask the poorly-acting child to leave their home before they can learn not to smash their face with spaghetti.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. should acknowledge its failure to implement legislation that prioritizes individuals’ rights over company profits; doing so would promote free trade in the digital economy. It is important to note that data privacy issues are not the only issue eroding global cooperation. Not only is the U.S. ineffectively governing private sector companies, but it is also actively reducing the number of formal partnership agreements with allies and trade partners. Over the last several years, the United States has pulled away from several high-profile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/01/trump-has-pulled-out-international-agreements-before-here-list/H9zTo2ctVEQ0b8xkUQ2t9J/story.html">international agreements</a>, including but not limited to the Paris Accords, JCPOA, Open Skies agreement, the U.N. Human Rights Council, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The reluctance for furthering international partnerships is forcing other countries to implement legislation, particularly around data privacy, that keeps U.S. companies accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the retrenchment from global cooperation around technology and data interoperability is closing the window on a possible future where governments successfully coordinate a standardized approach to digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Path Forward&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;<a href="https://id2020.org/digital-identity#:~:text=1.1%20billion%20people%20worldwide%20live,political%2C%20economic%20and%20social%20opportunity.">1.1 billion people</a>&nbsp;in the world without access to a digital identity – and even more people lack a mechanism to transfer or port their digital footprint with themselves outside of their native country. This lack of basic identification and interoperability systems perpetuate ongoing barriers for individuals to access goods and services. Digital identity experts, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/es/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/assets/pdf/Roadmap_for_Digital_Cooperation_EN.pdf">UNDP</a>, argue that the key to solving these issues is ongoing international cooperation and dedicating resources to establish standards for individuals to receive a universally recognized digital identifier. In addition to the lack of U.S. federal standards and frameworks, the rise of nationalism reduces the likelihood of these initiatives gaining meaningful traction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are potential paths forward. There are members of the digital identity community who are working tirelessly to promote alternative systems. Of the initiatives underway, a decentralized identity is a popular option that does not require participation from authoritative sources to maintain digital identities for individuals (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://verified.me/">SecureKey</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>). These systems commonly leverage distributed ledger technology to distribute identity data for users to readily access their sovereignty and leisure. And on the government front, there is still hope. We encourage members of the digital identity, big data, technology, and data privacy communities to keep raising awareness of these issues and garner the attention of more government officials worldwide to the consequences being inflicted on billions of people. Global problems can only be solved together.</p>

While Trinsic specializes in building the world’s best developer toolkit for decentralized identity, we recognize that plenty of non-technical people want to build SSI integrations. Zapier is the best tool we found to connect the APIs of various different services behind the scenes, making SSI more accessible than ever before.</p><p><br>If you’ve interacted with Trinsic much, you know we issue credentials for all sorts of things. Many of those workflows, including the Stripe, Calendly, and Zoom integrations, were done using Zapier and took less than 15 minutes to set up. We even issued our employees an Employee ID credential using Zapier! But we’re not the only ones who love this feature—see how other innovators are using Trinsic and Zapier to make self-sovereign identity a reality.</p>

					 <p>The magic happens behind the scenes where the Trinsic API is integrated with the Zapier platform using special webhooks. Zapier specializes in creating workflows, or a series of actions across multiple different apps. Through this process, Zapier can pass data from other apps into Trinsic and visa-versa, enabling completely automated credential exchange workflows.</p><p><br>In Zapier, triggers are an event that initiates an automated workflow and actions are the events that occur in that workflow. In the example below, a new registrant in Eventbrite is the trigger of this workflow. In the workflow, the actions that are completed are issuing a credential, registering for a webinar, and sending a confirmation email to the new event attendee.</p><p><br>With integrations to over 2000 other applications, the sky is the limit in terms of integrations. Build an automated credential exchange workflow in less than 15 minutes by following these instructions:<br><br></p>  First, plan out your use case. Maybe you’re following the lead of the Internet Identity Workshop and issuing verifiable credentials as event tickets.

<p>There’s just one downside: that we can’t give everyone an award for their efforts. Trust me when I say it was no easy feat to choose the winners from among many worthy nominations. But after many hours of review and deliberation, our judging committee narrowed the field to identify the top entries across eight different categories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worthy award recipients were celebrated at our annual user conference, <a>IDENTIFY 2020</a>. Like many events this year, IDENTIFY was held virtually, but that didn’t stop us from rolling out the digital red carpet for these deserving companies. It’s my great honor to announce this year’s Identity Excellence Awards winners as follows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At <a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR</a> we’ve been busy building the next generation of solutions for verifiable data and digital trust. Earlier this month we introduced <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">our platform</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/using-privacy-preserving-zkp-credentials-on-the-mattr-platform-4c9e351a2fc3">added experimental support</a> for a new, privacy-preserving method for selective data disclosure. Today, we’ve reached another milestone that gives our users even more choice and transparency by the addition of a new way to use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs).</p>



<p>Modularity and extensibility are key design principles underpinning our core platform architecture. The MATTR Platform is designed to support a wide range of distinct pluggable components, providing our customers with confidence that their technology choices will continue to evolve with new innovations as they emerge.</p>



<p>When it comes to DIDs, there are currently over 50+ <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">DID Methods</a> registered with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>. Each DID Method defines a CRUD model that describes how a particular DID scheme works with a specific <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry">verifiable data registry</a> such as a distributed ledger or blockchain. The initial group of DID methods was quite small, and has expanded significantly over time as more solutions emerge in this space. While all of these new DID methods theoretically adhere to the DID core specification, each method makes a different set of choices that affect the underlying trust model at play. For instance, DID methods have distinct rules about who gets to add new transactions, what input data is required, where DIDs are anchored, who can view or monitor the DIDs, and more.</p>



<p>In short, there are many factors that affect the choice around which DID method to use, and it’s not a trivial decision.</p>



<p>We believe that DIDs, when deployed responsibly, can be extremely effective at preserving user privacy, enhancing transparency and consent, enabling data portability, and enforcing user control. To learn more about our approach, read our blog, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/intro-to-dids-for-people-5ebe620b5a15">“Intro to DIDs for people”</a>.</p>







<p>In addition to our current support for <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a> (static key-based identifier) and <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">DID Sovrin</a> (ledger-based identifier), we are now proud to add <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a> (domain-based identifier) to our list of supported DID methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DID Web helps to bridge the gap between the way that trust is established on the internet today, namely using domains, and new and emerging ecosystems using DIDs. When using DID Web, rather than anchoring a DID to a decentralized ledger such as a blockchain, the DID is instead associated with a specific domain name, and subsequently anchored to the web host registered with that domain via <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS resolution</a>. Effectively, this allows a DID using this scheme to be resolved as simply as one resolves a web URL, every time they click on a link. For example, we’ve set up a DID Web using our own domain, which can be resolved at <a href="https://mattr.global/.well-known/did.json">did:web:mattr.global</a>.</p>



<p>Users in the emerging world of DIDs can use this mechanism to bootstrap trust by using the reputation associated with public domains. While this solution may not work in every circumstance and lacks some of the resilience and censorship guarantees afforded by DID methods with less centralized dependencies, DID Web provides a practical and useful pathway to adoption, particularly for entities whose data and identity are already public. When used in parallel with more natively decentralized mechanisms, we can help to ensure that the web remains free and open while providing a path for legacy systems to remain interoperable with the emerging distributed web of trust.</p>



<p>By adding support for new DID methods such as <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a>, we are creating optionality and choice for our users. Our products will always be ledger-agnostic. We will also continue to offer support for DIDs which are not anchored to any ledger. We aim to bridge the gap between approaches that are built on top of ledgers and those using domains, key registries, and other methods to establish trust.</p>



<p>We are also actively investigating how to add support for more scalable solutions that use ledgers on an ad-hoc basis, such as DID methods based on the layer two <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree">Sidetree Protocol</a>. This open-source protocol provides an abstract layer that sits on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger">DLT</a> infrastructure.</p>







<p>The <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/drivers">Platform Drivers</a> part of our architecture provides DID Method support in the form of&nbsp; pluggable integrations that prevent vendor lock-in and enable user choice. To find out more about how the MATTR Platform supports a broad spectrum of DID methods, check out our documentation on <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/core/dids">MATTR Learn</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">sign up</a> to get started.</p>

<p>Customize many aspects of your Gluu Server identity and access management service.</p>
<p>Interception scripts can be used to implement custom business logic for authentication, authorization and more in a way that is upgrade-proof and doesn’t require forking the Gluu Server code. Each type of script is described by a Java interface — i.e. which methods are required.</p>
<p>In 4.2, we’ve introduced new interception scripts for Post-Authentication Authorization (<a href="https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/admin-guide/custom-script/#post-authn">more details</a>), UMA2 RPT claims (<a href="https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/admin-guide/custom-script/#uma-2-rpt-claims">more details</a>), and application session management (<a href="https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/admin-guide/custom-script/#application-session-management">more details</a>).</p>
<p>Post-Authentication Authorization</p>
<p>For example: a sensitive web application may wish to force users to re-authenticate even if they present a valid session cookie to reduce the risk of a valid user session at an unattended computer being used by another person to access data inappropriately.</p>
<p>After the browser has a session, if a person visits a website, the RP can obtain a code without the user having to authenticate or authorize. In some cases, it is desirable to insert custom business logic before granting the code or tokens from the authorization endpoint. Post Authn script allows to force re-authentication or re-authorization (even if client is “Pre-authorized” or client authorization persistence is on).</p>
<p>UMA2 RPT claims</p>
<p>UMA2 standard is designed to separate the requesting party and the resource owner (where OAuth2 considers them to be only one person). And this differentiation allows us to address more use-cases than OAuth2.</p>
<p>RPT claims is a special script for UMA 2. It allows an admin to code logic for gathering additional claims (required by UMA RPT Authorization Policy).<br>
This script can be used in an oxAuth application only.</p>
<p>Application Session Management<br>
Session management is used to facilitate secure interactions between a user and some service or application and applies to a sequence of requests and responses associated with that particular user. When a user has an ongoing session with a web application, they are submitting requests within their session and are providing potentially sensitive information. The application may retain this information and/or track the status of the user during the session across multiple requests. More importantly, it is critical that the application has a means of protecting private data belonging to each unique user, especially within authenticated sessions.<br>
This script allows an admin to get notification about various session lifetime events. It’s possible to add multiple scripts with this type. The application should call all of them according to the level.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gluu.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gluu-server-webinars-on-identity-and-access-management.jpg"></a>The Gluu Server now supports CIBA. Improve the end-user experience during authentication and authorization</p>
<p>OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow is an authentication flow like OpenID Connect. However, unlike OpenID Connect, there is a direct Relying Party to OpenID Provider communication without redirects through the user’s browser. CIBA enables a Client to initiate the authentication of an end-user by means of out-of-band mechanisms.</p>
<p>CIBA allows a client application, known as a consumption device, to obtain authentication and consent from a user without requiring the user to interact with the client directly. Instead, the client application can initiate a backchannel request to the user’s authentication device, such as a smartphone with an authenticator app installed, to authenticate the user and consent to the operation.</p>
<p>This specification does not change the semantics of the OpenID Connect Authentication flow. It introduces a new endpoint to which the authentication request is posted. It introduces a new asynchronous method for authentication result notification or delivery. It does not introduce new scope values nor does it change the semantics of standard OpenID Connect parameters.</p>

 The GiD Report#129 — What we learned about digital identity from&nbsp;OnlyFans <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-128-what-the-apple-app-store-backlash-tells-us-about-this-moment-in-time-805a4443f077">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Every company is a messaging company  What we learned about digital identity from&nbsp;OnlyFans  Facebook is worried about messaging (and being broken&nbsp;up)  Trump administration to sue Google next&nbsp;week  The EU and China are getting in on&nbsp;it  This week in the app platform&nbsp;wars  Stuff happens   1. The pandemic lockdown and the resulting era of remote work (and play) has brought to the forefront our platforms for interaction and bringing us together. There was that a16z saying — that every company is a fintech company. Today, it feels like every company is a messaging and groups&nbsp;company. <p>Zoom is <a href="https://zoom.us/feature/messaging">expanding into messaging and groups</a>. Venmo <a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/217042878-Group-Accounts">experimented with groups but is apparently shelving the initiative</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/VS">/VS</a>). Discord is <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035969312-Community-Server-Guidelines">expanding groups and community functionality</a> with <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server">community servers</a>.</p><p>But none of those initiatives move the needle in terms of addressing lessons learned from this last cycle of the internet because none of these platforms address the issue of digital identity in a material&nbsp;way.</p><p>Really, it’s more of the&nbsp;same.</p><p>We need an interoperable, portable identity in order to best enable all people economically and socially around the world. We need a persistent identity in order to restructure incentives for better outcomes and prevent fraud and abuse. And we need an open platform so that developers can experiment and create with those messaging and groups (and payments) building blocks so that real innovation can&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>Fundamentally addressing that remains a huge opportunity.</p> 2. Incidentally, one platform that has addressed the issue of identity more than any other is OnlyFans. (For those out of the loop, OnlyFans has been trending this year as a way premium membership platform for influencers. As you might guess, there’s a lot of “adult”-ish type content&nbsp;there.) <p>In accordance to Rule 34 of the internet, they’ve also <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/lessons-from-the-rise-of-onlyfans">managed digital identity better than&nbsp;most</a>:</p><blockquote>First, OnlyFans offers an example of how the desire to get paid for content online smooths the way to validating user identities. There are three major reasons other social services don’t validate the people who participate in their networks. First, the friction of going through the validation process for new accounts prevents people from signing up. Second, it is expensive and time-consuming for services to validate identities. Third, requiring proof of real-world identity is quite exclusionary, as many people can’t easily make that proof. The desire to get paid for content provides a level of motivation that overcomes at least the first two of these&nbsp;hurdles.</blockquote><blockquote>At a bigger systems level, the lesson might be that the path toward trusted validation of identities will come through payment systems. I very much hope that we never face a world where someone has to prove their identity in order to share content on the internet; however, the financial system is far more structurally locked down. It seems likely that payments will become the wedge that forces people to validate online identities. That could lead to the creation of an internet environment where it is easier to validate the real-world identity (or at least the valid citizenship) of the people you are interacting with&nbsp;online.</blockquote><p>So yeah, it only took OnlyFans to validate GlobaliD’s vision that payments, messaging, and digital identity go hand in hand&nbsp;:)</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/lessons-from-the-rise-of-onlyfans">Lessons From the Rise of&nbsp;OnlyFans</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-29/private-social-app-clubhouse-courts-fresh-controversy?sref=BAcrnccI&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Private Social App Clubhouse Courts Fresh Controversy</a>  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity&nbsp;System</a>  <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/How-self-sovereign-identity-principles-suit-the-modern-world">How self-sovereign identity principles suit the modern&nbsp;world</a>   3. Much has been said about last week’s presidential debate. What’s clear, though, is that the country has never been more divided. What they’re not divided on, however, is the idea that we need to regulate Big&nbsp;Tech. <p>Sure, each side has its own motivations, but the end result is the same. Big Tech is the new Too Big To Fail. They’ve gotten too powerful, stifling competition and innovation. And they’ve gotten too influential, undermining social cohesion. Not even Apple is&nbsp;safe.</p><p>Anyway, Facebook is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-government-breakup-of-instagram-whatsapp-would-be-complete-nonstarter-11601803800">worried about messaging:</a></p><blockquote>The document was produced by staff at Facebook based on work commissioned from lawyers at Sidley Austin LLP. While light on legal citations and technical language, it offers a window into how Facebook may defend itself if it is sued on antitrust grounds and reflects its lawyers’ sense that any attempts to force a divestiture of WhatsApp or Instagram would be fought in both the public square and the courtroom.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 were examined by the Federal Trade Commission, which closed its reviews without issuing an objection. The company made big investments to boost growth on those platforms and they now share numerous operations that are integrated. In the paper, Facebook says unwinding the deals would be nearly impossible to achieve, forcing the company to spend billions of dollars maintaining separate systems, weakening security and harming users’ experience.</blockquote><blockquote>“A ‘breakup’ of Facebook is thus a complete nonstarter,” the paper declares.</blockquote>Tim Wu, Photo: New&nbsp;America<p>Tim Wu, who I interviewed many years ago (incidentally, also Big Tech monopoly related — yeah, we’ve been on this beat for a while), wasn’t impressed:</p><blockquote>Facebook’s contention that past government inaction on the acquisitions should limit current action is “surprisingly weak,” said Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor, tech critic and author who has said Facebook should be broken up. A government antitrust case against the company would likely rely on the argument that Facebook made serial acquisitions to reduce competition, a question that wasn’t considered when the Federal Trade Commission originally chose not to oppose the Instagram and WhatsApp deals, he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“There’s no way a decision on one merger would be preclusive,” he said, noting that the FTC’s reviews of both acquisitions had reserved the right to revisit the deals at a later&nbsp;time.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook’s claim regarding the difficulty of a potential breakup would also be unlikely to carry legal weight. “There is no ‘it’s too hard’ defense,” Mr. Wu&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>The FTC is expected to file a formal complaint by year’s end. Meanwhile, Facebook is racing to integrate its messaging platforms to make it even more difficult to&nbsp;breakup.</p>  <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/new-messaging-features-for-instagram/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Say “hi” to Messenger: Introducing New Messaging Features for Instagram — About&nbsp;Facebook</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-government-breakup-of-instagram-whatsapp-would-be-complete-nonstarter-11601803800">Facebook Says Government Breakup of Instagram, WhatsApp Would Be ‘Complete Nonstarter’</a>   4. Things are happening more quickly for&nbsp;Google. <p>Maybe <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/02/trump-doj-google-antitrust-lawsuit-425617">as soon as next&nbsp;week</a>:</p><blockquote>The Justice Department and state attorneys general are expected to sue Google as soon as next week for alleged antitrust abuses, people familiar with discussions said Friday, marking a dramatic escalation of Washington’s fight to rein in Silicon Valley’s&nbsp;giants.</blockquote><blockquote>The Justice Department — which has been probing Google for 16 months — circulated text of a proposed complaint this week, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. The complaint could come late next week or just after the Columbus Day holiday, two of the people said. All spoke anonymously to discuss an ongoing investigation.</blockquote><p>This suit will mainly focus on search. But the government’s commitment to the cause portends more to&nbsp;come.</p>  <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/02/trump-doj-google-antitrust-lawsuit-425617">Trump administration to launch antitrust suit against Google as soon as next&nbsp;week</a>   5. And I know that we usually speak about things here from a U.S. perspective, but this is apparently a sentiment felt worldwide. <p>The EU, of course, has long been at the forefront of regulating Big&nbsp;Tech.</p>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-tech-antitrust/u-s-tech-giants-face-curbs-on-data-sharing-digital-marketplaces-under-draft-eu-rules-idUSKBN26L293">U.S. tech giants face curbs on data sharing, digital marketplaces, under draft EU&nbsp;rules</a>  <p>But China wants in on it,&nbsp;too.</p>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-china-huawei-tech-exclusive-idUSKBN26L1OH">Exclusive: China preparing an antitrust investigation into Google — sources</a>   6.

  <p>With the Covid-19 pandemic causing a dramatic shift in how public sector organizations and agencies do their work and provide citizen services, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> has become a priority. Easy, yet secure, remote access for both citizens and employees is no longer a goal for tomorrow, it is a must for today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, traditional IT environments struggle to accommodate increased access demands. For example, legacy identity and access management (IAM) and identity governance and administration (IGA) weren’t designed to provide real-time, continuous enterprise-wide user access visibility, control, and remediation, or to collect and analyze identity data to identify security access and risk blind spots. These shortcomings result in error-prone and time-consuming manual work, poor user experiences, and increased risk — making it difficult for public sector organizations to successfully implement their digital transformation initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What’s needed is a comprehensive IAM and IGA platform capable of not only <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">modernizing and filling the gaps of legacy identity systems</a>, but also unlocking their value with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).&nbsp;</p>

<p>At ForgeRock we’re ready to help. I’m excited to announce that the ForgeRock Identity Governance and ForgeRock Autonomous Identity solutions are now available on the GSA Schedule, which means <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock’s complete IAM and IGA platform</a> can be purchased on the GSA Schedule with Carahsoft. ForgeRock has a long-standing partnership with Carahsoft within the public sector market across US Federal Agencies and State Governments. In fact, Rich Savage, Sales Director at Carahsoft, noted “We pride ourselves on helping government agencies find the best technology solutions available. ForgeRock’s AI-powered platform is exactly what IT teams need in the public sector for solving complex digital identity challenges.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both Identity Governance and Autonomous Identity are fully deployable in a DevSecOps environment. You can view the <a href="https://www.carahsoft.com/forgerock#products">new SKUs on our Carahsoft microsite</a> under ‘Products.’&nbsp;</p>

 ForgeRock Identity Governance and Administration 

<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) is the ability to manage and reduce the risk that comes with excessive or unnecessary user access to applications, systems, and data.&nbsp;Users want to have easy and rapid access to all of the applications they need to do their jobs. As a security-conscious organization, you need to balance requests for immediate application access with security, while reducing the risk associated with this process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem is, many public sector organizations use manual processes or scripts to grant immediate access to users. However, this leads to a failure to implement proper monitoring and governance controls on access in order to determine whether users should continue to have access. When auditors ask for proof of proper detective and preventive controls, organizations often resort to even more manual processes that involve spreadsheets and emails. Imagine the worst-case scenario, when a security team is triaging and they have to rely on searching through emails and spreadsheets in order to understand the chain of events. Fortunately, there’s a better way.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">ForgeRock Identity Governance and Administration</a> is an integral part of the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>. It simplifies the manual access request, access approval, certification, and role mining processes while providing full identity lifecycle management for creating, managing, and restricting identity access to accounts, systems, applications, and infrastructure. With ForgeRock IGA, you can strengthen your security posture and automatically drive regulatory compliance.</p>

 ForgeRock Autonomous Identity&nbsp; 

<p>Legacy IGA solutions operate in ‘identity silos’ based on static data, including assignments, roles, and entitlements. Combined with the increasing volume and type of identities within the public sector, this can leave your already overburdened risk and security teams struggling to keep up as they manually provision access privileges and rubber stamp access requests and certifications.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">ForgeRock Autonomous Identity</a> is an AI-driven identity analytics solution that can be layered on top of, and integrated with, your existing IGA solutions to provide real-time and continuous enterprise-wide user access visibility, control, and remediation. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the Autonomous Identity collects and analyzes identity data, such as accounts, roles, user activity, and entitlements, to identify security access and risk blind spots. As a result, public sector organizations gain wider and deeper insight into the risks associated with user access as well as remediation recommendations.</p>

<p>As these product descriptions exemplify, there’s a better way to do Identity Governance and Administration to improve your overall access and security landscape while reducing manual processes and extending the value of your current investments. These solutions, along with ForgeRock’s comprehensive identity platform capabilities, help you achieve the digital transformation required for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/connect-everyone">today’s remote access demands</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the State of Utah wanted to gain greater reliability and scalability in its identity and access management (IAM) infrastructure to integrate more data and applications, and expand the number of online services available to employees, citizens, and businesses. Using the ForgeRock Identity Platform, the state integrated more than 900 applications and online services, providing the flexibility and scalability to support all 1,400 of the states online services and a growing variety of additional applications and services, including those running in the cloud. The above and more resulted in a projected savings of up to $15 million due to operational efficiencies. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/customer/state-utah">Read the full State of Utah customer story</a>.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the ForgeRock Identity Platform, as well as our newly added Identity Governance and Administration and Autonomous Identity solutions <a href="https://www.carahsoft.com/forgerock#products">on our Carahsoft microsite</a> under ‘Products’. And, as always, please reach out to us directly with any questions. We and Carahsoft are here to serve you.</p>

Photo by Shikoh Gitau/&nbsp;Qhala How Jumia and Facebook are competing, even though they’re playing different games <p>Tiffany* sells makeup, and is evaluating a new display shelf where her product would be at eye level with passing shoppers. That visibility could lead to new customers, but she’s not convinced it’s worth the trouble, because almost all of her customers currently find her on Instagram. And actually, that shelf isn’t even in her store — it’s in the front of a retail locker space where she rents a container in the back to hold her inventory. Tiffany keeps some of her most popular products on hand here so that customers can easily drop by and see the merchandise, but otherwise she runs a completely virtual, just-in-time business. And paying for a physical footprint, even if it’s only a few square feet of shelf space, might not give her the return she needs on scarce&nbsp;capital.</p><p>Tiffany is among millions of entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa taking advantage of popular digital tools to transform their business. Formal marketplaces such as Jumia or Takealot have successfully established a traditional model of e-commerce, while new platforms from Paystack, Flutterwave, and others provide the underlying tools for independent sellers. Despite these formal offerings, the vast majority of digitally connected small businesses are using Facebook, WhatsApp, and other consumer platforms to fulfill an increasing number of commercial use cases. This “social commerce” is often heralded as a leveler of the playing field, as even the smallest businesses can typically use social platforms for a low&nbsp;cost.</p><p>To help make sense of this mix of formal and informal, of purpose-built and appropriated, I developed a framework for comparing the range of digital solutions available to today’s entrepreneurs. For those with a commercial interest in this sector, the framework offers a lens for understanding how different solutions solve distinct parts of the value chain, and what this means for the likely addressable market of each solution. For policymakers and those interested in inclusive economic growth, the analysis highlights the implications of fundamentally different operational structures between formal ecommerce and social platforms, and why we should worry about how previously informal economic activity becomes formalized.</p> From analog to&nbsp;digital <p>Small businesses in sub-Saharan Africa looking to sell online have multiple options to consider; which I’ve simplified here into four categories.[<a>1</a>] These are by no means mutually exclusive, but for clarity I have separated them in the analysis.</p><p>Social commerce<br>The most accessible and likely approach for most small businesses is to use those consumer products that are already familiar and ubiquitous, especially Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Instagram. Entrepreneurs can create a page on Facebook and/or Instagram, post photos or videos of products, communicate with prospective customers, respond to customer reviews, and use built-in advertising tools to boost her page or specific product&nbsp;posts.</p><p>E-commerce marketplaces<br>Businesses may also sell on formal marketplaces such as <a href="https://group.jumia.com/">Jumia</a>, <a href="https://www.kilimall.co.ke/new/">Kilimall</a>, or <a href="https://www.konga.com/">Konga</a>. These online marketplaces aggregate supply and demand into a single platform, providing sellers with immediate access to a large audience — for a price. Like Amazon, they offer sales support with payment processing, fulfillment, and delivery, as well as back office business tools such as inventory management and analytics; typically they charge a commission on&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Standalone domains<br>More digitally savvy businesses might go a step further and publish their own standalone website using one of a growing number of e-commerce tools, such as <a href="https://paystack.com/commerce">Paystack Commerce</a> or <a href="https://flutterwave.com/us/store">Flutterwave Store</a>, two new solutions from Nigerian fintechs that combine payment processing and back office functions with a website builder into a single platform (essentially, Shopify for&nbsp;Africa).</p><p>B2B sourcing<br>And another option for FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) retailers are B2B platforms that connect businesses with suppliers and financing, such as <a href="https://www.tradedepot.co/">Trade Depot</a> in Nigeria or <a href="https://sokowatch.com/">Sokowatch</a> in East Africa, both of which aggregate demand from retailers to provide discounted wholesale pricing and deliver consumer products to the retailer.</p> The retail value&nbsp;chain <p>To understand how these digital solutions are reshaping retail in sub-Saharan Africa, it’s helpful to examine the business functions that each solves for. Retail businesses like Tiffany’s have a relatively straightforward value chain: retailers buy goods from upstream suppliers (inbound logistics), manage inventory and resources (operations), engage with customers (marketing), and, when they’re lucky, make sales and deliver product (sales/outbound logistics). Looking at each category of the value chain in turn, we can summarize the benefits different digital solutions provide to offline businesses looking to digitize.</p><p>Figure 1. Where different digitization solutions impact the retail value&nbsp;chain</p><p>Inbound logistics<br>The B2B marketplaces or supply chain solutions that service this part of the value chain are primarily trying to secure better pricing for retailers by aggregating demand. For example, Sokowatch in East Africa promises not only lower pricing but also financing and complete last-mile delivery to its retailers. These solutions are currently limited to FMCG, where high sales volume and commodity products make it easier to aggregate orders.</p><p>Operations<br>All of the e-commerce marketplaces provide warehousing services to eliminate the need for physical storage facilities. This is especially convenient if the retailer also pays the platform to handle fulfillment and delivery, but these services eat into margins, and many smaller businesses prefer to handle warehousing and fulfillment themselves. Businesses that sell on a marketplace are often also selling directly to customers via physical shops or social media, so the platform’s inventory tracking systems will only cover a portion of their business, reducing its&nbsp;utility.</p><p>Marketing<br>This is where digital options far outperform anything offline. A small retailer with no online presence can only market to those prospects who pass in physical proximity of the shop. Although advertising costs are low, the maximum size of the funnel is limited. But once the business starts marketing online, they can easily increase the reach of their advertising by many orders of magnitude. This is especially true of social media, where the smallest entrepreneur can put up a Facebook page and start bootstrapping eyeballs via their personal networks before transitioning to paid ad spend to “boost” their page or&nbsp;posts.</p><p>Marketplace platforms also offer substantial reach given the installed base of customers who use the site, and sellers pay to promote their products higher in the search or browsing results. One could argue that advertising dollars spent on an e-commerce platform should outperform those on social media, as customers on the former are more likely to be closer to a purchase decision, i.e. deeper in the sales funnel. But marketplace platforms can be brutally competitive for many product categories, and the structure of the market doesn’t allow for much retailer branding or other differentiation. You live and die by the transaction, with little opportunity to build a brand and a following — which is exactly what social media excel&nbsp;at.</p><p>Because standalone domains exist on the open web, they rely on driving traffic from other sources — search and social — to the domain, and therefore don’t benefit from any installed base of&nbsp;buyers.</p><p>Sales/ Outbound logistics<br>One of the bigger service offerings from both the marketplace platforms and the independent domain platforms, like Paystack Commerce, is the ability to process different kinds of payments. For some product categories and businesses this is important, but the majority of e-commerce payments in sub-Saharan Africa are still COD (cash-on-delivery).<a>[2]</a> And in markets where mobile money is popular, buyers can make non-cash payments (pre- or post-delivery) directly into mobile money wallets. So the payment processing function is most valuable only for customers who are willing to pay upfront and want to pay with a card or bank transfer.</p><p>Last-mile delivery to the customer is infamously challenging in most markets, and one of the key services that marketplace platforms offer to their sellers. But typically the delivery price is passed on to the buyer, not built into the product price. Many businesses work with local couriers or contract with new logistics platforms like Sendy in East Africa; many retailers let the customer choose a preferred logistics provider. Because most small retailers have less expensive options for delivery, paying the marketplace to handle delivery only makes sense if the retailer has sufficient volume such that the overhead of managing independent deliveries outweighs the cost&nbsp;savings.</p> Follow me for top-line&nbsp;growth <p>One helpful way to think about how each solution solves a different business function is to categorize it as impacting either (a) top-line growth or (b) bottom-line profitability. The latter category includes solutions that streamline procurement; process payments; digitize inventory management; or provide warehousing, fulfillment, and delivery services. Efficiencies in any of these can lower a retailer’s operational costs, but these will be incremental gains, especially for the smallest retailers.</p><p>On the other hand, digital advertising channels enable entrepreneurs to grow their business by reaching many more customers than they would otherwise. Social media platforms in particular allow businesses to substantially and cost-effectively increase their potential customer base, thereby scaling top-line growth and&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>In the language of unit economics, this is about very large reductions in CAC (customer acquisition costs) vs. incremental improvements to COGS (cost of goods sold). Obviously both are crucial metrics to a business, but have different implications at different stages of business maturity. For any business, reducing COGS and thereby improving margins, by say 10% can easily be the difference between break-even and profitability. But for the smallest businesses, where sales numbers are low, improving margins by 10% may not actually translate into anything meaningful in terms of absolute value.<a>[3]</a> On the other hand, if a small business can double or triple sales at a lower CAC, that revenue opens up all kinds of opportunities for staffing up or expanding the business in different ways.</p><p>Using the framing of the value chain analysis above, here’s a simple 2x2 illustrating which types of businesses are most likely to benefit from each type of digital solution. In addition to the maturity or size dimension, which as described above is a primary factor in determining the relative value of increasing reach and top-line sales vs. operational efficiencies, it plots average sales price on the other axis to serve as a proxy for the types of products and income level of the customers buying&nbsp;them.</p><p>Figure 2. The sweet spot for each type of&nbsp;solution</p><p>Social commerce occupies the lower left because it’s essentially free to use (minus paid advertising) and provides the best opportunity for growing the customer base with a lower CAC, the two most important factors for the smallest businesses. Social commerce likely has a ceiling in terms of average sale price, partly because of trust (i.e., consumers tend to place more trust in retailers on formal marketplace platforms, which may have buyer protection programs), but also as a function of how prospective buyers are most likely to search for and purchase products: Higher-income consumers are more likely to use a laptop and web-based search engines to find products, making them more likely to shop from marketplaces and standalone website domains. Lower-income consumers are more likely to only have a mobile device and spend more time within the confines of social media feeds, where social commerce&nbsp;reigns.</p><p>Ecommerce platforms like Jumia and Konga are used as sales channels by all kinds of businesses, but are most helpful to those that have grown to have multiple employees and higher sales volumes, where the operational and logistics services the platforms offer will have a greater impact on efficiency and overall profitability. Because of the additional formality and high transaction fees — Jumia sellers pay a sales commission of 10%-20% depending on the product category — vendors are less likely to focus on really low-value items, keeping the average sales prices higher than what you see with social media businesses.</p><p>Standalone domains supported by e-commerce platforms like Paystack Commerce are most appropriate for the largest businesses with the highest average sales price. Such firms already have established customer bases and are looking to control more of their brand without giving up margin to a marketplace. Because they exist on the open web, they have to drive traffic from search and social, which typically means a higher CAC and thus requires higher average sales&nbsp;prices.</p><p>Finally, B2B sourcing platforms have a hard ceiling on average sale price given that (at least in current incarnations) they are limited to FMCG and other high-volume, commodity products. The economics of bulk ordering and delivery costs mean that smaller shops with lower turnover are less likely to enroll given the expected cost benefits.</p> The future will be formalized <p>A natural question to ask is to what extent online commercial activity will migrate away from the social commerce model and toward the more formal paradigms of e-commerce marketplaces and standalone domains that are dominant in the West. I would argue that while the business logic that has the vast majority of African businesses choosing informal activity on social platforms won’t change anytime soon, those social platforms will increasingly push that economic activity into more structured and legible&nbsp;forms.</p><p>For the most part, social commerce businesses are appropriating tools designed for personal communication to use for business purposes; as such, the platforms don’t have good ways of knowing about these transactions being coordinated through their ecosystem. WhatsApp Pay and the new Facebook Shops are obvious steps toward improving the platforms’ visibility into commercial activity, and much more will come. The goal isn’t necessarily to compete head-to-head with e-commerce platforms with a fully integrated offering, but to capture enough of the activity to develop a completely new purchase behavior dataset that can be monetized via their ad engines.<a>[4]</a> Imagine advertisers being able to target their ads on Facebook to those users who have “purchased a health and wellness product for $10-$20 within the last 30 days from a seller with 5,000–25,000 followers.”</p><p>The result will be an asymmetric, top-down vs. bottom-up competition between the formal marketplaces and social media: Formal marketplaces will try to broaden their value proposition to reach lower to the smallest-scale businesses and spin the network effects flywheel, while social media will attempt to formalize its offerings, not to compete directly as a solution provider, but to develop one of the most comprehensive and valuable datasets on consumer economic activity.</p><p>The competition is asymmetric in that the two platform types have fundamentally different business models. Social media platforms, and for all intents and purposes this means Facebook, are ad-based; they make activity free in order to accumulate eyeball-hours. The marketplaces rely on the transactional revenue of the commissions they charge sellers on each sale. Put another way, the marketplaces have to make the unit economics work for each transaction on the platform, which Jumia has estimated to require something like a 10%-20% margin, a significant cost that is prohibitive to many smaller retailers.[<a>5</a>] Facebook, on the other hand, can afford to offer (a more limited set of) services for free because the resulting activity will substantially increase the value of its ad inventory. That data and resulting value may take a while to accumulate, but as <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-land-where-facebook-loses-money-d850c6593f70">I’ve argued previously</a>, Facebook can use its tremendous cash reserves from its high-ARPU user base in the West to cross-subsidize unprofitable initiatives in the Global South for as long as it needs. In any war of attrition, Facebook doesn’t&nbsp;lose.</p><p>This disconnect between Facebook’s revenue model and its consumer-facing services presents challenges not only for regulation (e.g., antitrust policy based on consumer welfare in the form of pricing), but also assessments of its net benefit to the resource-constrained populations who rely on it. As with Free Basics, its subsidized internet access initiative, Facebook’s commerce offerings provide very real value to millions of individuals with few truly affordable alternatives. Yet the long-term implications of allowing it to continue to envelop and become the de facto provider of adjacent sectors of the digital economy are&nbsp;immense.</p><p>In the context of social commerce, that risk may be under-appreciated, given that most of the commercial activity moving onto the platform was informal and unreported to begin with. The sheer size of the informal sector — an estimated <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_627189/lang--en/index.htm">86% of employment in Africa</a> — makes it a key focus for governments grappling with economic growth policies. And digitized network technology is key in state efforts to make legible the invisible, as large-scale identification and currency initiatives have shown. Yet as more informal trade moves onto and is structured by social media, we may face a future in which the most complete and accurate source of informal economic activity is held not in Abuja, Nairobi, or Pretoria, but in Menlo Park. The future of trade may indeed be formalized, but by a platform logic with a distinctly private&nbsp;agenda.</p><p>The unique market conditions of sub-Saharan Africa mean the dominant model of digital commerce that emerges won’t look like digital commerce in Southeast Asia, China, or the West. Savvy and ambitious entrepreneurs like Tiffany will continue to cobble together the services they need to grow their businesses digitally, but widespread adoption will require solutions that are accessible and affordable to a broader base of sellers. For the vast majority of these micro businesses and solo entrepreneurs, the driver of value is the ability to cost-effectively increase their reach to a wider market of customers. And if this is indeed the race, it is Facebook’s to&nbsp;lose.</p><p>Thanks for input and suggestions from Sammy Muraya (<a href="https://smkollectionz.com/">SM Kollectionz</a>), Winnie Makena (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nairobiluggagecentre/">EGD Luggage Center</a>), Sabina Naamwinbong (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/glammy_accessories/?igshid=9tca1b9naxgk">Glammy Accessories</a>), Bode Oyelami (<a href="https://www.konga.com/merchant/hekmore-systems-ventures">Hekmore Systems</a>), Mavis Dzedu (<a href="https://www.jumia.com.gh/hotfro/">Hotfro</a>), Annabel Schiff, Grace Natabaalo, Stephen Deng, and Jonathan&nbsp;Donner.</p><p>* A fictional persona. At Caribou Digital we often create composite personas to anonymize interviewees. In a prior version of this article, I used a Biblical name for the persona which I now understand could be perceived as offensive. I very much regret this oversight, and have updated the article with a new&nbsp;name.</p> Notes <p>[1] A note on scope: Many other models of digitally-enabled commerce exist, especially in China and Southeast Asia, where platforms like Pinduoduo and Go-Jek have successfully proven different operational models. While there are <a href="https://theflip.africa/newsletter/pinduoduo-social-commerce/">arguments</a> for why group purchasing, influencer-based revenue models, and other “social” practices may gain traction in sub-Saharan Africa, these are currently not widespread and thus not covered here. For simplicity, I also exclude classifieds marketplaces (e.g., <a href="https://jiji.co.ke/">Jiji/OLX</a>), which are lower-cost for the retailer but don’t offer the same range of services as formal e-commerce marketplaces.</p><p>[2] Jumia reports 65% to 95% of orders are COD; social commerce orders are even more likely to be cash <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/mea/press-releases/delivering-cashless-e-commerce-in-africa/">https://newsroom.mastercard.com/mea/press-releases/delivering-cashless-e-commerce-in-africa/</a>.</p><p>[3] This is especially true for solo entrepreneurs, where the nature of the hustle makes it difficult to accurately account for time/labor costs. Yes, opportunity costs are real, but for the smallest shops an inefficient process that takes 50% longer but is free will win out over paid services that automate or streamline the task. The cost calculations change once the business is large enough for paid&nbsp;labor.</p><p>[4] Facebook already buys purchase behavior data (including offline) from external data aggregators in order to inform its user profiling, but this would be first-party data of transactions on its platform and concretely tied to the individual’s account, so infinitely more valuable.</p><p>[5] For reference, Amazon says it averages 8%-15%; <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html#referral-fees">https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html#referral-fees</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-race-to-digitize-commerce-in-sub-saharan-africa-252b2f977c86">The race to digitize commerce in sub-Saharan Africa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> gets better all the time and our focus on delivering software development kits (SDKs) underscores our commitment to helping you build secure apps faster. Earlier this year, we talked about the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/six-reasons-why-forgerock-sdks-make-sense">Six Reasons Why ForgeRock SDKs Make Sense</a>. Today, we are pleased to announce there are now six more reasons you can count on ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/sdk">SDKs</a> to make your life easier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at SDK 2.0.&nbsp;</p>

 Reason 1: Unlock Intelligent Access 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access</a> combines Intelligent Authentication (or authentication trees) capabilities that our customers appreciate with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/self-service">Intelligent Self-Service</a> (self-service trees). Intelligent Access includes new journeys for user registration, password reset, and progressive profiling – to name just a few advanced features. With this new release, our SDKs now support Intelligent Access, effectively doubling the number of supported use cases. Now, developers using SDKs can save time and integrate authentication, registration, and self-service journeys into their apps faster than ever before.</p>

 Reason 2: Access Device Context 

  <p>ForgeRock SDKs can collect contextual information from devices (or browsers) and seamlessly integrate with the new <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/7/authentication-guide/auth-node-configuration-hints.html#auth-node-device-profile-collector">Device Profile Nodes</a> of the ForgeRock IAM Platform. Device context can be used to build sophisticated authentication journeys and detect anomalies such as deviations in previously trusted devices, geo-fence breaches, access from tampered devices, and more. By using the SDKs, you can start building better authentication journeys with device context in no time.</p>

 Reason 3: Exceptional User Experiences With Usernameless and Passwordless Authentication 

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Say goodbye to usernames and passwords with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">ForgeRock Go</a> while providing great user experiences without compromising security. Our JavaScript SDK now supports FIDO2-based strong authentication with WebAuthn. This enables you to build this secure and seamless login experience into your single-page apps (SPAs) with ease. Our SDK can help you go passwordless faster.</p>

 Reason 4: Improve Application Security 

<p>Our SDKs do more than just simplify the integration with the ForgeRock IAM Platform. They have native capabilities to improve application security by implementing industry best practices and adopting the latest technologies in the iOS and Android ecosystem. Starting with this release, the ForgeRock iOS SDK uses Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/security/sec59b0b31ff/web">Secure Enclave</a> for hardware-backed encryption and storage of tokens. When you use our SDKs, you can be sure that credentials are in good hands.&nbsp;</p>

 Reason 5: Simplify the User Experience With In-App Authenticator 

<p>Using one time passwords generated by soft tokens or push notification based approvals are great ways to improve security by introducing a second factor in the authentication flow. Traditionally however this approach comes at the cost of user experience. End users are forced to download and use a dedicated Authenticator app which introduces a lot of friction in the user experience. With the latest version of the SDK, you can now <a href="https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/SDKS/Authenticator+SDK+-+Design+Document">embed these capabilities</a> into your own mobile apps and provide your users a superior, branded and seamless authentication experience.&nbsp;</p>

 Reason 6: Secure High-Value Transactions 

<p>Great experiences and proper security during login are paramount, but your customers have come to expect, and are also looking for, that same level of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security </a>during each and every transaction. That’s why they need a Zero Trust model or Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment (CARTA). With ForgeRock SDKs you can improve security by requiring the user to perform additional verifications when engaging in a high-risk transaction or while performing an action that deviates from their normal behavior. For example, they must reauthenticate by using a second factor or respond to a push notification on their mobile device.</p>

<p>Too many companies think of privacy as a feature that can be added later. And while, yes, it is true these features can always be enhanced and evolve, when it isn’t baked into your product, it will never be the default. Privacy by Design is an approach to make sure that it is.<br></p>



<p>Originally developed by <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/pbdce/about/ann-cavoukian/">Dr. Ann Cavoukian</a>, Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, the concept of Privacy by Design was formalized in a report on privacy-enhancing technologies in 1995. Having privacy incorporated by design, and by default, means that the product or solution is designed with privacy as a priority—not an afterthought—and that becomes integral to organizational priorities, development objectives, and design processes.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Cavoukian’s main thesis was that the future of security can not and could not be assured with compliance to regulatory frameworks, but that “privacy assurance must ideally become an organization’s default mode of operation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 The 7 Foundational Principles&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://authenteq.com/privacy-by-design-and-electronic-identity-verification/">Privacy by Design (PbD)</a> has seven key principles. This is not a pick or choose, each element is as important as the next.<br></p>



 1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial 



<p>When building any product, service, or tool, companies should anticipate any and all of the ways that privacy breaches could happen before they happen. That means that PbD focuses on prevention rather than resolution. It comes before the fact, not after. This significantly reduces the potential exposure to risk associated with data breaches and also that less data is exposed in the case of a breach.<br></p>



 2. Privacy as the Default Setting 



<p>The burden never falls to the customer or user. That means that no additional steps need to be taken for them to protect their own personal data, the protection is built into the system by default. They don’t need to worry about taking extra steps because they are automatically protected.<br></p>



 3. Privacy Embedded into Design 



<p>It becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. That means the privacy embedded in your product, tool, or service is integral to the system without diminishing functionality.<br></p>



 4. Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum 



<p>There are no trade-offs in PbD. That means it is never privacy or security as if it’s not possible to have both. It also means that having both doesn’t mean that it comes at a cost to the overall functionality.&nbsp;<br></p>



 5. End-to-End Security – Full Lifecycle Protection&nbsp; 



<p>PbD means security, security, security. From start to finish, all data is securely collected, safely stored, and properly destroyed.&nbsp;</p>



 6. Visibility and Transparency in Privacy – Keep it Open&nbsp; 



<p>Accountability, openness, and compliance are required for an effective and secure system. Adding transparency to the where, how, and why of data collection and processing actually improves the overall system. This breeds confidence amongst all stakeholders that the company is following all promised procedures and keeps companies accountable.&nbsp;<br></p>



 7. Respect for User Privacy – Keep it User-Centric 



<p>Above all, the individual’s data-security should be the number one concern. People are rightly worried about their data ending up in the wrong hands. It should always be clear to them what personal information is being collected, for what purpose, and how long it will be stored. Keep their needs top of mind.</p>



<blockquote><p>Did you know?&nbsp;</p>The EU GDPR incorporates Privacy by Design. Companies who follow these principles have a far lower risk of exposure to GDPR violations and associated fines.&nbsp;</blockquote>

   Have you ever had a notification about a suspicious login attempt from a digital destination you’ve never been to? Hopefully it came with the option to say it wasn’t you, allowing you to deny access to that specific place and rebuff the user trying to sneak into your account or information. If so, you probably have token revocation to thank for the security measure.&nbsp;

<p>Have you ever had a notification about a suspicious login attempt from a digital destination you’ve never been to? Hopefully it came with the option to say it wasn’t you, allowing you to deny access to that specific place and rebuff the user trying to sneak into your account or information. If so, you probably have token revocation to thank for the security measure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token revocation means a token is no longer able to be used for access to a protected digital place, and it’s often behind the scenes in the denying process. It’s similar to session revocation in that you’re blocking access at some level, but there’s a key difference. With session revocation, you can deny one or more sessions and still access protected information. But token revocation is more permanent because it “kills” the token that might otherwise be reused for the duration of the token’s lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokens play a big role in OAuth 2.0, which is designed to protect resources from wandering or malicious hands by using tokens to securely authorize users. You could build your own method of verifying access tokens and get a decent way there with open source packages, but a ready-made solution—token introspection—is easy to use and gives you the ability to offload the work from the app team to the identity platform’s team. PingOne for Customers handles the messy job of building a token verification system by giving you an API endpoint that does the work for you on our backend. In this blog post, I’ll walk you through how to use token revocation in PingOne for Customers.</p>

At present, Wing’s TVL is around 150 million USD a very promising figure.</p><p>In addition to retaining a high TVL and providing higher returns to users in terms of APY (annual percentage yield), Wing also provides users with returns on borrowing and lending mainstream coins including ETH, USDT, DAI, and USDC, at some of the highest rates available on the DeFi&nbsp;market.</p><p>Currency — Wing Interest&nbsp;Rate</p><p>USDT — 11.97%</p><p>DAI — 11.96%</p><p>USDC — 11.97%</p><p>ETH — 11.97%</p><p>WBTC — 29.93%</p><p>TVL（Total Value Locked）/ — 134 Million&nbsp;USD</p><p>*Data Source: Borrow APYs of the above tokens are recorded from respective websites, as of 2:00 a.m. September 28, 2020&nbsp;(UTC)</p><p>Further, Wing is among the very few DeFi lending projects that has completed cross-chain integration with Ethereum assets, which has the potential to provide high yields for Ethereum assets outside of the current Ethereum ecosystem.</p> WING, Returning to a Governance Token <p>A token’s price in the secondary market is often regarded as a major indicator of its value. The day WING went live on Binance, the token instantly hit an all-time high of $300, before gradually cooled to $20. Of course, this resulted in some doubting the token’s&nbsp;future.</p><p>It’s likely that the recent hype in the DeFi market contributed to a $300 peak so quickly. These prices have, indeed, put both the Wing and Ontology teams under some pressure.</p><p>Comparisons can be drawn between WING quickly reaching a high of $300 and COMP’s experience of reaching an almost instantaneous high of $2,000 upon its release. As newly-launched projects are yet to reach proper transaction depths, an all-time high upon release is not a good indicator of its long-term price</p><p>In the long run, the market price of a token should be based on its application value and users enthusiasm around growth potential. In relation to WING as a governance token, the governance power and potential returns are substantiated by the ever-increasing TVL (Total Value Locked) on the Wing platform, as well as the transaction fees derived from interest on borrowing, lending and insuring. The Wing team believes that the value of the WING token will be more visible to community members when WING returns to its original position as a governance token.</p> Improving The Governance Model and Enriching Value <p>The Wing team greatly values feedback from the Wing DAO community..</p><p>In terms of next steps, Wing’s core development team will increase efforts in protocol implementation, product upgrades and improvements to user experience. In addition to further optimizing the Flash Pool UI, the Wing dApp will be released on ONTO, Ontology’s data wallet, at the end of September. In mid-October, a month after Wing’s official dApp launch, Wing.Finance will go through a structural upgrade that will facilitate the community governance framework and expand WING’s value in more dimensions.</p><p>As for product upgrades, in October, Wing’s core development team will submit a proposal to the Wing DAO community for a second lending pool incorporating credit, prompting Wing to venture into credit-based lending.</p> Empowering Wing with a Wing DAO-led Governance Strategy <p>As we have learned from Ontology’s positive growth history, a community-driven strategy is the cornerstone to a sustainable development of blockchain-based products. For this reason, the Wing community will remain our primary commitment in the next phase, and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Upon Wing’s launch, a series of mining activities were initiated by the <a href="http://gov.wing.finance">https://gov.wing.finance/</a> Wing team to ensure the steady growth of the ecosystem. Over the past 15 days, three proposals in the Wing DAO community were initiated with the aim of empowering Wing’s growth with a community governance approach of raising public proposals and seeking a vote from the entire community for execution.</p><p>As the governance policies formed by the three Wing DAO community proposals came to fruition, it has been great to see that the community has grown accustomed to taking governance power into their own hands. As the governance model has made a positive impact, the Wing project will prioritize a community-driven strategy in the next stage of Wing’s development. Meanwhile, we are more than happy to see community forums like <a href="https://gov.wing.fiannce/">https://gov.wing.fiannce/</a>,where members can express their opinions, and the community can gather together to brainstorm ideas. Every bit of feedback from the community is of significance to Wing’s&nbsp;growth.</p><p>A recent proposal suggested transaction fees from borrowing on WING should be bought back and burnt. The Wing team is currently looking into whether the proposal is technically feasible. If this is the case, the Wing team will initiate a fourth proposal for the community to make a final decision.</p><p>Following the Wing DAO-driven strategy, Wing will continue to adhere to an open and transparent governance structure, taking into account the community’s feedback to further improve the governance rules, simplify the process for member governance participation, perfect the governance protocol, and enable the protocol to be applied to more scenarios. We believe that as we progress, WING will be regarded as an increasingly valuable governance token.</p> Wing’s Strategic Significance to the Ontology Ecosystem <p>The success of DeFi projects requires ongoing commitment. Compound, a DeFi project released two years ago, has spent two thirds of its life in stealth mode until the unprecedented yield farming spree which took place inJune 2020. Uniswap provides us with another example of long-term users working together and remaining committed, ultimately cumulating in bountiful returns.</p><p>As the first credit-based cross-chain DeFi platform, Wing also serves as the first key project in Ontology’s DeFi ecosystem. Ontology’s decentralized identity framework (ONT ID) and decentralized data protocol (DDXF) can support users in managing their own identities and data verification, while also integrating with smart contracts to enable automatic verification of credit data and credit evaluation. A technical infrastructure such as this combined with OScore, Ontology’s credit evaluation system, makes it intrinsically possible for Wing to integrate credit data into its products.</p><p>In the next stage, Wing can be be fine-tuned to work as a crucial component of the Ontology DeFi ecosystem. We expect that more premium projects derived from Wing will emerge and enrich the ecosystem, in turn maximizing the project’s significance and value in the DeFi&nbsp;sector.</p><p>While we continuously improve our underlying infrastructure, Ontology will prioritize the development of our communities around the world. We’d like to extend our thanks to every community member who presented us with suggestions for Wing, and those who participated in Wing DAO governance in the last&nbsp;month.</p><p>Ontology is committed to continuing our efforts to optimize the governance framework, product design, and user experience of Wing. We also plan to explore more innovative DeFi products in a bid to build a bridge between DeFi and traditional finance.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/a-letter-to-the-wing-dao-community-from-jun-li-founder-of-ontology-7117c6eb41a5">A Letter to the Wing DAO Community from Jun Li, Founder of Ontology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>ITSM is going well beyond ITIL and IT ticketing these days: It’s becoming the portal and workflow platform</p>
<p>Not that long ago, ITSM (IT Service Management) was what the name means: A technology used within IT to manage IT services and facing to the end user when it comes to IT requests. IT requests led to tickets as the tasks to be performed by workers in IT. And yes, there was and is ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) describing common IT processes, there were and are Service Catalogs, and there were and are CMDBs (Configuration Management Databases).</p>
<p>However, this is changing. ITSM platforms are shifting from IT solutions to business solutions and becoming strategic tools for organizations, for service delivery (and thus service definition, service management, and so on) across a range of business functions. They have become a widely used interface for users to a wide range of services, and they support the workflows and process automation behind these interfaces.</p>
<p>With IAM providing interfaces and with workflows and processes being a vital part of every IAM, it is obvious that there is a logical link between IAM and ITSM (or the other way round).</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, in his talk will look at the journey of ITSM and where ITSM is heading. He will look at the overlaps and links between IAM and ITSM. And he will take a high-level perspective on where integration is expected to become deeper and where IAM capabilities might shift to ITSM, specifically in the context of IAM evolving from monolithic platforms to modern, microservice-based architectures that can well make use of existing ITSM services, microservices, and APIs.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive10_2020_10_01_kuppinger"></a>

<p>As the seasons change, each week on <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/podcast-main/">State of Identity</a>, we’re watching the trends in identity transition as well, especially as COVID-19 has accelerated the importance of these solutions across business landscapes. While it’s no surprise COVID unmasked itself in each episode, each guest moved past “what’s the impact” and rather dove into “what’s next” for businesses and users in the new normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We kicked off the month welcoming Jimmy Williams, Accelitas National Sales Manager at Accelitas, for a conversation centered around alternative data pertaining to access to financial services. The ways we access financial services, lending, credit, or otherwise have changed, and how to leverage alternative data for inclusion. How is Accelitas doing it?</p>
<p>“What we’ve found to be incredibly successful is consumer behavior, both at the physical point of sale as well as the virtual point of sale…because not only is it a reflection of that consumer’s spending, potential fraud, things like that, but also it’s a proxy for things like employment or payback behavior.” Tune in to learn how this data is opening up access to financial services, especially when physical documentation isn’t as accessible, and how this can be the future of establishing trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following, Christina Luttrell, Chief Operating Officer of IDology, sat down with Cameron D’Ambrosi (virtually, of course) to not just discuss the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the customer experience across industries. The conversation begins noting how they have seen a massive spike in not only the number of fraud cases but a shift in the ways they fraudsters are executing.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You know, the creativity isn’t quite there… it’s a lot of the old same old things that we’ve seen in the past. It’s just that it’s so much more. And it’s impacting demographics that normally wouldn’t be transacting digitally.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And while fraudsters will always be around, looking for ways to cause harm, this posed a broader conversation on successful, frictionless onboarding as companies see a rapid spike in users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conversation on fraud led us to wonder, is this spike an unprecedented event, like the pandemic itself? We continued the discussion with Socure Senior Counsel &amp; Privacy Lead Annie Bai, exploring why an uptick in identity fraud usually follows economic downturns, honing in on what kind of security and experiences customers expect, and how businesses – especially the financial sector – can meet them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A critical challenge that I think we need to face as an industry is can we balance these mandates of providing high levels of assurance and high levels of customer experience, with low friction, but also respecting the needs that these digital identities have with regard to inclusion?” Annie believes yes, emphasizing the importance of partnerships, alternative data, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we rounded out the month by welcoming Yoti Commercial Director Gareth Narinesingh and Synectics Solutions Head of Presales Chris Lewis, following the launch of Project Endeavor, a pilot program to revolutionize electronic digital onboarding, identity verification, and risk assessment for the financial services sector in the United Kingdom. While they’re making significant strides with this new venture, the guests closed out in making some future-focused predictions, spanning from the adoption of digital identity, to open banking, to the lasting impact of COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You’ve then got a global model, which is going to change the way that we engage digitally. But I think it’s probably not in the long term future. I think it’s medium-term future. And I think that schemes like Endeavor and many others like it are going to be big pioneers moving in that direction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re keen to see the impact Endeavor has, and if their predictions come to fruition. And while each of our guests left us with great food for thought, each took a future-focused look at the potential impacts of today’s landscape and how we can create a safer, more secure, and more inclusive world. What will the next month bring across the identity ecosystem? You’ll have to tune in each Thursday to find out!

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Whether you are a firm believer in the bright future of Artificial Intelligence or somewhat of a skeptic like me – you simply cannot ignore the great strides AI technologies have made in recent years. Intelligent products powered by machine learning are everywhere: from chatbots to autonomous vehicles, from predicting consumer behavior and detecting financial fraud to cancer diagnostics and crop harvesting. There is however a major factor limiting even further applications of AI and ML in almost any industry: AI algorithms are very computationally intensive and until quite recently, prohibitively expensive to operate “on-premises”.</p>
<p>The rise of cloud computing has given a major boost to AI technologies in recent years, and to this day, it is the cloud that powers the majority of AI applications, both for consumers and for enterprise applications. However, what works perfectly well for business analytics, language translation services or, say, virtual assistants, might be not enough for more mission-critical scenarios.</p>
<p>The Challenges of AI in the Cloud</p>
<p>The biggest challenge of cloud-based AI are potential connectivity issues: if a device is only occasionally connected to the Internet, it won’t be able to utilize cloud-based machine learning services efficiently. For real-time scenarios like self-driving cars, even the additional milliseconds of network latency can be a deal-breaker. Another major problem of cloud-based AI is the sensitivity of the information that has to be sent to the cloud for processing. Companies operating under strict regulations (which nowadays includes anyone dealing with personally identifiable information) simply cannot afford the risks for a security breach or a compliance violation fine.</p>
<p>These problems are nothing new, of course – they’ve been the biggest obstacle to adopting any cloud services for over a decade already. To address this challenge and to expand their customer base to these “not cloud-ready” companies, cloud service providers have been pushing the concept of Edge Computing. At its face value, edge computing simply means bringing computing and storage resources closer to the customer’s geographical location to reduce network latency. This has started over 20 years ago with CDNs (content delivery networks) but expanded to mobile phones, IoT devices and network gateways.</p>
<p>Nowadays, these devices are powerful enough to implement a substantial part of the cloud service stack locally, creating a distributed computing platform between corporate networks and clouds, dramatically improving response rates and reducing the strain on the core cloud infrastructure. It is important to understand that this trend does not by any means undo the achievements of the cloud model. Edge computing isn’t returning to on-prem data centers; it is simply another phase in the evolution of the cloud. Even the name itself implies it: the edge, of course, refers to the cloud, its proverbial “silver lining” …</p>
<p>In a sense, edge computing is an alternative approach towards hybrid architectures, one that tries to blur the massive divide in on-prem and cloud technology stacks and to expand the reach of cloud service providers even deeper into their customers’ networks. Bringing AI capabilities closer to their consumers is just another logical step in that direction.</p>
<p>The Future of the Intelligent Edge</p>
<p>It is well known that preparing data for machine learning and training of ML models is the part of AI that requires the most computing resources. The actual inference (i.e., putting a model to productive use) is much lighter. Optimizing ML models for running on edge devices is one of the primary methods of decoupling them from the cloud. Solutions like AI-powered antiviruses that only require updates every six months are already a reality. Simple image recognition can run directly on your mobile phone, helping you take better pictures of your food.</p>
<p>More sophisticated models require specialized hardware to run. Major semiconductor manufacturers like Intel and Nvidia and even cloud service providers themselves like AWS have specialized AI chips in their portfolios; smaller companies are offering solutions for developers to simplify and optimize the usage of this hardware. In other words, a whole ecosystem is being born, bringing AI/ML closer to customers and enabling usage scenarios previously impossible.</p>
<p>The field is still far from mature, however. Perhaps the best indication of this is a lack of standardization developments and a very fragmented market, where very few vendors can deliver a full technology and service stack to satisfy different use cases. Will we see the emergence of a standardized abstracted architecture similar to VMware or Kubernetes for traditional computing? Perhaps: companies like Run:AI are already working on AI orchestration platforms.</p>
<p>One thing is clear though: cloud AI isn’t going anywhere. For the foreseeable future, we’re going to deal with a multitude of hybrid architectures. History has a tendency to repeat itself, after all.</p>

Recently, the Freddie Mac identity team determined it was time to <a>modernize their legacy web access management (WAM)</a> infrastructure. The system was nearing end of life and presented numerous security vulnerabilities that weren’t easily remedied. But given the number of resources involved and the 400+ applications that had to be migrated, the switch to a modern identity and access management (IAM) platform would be a massive undertaking.<br>

<p>On September 22nd, the<a href="http://know.oneworldidentity.com"> KNOW Identity Digital Forum</a> took a look into the growing ways that alternative data can expand services to new customer groups as well as combat fraudulent attempts worldwide. We gathered experts in the financial services and digital identity industries to discuss inclusion and security balances in our current banking systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each session was jam-packed with unprecedented insights, but a few standout takeaways included:</p>
 
 Fraud rates have accelerated in 2020 with more and more transactions happening online as a result of COVID-19. However, regulation is still slow to catch up to or empower technologies to ward off bad actors’ tactics. 
 Openness and data sharing across governmental bodies and private institutions are going to be critical to expanding service offerings to new customer groups, such as immigrants and previously thin-file consumers. Data collected from mobile devices can also help level the playing field for previously un- or underbanked consumers.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Combating Synthetic Identity Fraud&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first session, <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/ghost-in-the-machine-combating-synthetic-identity-fraud/">Ghost in the Machine: Combating Synthetic Identity Fraud</a>, in partnership with Acuant, tackled the ever-moving target of synthetic identities. Even difficult to define, these data mashups present unique threats for companies verifying relationships between user and data attributes. In 2020, the SSA in the U.S. will be rolling out its Electronic Consent Based SSN Verification Service (eCBSV), but is this the end-all solution to stop synthetics? Jose Caldera (Chief Product Officer at Acuant), Lauren Day (Compliance and Risk Manager at Binance.US) and Chuck Christofilis (Chief Compliance Officer at CoinZoom) discuss how businesses better detect and remove synthetic identities as fraudsters adapt their strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: One solution that has come to the fore on the synthetic identity fraud front is the eCBSV that has begun to be rolled out by the Social Security Administration to allow for verification of SSN and the tying a user-submitted social to the actual issuing database. Is this a magic bullet that can end synthetic identity fraud as we know it, or do we need to continue pushing ahead in terms of identifying ways as an industry to combat synthetic fraud?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acuant: I think that thinking of any solution as a silver bullet is probably not the right way of thinking. It is the components that make that solution, they are not necessarily available to every application where identity fraud or synthetic identity fraud is present. Certainly those applications that rely on the data and the data attributes are going to benefit from it. No question about that. But then you have to deal with the consent issue. I think a lot of other practitioners may be put off by the fact that you need to get consent from your end customer to let the Social Security Administration give you permission to access that data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other countries have similar solutions, but one of the issues that they have had is that one to one relationship. It is unclear whether those databases actually maintain that relationship between the security number and the entity of the person. It is unclear whether within the database itself, there might be multiple identities associated with the same person. So that is one to end or one to one relationship has been a problem in other countries with similar solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: What are we seeing in the current fraud landscape from the bad actors? Is synthetic fraud accelerating in 2020? Does this remain as one of the favored fraud vectors?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance.US: As we move online, more and more, our transactions move online. Companies move online and we’re just going to see more and more of these fraudsters trying to get around certain controls. We’ve definitely seen an increase. On top of not only synthetic fraud, we’ve also seen a lot of classic scams that essentially trick people into giving away certain elements of their personal identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Data offers greater visibility into quantifying synthetic fraud, and potentially being able to strengthen the models being used to predict or identify current parts of the portfolio or applicants who are believed to be synthetic fraudsters. What are some of those techniques that we’re seeing success with? And what are some of those new types of data that we are leveraging successfully in this fight against synthetic fraud?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoinZoom: We’ve seen [success] specifically in potential elder abuse cases where someone is using the same device. That’s a data point. And it’s information that just a few years ago was unthinkable. Now we’re able to prevent a lot of what could potentially be elder abuse when we just see people trying to set up accounts with different people on the same device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Do you foresee any challenges from the device data from a regulatory standpoint that is often a strong indicator of fraud? What are you seeing in terms of the evolving landscape, in terms of what we have access to to help make these fraud decisions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acuant: Just a couple of years ago was when FinCEN allowed that the collection and the reporting of data had to do with devices and IP as part of the source. I think from the regulatory standpoint, there is now a recognition of the detailed aspects of those transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how are they used for prevention? I think, regulatory-wise, it is being accepted as those reportings have more information about the detailed components of those transactions. By FinCEN adding this data to their [reports], it seems to be a recognition that this data is relevant and it’s important–it’s reliable to do analysis on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Alternative Data Revolution 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shifting gears from fighting fraud to expanding services, OWI next welcomed Robin Weiss (Sr. Technology Advisor at Fidelity Investments), Schan Duff (VP of Strategy at Kiva), and Steve Polsky (Founder and CEO at Juvo) to the virtual stage for <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/alternative-data-revolution/">The Alternative Data Revolution: Fast Forward to Today’s Inclusive Lending Through Big Data &amp; AI</a>. Weiss moderated the discussion on how each company has utilized mobile data and other digital touch-points to build alternative credit files for the previously un- and underbanked and what we have learned through grappling with the repercussions of the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fidelity: How are you each using alternative data sources to broaden financial service access through your work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Juvo: What we are trying to do is using the ubiquity of mobile phones and cloud computing to build what we call a financial identity, to establish who is thought of as credit worthiness, but with a broader perspective that their financial identity starts with their everyday usage of their mobile phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That gives us a macro ability to impact a large portion of populations in the countries that we serve. We can then turn this around and create a feed to financial service providers. A data feed that effectively bridges the gap between financial services providers who don’t have information on a group of consumers and a group of consumers who are unable to access financial service to close this gap through a new source of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kiva: The thesis behind all of our work is that unbanked borrowers are not riskier borrowers. They’re not inherently uncredible. They’ve just been denied the opportunity and access to the formal financial system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Q2 2020, the United States in the height of the COVID pandemic, default rates on credit cards were somewhere near 3.8 percent or 4 percent. Over our time at Kiva, our default rates across those 90 countries, including conflict zones, is about 3.6 percent. This is lending to populations who aren’t included in credit bureaus, who don’t have bank accounts and don’t have access to formal financial services. So that experience proves to us that, in the words of William Gibson, the world is awash in credit data. In financial transaction data, it’s just not evenly distributed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fidelity: Inherent in both of your models is the fact that they are dependent on government-issued foundational identities that clearly vary from geography to geography. Can these or should they be replaced by a constellation of non-foundational identities? In other words, alternative data points to arrive at a high assurance I.D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Juvo: There’s essentially three parts that need to come together to provide someone financial services. One, you need an anchor: you need the government to step up and provide a system of identities, something you can tie into. Two, we need some form of biometrics. It’s not NSA always biometrics; that person needs to prove they are who they say they are just to eliminate fraud. Then the third piece is that we need to know that the person qualifies for the particular service they might be offered. To me, stitching these three things together is the key thing to enable someone to get access to a financial service. Juvo’s focus is on the last piece: understanding qualification and giving like a whole new group of people the ability to establish qualification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kiva: Our view at Kiva is that there will always be a role for a centralized identity issuer and that in some ways is going to be the most easy way to compliantly onboard an individual into regulated financial institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FATF, the Financial Action Task Force, which is the intergovernmental body that thinks about things like MLSE, a key compliance, has issued some really interesting guidance in the last year on the use of digital identities for compliant onboarding. Yet they leave the door open for what we’re thinking about risk-based approaches to this question. They haven’t gone as far as to say official identity is not required or is not recommended for financial sector onboarding…but I do think that it’s possible technologically to prove with a high level of assurance who a person is without reliance on an official identity. I think we’re still a little ways away from having regulators fully embrace that concept but I think it’s a conversation that if we’re serious about financial inclusion, we should be having.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity &amp; Immigrant Banking 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the final session of the day, OWI was joined by Alka Gupta (Co-Founder and Board Director of GlobaliD) to discuss how growing non-citizen or new citizen populations are able to access financial services in <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/coming-to-america-immigrant-banking-in-the-u-s/">Coming to America: Immigrant Banking in the U.S</a>. The conversation identified some of the current gaps and possible solutions in providing user-friendly services to these communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GlobaliD: For context…51 percent of [U.S.] foreign-born non-citizens are either unbanked or underbanked. Of those that are banking, 80+ percent of the immigrants are with one of five financial institutions, which means about 18 percent of them are spread across 60-70 other smaller banks or credit unions, with none of them making up more than 2 percent. Why is this happening? How do we help? What does this next chapter look like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges are three-fold. Banking has historically accepted limited forms of identity. Identity more traditionally is a driver’s license and Social Security, which many immigrants may not have. So how do we open that aperture? And many have, since government-issued I.D. vary from country to country. Banks have expanded the list, whether it’s the individual taxpayer numbers, passports, consular I.D., etc.. That’s a huge area. There is also fear. There’s just a fear of even walking into the bank. So how do we provide culturally-specific guidelines? And lastly is minimizing fees or not maximizing those types of schemes. This is frankly not true just with financial services, but also with international calling and other type of infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Where do we see the solutions coming into play? What role do we see governments playing? What role do we see nongovernmental organizations playing and what role do we see private sector players playing in solving this challenge? And where do you see the most progress being made in the near-term future?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GlobaliD: I think there’s been some progress whether it’s startups or neo-banks looking to address some of the issues we’ve talked about, there are immigrant banking focused startups. So there is a cottage industry around migrant banking, migrant tech, but we need to step back and talk about the larger ecosystem. I do believe that the more meaningful improvements are going to happen, not just from a technology perspective. In fact, I might argue that this is not about the technology. This is about the silos coming down. We do see the world opening up more and more, but at the same time, sometimes we see more and more walls going up, given the times that we’re in. I think that much of the advancement is going to need to come from…cooperation and openness, open access to data and silos coming down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also think it’s about there being more user control and portability of that data and that information. Users need to control their data. Institutions need to respect the portability of data. And those that don’t know how to either keep data secure or store cetera are better off in focusing on their core competencies and allowing more of these horizontal plays. Whether it’s the identity, the chat, the calling, et cetera, to be to be frankly, you know, built within a horizontal stack that can be leveraged across whether it’s financial services or others. I think we’re at a time where we would be all well-served to consider how it is that the user is experiencing the data, the frustrations, the frictions. We would be better served really thinking about is that just neat and cool? Or if I were a user, would I actually engage? Would I trust it? I really think that’s what this next chapter is about and why I am so passionate about this space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s Next? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s always more to dive into (we recommend you <a href="http://know.oneworldidentity.com">secure your seat</a> at our next digital event now,) and we’re looking forward to seeing how the industry drives further inclusion in financial services through this data.

Also, multiple swaps were listed on Wing, including ETH/pETH, DAI/pDAI, and WING/pWING.</p><p>Events</p>  From September 2nd-4th, Ontology co-organized the event ‘Cointelegraph China’s DeFi Marathon’. On September 2nd, Jun LI, Founder of Ontology, addressed the audience during “Ontology: Empowering DeFi with Credit” and joined a panel discussion themed “Public Chain’s Choice amid DeFi Pressure”. He stated, “By empowering DeFi with credit, we are poised to build the next ‘Super-Oracle’”. In addition, during the event, Erick Pinos, Americas Ecosystem Lead, was engaged in a discussion with the lead of Aave, as well as other renowned projects.  On September 4th, Jun LI, Founder of Ontology, participated in a live AMA panel hosted by HyperPay on the topic of “Braving the DeFi-spurred Storm: Where Will Public Chains Head”. During the panel discussion, he unveiled Ontology’s blueprint for DeFi, and briefed the community users on the innovative and transformative features of&nbsp;Wing.  On September 18th, Jun LI took part in a panel discussion themed “Prospects of Decentralized Finance” at 2020 International Fintech Innovation Conference (IFIC) in Shanghai. During the panel discussion, Li stated that should Ontology wish to stand out in the DeFi industry, while avoiding the transaction-fee issue as faced by Ethereum, it needs to work harder on its strategy to support different fees in scenarios of different technical complexities.  On September 3rd, Kendall MAO, Dean of Ontology Institute, discussed the dilemma posed by DeFi to public chains at a SheKnows live panel. The panel was organized by 8BTCnews, along with representatives from Bytom Blockchain. Kendall mentioned, “Wing, Ontology’s latest cross-chain DeFi project, is integrated with the element of credit. We believe that a dynamic integration with the OScore system will create new paradigms for DeFi innovations, thus opening up new opportunities for Ontology.”<br> <br>Recruitments<br>- Solution Architect<br>- Business Sales<br>- Global Development Manager<br>- Global Marketing Manager<br>- Social Media Associate<br>- Product Manager<br>- Product Operations<br> <br>New Team Members<br>- 1 Marketing Intern <br> <br>Contact Us<br>- Contact us: <a href="mailto:contact@ont.io">contact@ont.io</a><br>- Apply now: <a href="mailto:careers@ont.io">careers@ont.io</a>   Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-monthly-report-september-2020-3c9c1af617d7">Ontology Monthly Report — September 2020</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The market capitalization of stablecoins reached $20.62 billion, Stablecoin regulatory policy of the United&nbsp;States <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1915489812">https://bihu.com/article/1915489812</a></p><p>Original publish time: September 30,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   The market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $757 million to $20.62&nbsp;billion.  Last week, the circulation of USDT, USDC, and DAI increased by 150 million, 334 million, and 213&nbsp;million.  OCC issued the regulations on stablecoins for the first time, confirming that the Commonwealth Bank can provide custody services for legal-collateralized stablecoins.  The bank has the right to deposit reserves of certain ‘stablecoin’, which refers to stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency.  The Bank verifies at least once a day that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with&nbsp;issuers.  FinHub encourages all parties involved in the construction and sale of digital assets to contact FinHub through the official website to help them ensure that such digital assets comply with the Federal Securities Act. If appropriate, a ‘no action’ position will be considered.   1.

Stablecoin Regulatory Policy of the United&nbsp;States <p>As early as June, the OCC issued a ‘pre-notification of the proposed rulemaking’, asking the public to weigh how to use cryptocurrency and other financial technology tools in the financial sector before August 3. Several banks have indicated that they may be interested in providing crypto custody and other services to customers. Dominic Venturo, the chief digital officer of the National Association of American banks, said in response that the OCC should distinguish between utility tokens, stablecoins, and Exchange platform&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Last week, the OCC issued regulations on stablecoins, confirming that the Commonwealth Bank can provide custody services for legal-collateralized stablecoins. This is the first time the OCC has issued regulations regarding stablecoins. The OCC is a federal agency responsible for overseeing the implementation of laws related to the National Bank and supervising the Federal Bank and the agencies of foreign banks. Subsequently, the SEC FinHub Staff stated that it could consider adopting a ‘no action’ position on specific digital asset activities under appropriate circumstances.</p> The OCC released regulations on stablecoins for the first&nbsp;time <p>On September 21, the OCC issued a press release and subsequent explanatory letter stating that banks have the right to deposit certain ‘stablecoins’ reserves. The stablecoin mentioned here specifically refers to stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency and does not include other stablecoins backed by commodities, cryptocurrencies, or other assets. The demand for stablecoins is increasing day by day, with multiple applications, such as large-scale transfers, which have great potential. Two technologies for realizing cryptocurrency, encryption technology and distributed ledger technology, are developing rapidly.</p><p>The National Bank has a clear authorization to accept deposits, which is also the core business of the bank. Certain stablecoin issuers may also wish to deposit the cash reserves supporting their issuance of stablecoins in the National Bank. As long as stablecoin issuers can effectively manage risks and comply with relevant laws (including the ‘Bank Secrecy Law’ and anti-money laundering laws), banks can provide services for their legitimate businesses, including cryptocurrency businesses. Therefore, banks may obtain deposits from stablecoin issuers, including stablecoin reserve deposits related to custodian wallets.</p><p>Like other deposits, stablecoin reserves are also subject to laws and regulations related to deposit insurance coverage. The stablecoin reserve account can be the deposit of a stablecoin issuer or the deposit of a single stablecoin holder. Banks and the FSA should provide accurate and appropriate disclosures on deposit insurance coverage to ensure compliance with the BSA and other regulations, including but not limited to the customer due diligence under the BSA, customer identification requirements under the Patriot Act, requirements under the Federal Securities Act, and identification of the beneficial owners of the accounts&nbsp;enabled.</p><p>Reserves related to stablecoins may bring significant liquidity risks. New banking activities should be developed and implemented under sound risk management principles, and banks should establish appropriate risk management procedures for the development of new businesses. OCC hopes that all banks manage liquidity risks at the same level as the risks they assume. The protocol between the bank and the stablecoin issuer may include restrictions or requirements for holding assets in the reserve account, and the protocol may stipulate the responsibilities of the parties. For example, the bank should sign an appropriate protocol with the issuer to ensure that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with issuers. The agreement should include a mechanism for the bank to periodically check the amount of outstanding stablecoin.</p><p>To summarize, national banks are authorized to deposit stablecoin reserves, subject to the following restrictions:</p><p>Only support stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency.<br>The Bank verifies at least once a day that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with issuers.<br>Banks should establish appropriate risk management procedures for the development of new businesses.<br>Banks must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.<br>Banks must establish appropriate control measures and conduct adequate due diligence.<br>The bank must confirm the beneficial owners of the accounts&nbsp;enabled.</p> The Statement of&nbsp;SEC <p>After the OCC issued the explanatory letter, the SEC FinHub Staff issued a statement.</p><p>According to the Federal Securities Law, whether a specific digital asset (including stablecoins) should be considered security depends on actual conditions. The nature of the asset needs to be carefully analyzed, including the right to hold the asset and how to provide and sell the&nbsp;asset.</p><p>SEC FinHub believes that as long as it meets the relevant registration, reporting, and other requirements of the Federal Securities Law, market participants may construct and sell digital assets in a way that does not constitute securities. However, the terms used to describe digital assets or financial activities involving digital assets may not be consistent with the definitions of SEC in relevant laws and regulations. FinHub encourages all parties involved in the construction and sale of digital assets to contact FinHub through the official website to help them ensure that such digital assets can comply with the Federal Securities Act. FinHub staff will always be ready to assist participants. If appropriate, a ‘no action’ position will be considered.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

 The GiD Report#128 — What the Apple App Store backlash tells us about this moment in&nbsp;time <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-127-amid-tiktok-deal-ray-dalio-explains-chinas-differences-58c5cab76639">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  The era of David v.&nbsp;Goliath  The era of moderation  Stuff happens   1. I’ll just talk about two main things this week — both of which speak to the moment that we are currently in. The first is the Apple App Store backlash. <p>It’s worth noting — it’s still pretty unclear how any of this plays out. Apple is in a strong position in terms of its loyal user base, the quality of its products and ecosystem, and also possibly in the eyes of the law (disclaimer: I am not a lawyer). It’s Apple’s App Store and Apple gets to call the&nbsp;shots.</p><p>Plus, I’ve been an iPhone user since the 5S and I don’t see myself switching anytime soon. (Not that it would make a huge difference since Google — aside from allowing you to access apps outside the Play Store, essentially follows the same type of&nbsp;model.)</p><p>And Apple has taken criticism before from disgruntled developers.</p><p>But what all of this shows is that this time, it’s different.</p>Photo: Fortune Global&nbsp;Forum<p>Whatever you want to call it — the establishment, the status quo, Big Tech monopolies — people have never been more distrustful and/or critical of the large institutions that rule over us. As one of the world’s largest multinational corporations with a market cap of ~$2 trillion, Apple easily falls into that&nbsp;camp.</p><p>That distrust has been brewing for some time, but for the most part, I’m not sure people had a real sense of belief that things could change. It’s Apple. What are you going to do about&nbsp;it?</p><p>That’s what makes this moment different — the growing sense of belief that change is suddenly possible. It’s not just about Apple and the App Store, either. You don’t have to look around very much to see that this moment applies to everything — our platforms, our politics, our society in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney certainly senses the moment. His latest coalition is a call to&nbsp;arms.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/technology/apple-google-coalition-epic-match-spotify.html">NYTimes&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>For months, complaints from tech companies against Apple’s and Google’s power have grown&nbsp;louder.</blockquote><blockquote>Spotify, the music streaming app, criticized Apple for the rules it imposed in the App Store. A founder of the software company Basecamp attacked Apple’s “highway robbery rates” on apps. And last month, Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued Apple and Google, claiming they violated antitrust rules.</blockquote><blockquote>Now these app makers are uniting in an unusual show of opposition against Apple and Google and the power they have over their app stores. On Thursday, the smaller companies said they had formed the Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit group that plans to push for changes in the app stores and “protect the app economy.” The 13 initial members include Spotify, Basecamp, Epic and Match Group, which has apps like Tinder and&nbsp;Hinge.</blockquote><blockquote>“They’ve collectively decided, ‘We’re not alone in this, and maybe what we should do is advocate on behalf of everybody,’” said Sarah Maxwell, a spokeswoman for the group. She added that the new nonprofit would be “a voice for&nbsp;many.”</blockquote><p>What the coalition is fighting&nbsp;for:</p><blockquote>At the heart of the new alliance’s effort is opposition to Apple’s and Google’s tight grip on their app stores and the fortunes of the apps in them. The two companies control virtually all of the world’s smartphones through their software and the distribution of apps via their stores. Both also charge a 30 percent fee for payments made inside apps in their&nbsp;systems.</blockquote><blockquote>App makers have increasingly taken issue with the payment rules, arguing that a 30 percent fee is a tax that hobbles their ability to compete. In some cases, they have said, they are competing with Apple’s and Google’s own apps and their unfair advantages.</blockquote><blockquote>On Thursday, the coalition published a list of 10 principles, outlined on its website, for what it said were fairer app practices. They include a more transparent process for getting apps approved and the right to communicate directly with their users. The top principle states that developers should not be forced to exclusively use the payments systems of the app store publishers.</blockquote><p>Reality check: At best, this is simply the beginning of a movement that is fundamentally a story of David v. Goliath. Despite the success of Fortnite, Apple is still 200x the size of Epic Games. And more recently, Apple’s has centered the narrative of the company’s future around “services.” Expect Tim Cook to stand his&nbsp;ground.</p><p>And the Goliaths of the world have been steadfast and reaping the rewards for some&nbsp;time.</p><p>But like I said, this time, it’s different:</p><blockquote>Scrutiny of the largest tech companies has reached a new intensity. The Department of Justice is expected to file an antitrust case against Google as soon as next week, focused on the company’s dominance in internet search. In July, Congress grilled the chief executives of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook about their practices in a high-profile antitrust hearing. And in Europe, regulators have opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple’s App Store tactics and are preparing to bring antitrust charges against Amazon for abusing its dominance in internet commerce.</blockquote><p>Grab some popcorn. Whatever happens, it’s a bit thrilling that the Davids of the world are starting to believe again,&nbsp;no?</p><p>In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://appfairness.org/">the coalition’s site here</a>, where they <a href="https://appfairness.org/our-vision/">outline their 10 principles</a>.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-opens-new-fight-with-apple-over-messaging">Facebook Opens New Fight With Apple Over Messaging</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage">Justice Dept.

The second thing we’ll highlight this week is really about the challenges of operating a platform in this current climate. Which is sort of a catch-22 seeing as the nature of our platforms have themselves deeply contributed to where we’ve ended up. Just look at Facebook. <p>And I’m not talking about the Facebook that you and I use. I’m talking about the internal Facebook that Facebook employees use.</p><p>Ina Fried:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: As political arguments on Facebook’s employee discussion boards have grown more heated and divisive, the company ordered new restrictions on the forums earlier this month, which run on Facebook’s Workplace platform.</blockquote><blockquote>Last week, the company banned employees from replacing their profile photos on the system with activist&nbsp;images.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Facebook’s difficulty managing its own employees using its own social network suggests that the company’s problems might be rooted more in the conception and design of its products than in the fiery state of today’s public discourse.</blockquote><blockquote>Catch up quick: Facebook, like most Silicon Valley companies, has long prided itself on an open culture embracing free debate, epitomized by regular staff meetings where CEO Mark Zuckerberg answers employee questions.</blockquote><p>Mark’s solution has been to create “dedicated spaces&nbsp;… for discussing charged topics, with clear rules and strong moderation.”</p><p>Which makes you wonder — how will that make Facebook think about actual Facebook? The difference, of course, is that divisive engagement internally is bad because it makes the company dysfunctional. But divisive engagement on Facebook proper, despite contributing to a more dysfunctional society, is super aligned with their core ad-based business&nbsp;model.</p><p>Because what we’re learning — and frankly, what people have intuitively known for some time — is that the engagement that these platforms promote is probably not that&nbsp;great:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: What’s bugging so many Facebook workers is the same problem some of Facebook’s 3 billion users identified a long time&nbsp;ago.</blockquote>  By shunting so many different dimensions of our online communications onto the same platform — from school connections to family members and workplace acquaintances to people with shared interests — Facebook makes it impossible to keep different facets of our lives from overlapping.  <blockquote>The scholar Danah Boyd popularized the phrase “context collapse” to describe the tendency of social networks to flatten our&nbsp;lives.</blockquote>  Now that dynamic is pushing Facebook, which has staked out a content moderation policy that treads lightly on limiting political speech in public, to curtail the political speech of its own employees.  <blockquote>The catch: Facebook’s internal moderators will now have to figure out how to draw a clean line between “charged topics” and everything else.</blockquote><blockquote>Everything Facebook touches today has a political dimension, and everything from user interface design to machine-learning code to marketing materials has social and political dimensions that can trigger “charged” exchanges.</blockquote><p>I’m not going to put too much blame on Facebook for this one. They’re figuring things out along with the rest of us. But it certainly raises a bunch of important questions as we look to build the&nbsp;future.</p><p>And in an age when every company is also a messaging company (see: Zoom, below), these are questions that every platform will need to ask itself (and in a way, they’ll be able to come at it from a different perspective since companies like Zoom and Discord aren’t built on ad-based business&nbsp;models.)</p><p>Because how do we want to shape the incentives that define our communities such that we can constructively evolve as a&nbsp;society?</p><p>In any case, the road ahead won’t be easy or straightforward.</p><p>Certainly <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-13a2568e-e823-475a-88b8-eb370237d273.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">not for Facebook</a>:</p><blockquote>A group of high-profile Facebook critics on Friday announced the launch of what they are calling the “Real Facebook Oversight Board.” As Sara Fischer reports, it’s an effort that aims to counter an independent board established by Facebook last year to oversee its decisions on content moderation.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: The opposing effort represents how political the fight between Facebook and its critics has become in the lead-up to the presidential election.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: The group includes leaders from the Stop Hate for Profit boycott, like Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, and Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, as well as prominent Facebook critics like Roger McNamee and some journalists and&nbsp;pundits.</blockquote><p>So yeah, tomorrow’s presidential debate will be interesting.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/zoom-invests-in-big-messaging-upgrade-in-challenge-to-slack">Zoom Invests in Big Messaging Upgrade in Challenge to&nbsp;Slack</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/opinion/2020-election-security-tech.html">America’s Tech Billionaires Could Help Protect the Election.

  <p>Suddenly, everybody was home. You became a homeschool teacher and you learned how to host a corporate happy hour over Zoom. Your new puppy started making guest appearances in your team calls. You downloaded a new app to deliver your groceries. Covid-19 impacted the entire world as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">online apps and services</a> became our primary way to get things done.</p>

<p>Businesses had to figure out how to serve their <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">customers</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">employees</a> remotely as much as possible through new channels at unprecedented scale, regardless of age and geography, and quickly realized the importance of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/connect-everyone">digital experiences</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now the question is when will things get back to “normal?” What will normal even be? And will our new digital habits stick?</p>

 
 


 The New Normal – Living Life Online 

<p>ForgeRock just completed a global survey that captures how the pandemic is affecting consumer behavior. Here are four key <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/112234584/infographic/new-normal-infographic.png">findings</a>:&nbsp;</p>

  Nearly half of all consumers polled say they will use more online services even with things return to normal. 
	 The second point, which should be a warning, is that more than one-third (35%) say a difficult <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">log-in process</a> would cause them to cancel their account, while 32% said they would look for another service. 
	 Third, consumers 65 and older are really embracing the new digital lifestyles, with 31% saying they will only shop online when this is all over. 
	 Finally,&nbsp; this shift isn’t just among retirees.&nbsp;A&nbsp;third of consumers ages 18-24 say they won’t go back to stadiums or theatres, instead they’ll keep watching sports, concerts, and movies online. 
 <p>So, about that new normal, while no one knows exactly what’s next, it’s clear that we have very low tolerance for poor digital experiences and will, without hesitation, switch to apps and services that deliver easy, productive user<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity"> </a>experiences. This provides the greatest opportunity for businesses to thrive through any disruption.</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/112194411/industry-brief/forgerock-consumer-behavior-report-the-new-normal.pdf">report</a> for great insight into what consumers have to say about their online experiences and how their behavior is changing now and in the future. And, don’t forget to keep an eye out for more insights from ForgeRock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even before 2020, digital transformation initiatives were monopolizing the attention of most enterprises. Lines of business were attempting to outmaneuver the competition with experiences that would win customer loyalty and steal market share. IT departments were focusing on access and data security and technical enablement of the initiatives. And compliance departments were striving to ensure adherence to GDPR, CCPA and other regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then earlier this year the pandemic appeared. Suddenly, everyone was working from home and any customers still physically interacting with brands shifted to 100% digital—or very close to it. Organizations with five-year digital transformation plans have been forced to get their digital infrastructure in order much faster than previously anticipated.</p>

  <p>This month we announced some exciting enhancements to ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">Identity Cloud</a>. All of the updates we make to our platform are done with your realities and requirements in mind. The year 2020 has taken a toll on many businesses all over the world, and this has put increasing pressure on IT teams. Our customers are seeing online traffic like never before.&nbsp;The journey towards <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> has been turbo-charged as we move through the pandemic and prepare for what’s next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizations are doing everything they can to go digital while prioritizing the delivery of&nbsp; exceptional user experiences. At the same time, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security</a> and trust remain critical to keep customers, partners, and employees safe online and in person. And while there is a big rush to the cloud, firms may be struggling with how to do it safely, securely, and without disrupting business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As companies weigh their cloud decisions, they are starting to raise critical questions about commonly held myths regarding cloud migration: Is the cloud really less secure and compliant? Does everything have to go to the cloud? Is it more expensive?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: The answer is absolutely not. We busted these myths last week during <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-live">Identity Live: Cloud Edition</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To kick off our event, ForgeRock CEO Fran Rosch and retired U.S. General and KKR partner David H. Petraeus discussed the CIA’s journey to the cloud, which began in 2013. At one time, security was one of the main reasons that many organizations elected not to adopt cloud solutions. Today, security is one of the many benefits of the cloud due to the scale of investment in security that cloud service providers have made – investments far beyond the scope of individual organizations. Knowing that the CIA has trusted the cloud for nearly 10 years reinforces this point.</p>

<p>While many companies have cloud-first strategies, we recognize that not all workloads are created equal. We were excited to chat with Amol Kabe, senior director of product management at <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/partner/google-cloud">Google Cloud</a>, about the need for choice and flexibility. We’re here to help our customers embrace the power of the cloud and also work within their own <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/multicloud-hybrid-cloud-identity-solution">hybrid</a> realities. We polled the Identity Live audience and found that 80% expect to remain in a hybrid cloud world for at least five more years. On premises, your cloud, or our cloud – we will make it work for you.</p>

<p>We will keep working to enable excellent digital experiences. General Petraeus believes the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">login</a> experience will be a differentiator, and we could not agree more. Personalization matters. Ease of use matters. Security matters. The outcome for a great user experience? It’s pretty simple. Do it fast, do it right, and do it now. We understand the need for a superior experience and, at the same time, ensure that this will not diminish security in any way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also had the pleasure of hearing from Daryl Robbins, senior director of global architecture at Calabrio about their journey to the cloud. One of the reasons Calabrio chose ForgeRock to manage their 1.3 million digital identities is because of our full tenant isolation security capability. With ForgeRock, they never have to worry about their data being commingled with other customer data. From the administrator login screen to API endpoints and from the data to the application stack itself, there is no data traversal across those planes. We live, breathe, and sleep security, and we pledge to do that for you and all our customers. While we securely manage their IAM, Calabrio can focus on building incredible experiences for their customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock delivers simple truths – with no surprises. Moving to the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud</a> does not have to be more expensive. Having an unplanned uptick in traffic should not be costly. In times of uncertainty, we’ll provide you with more certainty. If you’re experiencing Black Friday-like numbers every day, we are here to help you <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/ten-iam-capabilities-to-support-remote-work">scale up</a> &nbsp;– at no additional expense to you.</p>

<p>Cloud without compromise. Great experiences. No surprises. That’s what ForgeRock delivers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We know that you’re facing immense pressure to adapt and respond to a new normal. We are here to help you plan your IAM future along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks to all of our customers and partners for attending Identity Live: Cloud Edition!&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to revisit the action from our event? Watch each of the replays <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-live">here</a>. </p>

   Access management and access governance in many companies are still largely based on traditional authorization concepts. Thus defining and thinking access management is often rooted in a rather one-dimensional paradigm.

September 23, 2020, <a href="https://www.fintechaustralia.org.au/fintech-australia-is-proud-to-announce-the-2020-finnies-finalists/">FinTech Australia announced the finalists</a> for this year’s Finnies. The Finnies recognise and reward the Australian FinTech community by honouring innovation, growth and collaboration.




 




For <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a>, collaboration is at the heart of everything we do. We’re humbled (and a little excited) to be a finalist in the “Excellence in Industry Collaborations &amp; Partnerships” category.




 




Our submission was based on our partnerships in Belgium with <a href="https://www.kbc.be/particulieren/nl.html">KBC Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.kbcbrussels.be/retail/en/information/bank-with-kbc-brussels.html?s_kwcid=AL!10117!3!184845854352!e!!g!!kbc%20brussels&amp;TYPE=ga&amp;CID=pa_crs_AO_na_kbc-brussels_44591477710&amp;PLA=na_na_adw_na_na_brand&amp;CRE=184845854352_na_na_na&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9bLXlteE7AIVD1dgCh3y8gyqEAAYASAAEgLC8PD_BwE">KBC Brussels</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.be/particuliers/fr.html">CBC Bank</a>. As an Australian FinTech, we’re thrilled to have&nbsp;forged this partnership along with expanding our operations into Belgium and establishing a team on the ground.




 




KBC was recently voted the most valuable brand in Belgium for the 5th consecutive time, along with also being voted the best Digital Bank for 2019. Known for digital innovation, KBC has created an eco-system of value added services for customers, all available from within their mobile banking app.<br><br>In December 2019, three of KBC’s retail bank brands added the <a href="https://www.kbc.be/particulieren/nl/product/betalen/zelf-bankieren/met-je-smartphone/mobile/digitale-kluis.html">“Digital Safe powered by Meeco”</a>. A secure data enclave that enables customers to capture, store and share personal data and documents. Available in four languages (Dutch, French, German and English) and leading the way in customer data privacy and personal data mobility.




 




Despite the global challenges of 2020, our engineering teams in Australia and Belgium have been focussed on making Meeco’s technology available to more partners. <a href="https://dev.meeco.me">Our APIs and SDKs</a> will soon be available in Australia, to support the Consumer Data Right, in the same way we have been helping our European partners with GDPR and Open Banking.




 




We would also love to give a shout out to our newest partners developing amazing application powered by Meeco. <br><br>Starting with <a href="https://miks-it.com">mIKs-it</a> “The safe multimedia app for kids”. mIKs-it is a protected space for kids to experience play and joy through photos, videos and audio. Enabling kids and their trusted grown-ups to safely connect to daily life always with complete privacy.  mIKs-it is being developed in <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/meeco-announces-kidtech-partnership-with-heder-to-co-develop-safe-media-platform-for-kids/?_thumbnail_id=2975">partnership with Heder VZW</a> in Belgium, and will launch in December 2020.




 




Closer to home, Meeco is privileged to have been selected by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pam-moorhouse-8a6aa516/">Pam Moorhouse</a>, founder and CEO to provide the privacy, security and consent platform for <a href="https://mylifecapsule.com.au">My Life Capsule</a>. My Life Capsule empowers family connection &amp; organisation across multiple generations, relieving day-to-day and time-critical administration. It helps families capture and share memories, important information and data assisting with the emotional and logistical requirements at every stage of life.




 




The Finnies category winners will be announced at the virtual ceremony on Wednesday 28 October (AEST).  Also, <a href="https://www.stoneandchalk.com.au">Stone &amp; Chalk</a> in Sydney, will be hosting a special <a href="https://events.humanitix.com/stone-and-chalk-and-fintech-australia-presents-finnies-2020">in-person event on the night</a>.




 





<blockquote>“We are thrilled with the&nbsp;quality of applications and the finalists, which are a testament of the growth, and strength of the fintech ecosystem.&nbsp;We are excited to celebrate the hard-fought achievements of the ecosystem at this year’s Finnies”&nbsp;<p></p>Rebecca Schot-Guppy, CEO, FinTech Australia</blockquote>




This will be the first virtual Finnies event, starting at 18:00 AEST on October 28. People will be able to watch from home, which means our team in Belgium can also join in the celebrations. 




 




From all of us at Meeco, huge congratulations to all the wonderful finalists. <br>




 




It’s an honour to be counted in such great company, thank you!

					 <p>Digital identity has advanced over time, most recently culminating in self-sovereign identity (SSI). In this Trinsic Basics post, we are going to briefly cover the different models of digital identity and how SSI is the next step in the digital identity evolution. The content in this post is inspired by a <a href="https://medium.com/evernym/the-three-models-of-digital-identity-relationships-ca0727cb5186">blog post</a> written by digital identity expert Timothy Ruff in 2018.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Model #1: Siloed identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The first model of digital identity is the siloed model, and its name describes exactly how it works. In the siloed approach, in order to interact with another company or institution digitally, you must open an account, typically with a username and password. Through this process, the company becomes your identity provider. Over time, you’ll end up managing hundreds of accounts from hundreds of identity providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your identity provider stores your username and password and other personal data in large data silos. In other words, your personal data is stored with all of the other customers’ personal data in one central location controlled by the company.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The siloed model is broken because it is:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Centralized. You are not in control of your digital identity—the company or institution is. If they choose to block your account or if they shut their doors, your account, along with all of your data, would be gone.  Not secure. Data silos are gold mines for hackers since they essentially only have to crack one silo to gain access to the personal data of a lot of people. Besides this, account security usually relies on a username and password, and research shows that people do not typically create secure passwords and often use the same username and password for many of their accounts.  Poor user experience: How many times have you forgotten your password and had to recreate it? Having so many different accounts with (supposedly) unique usernames and passwords has led to a frustrating customer experience when trying to access services digitally.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Model #2: Federated identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Digital identity advocates saw the flaws of siloed identity and sought to create a more user-centric approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of every company needing to be its own identity provider, anyone could be an identity provider! You could, theoretically, be your own identity provider! But ultimately, this approach to “federated identity” was taken over by big tech companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although we may not be familiar with the term, we are all very familiar with how federated identity works. The most common federated identity example is the “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook.” With federated identity, large tech monoliths act as middlemen between you and the company you are interacting with digitally. Instead of the company managing your identity data, the middlemen do.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Although the federated identity model improves the user experience, it too suffers from some problems:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Reliance: In this model, technology monoliths provide us a digital existence. Instead of being independent and in control, we subject ourselves to the whims of the middleman. This has led to anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior that is problematic.  Universality: Logging in with Facebook might work for buying shoes or signing up for a newsletter. But business tools, regulated industries (financial, healthcare, government), and privacy-focused industries will never accept your personal social media account as authentication because it has almost no assurance—anyone can create multiple Google accounts with ease.  Surveillance: When you login with Facebook, Google, or some other service, you give that middleman more data points they can use to track and spy on you so that they can increase their revenue. Interests are fundamentally not aligned between people and the middleman.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Model #3: Self-sovereign identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Various approaches have been tried over the years to put individuals in more control of their identity, but they’ve struggled to get adopted. Finally, self-sovereign identity appears to be the solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Various technical innovations including blockchain, <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-digital-wallets/">digital wallets</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">DIDs</a>, and more gave rise to a new, decentralized identity that not only improves the user experience but also the security of the internet. SSI can be summed up as a movement that claims digital identity should be just as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>With SSI, you’re your own identity provider because, as an individual, you have a human identity! Nobody gave you your real-world identity, so likewise, you don’t need someone to give you a digital one. Instead, you control the information that makes up your identity information as well with whom you share that information with. For the first time ever online, SSI makes it so that you interact as a “peer” with other people, organizations, and more.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Trinsic is the easiest way to implement SSI 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>At Trinsic, we are trying to make this third model of digital identity a reality. Our company’s mission is to make the world and its services more accessible by making self-sovereign identity more accessible. We’ve done that by creating the world’s most advanced SSI platform.

 Daimler Mobility Partners With Ontology To Leverage High-Performance Technologies and Transform the Driving Experience  With Ontology’s decentralized blockchain solutions, drivers can enjoy a suite of new, highly-secured digital driving services! <p>Singapore — 24 September 2020 — In a move that will transform the experience of drivers all over the world, the <a href="https://www.daimler-mobility.com/en/">Daimler Mobility AG</a> Blockchain Factory, which was set up to bring the benefits of blockchain innovation and application to the automotive finance and mobility industry, is partnering with <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, open-source blockchain specializing in digital identity and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today, at Daimler’s <a href="https://startup-autobahn.com/">Startup Autobahn EXPO Day</a>, a live event bringing together the most innovative minds in mobility solutions, the companies unveiled the fruits of their first collaboration — ‘Welcome Home’, a self-sovereign in-car personalization and management solution.</p><p>Daimler Mobility AG’s Blockchain Factory and Ontology have joined forces to develop MoveX, a first-of-its-kind blockchain-based mobility platform for the automotive and mobility industry. Utilizing ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, MoveX will empower user roaming, bundling, and sharing, as well as facilitate the integration of services across providers — one of the main barriers for adoption.</p><p>Welcome Home, the first product on the MoveX platform, solves the trade-off for users who want to have highly personalized experiences and diverse service integrations while also preserving their data privacy and control. The Welcome Home solution will not only be applicable to in-car experiences but to any smart device as they are becoming increasingly intelligent, connected and data-rich.</p><p>Commenting on the partnership, Andy Ji, Co-founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a> stated, “In choosing to partner with Ontology, Daimler Mobility has demonstrated its commitment to innovation and to leveraging advanced emerging technologies such as ONT ID which deliver the best possible experience for drivers around the world.

 The market capitalization of stablecoins reached $19.86 billion, The latest development of several decentralized stablecoin protocols <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1485006994">https://bihu.com/article/1485006994</a></p><p>Original publish time: September 22,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   The market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $1.334 million to $19.86&nbsp;billion.  Last week, 1 billion USDT migrated from Tron to Ethereum. Besides, Tether additionally issued 500 million USDT on Tron twice and 150 million USDT on Ethereum.  From September 13th to 20th, the supply of DAI rose from $475 million to $800 million, an increase of&nbsp;71%.  Pickle developed the feature using Ethereum and stablecoin exchange pairs as LP Tokens to aggregate mining in&nbsp;Uniswap.  On September 20, the one-day transaction volume in Curve set a record of $519&nbsp;million.  After the SWRV lower the inflation rate, the total lock-up volume in Swerve was less than $20&nbsp;million.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(September 12, 2020 ~ September 18, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $1.334 million to $19.86&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past week, the circulation of USDT has increased by 650 million. 1 billion USDT migrated from Tron to Ethereum. Besides, Tether additionally issued 500 million USDT on Tron twice and 150 million USDT on Ethereum. The circulation of USDC increased by 260 million, and the circulation of DAI increased by 230 million. The circulation of PAX, BUSD, TUSD, and GUSD increased by 23.59 million, 93.97 million, 77.86 million, and 1.35 million. The circulation of HUSD decreased by 1.39&nbsp;million.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last week, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all increased by&nbsp;104,702.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT, USDC, TUSD, and DAI increased by 90,882, 7,319, 570, and 5,947. The number of holding addresses of PAX decreased by&nbsp;16.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last week decreased by an average of 2.43% compared to the previous&nbsp;week.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins decreased by an average of&nbsp;1.18%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last week decreased by an average of 0.71% from the previous&nbsp;week.</p> 2. The latest development of the decentralized stablecoin protocol <p>The development of the blockchain industry is changing with each passing day, and so are the stablecoin projects. Last week, several decentralized stablecoin protocols have made great progress. This report will introduce these projects to&nbsp;you.</p> MakerDAO <p>MakerDAO is a representative of the decentralized autonomous blockchain project. The stablecoin DAI is the largest on-chain collateralized stablecoin. The governance token MKR can also well realize the unification of power, responsibility, and benefit. With the increase in Dapps on Ethereum, the supply of DAI appears to be insufficient. In the last three months, the supply of DAI has increased by 545%, it still can’t avoid the premium when DAI is in high demand. Last week, MakerDAO passed a series of important votes, which can solve the problem of DAI premium to a large&nbsp;extent.</p>  The clearing lines of USDC-A and PAX-A have gone through two rounds of voting, from 110% and 120% to&nbsp;101%.  The debt ceiling of USDC-A was raised from $100 million to $400 million after two&nbsp;votes.  Activate TUSD as collateral, the debt ceiling is 50 million, and the clearing line is&nbsp;101%.  The global debt ceiling of DAI is raised to 1.2&nbsp;billion.  <p>After a series of expansionary votes, the supply of DAI rose to $800 million, a 70% increase from a week ago. The market capitalization of DAI also exceeds the market capitalization of its governance token MKR. The price of DAI will be closer to the centrally issued USDC, PAX, and TUSD. When DAI has a premium of more than 1%, arbitrageurs can borrow DAI near the clearing line and sell it on the secondary market and can ignore liquidating risks.</p><p>This also brings centralization risk to DAI. Previously, because DAI was the only large-scale decentralized stablecoin issued on Ethereum, the application of DAI on the blockchain was generally better than centralized stablecoins. After that, the boundary between centralization and decentralization may become&nbsp;blurred.</p> Pickle <p>When the demand for a certain stablecoin increases, a premium of more than 3% may appear in the short term. This situation has become frequent in recent yield farming, and users need to switch between different stablecoins. When the popularity of mining passes, the premium will disappear, and users may suffer a 3% principal loss in a short period. As the profitability of yield farming decreases, this loss will be unacceptable for many&nbsp;people.</p><p>Pickle Finance wants to use incentives to allow stablecoins such as DAI and sUSD to return to their anchored value ($1). In the beginning, PICKLE tokens will be distributed to the pledgers of Uniswap LP Tokens of ETH and DAI, USDC, USDT, and sUSD. The LP corresponding to the stablecoin with the lower price will be rewarded with more PICKLE tokens, which will encourage liquidity providers to sell stablecoins with higher prices and buy stablecoins with lower&nbsp;prices.</p><p>The Pickle Swap feature will help users complete the conversion of LP Tokens with one click, including the conversion between platforms (now only supports the conversion from SushiSwap to Uniswap) and the conversion of LP Tokens between different stablecoins and ETH in the platform.</p><p>pJar is the valut in Pickle. Users can pledge Uniswap LP Tokens. pJar will help users automatically mine and sell UNI to exchange for more underlying assets. pJar realizes the aggregate mining using Ethereum and stablecoin as LP Tokens on Uniswap. After users pledge Uniswap LP Tokens in pJar, they will get pToken, such as staking UNIV2 DAI/ETH LP will get pUNIDAI. Over time, 1 pUNIDAI will correspond to more UNIV2 DAI/ETH LP. Staking pUNIDAI will also receive additional PICKLE&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Although Pickle Finance may not be able to achieve the goal of returning stablecoins to anchored value, this direction is worth the effort. Because of the token incentives of Uniswap, more and more stablecoins and ETH exchange pairs will be used for mining in Uniswap, and pJar aggregate mining will be more&nbsp;useful.</p> Curve <p>Curve was originally a stablecoin exchange protocol. With the development of cross-chain assets, there are now many Bitcoin anchor tokens on the platform. When trading in Curve, the platform only charges a 0.04% commission. In August, after the release of Curve’s platform token CRV, the funds in Curve rose from less than $300 million to more than $1 billion. Currently, Curve has a total of $1.6 billion in assets. On September 20, the one-day transaction volume in Curve set a record of $519&nbsp;million.</p><p>The price of CRV has dropped from $30 at the initial issuance to $1.4 now, and the annualized rate of return in the y pool has also dropped to 14.39%, but there are still more than $600 million stablecoins in the y pool. The decrease in mining yield did not reduce the amount of funds and transactions in Curve. It can be seen that the token incentives of Curve are effective. After the revenue declines, users have not lost a&nbsp;lot.</p> Swerve <p>Two weeks ago, Swerve forked from Curve. Its governance token SWRV has no team reservations and no pre-mining. Swerve has also optimized the gas fee in use. Because of the high incentives at the early stage, the total lock-up volume in Swerve reached up to $900 million. However, the economic model of Swerve has a fatal problem. It allocates 9 million SWRV in the first two weeks and 9 million SWRV in the following year. At the end of last week, SWRV completed its first token-issued cut, and now the total lock-up volume in Swerve is less than $20 million. A decrease in the lock-up volume will increase transaction slippage, which will affect the experience of&nbsp;Swerve.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

  <p>Businesses are increasingly embracing new technologies to enhance existing processes and enable new business models and revenue streams through Digital Transformation. Service-based business IT, however, is not without challenges, particularly around access governance and control. Digital Transformation is all about enabling everyone and everything to connect seamlessly to new digital services, to facilitate value exchange while still ensuring regulatory compliance, faster product innovation, secure remote working capabilities, and multi-channel consumer access despite ever-tightening budgets.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/seamless_connectivity"></a>

<p>We know that the universe of knowledge surrounding identity verification and security can feel vast. We’re here to help! Consider this glossary your one stop shop, a way to help equip you with the ABCs of KYC. Share it with your friends or colleagues, or let it be your secret weapon as you become the resident expert—we won’t tell.&nbsp;</p>



 The Basics&nbsp; 



  Biometric is the “measurement of the human body”, the science of analyzing physical or behavioral characteristics specific to each individual. <br><br>  KYC means Know Your Customer. It is the process of a business verifying the identity of its customer and assessing their suitability. <br><br>  Identity Verification is the process of confirming a person’s identity. Easy!<br><br>  Selfie Authentication uses facial recognition and biometric data to allow users to verify and match themselves to the piece of identity used in the verification process.&nbsp;  



 The Tech 



  AI stands for artificial intelligence and is the simulation of human intelligence processes such as learning, reasoning, and self-correction by machines.&nbsp;  



  Facial Recognition is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or video. In identity authentication or verification, this is usually used to compare a selfie or with an image on file to see if the faces match.<br><br>  Machine Learning is a category of algorithms that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed.<br><br>  



 &nbsp;For the Experts <br><br> 



  AML stands for Anti-Money Laundering and refers to a set of laws, regulations, and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income.&nbsp;  



  GDPR means General Data Protection Regulation in the EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the EEA.&nbsp;  



  Hashing is meant to verify that a file or data is authentic and has not been altered. It uses an algorithm to map data of any size to a fixed length called a hash value/hash code and is one-way.<br><br>  Privacy by design means privacy is incorporated into technology and systems by default when designing a product. <br><br>  Private key is a type of lock used in asymmetric encryption that is used to decrypt the message by converting the received message back to the original message and is kept secret.<br><br>  Public key is a type of lock used in asymmetric encryption that is used to encrypt the message by converting it to an unreadable form and is widely distributed.<br><br>  Spoofing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain someone’s personal information by pretending to be a source known to the receiver. For tips to keep yourself and your company safe, head <a href="https://authenteq.com/anti-spoofing-tips-and-tools-to-keep-you-and-your-company-safe-and-secure/">here</a>. <br><br>

Community members were invited to vote for a change to the WING reward distribution rate during the WING Mining Celebration. Over 1/3 of all current WING in circulation participated in the vote. As a result, the distribution rate will change to twice, compared with the previous ten times, effective from 00:05, September 18th. <br>- From September 18th to 29th, through the Flash Pool Mining Celebration, users will be rewarded extra incentives. Users who deposit their WING in the Wing DAO Supply Pool during this period will receive a ten-fold increase in rewards between September 18th and 24th, and a five-fold increase in rewards between September 25th and 29th.<br>- On September 20th (UTC), the WING/EWING swap was launched in Flash Pool of Wing, with the aim of increasing the project’s liquidity&nbsp;. Recently, project teams such as OpenOcean.finance also announced that WING-related swaps would soon be launched online, opening new channels for WING’s circulation and increased scenarios where WING could be used. <br> <br>Global Events<br>- On September 18th, Jun LI (founder of Ontology) took part in a panel discussion themed “Prospects of Decentralized Finance” at 2020 International Fintech Innovation Conference (IFIC) in Shanghai. During the panel discussion, Li stated that should Ontology wish to stand out in the DeFi industry while avoiding stepping into the transaction-fee issue as faced by Ethereum, it needs to work harder on its strategy to support different charges in scenarios of different technical complexities. He said, “Ontology is determined to integrate all types of data, including real-life identity data, credit data and asset data of various groups of people, on the blockchain to build a ‘Super Oracle’ that provides the whole package of data and identity information in various DeFi services.”</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-september-16-22-634f2d3c6a24">Ontology Weekly Report (September 16–22)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Greg’s piece about Apto’s upcoming developer-first, instant issuance program — <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/partner-spotlight-introducing-developer-first-instant-card-issuance-from-apto-e22915bba322">Partner Spotlight: Introducing Developer First, Instant Card Issuance from&nbsp;Apto</a>  <p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  TikTok/WeChat and the fundamental differences between China and the U.S. according to Ray&nbsp;Dalio  “Common Code: An Alliance Framework for Democratic Technology Policy”  We need to rethink privacy and security for pretty much everything post-pandemic  Stuff happens   1. With President Trump giving his blessing to the TikTok/Oracle deal and his WeChat ban running into some legal challenges, Ray Dalio has published a timely post on China, his latest in his Big Cycles&nbsp;series.   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chapter-6-big-cycle-china-its-currency-ray-dalio/">Chapter 6: The Big Cycle of China and Its&nbsp;Currency</a>  Photo: Web&nbsp;Summit<p>We won’t dive too deep into this one, but he provides a neat overview on how the Chinese historically think and operate by drilling down on its core philosophies:</p><blockquote>The Chinese culture developed as an extension of the experiences the Chinese had and the lessons they learned over the millennia. They were set out in philosophies about how things work and what ways work best in dealing with these realities. These philosophies made clear how people should be with each other, how political decision making should be done, and how the economic system should work. In the Western world the dominant philosophies are Judeo-Christian, democratic, and capitalist/socialist. Each person pretty much chooses from these to come up with the mix that suits them. In China, the main ones were Confucian, Taoist, and Legalist until the early 20th century when Marxism and capitalism entered the mix. The most desired mix to follow has historically been the emperor’s most desired mix. Emperors typically study Chinese history to see how these have worked and come up with their own preferences, put them into practice, learn, and adapt. If the mix works, the dynasty survives and prospers (in their parlance it has the “Mandate of Heaven”). If it doesn’t, it fails and is replaced by another dynasty. This process has gone on from before history was recorded and will go on as long as there are people who have to decide how to collectively do&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>While I can’t do these philosophies justice in a couple of sentences each without digressing too deeply (though I will go into them more deeply in Part 2), here is the best I can&nbsp;do:</blockquote>  Confucianism seeks to bring about harmony by having people know their roles in the hierarchy and know how to play them well starting from within the family (between the husband and the wife, the father and the son, the older sibling and the younger sibling, etc.) and extending up to the ruler and their subjects, with them bound together by benevolence and obedience. Each person respects and obeys those above them, who are both benevolent and impose standards of behavior on them. All people are expected to be kind, honest, and fair. Confucianism values harmony, broad-based education, and meritocracy.  Legalism favors conquest and unification of “all under heaven” as soon as possible by an autocratic leader. It believes that the world is a “kill or be killed” jungle in which the strength of the emperor’s central government and strict obedience to it must exist without much benevolence given to the people by the emperor/government. The Western equivalent is&nbsp;fascism.  Taoism teaches that the laws of nature and living in harmony with them are of paramount importance. Taoists believe that all of nature is composed of opposites and that harmony comes from balancing them well — yin and yang. This plays an important role in how the Chinese seek the balance of opposites.  <p>And how China’s culture fundamentally differs from the&nbsp;U.S.:</p><blockquote>All of these Chinese systems from the beginning of recorded history were hierarchical and non-egalitarian. I was told by one of the most senior Chinese leaders, who is also a highly informed historian and an extremely practical top policy maker, that the core difference between Americans and the Chinese is that Americans put the individual above all else and the Chinese put the family and the collective above all else. He explained that Chinese leaders seek to run the country the way they think parents should run the family — from the top down, maintaining high standards of behavior, putting the collective interest ahead of any individual interest, with each person knowing their place and having filial respect for those in the hierarchy so that the system works in an orderly way. He explained that the word “country” consists of two characters, “state” and “family,” which represents how the leaders view their roles in looking after their state/family — like strict parents. So one might say that the Chinese government is run from the top down (like a family) and optimizes for the collective while the American approach is run from the bottom up (e.g., democracy) and optimizes for the individual. (These differences of approach can lead to policies that those on the opposite side find objectionable, which I will explore in more detail in the next chapter.)</blockquote><p>These are fundamental differences that are hard to reconcile. Extrapolating this framework to the current ongoing conflicts around the internet and platforms makes you think that existing divisions will only deepen without some sort of new approach.</p> 2. And so you have&nbsp;this: <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-china-d42ab331-0cb3-4d2a-9b36-bce6e6610df7.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>A group of researchers from Europe, the U.S. and Japan are proposing a “tech alliance” of democratic countries in response to the Chinese government’s use of technology standards and its tech sector as instruments of state power abroad, according to a version of the proposal viewed by&nbsp;Axios.</blockquote><blockquote>The proposal, called “Common Code: An Alliance Framework for Democratic Technology Policy” to be published next month, recommends that founding members of the new tech alliance include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the U.S., as well as the European&nbsp;Union.</blockquote><blockquote>What they’re saying: “The status quo of uncoordinated and reactive technology policymaking for the major democratic technology powers in Asia, Europe and North America means growing risk of ceding their technological leadership,” the authors&nbsp;write.</blockquote> 3. All of this of course coincides with the ongoing shift to digital as a result of the pandemic. <p>And there’s plenty to figure out on that front as well — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-da0f7769-d5e3-4a59-810d-3525a43b4e63.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The shift to online schooling is running roughshod over children’s privacy rules and rights and creating new inequalities, experts tell Ashley&nbsp;Gold.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: Minors are the only group that enjoys federal online privacy protections in the U.S., but that’s not enough to protect their privacy rights as school districts and teachers scramble to move all classwork to the internet amid the pandemic.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: These rules aren’t just technicalities. If companies don’t maintain rigorous data security and privacy practices, children’s personal information, photos and video could end up in the wrong&nbsp;hands.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: “We’re trying to take brick-and-mortar school and shove it onto the internet, and the two things just aren’t compatible,” Karen Richardson, executive director for the Virginia Society for Technology in Education, told&nbsp;Axios.</blockquote> 4.

<p>Recently, our CEO, Vinny Lingham, joined a forum hosted by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) to present an overview of Health Key by Civic. The forum, called “Tourism Tech Adventures on Aviation Technologies,” showcased the best ways to jumpstart the tourism industry as the world evaluates safe reopenings. The UNWTO was founded to cultivate modern tourism, which is closely linked to socio-economic progress around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Health Key by Civic offers one way to provide safe passage abroad. The solution can help travelers keep their identity and health information private, while allowing organizations to create safe spaces on airplanes, in hotels, and at large gatherings. It is built to comply with international GDPR and CCPA and other data privacy regulations.</p>



<p>For travelers, providing health status verification to gatekeepers is as easy as getting a vaccine from a qualified partner and then setting up Health Key by Civic in our Civic Wallet app. When a user signs up, they are authenticated as a real person, using both AI and blockchain-based technology. Civic does not take custody of personal data or medical records.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For businesses, Health Key by Civic streamlines the management of entry points. This is critical because there are complicated logistics that the industry will need to navigate. First, there are many vaccines currently undergoing testing with varying efficacy rates. Second, there are <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/24-08-2020-172-countries-and-multiple-candidate-vaccines-engaged-in-covid-19-vaccine-global-access-facility">172 economies</a> collaborating on distribution. This means that countries and organizations will need to confirm that an individual has received a vaccine, whether the vaccine received is effective, and which local entry point regulations must be followed around the world. It’s a problem that may be solved with thoughtful technology.</p>



<p>While we’ve been working hard to provide the right kind of technology solutions, we also know that collaboration on health status verification is essential. Civic partnered with <a href="https://www.circlemedical.com/">Circle Medical</a> to supply testing for interested San Francisco Bay Area companies. Additional regional testing partners will be coming online to support customers in other locales. Together, we seek to give individuals control over their own credentials and facilitate economic rebuilding.</p>



<p>And, along with collaborating in the medical and international communities, Civic has been making progress on other fronts. Recently, we’ve been <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004">working with California lawmakers</a> on a bill that will provide privacy-oriented guidelines for proof-of-health technology.</p>



<p>To learn more about proof-of-health and the travel industry, we invite you to watch the UNWTO forum and <a href="https://youtu.be/U4TnqeG_F5g?t=5136">check out Health Key by Civic</a>.</p>

   For today’s companies, IT service management is more than IT support. ITSM is about working behind the scenes to help employees to do the work that drives your business – providing a one-stop shop for service needs, upgrades, improvements, and asset management.

  <p>For today’s companies, IT service management is more than IT support. <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/itsm.html">ITSM is about working behind the scenes</a> to help employees to do the work that drives your business – providing a one-stop shop for service needs, upgrades, improvements, and asset management.</p>
<p>If IGA doesn’t play a critical role in your ITSM strategy, it should. We frequently hear from customers who are looking to better align IGA and ITSM, and our conversations with the analyst firm KuppingerCole often focus on this topic as well.</p>
<p>Simply put, it just makes sense to marry IGA and ITSM. There’s a relationship between every service that an employee can access and the role of that employee within your organization. Sometimes it’s a simple matter of convenience, such as automatically granting new hires in Sales access to the sales software. Sometimes it’s a matter of security and risk management, so employees with privileged accounts can safely view mission-critical data when they aren’t on the physical network.</p>
<p>On Oct. 1, I’ll be delivering a keynote at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/iga-servicenow">KuppingerCole IGA Solutions for ServiceNow Infrastructures virtual event</a> focused on the alignment of ITSM and IGA. <a href="https://clearskye.com/">At Clear Skye</a>, we’re well positioned to talk about this, since we’re an IGA solution built on top of the ServiceNow platform – running natively without the need for custom integrations. Here’s a look at five key ways your company performs better when IGA and ITSM are able to work hand in hand.</p>
<p>Read Martin Kuppinger's Executive View |&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.clearskye.com/kuppingercole">Clear Skye IGA: IGA on the ServiceNow NOW Platform</a><a href="https://identity.clearskye.com/kuppingercole"></a></p>
<p>Self-Service Requests. It’s one thing to automate service requests such as account or group access. Why not take that to the next level and apply logic to the request based on a user’s role? Say a VP of Operations in the Dallas office requests permission to join one Active Directory group. There are likely other groups for Operations personnel, VPs, and the Dallas office that she should also join – as well as legacy Active Directory groups that she should be steered away from. The same is often true for many other types of requests. If an employee wants access to the travel booking software, for example, he probably wants access to the expense reporting tool, too. Identifying and taking action on similar requests simultaneously will save time for users and ITSM alike. As an added bonus, your end-users will be using an interface that they already feel comfortable with: ServiceNow. That means increased productivity and faster time to value.</p>
<p>Separation of Duties. If a software engineer based in Asia is logging onto the network in the middle of the night to access a dev server, that’s not unusual. If a VP of Accounting is logging on from New York at 3 a.m. to access financial software, well, that’s a problem. Restricting access to certain systems – by requiring higher-up approval or denying access outright – can prevent activity both nefarious and accidental (such as an HR rep accidentally attaching the salary spreadsheet to a company-wide email). You could also take this level of access a step further – and protect valuable assets to boot – by restricting access to certain systems unless a user has completed security training, installed required patches, or updated potentially vulnerable systems, all by matching their privileges to the systems they have access to and the level of security those systems require. The ServiceNow Common Services Data Model (CSDM) gives you visibility and alignment in data value, utilization, hygiene, compliance, governance, risk and security.</p>
<p>Incident Management. Responding to open tickets is often a matter of hunting for valuable information such as what permissions a user has, what software versions a user is running, or whether that security training was completed. When you bring together ITSM and IGA, the analyst working on a ticket can pull up this information right away and solve the problem – along with identifying other issues that a user may need to address, such as expiring credentials. For organizations with thousands of employees, this improved efficiency can quickly save a full FTE on the Help Desk.</p>
<p>Change Management. Knowing the roles and privileges of all end users who will be impacted by a software upgrade or hardware replacement helps organization manage risk, plan backup support, schedule outages, and identify vulnerabilities. This has the clear benefit of minimizing the disruption to clinical business services. It also provides predictive and retrospective insight into which changes can be treated as low-risk repeatable actions and which changes require more extensive preparation, as well as knowledge of which roles are most likely to request which changes. Instead of being a hassle, change management can become an efficient and differentiating process for your organization.</p>
<p>Mobility. Employees who respond to incidents or manage deliveries on a large campus rarely have a physical office, so mobile apps are critical for their fay-to-day role. They’ve also become a lifeline for remote employees who are juggling school and family care and need the flexibility of mobile solutions. Marrying IGA and ITSM on the Now Platform is more than just being able to offer SSO for multiple mobile solutions – it’s giving employees a single point of entry for those solutions, one that’s maintained by a trusted partner in ServiceNow.</p>
 Looking to the Future 
<p>The ultimate goal of marrying IGA and ITSM is taking a more holistic approach to enabling your staff / people / teams. Instead of the stimulus-and-response process of opening and closing tickets to fix a single issue, it’s being able to draw on a wealth of data that’s no longer sitting in silos to automate when possible and evaluate risk when necessary – whether it’s risk from outdated security settings, risk from the combination of a user’s privileges, or a bit of both. This enables an organization to manage the present and plan the future, whether it’s updating critical systems, culling obsolete Active Directory groups, or updating admin privileges.</p>
<p>Few organizations have truly reached this point, however. Instead of breaking down silos and leveraging single control plans and common interfaces, the market has primarily focused on integrating and synchronizing data and workflows across two or more disparate systems. This only adds complexity – which is the last thing ITSM needs.</p>
<p>At Clear Skye, we believe there’s a better way. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/iga-servicenow">Register to join our keynote discussion on Oct</a>. 1 and learn more about our vision to bring IGA and ITSM together natively on the Now Platform.</p>

<p>We believe the decentralized identity layer is finally mature enough to enable the next phase of development in DeFi. In an upcoming series of posts we will dive into the components that need to be built to enable unsecured DeFi lending, and lay out our vision for how to get there.</p><p>What has Bloom been up to?</p><p>For the last two and a half years, Bloom has been working towards the vision of a financial services ecosystem which is open and accessible to all individuals with any amount of inclusion in the traditional credit system.</p><p>In our original whitepaper, we outlined a multi-phase approach to achieve a decentralized credit system: First, we needed an identity layer that allowed individuals to receive, store, and share verified attributes about themselves. Next, we built a competitive marketplace to efficiently seek prices for identity verifications. Finally, with the first two pieces in place, we could build a system to aggregate data and build open risk assessment systems.</p><p>In April 2018, we built a <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/introducing-bloom-payment-channels-enabled-by-ethereum-whisper/">discovery marketplace</a> based on the BLT token, using a combination of smart contracts and Ethereum Whisper, which enabled vendors and individuals to find each other, in order to facilitate payment for identity verification related work. Shortly thereafter, we engaged in negotiations with data vendors to get the right data into the Bloom ecosystem and built connectors that enabled users to pull in data about their phone numbers, email addresses, watch-list screens, social media, identity documents, income &amp; assets.</p><p>First Key Lesson: Ecosystem Data</p><p>Attaining vendor participation in Bloom’s marketplace presented challenges. On the one hand, most vendors require custom enterprise contracts with monthly or yearly minimums. On the other hand, the scalable approach to these marketplaces requires transaction-based pricing. The vendors simply didn't understand the potential in a decentralized data marketplace. So, we got to work on building the demand for that data, with the goal of re-introducing the marketplace at the right time.</p><p>Second Key Lesson: Built-In User Privacy</p><p>By the EthSanFrancisco Hackathon in Fall 2018, Bloom had a fully functional end-to-end flow - Users could sign up, generate a unique identifier, receive credentials, and share with any 3rd party that integrated Bloom’s free-to-use <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/share-kit">Bloom Share Kit</a>. The overwhelming number of project submissions (<a href="https://bloom.co/blog/built-on-bloom--lending-party-lets-anyone-get-a-decentralized-fiat-loan-with-bloom-protocol-and-/">Lending Party</a>, <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/built-on-bloom--how-sendput-makes-employee-expense-reimbursements-instant-with-bloom-protocol/">SendPut</a>, <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/built-on-bloom--blocusign-makes-digital-signatures-provable-and-secure-with-bloomid/">BlocuSign</a>) at that first hackathon led the Bloom team to expand Bloom’s vision of the identity layer.</p><p>Users wanted the ability to selectively disclose identity traits, share data without being tracked by an Ethereum address, and pull in traits we hadn't considered before. Our team responded to that need by building the <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/how-does-share-kit-work/">Selective Disclosure Merkle tree spec</a>.</p><p>Third Key Lesson: No Point in Doing This Alone</p><p>In February 2019, our team went to EthDenver to share the latest Share Kit improvements and review the next round of feedback and submissions from developers (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-mpOEjT9D0">Check out the workshop video here</a>). When we arrived, we learned the conference was using UPort decentralized identity wallets to register attendees for events. We each downloaded uPort, claimed a credential that verified our email addresses, and shared them by scanning a QR code. We realized that interoperability would have enabled us to register for the events using the Bloom app. Clearly, we needed to expand BloomID to be part of the wider decentralized identity community!

<p>Presentation by Dr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianluca-misuraca-4a04a61/">Gianluca Misuraca</a>, Senior Scientist, European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Spain</p>



<p>The
Procivis Think Tank meeting of 3 September 2020 took place against the backdrop
of a corona flare up and new travel restrictions in Europe. Accordingly, at
short notice we switched to our first-ever webinar format. </p>



<p>Our
first speaker, MEP Eva Kaili, shared her views against the background of the announcement
of the EU’s €750 billion “Next Generation” pandemic recovery plan in addition
to its new long-term budget of €1,100 billion. She highlighted the EU’s priorities
– “green and digital” and security in North Africa/Middle East.</p>



<p>How
did the European parliament operate during the lockdown? </p>



<p>Eva
Kaili explained that ballots were submitted via email. This illustrates how one
always makes do with the technology that one has during an emergency. Projects
were under way to make the system more resilient. During the Q&amp;A with Eva
Kaili it was also helpful to be reminded again that the EU only has the
competences that were conferred to it by member states in treaties. </p>



<p>Shaping
Digital Europe 2040</p>



<p>Gianluca
Misuraca presented his research on “Shaping Digital Europe 2040: Artificial intelligence
&amp; public sector innovation in a data-driven society”. It was interesting to
see that the EU is funding such long-term research. Looking ahead to 2040, he presented
scenarios based on a sliding scale of digital participation by citizens vs. the
degree to which this participation was regulated. &nbsp;The digital future might not be knowable, but
we can imagine its contours, challenges and opportunities.</p>

<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> has some very happy news to share about a new partnership with <a href="https://heder.be">Heder VZW</a> and a new&nbsp;KidTech&nbsp;product planned to launch December 2020. But first, we would like to share a little about why we believe this is so important.



Back in April 2019, we presented our thoughts at the World Government Summit on the digital future for Kids.




<blockquote>“Every child born in today’s digital world will live a dual physical and digital life. How we enable privacy and security for their digital twin in as important as the rights afforded to them in the physical world. If we don’t get this right, we risk a generation born into digital slavery”<p></p>– Katryna Dow, Meeco<br>World Government Summit, 2019</blockquote>




Sadly, a year on from the Summit and our concerns are evidenced all too often. This week by the news that the parents of 5 million British children under the age of 13, are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-14/google-faces-3-billion-u-k-suit-over-use-of-children-s-data?srnd=technology-vp">mounting a legal battle</a> with the tech giant Google, for $3 Billion.



At the heart of their claims is the desire to protect the digital rights of their children. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube’s method of targeting underage audiences constitute “major breaches” of UK and European privacy and data rules designed to protect citizens, especially kids.




 




This month NETFLIX released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0">The Social Dilemma</a>, a must watch documentary on the social media addiction that is both alluring and alienating for each of us, especially our children. The documentary includes alarming statistics on the increase in childhood depression, self-harm and suicide.




 




Most alarming is that the age group impacted is getting younger and younger and directly linked to their early access to social media. These platforms make it all too easy for underage children to access and be subjected to unfiltered feedback that contributes to feelings of inadequacy, dissatisfaction and isolation.




<blockquote>“There has to be a better way for us to enable children to participate in the digital world, along with making their first digital experiences safe.”  

<br>– Katryna Dow, Meeco</blockquote>





 




Enter <a href="https://heder.be">Heder</a>, a not-for-profit organisation based in Antwerp, Belgium. Heder provides care and guidance to improve quality of life for children with different abilities, along with their families and extended networks.




 




Heder’s philosophy is to always start from present strengths. Finding small things or looking for bigger solutions that enable people to focus on their unique strengths. Fostering pride and allowing themselves to experience joy from everyday things. Cultivating this from early childhood, together with support from family and community really makes a difference.




 




Their multidisciplinary experts work together to give support in different ways including creative play, adjusted sports, training, physical and psychological therapy.&nbsp;Heder offers services in the home, at day-care, school or on campus, and is just some of the ways Heder contributes to a more inclusive society.




 




And now, there’s another way; drawing on Heder’s philosophy of building on strengths, the idea for mIKs-it was born. After a number of years of research, the inspiring vision of Gaby Pereira Martins (Masters in Educational Sciences) and Kim Struyf (Director of Early Development), supported by Heder’s Senior General Manager, Erik Van Acker, will now become a reality.




 





<blockquote>“Together with Meeco we can give mIKs-it a strong foundation” 



<br> – Kim Struyf, Heder</blockquote>




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is honoured to announce our partnership with Heder to co-develop a media platform for kids, focussing on the developmental stages of 0-7 years. The platform is called mIKs-it. It has been designed to foster joy and connection to everyday life for kids, with privacy, security and control as the foundation.




 




Early childhood is the most vulnerable time in a child’s development as they are totally dependent on family and society for nurturing and protection. It is also likely the period when they will first come into contact with technology. Whether it is playing with their parents’ phone, watching YouTube or listening to content, all these media choices present new challenges to navigate in order to keep children safe.




 




In designing mIKs-it we had the privilege to work with <a href="https://trendwolves.com">Trendwolves</a>, who validated the design, usability and kid’s experience through a series of research projects. The research was led by Maarten Leyts, the founder of Trendwolves. Maarten brought unique insight to the project, given his expertise in KidTech. Many of the issues we wanted to understand were addressed by Maarten in his upcoming book “Generation Alpha in Beta”, due for release later this year.




 





<blockquote>“Today’s and tomorrow’s kids swipe before they draw. Say hi to Generation Alpha. But we’re facing a challenge here. Fully immersed in technology during their formative years and in a fast-changing world, differentiates Gen Alpha from previous generations.”

<br>– Maarten Leyts, Trendwolves</blockquote>





 




Working with Trendwolves was the obvious choice as they specialise in trend research focusing on families and global youth culture. Their insights help shape and validate product design, always focussing on how we can enhance meaningful human relationships.&nbsp;




 




Following a successful proof-of-concept completed earlier in the year, the decision to develop the platform was clear. The results of the research, and especially observing kids with a wide range of abilities interact with personal content touched our hearts and motivated our action. Especially as the study included kids with a diverse range of physical and developmental abilities, focussing on media formats for kids with reduced motor skills or that are visually or hearing impaired.




 





<blockquote>“Meeco’s guiding principle in the digital world is the same as Heder’s principle for the physical world: children are entitled to a safe and positive climate in which to flourish.”   

<br>– Gaby Pereira Martins, Heder</blockquote>




<a href="https://miks-it.com">mIKs-it</a> has been designed to provide a safe digital place for children to interact with multimedia; photos, video and audio files. The platform is developed using Meeco’s globally awarded technology, with content secured and encrypted using the same approach Meeco developed to protect bank applications, like the digital vault for KBC Bank in Belgium.




 




mIKs-it is a family platform and not a social network. There are two companion apps – a media app for kids, supported by an app for their trusted grown-ups to manage connections, consent and content. The features of mIKs-it are all the things that it doesn’t do, such as:




 
 
  no ads  no tracking  no manipulation  no unauthorised access to your media  no contacts without your approval  no content without your consent  no data mining  
 



 








  
 
 




Most importantly, the control is always with parents and guardians, and personal data is never sold!








<blockquote>“Heder and Meeco is a purpose driven partnership, our shared goal is to enable a more empowering digital experience for all children.”

<br>– Erik Van Acker,  Heder</blockquote>





 




If you would like to know more about our progress over the coming months and the launch you can register your interest at the <a href="https://miks-it.com">mIKs-it</a> website.
<br>












 




We realise there’s still a lot to do to help our kids develop healthy and empowering digital habits, but our hope is that mIKs-it is a small, but meaningful step in the right direction.




 




Now we invite you to join us on this most wonderful adventure, into the land of mIKs-it: a playground where children and their grown ups can connect and safely share snippets of everyday life and build lasting memories.

<p>MATTR is proud to announce we’ve added support for privacy-preserving verifiable credentials on our platform using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures-spec">BBS+ signatures</a>. Using a technique to implement selective disclosure, we’ve added the ability to generate credentials that support zero knowledge proofs without revealing any unnecessary information about the end-user, or placing any added burden on issuers, in the process. Since we&nbsp;<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">open-sourced</a>&nbsp;JSON-LD BBS+ Signatures at&nbsp;<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW30</a>&nbsp;in April of this year, we’ve received lots of engagement, feedback and contributions from the broader technical community to further develop the implementations and specifications we presented. You can read more about our approach to privacy-preserving verifiable credentials on our introductory&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">blog post</a>.</p>



<p>One of the benefits of using the BBS+ cryptographic scheme to sign credentials is the ability to derive a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">zero knowledge proof</a>&nbsp;from the signature, where the party generating the proof can choose to partially disclose statements from the original message. When enabled, this feature allows issuers to create a credential that effectively enforces minimal data disclosure using the MATTR Platform and a compliant digital wallet.</p>



Issuers can create ZKP-enabled credentials that allow the user to selectively disclose data



<p>To support this functionality, we generate the keys required to support these signatures and create a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a>&nbsp;(DID) with the keys referenced in the DID Document. BBS+ signatures require what’s called a&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03">pairing-friendly curve</a>, we use&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. This DID can be referenced in credentials to establish the issuer of the data, a common practice to allow a verifier or relying party to trace the root of trust in a credential.</p>



<p>To issue a ZKP-enabled credential, simply use our API endpoint to create a new DID Key with type set to BLS 12–381. Then, create a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a>&nbsp;(VC) using your new DID Key as the issuer DID. Our platform will automatically detect this capability is available in your DID and create a ZKP-enabled BBS+ credential for you. You can use the platform this way to create a privacy-enabled credential, or you can create a regular credential by providing a DID with a different key type — you have the option.</p>



<p>On the user side, you can hold ZKP-enabled credentials in your wallet alongside all of your other credentials. We’ve designed this process in a way that minimizes friction to the user. In future updates, our Mobile Wallet App will be able to detect if BBS+ signatures are being used in a credential. When you get a request to verify some information contained in one of these privacy-enabled credentials, it will derive a new presentation that selectively discloses the required info using a zero-knowledge proof. The platform will then allow verification of the proof using the same interface as any other type of presentation.</p>



<p>Our integrated approach treats zero-knowledge proofs as an extension of VCs, rather than an entirely new framework with a separate set of dependencies. We have built BBS+ Signatures and privacy-enabled credentials into our platform for anybody to experiment with, in what we think is a significant milestone for standards-based credential solutions on the market today.</p>



<p>As a technology, BBS+ digital signatures can be used to sign more than just verifiable credentials. Combining these technologies is quite effective, though they can also be treated as modular or separate components. We’ve open-sourced software for creating and verifying BBS+ signatures in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">browser</a>&nbsp;environments as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures">node.js</a>, and we’ve also published a library for generating&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bls12381-key-pair">BLS 12–381</a>&nbsp;keypairs for signing and verifying BBS+ Signatures.</p>



<p>By leveraging pairing-friendly elliptic-curve cryptography in the context of&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>, our approach provides an unprecedented way to perform zero-knowledge proofs using the semantics of&nbsp;<a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>. This allows credential issuers to tap into vast data vocabularies that exist on the web today, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph">Google Knowledge Graph</a>, making user data more context-rich without sacrificing security and privacy of the user in the process. Not only is this approach more interoperable with existing implementations of the VC data model and semantic web technologies, it also doesn’t rely on any external dependencies to operate (like a distributed ledger), meaning it’s&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">far more efficient</a>&nbsp;than other approaches based on&nbsp;<a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/cl">CL-signatures</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">zk-SNARKs</a>. We’ve open-sourced our&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">LD-Proofs suite for VCs</a>&nbsp;including performance benchmarks so you can check it out yourself.</p>



<p>We’re excited to finally make these powerful privacy features easily accessible for everyone, and we can’t wait to see what you build with it. To get started,&nbsp;<a href="https://mattr.global/get-started">sign up now</a>&nbsp;on our website and follow our tutorials on&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/issue-basic">MATTR Learn</a>&nbsp;to start creating ZKP-enabled verifiable credentials on the MATTR Platform.</p>

In this session, Nick Groh will introduce the concept of data-driven decision making, including how artificial intelligence can help reduce the costs of decision-making. The session will also cover mobile trends and other sources of leveraging data, and focus on applications to identity management. This session will look at how IGA has mature use cases, but needs to be applied more broadly. Finally, there will be a discussion on how these applications extend beyond identity management, such as other areas of security, and how the business can incorporate identity data.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive9_2020_09_15_groh"></a>

<p>Greg Kidd is the co-founder and CEO of GlobaliD and the founding partner of Hard Yaka, an investment firm focused on fintech ecosystems. His commitment to innovation and democratization in banking and payments has led to his involvement in other projects such as <a href="https://aptopayments.com/">Apto</a>, a Y-Combinator alum focused on developer-first card issuance he co-founded with CEO Meg Nakamura.</p><p>In 2014, after several years working for a regulatory and compliance advisory company, I co-founded Apto with my colleague and friend Meg Nakamura. It became apparent from my experience that the financial services landscape was in need of a significant upgrade — the industry was dependent on outdated, legacy infrastructure and entangled in a web of opaque regulatory requirements, making it difficult to build and launch innovative and bespoke card programs specifically designed for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>The system was set up to serve only the most highly-resourced, established players in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Since those foundational experiences in finance, we’ve been passionate about creating a payments ecosystem that is more fair and equitable, allowing the most aspirational companies to enter the market quickly and responsibly. To this end, we’ve prioritized working with those who are equally as enthusiastic about creating user-first experiences in the financial services sector as we built Apto. Since its Y-Combinator days, when Apto was known as Shift Payments, we now support several of the fastest growing fintech companies in the U.S. and expanded our business to Europe as of 2019. After building cutting-edge card programs for fintech innovators like Venmo and Coinbase, we’re expanding our purview to make card programs truly accessible for&nbsp;all.</p><p>I’m thrilled to announce that in the coming weeks, Apto will be taking an exciting and important step forward in democratizing fintech by launching an instant card issuance portal for developers at companies of any&nbsp;size.</p><p>Launching a card program is historically a long, painful process. Our goal in designing this program is to remove barriers to entry and shield you from the technical complexities to make it fast and easy to design and launch card programs in&nbsp;minutes.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/aptopayments/the-democratization-of-financial-services-fe257c223ba3">Read Greg’s full post over at&nbsp;Apto</a>  <a href="https://aptopayments.com/">Sign up for Apto’s&nbsp;waitlist</a>  <p>You might also&nbsp;like:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-erik-westra-head-of-globalid-labs-57fe63b5f1ba">Meet the Team — Erik Westra, head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-sepa-and-crypto-transfers-to-your-wallet-6147deb5f6cd">GlobaliD App: Introducing SEPA and crypto transfers to your&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-coronavirus-developer-first-matters-amazon-declining-trust-and-super-apps-6656ed1f58e3">Why “developer-first” matters</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/partner-spotlight-introducing-developer-first-instant-card-issuance-from-apto-e22915bba322">Partner Spotlight: Introducing Developer First, Instant Card Issuance from Apto</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Here at MATTR, we have been hard at work building a suite of products to serve the next generation of digital trust. We’ve designed our products based on a few key principles: extensible data formats, secure authentication protocols, a rigorous semantic data model, industry-standard cryptography, and the use of drivers and extensions to allow modular and configurable use of the platform over time. By combining our core capabilities with extensions and drivers, our platform offers developers convenience without compromising flexibility or choice.</p>



  



<p>The MATTR Platform delivers digital trust in a scalable manner. Our belief is that a modular security architecture is one which can work across many different contexts. When it comes to trust, context is everything, and we know our users each have their own unique requirements and expectations when it comes to their digital interactions.</p>



<p>We provide flexible and configurable building blocks for trust on the web in order to create a digital ecosystem that can support global scale.</p>



<p>The platform consists of 3 main components:</p>



  Platform Core  Platform Extensions  Platform Drivers  



<p>Our platform provides the capabilities needed for digital trust through a set of modular and flexible building blocks known as our&nbsp;Platform Core. This includes the ability to establish and use DIDs, sign and encrypt messages, manage the verifiable credentials lifecycle, and share privacy-preserving verifiable presentations. Platform Core is designed as a set of simple APIs that are available for all of our users, with operational tools and documentation.</p>



<p>We’ve designed the platform to have cryptographic agility and flexibility built in at a fundamental level.&nbsp;Platform Drivers&nbsp;are pre-configured integrations that allow our capabilities to be pluggable and extensible over time, preventing vendor lock-in and enabling user choice. They identify key areas where flexibility, choice, and optionality are desirable and surface them to the user to promote more resilient security architectures for the future. They are typically surfaced to the user as pluggable parameters in our Platform Core.</p>



<p>Extensibility is a key component of our platform architecture.&nbsp;Platform Extensions&nbsp;are higher level capabilities that plug in to our platform, providing convenient and easy-to-access application logic, such as service orchestration and workflow. They are built on top of our Platform Core, allowing users to smoothly onboard and extend our platform as well as enabling MATTR’s digital trust infrastructure to integrate with digital services and protocols that exist outside of our products. They are modular components in terms of logic and configuration, operating independently of Platform Core as an extensible set of APIs.</p>



<p>Finally, we offer a growing number of&nbsp;Developer Tools&nbsp;to simplify the user experience by providing additional interfaces and ways to interact with our platform. These tools are free and mostly optional to use, though they do simplify setting up the infrastructure needed to get started experimenting with the platform. Some tools, like some of the features exposed by MATTR’s Mobile Wallet, may be required to use certain features of the platform. Our Developer Tools are designed to work natively with Platform Core as well as our Platform Extensions.</p>



 



<p>Over the past 6 months, we have been working in close collaboration with a number of preview customers to create a great developer experience and identify features that are important for a wide variety of use cases. We’ve been working with partners from industry and government to make sure we’ve built a solution for the problems that matter to you.</p>

  <p>Damit Sie besagte Vorschriften rechtzeitig erfüllen können, ist es notwendig, sensible Daten zu erkennen und zu klassifizieren, unabhängig davon, wo sie sich befinden. Vor einer Cloud-Migration müssen Sie die Kritikalität von Daten verstehen und definieren, welche Informationen in die Cloud verlagert werden können, welche nicht und wie solche Informationen geschützt werden müssen. Die Sicherheit kann unter anderem durch proaktives Überwachen von unberechtigten und möglicherweise bösartigen Zugriffen erhöht werden. Die Ergebnisse Ihrer Arbeit sollten integriert in einem Identity-Management-System (IDM) dargestellt werden.</p>
<p>In diesem Webinar lernen Sie:</p>
 
 Wie Sie herausfinden, wer direkt und indirekt Zugriff auf geschäftskritische Applikationen und Daten hat 
 Wie diese Informationen in das IDM-System kommen und wie Sie sie nutzen 
 Mit welchen Methoden Sie sensible und unstrukturierte Daten in Ihrem Unternehmen aufspüren können 
 Welche Informationen aus dem IDM-System Ihnen dabei helfen 
 Wie Sie gleichzeitig die gesetzlichen Vorgaben zur Datensicherheit einhalten 
 
<p>KuppingerCole Principal Analyst Martin Kuppinger wird erklären, weshalb Data Access Governance und Identity Governance hervorragende Tools sind, um sensible Daten zu schützen und wieso sie darüber hinaus auch geeignet sind, um Compliance-Vorschriften umzusetzen.</p>

<p>Munich / September 16th, 2020 – IDnow, a leading Identity verification specialist, welcomes that Germany’s 16 states have agreed to a transition period incorporating the new and upcoming legal framework by October 15th. This transition clarifies existing and new mandates including, and imporatantly, age verification requirements for online gambling. The new regime officially enters into effect in July of next year. </p>
<p>IDnow, in its mission is to make the connected world a safer place, is pleased about this decision among the German states. The company looks forward to supporting the operators in order to provide greater safety for users. For IDnow, this ensures better protection for customers under German law as well as clearer rules in regard to responsible gambling.</p>
<p>“This is a big step for Germany’s online gambling industry, and again, it shows the importance of eKYC methods and their need to evolve. In a world that becomes more and more digital by the day, we need to stay vigilant and constantly adapt our security requirements,” says Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow. “IDnow strives to contribute to responsible corporate citizenship, ensuring that the social responsibility for this industry can be achieved effectively through innovative methods. This is the strong desire of the federal and state governments within Germany, and IDnow has been and –&nbsp; will continue to be –&nbsp;an active supporter of those efforts,” she adds.</p>
<p>“We have developed our products together with our clients – the biggest players in the market – , to perfectly meet their needs. IDnow offers AML compliant video verification, but also an approved automated verification solution. Gambling operators can choose, depending on their security needs, which of those multiple solutions they want to use. All of them fulfill mandatory age verification requirements.” says Oliver Obitayo CSO at IDnow. “To us its more than important that our clients can offer&nbsp; safe service platforms to customers so underage use can be prevented,” he adds.</p>
<p>After a period of uncertainty, each of Germany’s 16 states have agreed to a transition period for online gambling in Germany before the official start date of July 1, 2021. This transition period is noted by the shared agreement to not punish gambling companies who conform to the new law that will officialy go into effect next year.</p>
<p>In January 2020, the German states agreed on an amendment to the State Treaty on Gambling (Glücksspielstaatsvertrag) that also comes into effect July 1, 2021. This date was partly put into jeopardy, as was the process to issue sports betting licenses, in the first half of this year when matters came to a halt due to a court injunction sought by an Austrian gambling operator.</p>
<p>In a welcome development last week, Germany’s 16 states agreed to a transition period for gambling activities. This will allow operators to offer casino style gaming and poker as long as such activities are fully-compliant with the draft for the new Glücksspielstaatsvertrag. Online gambling operators must meet all licensing requirements by an October 15 deadline. This will include an Age Verification (AV) solution for online operators.</p>
<p>Under the new and upcoming regulatory regime, the following changes will be implemented:</p>
 
 It will be possible for German players to play online casino games and online poker under strict regulations 
 A wagering limit of €1 will be placed per spin for slot games 
 The number of licenses for table games will be limited to the number of physical locations for casinos in each state 
 A €1,000 deposit limit will now be implemented across all online gambling verticals in Germany. 
 
<p>&nbsp;With the recent acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services into the IDnow Group, the Munich based company has created additional capacities and possibilities for more flexibility in order to be able to adequately support its customers in every situation.</p>

 The GiD Report #126 — Forget Zoom, the video revolution begins&nbsp;now <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-125-everyone-v-apple-discords-groups-vision-a9067bc219be">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>The GiD Report is back after a brief hiatus. Today’s newsletter will be a bit of a quickie as I’m still getting up to&nbsp;speed.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  The beginning of a video revolution  Book Club preview: Marc Andreessen  The need for positive tech narratives  The Economist on digital&nbsp;identity  What’s going on with Epic v.&nbsp;Apple  The NYTimes on&nbsp;WeChat  Stuff happens   1. The pandemic has changed the way we work, play, and connect, accelerating brewing trends. What was once a ten-year horizon has transpired overnight, the domain of nerds and early adopters suddenly mainstream. And Zoom is one of the hottest stocks around because it’s all about video. The thing is, this is just the beginning. <p>Here’s a great overview from the Telegraph via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> (pdf attached):</p><blockquote>If Wu and other start-ups get their way, Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams will one day seem like the Model T of video calling services: functional and pioneering, but primitive. As the stubborn coronavirus continues, and the likelihood of increasing reliance on screens even after it passes, investors and entrepreneurs are now going through an explosion of dedicated video apps intended to replace today’s one-size-fits-all services.</blockquote><p>In a sense, it’s not so different from how Ayo thinks about fintech (re: vertical neobanks). One-size-fits-all is a reasonable way to start. But it’s only a matter of time before fine-tuned UX for specific target groups will rule the&nbsp;roost.</p>Photo: cottonbro<blockquote>Cannon says Zoom fulfils the specific and valuable task it was designed for: virtual workplace meetings. But it was not designed for classrooms, doctors’ appointments, live concerts or hen parties, all of which it has been co-opted for in the last six&nbsp;months.</blockquote><blockquote>The most recent batch of companies at Y Combinator, the leading Silicon Valley start-up school that is seen as a barometer of new tech trends, had at least a dozen video-related services. They ranged from Together, a video chat app for grandparents and grandchildren that includes games and bedtime stories, to Zuddl, for holding and streaming large business conferences online.</blockquote><blockquote>Another, Rally, aims to let people hold parties online without everyone shouting over one another: individuals can “take the stage”, for example when delivering a speech, or groups can split off into “tables”, where the muffled noise of the rest of the party can still be heard in the background.</blockquote><blockquote>Former yoga teacher Rachel Lea Fishman founded Sutra, which lets fitness instructors host classes online, earlier this year. The service was originally designed to let instructors rent out space and host classes, but was forced to shift to video as coronavirus closed&nbsp;gyms.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together/">Facebook introduces a co-viewing experience in Messenger, ‘Watch Together’ — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/know-identity-digital-forum-recap-identitys-role-re-opening-the-economy/">KNOW Identity Digital Forum Recap: Identity’s Role in Re-Opening the Economy — One World&nbsp;Identity</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mg">/mg</a> — <a href="https://www.netflix.com/si/title/81254224">The Social Dilemma | Netflix Official&nbsp;Site</a>  <a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-reports-second-quarter-results-fiscal-year-2021/">Zoom is killin’&nbsp;it</a>   2. Book Club preview: Marc Andreessen On Productivity, Scheduling, Reading Habits, Work, and&nbsp;More <p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/09/07/on-productivity-scheduling-reading-habits-marc-andreessen/">It’s an interview with a16z founder Marc Andreessen</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>). We’ll dive into this later in the week with the Book&nbsp;Club.</p> 3. The last decade of tech has naturally gravitated us towards a more dystopian outlook on technology, further emphasized by popular culture with TV shows like Black Mirror and books like The Circle. Given the outcomes, challenges, and unintended consequences of this last cycle of tech, the reaction feels natural. But maybe it’s time for a more positive narratives to take hold to balance all the negativity. <p>Here’s <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20200901&amp;instance_id=21808&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=37277&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fdb7a24ca-9d2d-586c-b9ec-d10ceb772efd&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Sriram Krishnan, a technology executive whom I respect, tweeted a few days ago asking for more optimistic descriptions in movies and television of people building technology. He didn’t put it quite this way, but I imagined he wanted less fiction like “The Circle,” about a surveillance-state corporate cult, and more like “Iron Man,” in which a tech nerd cobbles together a suit that saves his life and gives him superhero powers.</blockquote><blockquote>I get what Krishnan is saying, and there’s a bigger meaning behind it. Right now, there’s a lot of pessimism about the harm of social media, the creepiness of digital surveillance of our smartphones and our faces and the nefarious power of tech&nbsp;giants.</blockquote><blockquote>Those downers sometimes drown out the ways that we know technology has made many of our lives immeasurably better. Both “The Circle” and “Iron Man” encompass some form of reality, but it’s easy to see technology as either one or the&nbsp;other.</blockquote><p>Which I believe is very apt for the work we’re trying to do here at GlobaliD. Technology shouldn’t force you to undermine your values or concede your individuality. There’s a hugely positive story to tell here and we’re writing it every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Speaking of which — why <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-15c454b7-d99f-4cdc-bfb2-ccbb2a66d76f.html">telling that story in the right way from day one is so important</a>:</p><blockquote>Zuckerberg says he regrets not explaining Facebook’s free-speech ideals from the&nbsp;start.</blockquote><blockquote>“I just wish that I’d spent more time earlier on communicating about what our principles are and what we stand for — you know, things like free expression and voice and that we’re going to defend&nbsp;those.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Now a lot of people look at us and they see this as a successful company. With a lot of money. And it’s a little hard now, I think, for us to go back and talk about our principles and have people see the principles for anything but, you know, some talking&nbsp;points.”</blockquote> 4. Along with video, the pandemic has also put a spotlight on digital identity. <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/09/05/covid-19-strengthens-the-case-for-digital-id-cards">The Economist</a>:</p><blockquote>In countries without a system of secure digital identities, the closure of bricks-and-mortar government offices and the shift of public services online have caused havoc (see article). Divorces and adoptions have run into a virtual brick wall. Italy’s system for doling out emergency payments crashed and then demanded paperwork that applicants could not obtain because government offices were shut. In America, Washington state paid $650m in unemployment insurance to fraudsters who made applications using stolen identities.</blockquote><blockquote>No such havoc occurred in Estonia, a tiny Baltic state where every citizen has an electronic identity. More than just an identity card, it links every Estonian’s records together. So when the government created a furlough system for workers affected by the pandemic, it already knew where they worked and how to pay them. Nobody in Estonia had to join a queue on a pavement to claim benefits, as people in other places&nbsp;did.</blockquote><p>See also: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2020/08/29/apple-pay-was-not-disruptive-but-apple-id-will-be/">Apple Pay Was Not Disruptive But Apple ID Will Be</a> (via&nbsp;Luka)</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/u-k-digital-id-tool-passes-big-test/">U.K. digital ID tool passes big test — SecureIDNews</a>  Phil Windley — <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a>  <a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=51193&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=94620315&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--JebTsL19WdjcZszHMnrGsAJaWvma_91VeJzQhDEJ5plstlAwLi73eXBJyhR9l6qP7rxqHSI6_UDJSzBZJM1ea2cPJCA&amp;utm_content=94620315&amp;utm_source=hs_email">LG CNS to Take Lead in Developing Next-generation Digital Identification Technology</a>   5. What’s going on with Epic v.&nbsp;Apple: <p>The Information:</p><blockquote>Apple on Tuesday countersued Epic Games, the developer of “Fortnite,” asking a judge for monetary damages in the escalating legal battle between the two companies.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple made its claims in a filing with a federal court in the Northern District of California on Tuesday, in which the company also rejected the legal claims Epic made in an antitrust lawsuit it filed against Apple last&nbsp;month.</blockquote><blockquote>While Apple’s counter-suit was anticipated and didn’t contain any big surprises, the company tucked a noteworthy detail into the filing, saying that Epic has earned over $600 million in revenue through iOS apps in the past. That’s a substantial figure that likely represents the success of “Fortnite,” Epic’s hit battle&nbsp;game.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple justified its demand for financial damages in part because it said Epic has deprived it of App Store commissions by allowing “Fortnite” users to bypass an Apple payment system. The company also said Epic has hurt Apple’s image through an “extensive smear campaign” and requested punitive damages for its&nbsp;conduct.</blockquote><p>See also: <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1301962581180067846">Tim Sweeney on open platforms</a></p> 6.

As the coronavirus crisis struck China, her family used it to coordinate food orders during lockdowns. She also needs a local government health code featured on the app to use public transport or enter&nbsp;stores.</blockquote><blockquote>“I want to switch to other chat apps, but there’s no way,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“If there were a real alternative I would change, but WeChat is terrible because there is no alternative. It’s too closely tied to life. For shopping, paying, for work, you have to use it,” she said. “If you jump to another app, then you are&nbsp;alone.”</blockquote> 7.

 And how zero-trust biometric solutions can help you transition to a more secure digital workplace <p>We’re rapidly approaching a future fueled by digital technology — one where users and employees frequently access private systems outside the security perimeters of a workplace.</p><p>Traditional security systems, which are flawed to begin with, fail to offer adequate protection from cyber threats outside of the security perimeters of a workplace.</p><p>To properly secure remote working environments, organizations must start thinking about implementing radically different security&nbsp;models.</p> In this article, we’ll&nbsp;cover:   Traditional security models and their&nbsp;failings  Zero-trust security&nbsp;models  A biometric multi-factor authentication alternative   What are traditional security&nbsp;models? <p>Traditional security models refer mainly to perimeter network firewalls.</p><p>Firewalls were designed to protect corporate systems from malicious attacks by erecting security defenses that ward off threats from outside of the perimeters of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Security experts often refer to this as the “castle and moat” approach. The idea is based on the assumption that anyone outside the “moat” (firewall), cannot be trusted; and that anyone in the “castle” (the network) can&nbsp;be.</p> The issue with this approach is that it assumes anyone within the network can be&nbsp;trusted.  This is problematic for two&nbsp;reasons:   The assumption that everyone inside a network is trusted leaves organization’s vulnerable to insider-orchestrated attacks  This approach fails to protect organizations when employees are accessing systems from outside the security perimeters of a firewall. With the dramatic increase in remote work — firewalls are not just weak, they’re redundant.  <p>Remote-work security is traditionally tackled with VPNs, but with the rising adoption of smart technology comes the proliferation of security backdoors — greatly increasing the likelihood of a hacker successfully breaching a corporate network via poorly protected remote&nbsp;devices.</p><p>If a hacker compromises one smart-device within a home network, then the potential to launch further attacks on other devices (used to access company systems) greatly increases. In theory, hackers could potentially hijack a user’s device, steal their login credentials, and use them to bypass a&nbsp;VPN.</p> Hackers only need to find the weakest entry point to a network in order to infiltrate it. <p>Once a hacker has gained access to a network, they’re then free to move laterally within the network until reaching a target — usually a highly sensitive database that contains the private data of users, employees or&nbsp;clients.</p><p>According to IBM, the average breach went <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-07-23-IBM-Study-Shows-Data-Breach-Costs-on-the-Rise-Financial-Impact-Felt-for-Years">unnoticed for up to 206 days</a> (just under six months), giving malicious parties plenty of time to steal such&nbsp;data.</p> Zero-trust security: assume no one is&nbsp;trusted <p>Zero-trust authentication systems take a radically different approach to network security.</p><p>They assume that no-one can be trusted — whether inside a network or not. Therefore anyone attempting to access systems must be authenticated no matter where, when or how they access&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Since no trust is assumed, zero-trust models make a point of frequently authenticating users as they move through a&nbsp;network.</p> Zero-trust solutions protect against insider&nbsp;threats <p>Insider threats and cybersecurity incidents doubled between 2018 and 2019 — meaning it’s absolutely true that not everyone who has permissions to a network can be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Since zero-trust models assume that no one is trusted, they protect organizations from such threats. Insider organized threats can otherwise have large-scale financial and reputational consequences for organizations.</p> Zero-trust multi-factor authentication <p>Zero-trust multi-factor authentication solutions combine the principles of zero-trust security, with the principles of strong authentication.</p><p>Strong authentication, or MFA, improves security by presenting users with at least two different kinds of security challenges.</p><p>For example, an MFA solution may require a user to enter their login credentials, followed by a one-time-password sent to the user’s registered phone&nbsp;number.</p><p>Traditional MFA solutions create a range of user-experience problems when combined with the idea of zero-trust security: having to authenticate at every level of access can be disruptive when the authentication experience is cumbersome.</p><p>Plus, legacy MFA solutions are not immune to threats — since 2015, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/30/bank-customers-lose-91-million-five-years-sim-swap-scams/">customers in the UK lost £9.1 million due to SIM swapping attacks</a>. (SIM swapping is where a bad actor is able to bypass 2FA by having the ‘one-time code’ sent to the victim’s phone number, diverted to a new&nbsp;SIM).</p><p>Read more about security issues with 2FA solutions like YubiKey <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/local-authentication-vs-keyless-pt-1-faceid-and-yubikey-cb1b594d399c">in this&nbsp;article</a>.</p> The Keyless solution: Zero-Knowledge Biometrics <p>At Keyless, we combine multi-modal biometrics with privacy-enhancing secure multiparty computation to provide a passwordless, secure and privacy-first way to authenticate users that is minimally disruptive to the user-experience.</p><p>Our privacy-enhancing biometric authentication solutions offer multi-factor (MFA) security by&nbsp;design:</p>  Keyless verifies users are authenticating from their trusted device.

   Symantec Enterprise: With more informed decisions comes more automated security. 
<p>In today’s Zero Trust world, where the principle of least privilege is ubiquitous, enterprises are struggling to balance security while simultaneously enabling a highly agile business environment. There has always been friction with security and making highly specific security decisions quickly and efficiently contributes to this. Moreover, decision-making in enterprises exists on a spectrum from completely manual to completely automated. Regardless of where your organization resides on this scale, you are moving more and more towards automation--whether you know it or not. The real question is, as your business becomes more agile, how can you keep your security posture from falling off a cliff?</p>
<p>Traditional security tools can help with decision-making, but oftentimes there isn’t enough data to automate this decision-making process, or there isn’t enough confidence with the data that does exist. This results in a lot of manual effort, which cannot be supported by overworked and understaffed security teams. The solution to this challenge is more data; the more data you have, the more informed any automated decision will be to grant access (and specifically which type of access). Thus, from a Zero Trust standpoint more data is almost always better, and as we move towards a more secure enterprise environment, it will be essential to draw on data from numerous sources, including access requests, authentication, authorization, session activity, user behavior, etc. The more data, the clearer the picture - the clearer the picture, the safer and faster the decision.</p>
<p>But where do we collect this data? The answer is, you already have some of it - you just aren’t leveraging it. The data that your existing identity and access management solutions are collecting while they are continuously monitoring user access and activity is invaluable. This data might include things like login times, login locations, associated roles/access, etc. But the marginal benefits of additional data, which might initially seem irrelevant, should not be underestimated. For example, suppose we gather average session data for users, which on its own might not be predictive of risk. It could be that longer average session time combined with administrator access is the single most predictive measure of malicious behavior, but if we don’t bother collecting the data, we’d never know that.</p>
<p>The upside of collecting and consolidating identity and other data is that machine learning tools can continually analyze this data to search for new patterns that enable more informed decisions. These tools are capable of learning not only which data is valuable for risk assessment at any given time, but also how to apply that risk assessment to make informed security decisions. And through more informed decisions comes more automated security, which enables business agility.</p>
<p>At Broadcom, we are focused on a future state where all data inputs - from authorization, access requests, authentication, session monitoring, and contextual user behavior - are used at the business level. <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/info/symantec/global-intelligence-network">Symantec’s Global Intelligence Network</a> (GIN) is one of the largest civilian data repositories in existence, providing an extraordinary amount of data to inform security decisions. As the mindset of security has evolved, we are capable of making much more granular decisions with a greater level of context, creating and enforcing policies that are highly contextual. We are evolving beyond identity, because the data we gather allows businesses to function at the next level.</p>

However, Bart Cant, Founder and Managing Partner of <a href="http://www.rtledgers.com/">Rethink Ledgers</a>, decided to use a unique approach in developing his prototype app. Not only did he use verifiable credentials for the secure sharing of COVID-19 test results and vaccine information, but he also based his app on smart contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bart’s app uses the Trinsic platform for the verifiable credentials portion, so we interviewed him further about his app, how it works, and future plans.</p>

			 What inspired you to build this app? What problems are you trying to solve? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>My background has been in digital transformation, and I spent the last few years building blockchain-based solutions for large enterprises at Capgemini and IBM. While blockchain and distributed ledger technology provide many opportunities, I realized in the last few years that for many use cases and processes, there are some components of blockchain that are really valuable (e.g., cryptography, tamper-proof evidence), but some processes could be better served in a more centralized way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I wanted to apply my knowledge and talent, so I decided to join the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI). By contributing to the use case and development of a prototype application, I hope to contribute to building solutions that can help keep people safe and bring back some normalcy in our daily lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The problems I am trying to solve include the secure and timely sharing of COVID-19 testing data. Specifically in the case of COVID-19 testing, it is essential that all test results are communicated in a secure, privacy-enhanced, and safe environment. Secondly, accurate and timely data is critical for policy setting, so sharing data with state or local agencies in an automated way is also achieved. </p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How does the app use both smart contracts and verifiable credentials? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>As I mentioned previously, the app was developed using a combination of the DAML privacy-enhancing, smart contract language and W3C’s verifiable credentials. DAML guarantees privacy by coding the solution as rights and obligations. The information is stored, so it cannot be accessed unless the party accessing that data has been explicitly configured in the smart contracts to access it. DAML is also one of the few solutions that allows interoperability across networks. The solution is built on a centralized ledger based solution (<a href="https://projectdabl.com/">https://projectdabl.com/</a>) but could be easily deployed on other blockchain networks (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, Besu or R3 Corda), centralized ledgers (e.g., AWS QLDB), or traditional databases (e.g., Postgres).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second major technical component of the solution is how it interacts with verifiable credentials. Verifiable credentials are used to securely transmit COVID-19 test information from the health clinics to the patient. The application provides a digital workflow for this experience (including a mobile experience) while still being HIPAA compliant and providing a safe and secure mechanism for sharing COVID-19 test data that allows the recipient to be in control of his or her data and decide on what to share and with whom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The application is already looking forward to the future situation where COVID-19 vaccines will become available. When vaccines are available, at least a portion of the population will receive the COVID-19 vaccine and therefore will be better protected from contracting the virus or potentially infecting others in their communities. By providing verifiable credentials for vaccine proofs, we enhance the trust factor of sharing and disclosing medical information.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What role does Trinsic play in the app? How was Trinsic's platform helpful in the development of your app? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic is a critical component of the overall architecture of the solution. It is the glue for connecting the smart contracts to the distribution of verifiable credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It uses the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a> for setting up DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and schemas and can be used as a monitoring tool for connections and distribution of the verifiable credentials. The Trinsic Studio is an easy-to-use web interface for managing verifiable credential exchange with no code. It’s so easy to use that it makes it possible to issue a verifiable credential in less than five minutes! The <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> is also used for accepting and presenting the verifiable credentials.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How does this solution balance the need to track, analyze, and share COVID-19 related data and the privacy concerns that come with that? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>With COVID-19, there is a great emphasis on privacy and regulation. Verifiable credentials allow you to share medical data directly from the issuer to the holder without the need to store the data. Smart contracts can be leveraged to orchestrate this process. Additionally, smart contracts can be used to anonymize data by using DIDs, for instance. Additionally, the critical medical data can be blinded and encrypted by the DAML smart contract, so the solution can be both HIPAA and GDPR compliant. </p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What is the next step from here? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Since the release of my prototype and associated video, I have received a lot of feedback from healthcare professionals and self-sovereign identity advocates. I also am exploring further enhancements to a variety of use cases. There are many similar opportunities to leverage smart contracts and verifiable credentials for COVID-19 tests or vaccines in the entertainment, travel, or education industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the solution could be very helpful in international travel. By using the app, tourists from the US that are planning to go to the Caribbean islands can easily share their pre-boarding screening information about COVID-19 tests or vaccines and then provide additional test information upon returning back to the US, avoiding long lines upon entry or mandatory quarantine requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(end of interview)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes joined Bart and DAML representatives in a webinar to discuss and demo the prototype app. To view the webinar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0mSf0TNz9M&amp;utm_campaign=DAML%20for%20Enterprise&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=94512634&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_WANWD3dc6FImKtBVJDX9cdEjmDaQSXbXomOS-1tYSITgnPfyO5_U7tpgTLvFnUpH5bFF8G6jdHxt8kE-4YBg9Cz_WPg&amp;utm_content=94512634&amp;utm_source=hs_email">click here</a>.

  <p>For these organizations, an adaptable Active Directory-centered (AD) approach can address the areas of highest impact. By adding cloud-based access request and access certification functionality to the mix, a company can achieve a basic IGA solution for a fraction of the cost, complexity, and deployment time. This approach also provides the opportunity to expand the scope beyond AD and Azure AD by embracing many non-Windows systems (such as Unix/Linux) and SaaS applications (via SCIM connectivity). Learn how to build a strategy for a modular approach to identity that can be custom fit to company needs, size, complexity, and budget.</p>
<p>This webinar will equip you to:</p>
 
 Provision your AD and Azure environment – and beyond 
 Approach baseline IAM implementation efficiently 
 Plan a short track for improving security and compliance 
 Set up your identity program for ongoing success 
 Be well-positioned to expand to IGA and PAM when the time is right. 
 
<p>In the first part, KuppingerCole Principal Analyst Martin Kuppinger will give a brief overview of identity in general as well as of IAM, IGA and PAM strategies, and will look at what every business, regardless of size and industry, needs in IAM.</p>
<p>He will be joined by One Identity Field Strategist Dan Conrad, who will explain how to prioritize IGA capabilities for maximum impact and show why you should opt for a modular approach with AD-optimized tools.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/iam_strategies_that_grow_with_your_business"></a>

				 <p>I have been talking to numerous founders lately about the various oddities and niceties of raising funds – and the crazy things that VCs and aggressive angels do. Over the years I have advised many companies and I thought that there was a page that gave the founder-centric view of things – but I can’t find it. So… Here we go.</p>
<p>General Terminology – <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-venture-capital-terms">CB Insights</a> does a good job here. Key for raising are the following phrases (go to the page for the definitions):</p>
 
 pre-money valuation and post-money valuation are crucial terms – simple to get but if you haven’t heard them they sound odd. 
 liquidation preferences and especially any mention of a full ratchet. 
 
<p>Key warnings:</p>
 
 Be really careful about <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2004/07/liquidation-preferences.html">liquidation preferences</a>.&nbsp; 
 Watch out for the <a href="https://venturehacks.com/option-pool-shuffle">employee stock option game</a> that aggressive VCs play. This seemingly simple concept creates massive dilution that isn’t in a founder’s favour.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Interesting Approach – Vesting for Founders – One interesting thought is that some of the best places have quite long vesting periods, even for founders. AngelList, for example, has a <a href="https://venturehacks.com/6-year-vesting">6-year vesting period</a> – for everyone, including Naval.</p>

Everyone from end-users to enterprises to hackers know that identity information has value, and that if not protected it will be exploited. And yet collecting private information has become ubiquitous with online business to deliver personalized services. Enterprise-grade tools to handle and safeguard end-user information existed before the wave of global privacy regulation hit, but the Privacy and Consent Management segment has experienced rapid growth and maturity since the GDPR became active in 2018.

<p>The magic of innovation means that once a technology, product or tool becomes mainstream, it’s difficult for people to remember a time without it. E-commerce and same-day delivery options are to be expected whether you’re buying clothing, household items, electronics, and now even groceries. While the online grocery store market has seen steady growth, COVID-19—<a href="https://authenteq.com/how-covid-19-have-changed-the-self-tour-industry/">as it did with many industries</a>—dramatically shifted consumer behavior and, seemingly overnight, became the new norm. And yet, even for those grocery stores who were already operating online, there is one item on their shelves that presents a unique problem: alcohol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a<a href="https://research.rabobank.com/far/en/sectors/beverages/the-2020-alcohol-e-commerce-playbook.html"> RaboResearch report</a>, online alcohol sales reached $2.6 billion in the US in 2019, up 22 percent. Despite this growth, the same report predicts that alcohol brands are losing billions of dollars in online sales opportunities and missing out on building digital relationships with their consumers.</p>



<p>The physical sale of alcohol is one area where the legislation is very clear. A legal purchasing limit is set. Age verification is required. Fines are actively enforced. In Europe and the US, alcohol can be purchased in grocery stores, corner stores, specialty shops, and even in some pharmacies. These purchases require a face to face interaction solely because of the age verification step. But while good innovation can feel like magic, legislation often lags behind, as is the case with online alcohol sales. Add in a global pandemic, social distancing, and isolation, and suddenly what felt more like an exception becomes the rule.</p>



<p>Bier mich</p>



<p>In Germany, a system has been honed over the years that have in fact included the online purchase of alcohol. Wine or beer can be ordered and delivered to a private residence, but to receive the alcohol, a government-issued ID needs to be provided by the purchasing party and verified by the delivery person. Before COVID-19 hit, there were issues with deliveries being sent to locations like DHL boxes which meant the identity verification step could not be completed. However, by and large, the system was working, and it was working well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As COVID-19 spread, Germans, and citizens around the world for that matter, needed more space and less interaction. E-commerce and shipping providers began offering zero contact delivery in response. With no human exchange taking place at all anymore, what does this mean for alcohol sales? In the absence of updated nationwide regulations, the onus of how to navigate increased online alcohol sales has been left up to the individual shops. As it turns out, ensuring that alcohol is not being purchased and consumed by minors is much harder to regulate during a global pandemic.</p>



<p>More than money&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underage drinking poses a number of risks. In the US, alcohol plays a role in over 180,000 injuries and 4,000 deaths<a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/underage-drinking"> annually</a>. Selling alcohol online is more than a matter of profit or meeting economic demands, it is also a matter of corporate social responsibility. For any company that values protecting minors online, selling any product or service that could be classified within the vice industry—that is alcohol, tobacco, gaming and betting, adult websites—proper age and identity verification absolutely needs to be baked in.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Retailers across Europe and the US, both large multinationals and smaller brick and mortar shops, can easily integrate a KYC solution into their online systems. Rather than implementing a basic age checkbox, an automated identity and age verification system can protect your business and your customers.</p>



<p>Authenteq allows you to verify your customers and their identity through any channel without compromising their privacy or security. The omnichannel solution is fully automated and provides verification within minutes. With desktop and mobile solutions, it can be easily integrated into the sales process without channel breakage to keep your customer retention and completion rates high. Of course, a KYC tool with manual verification of online sales is better than no KYC at all, but with the expected immediacy of online purchases, manual intervention is both costly and lengthy.</p>



<p>By implementing an identity and age verification process like Authenteq’s into your own solution, you can unlock new growth potential in a safe and secure way for all.</p>



<p>Looking ahead</p>



<p>COVID-19 has taught us many things, but perhaps one of the biggest lessons so far is how adaptable companies and consumers must be. Consumer buying behavior evolves over time, but it can also change overnight.</p>



<p>As e-commerce sales continue to grow across all sectors, the barriers to entry are, for now, harder for alcohol marketplaces. Those that see these barriers as a reason to not enter the space at all, will see profound consequences. Participating in the online ecosystem is necessary for brands to stay connected to their customers, but brands that also consider and incorporate their own corporate social responsibility goals into that online presence are much better poised to respond to changes, and flourish while doing so.</p>

<p>Given that background, you might assume that this was another session about zero trust. It’s not.</p>
<p>Recently, a growing emphasis on data privacy has sought to treat identities and their associated data as valuable works of art as well, worthy of protection and compensation for use. Through the lens of the Gardner Theft, we’ll evaluate the current proposals and concepts around user-owned data and explore the benefits and pitfalls of each.</p>
<p>We'll step through the heist, recreate those 81 minutes, and discover how identity data is the new Vermeer. Note: If we somehow crack the case together, we'll split the $10 million between us all.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve8_2020_09_03_kiser"></a>

  <p>IAM implementations are not all same, but for sure there is not as many implementations as there are situations.I have selected 3 major factors which defined our IAM project. Of course, final result was a consequence of lot more things.</p>
<p>And yes, we succeeded to implement full Identity lifecycle in the enterprise where starting point is a complex matrix of requirements like&nbsp;multiple legal entities, multiple contracts, kinds of work relationships, several account directories, manual processes.</p>
<p>Just name any situation, we had it. We were on the edge of failure and almost ready to add yet another failed IAM project to the list.&nbsp;But we made it and if I had to do it yet again in another place, in another situation, I would take these 3 with me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<p>-Correct data is vital for every IT project, IAM is not special. But where to exactly look in the IAM project? Which issues with the data are toxic?</p>
<p>-The analysis of the system drives implementation architecture and design. Thereby the steering must be correct.</p>
<p>-And finally, how to bring it out in the enterprise scale if you cannot do big bang but same time you cannot left anybody behind?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve8_2020_09_03_vool"></a>

<p>Der Regierungsrat hat am 25. April 2018 die
Strategie «<a href="https://rr.zh.ch/dam/regierungsrat/rat/pdf/kommissionen/sdi/strategie/Strategie_Digitale_Verwaltung.pdf.spooler.download.1531402793115.pdf/Strategie_Digitale_Verwaltung.pdf">Digitale
Verwaltung</a>» festgesetzt. Sie zeigt auf, wie die Verwaltung die digitale
Entwicklung gestalten und die Chance der Digitalisierung nutzen will. Teil der
Strategie ist ein Impulsprogramm mit Digitalisierungsvorhaben, die vorrangig
und eng koordiniert angegangen werden. Das Impulsprogramm umfasst unter Ziel 1
«Vereinfachung und Ausbau des digitalen Leistungsangebotes» auch das Projekt
«IP1.5: Studie zum Einsatz der Blockchain-Technologie». Procivis&nbsp;wurde
mit der Ausarbeitung dieser Studie betraut. Wir veröffentlichen hier die
Zusammenfassung der Studie.&nbsp;Den Link zur gesamten Studie&nbsp;ist am Ende
des Blogs zu finden</p>



 Zusammenfassung 



<p>Eine Blockchain ist die
Aneinanderreihung von Datensätzen, Blöcke genannt, die durch kryptographische
Verfahren miteinander fest verkettet sind. Die Darstellung von Informationen
als Kette (“Chain“) von Blöcken (“Block“)
ergibt das Kunstwort Blockchain. Die Verkettung der Blöcke mittels Hashes
erlaubt es, die gesamte Vorgeschichte einer Blockchain jeweils in den neuesten
Block zu kondensieren. Damit entsteht ein unverfälschbarer Audit-Trail.</p>



<p>Blockchains können
unterschiedlich konzipiert werden. Erstens wird differenziert bezüglich des
Grads der Zugangsrechte (Unterscheidung nach Lese- und Schreiberechten).
Zweitens wird unterschieden nach Konsensregeln, die festlegen, wer den
nächsten Block berechnen und publizieren darf. Es besteht eine logische
Abhängigkeit zwischen Zugangsrechten und Konsensregeln. Blockchains, die Lese-
und Schreibrechte uneingeschränkt gewähren, wenden normalerweise die
Konsensregel Proof-of-Work an. Bei dieser Konsensregel ist die Rechenleistung
der einzelnen Teilnehmer der entscheidende Faktor. Bekannteste Beispiele dieser
Art von Blockchain sind Bitcoin und Ethereum. Diese Art von Blockchains hat
sich bezüglich der Sicherheit als robust erwiesen; ihr grösster Nachteil ist,
dass der Skalierung – also der Fähigkeit, grosse Mengen von Transaktionen
durchzuführen, Grenzen gesetzt sind. Zudem brauchen sie grosse Mengen Energie.
Am anderen Ende des Blockchain-Spektrums bewegen sich private Blockchains, wo
sowohl Lese- wie auch Schreibrechte auf einen ausgewählten Kreis beschränkt
sind. Hier stellt die Skalierung kein sonderliches Problem dar; auch der
Energieverbrauch ist bei solchen Blockchains vernachlässigbar. Allerdings
bieten solche Blockchains aufgrund der fehlenden Transparenz und
Dezentralisierung nicht die gleichen Vorteile wie öffentliche Blockchains.</p>



<p>Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass
Blockchains dynamischen Charakter haben, also die Entwicklung von einzelnen
Datenpunkten über die Zeit darstellen, ist es möglich, auf der Blockchain
Transaktionen in Abhängigkeit von Bedingungen zu programmieren. Dies geschieht
mittels Smart Contracts. Diese sorgen dafür, dass Transaktionen
ausgeführt werden, sobald eine gewisse Bedingung erfüllt ist. Dies erlaubt es,
auch komplexe Transaktionen weitergehend zu automatisieren.</p>



<p>Die Blockchain-Technologie wurde
ursprünglich entwickelt, um über eine Infrastruktur zu verfügen, die ohne eine
zentrale Autorität auskommt. Deshalb stellt sich die Frage, inwiefern es für
den Staat Sinn macht, diese Technologie einzusetzen, ist er als Inhaber des physischen
Gewaltmonopols doch das Sinnbild einer zentralen Autorität. Im Falle eines idealen
Staates, der effizient und ordnungsgemäss arbeitet, bedeutet die Anwendung
der Blockchain-Technologie eine Verkomplizierung; zentrale Datenbanken genügen.
Ein besonderer Anwendungsbereich bilden demokratische Wahl- und
Abstimmungsverfahren, bei denen Bürgerinnen und Bürger ihr Wahlgeheimnis
gewahrt wissen, gleichzeitig aber auch sicher sein wollen, dass ihr politischer
Wille korrekt ins Ergebnis einfliesst. Auf öffentlichen Blockchains wäre dies
möglich; allerdings zum Preis der Unmöglichkeit der späteren Vernichtung der
Wahlunterlagen.</p>



<p>Staaten weichen vom Ideal ab, indem sie Strukturen und Prozesse aufweisen,
die einen mehr oder weniger effizienten Mitteleinsatz zur Folge haben. Zudem
können sich Amtsträgerinnen und Amtsträger und Staatsangestellte mehr oder
weniger gesetzeskonform verhalten bzw. Fehler machen. Blockchains können die
damit verbundenen Ineffizienzen mildern, indem sie die Grundlage für
Datenkonsistenz bieten. Darauf aufbauend können Prozesse weiter digitalisiert
und automatisiert werden, und (unbeabsichtigtes) menschliches Fehlverhalten
kann besser kontrolliert werden. Blockchains verhindern gesetzeswidriges
Verhalten nicht per se, aber ein jederzeit einsehbarer und unverfälschbarer
Audit-Trail erhöht den Druck, sich korrekt zu verhalten.</p>



<p>Der Nutzen einer
Blockchain-Lösung kann sich nur entfalten, wenn die entsprechenden
Rahmenbedingungen gegeben sind. Jeder Veränderungsprozess setzt politischen
Willen und Führungsverantwortung voraus. Dies ist bei allfälligen
Blockchain-Anwendungen umso mehr der Fall, weil deren Implementation
Konsequenzen haben, die über technische Aspekte weit hinausgehen. Neben
organisatorischen und kulturellen Fragen sind insbesondere auch rechtliche
Fragen zu beachten: Erstens ist jeweils zu prüfen, ob für eine
Blockchain-Anwendung die erforderliche rechtliche Grundlage vorhanden
ist und zweitens, ob diese mit dem Datenschutzrecht in Einklang, und
drittens, ob eine rechtskonforme Archivierung möglich ist. Den
verfassungsmässig garantierten Rechten – Schutz von Personendaten, Recht auf
Korrektur und Löschung, Recht auf Erinnerung (die zueinander in Konkurrenz
stehen können) – ist Rechnung zu tragen.</p>



<p>Im Zuge der allgemeinen
Begeisterung über die Blockchain-Technologie im Allgemeinen und Kryptowährungen
im Speziellen sind weltweit hunderte Konzepte formuliert und Pilotprojekte für Blockchain-Anwendungen
in öffentlichen Verwaltungen durchgeführt worden. Produktive Anwendungen
mit namhaften Transaktionsvolumina sind aber noch keine bekannt. Dieser Befund
trifft auch auf die Schweiz zu: IIm Rahmen dieser Studie konnten acht
Blockchain-Projekte identifiziert werden, in denen kantonale Verwaltungen und
das Fürstentum Liechtenstein in den Bereichen Register, elektronische
Identitäten, E-Voting und Bezahlung von Gebühren erste Erfahrungen gesammelt
haben oder sammeln. Diese Projekte sind abgeschlossen worden, teilweise noch im
Gang oder in Vorbereitung. </p>



<p>Auf der Grundlage von
Prozessbeschreibungen, die im Rahmen des Projekts «Strategie Datenmanagement
und Data-Governance IP3.1» erarbeitet worden sind, wurden im Rahmen der
vorliegenden Studie vier mögliche Anwendungsbeispiele für den Kanton Zürich
entwickelt:</p>



  Registrierung von amtlichen Dokumenten auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  Bürgerdossier mit Blockchain-basiertem Logbuch zur Stärkung der Rechtssicherheit  Inventarkontrolle auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  Öffentliche Ausschreibungen auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  



<p></p>



<p>Der Reifegrad dieser Beispiele ist unterschiedlich, ebenso wie die Schwierigkeiten bei einer allfälligen Umsetzung. Allen ist jedoch gemeinsam, dass sie sich die unmittelbare und nicht mehr verfälschbare Transparenz von Blockchains zunutze machen. Zentrale Datenbanken sind nicht dafür ausgelegt, einem grossen Kreis in dynamischer Weise Transparenz zu bieten. Eine solche Funktion kann zwar auch in zentralen Architekturen nachgebaut werden, Blockchains lösen das Problem jedoch eleganter. Hinzu kommt, dass dezentrale Architekturen, wie sie Blockchains aufweisen, tendenziell einen Vertrauensvorsprung bieten, der von zentral konzipierten Lösungen nicht eingeholt werden kann.</p>

<p>Identity Verification Provider from Munich welcomes Bettina Pauck as Manager of the Operations Division.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich – September 4th, 2020, IDnow, a leading provider of Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions, is welcoming Bettina Pauck as Chief Operations Officer to its management team. She will head the Operations division at the Munich site as well as the Leipzig site, which will be part of the IDnow Group as of September. IDnow took this new subsidiary over as part of the acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services.</p>
<p>Following the successful takeover of Wirecard Communication Services GmbH at the beginning of this week, IDnow announces the appointment of Bettina Pauck as Chief Operations Officer to the management team of the Munich-based identity verification provider. Within the scope of the acquisition, she has already assisted in the valuation of the company. Her main task in the coming months will be to integrate the former Wirecard Communication Services GmbH – now IDnow Services GmbH – into the existing processes and to optimally position the business unit for the foreseeable growth.</p>
<p>In the last 12 years Bettina Pauck has been working with her own company as a consultant for companies like N26, reBuy or Axel Springer and has optimized their customer operations. She has been working in customer service since 2004 and now brings her many years of experience in strategic, tactical and operational customer management as well as in the conception and control of service structures to IDnow.</p>
<p>“Identity verification is at the heart of many industries, but most of all it ensures the security and sense of security of many customers. Since the customers are the focus of all my activities, I am particularly pleased to be able to make a real difference for the customers – and for IDnow – in this central function,” says Bettina Pauck. “IDnow is a company with a strong vision and my goal is to take the Operations division to a new level together with the outstanding team,” she adds.</p>
<p>“I am pleased that we were able to win Bettina Pauck as COO for IDnow. She will play a central role in the scaling of our operations area, also and especially in the context of the recent strong increase in demand. With the acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services, we have created additional capacity and infrastructure in order to further improve our range and service quality,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>

  When it comes to identity management many companies depend heavily on Microsoft Active Directory (AD). This high degree of dependency on one service can become a problem when this service faces an outage. Also, respective of the requirements companies have, all services have certain limitations which are sometimes necessary to overcome. Many cyberattacks are perpetrated via staff endpoint devices (computers, smartphones or even printers). This necessitates a fine-mesh risk management approach with a centralized solution, called Identity Fabric at KuppingerCole.

					 <p>“Identifiers” are how you are identified as a unique person and recognized as that same unique person over time. With other people, your primary identifier is your face. With organizations, it might be a student ID, social security number, or driver’s license number. Online, it might be a username, phone number, or email address.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using identifiers properly helps to avoid confusing two people with one another. But identifiers can also be harmful—if a hacker gets ahold of your social security number, it could mean trouble!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most identifiers are given to us by centralized registration authorities like governments, telephone companies, and email providers. But that puts an organization in between us and our ability to access basic services, compromising privacy and putting individuals in a position of powerlessness. The answer to this problem is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C standard</a> called Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 A new type of identifier 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>DIDs are “a new type of globally unique identifier”¹ that is used in <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). It looks like this:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>You’ll notice it has three parts:<br><br></p>  Scheme: DIDs all start with <code>did:</code> just like how all website addresses start with <code>http://</code> . This is so that computers can tell what they’re looking at.  Method: After DIDs are generated, they have to be stored somewhere. They’re often stored in a blockchain or a digital wallet, but they can be stored anywhere. The method, which is the <code>example:</code> part of the DID in the example above, tells computers where to go to find the DID. For example, issuers of verifiable credentials in the Trinsic platform get a DID that has a <code>did:sov:</code> method, because the DID goes on the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>.  Identifier: This is the unique identifier of the DID.  <p>According to the W3C, a DID has the following four characteristics²:<br><br></p>  Decentralized: There should be no central issuing agency. That means you should be able to create your own DIDs independently of anyone else.  Persistent: The identifier should be inherently persistent, not requiring the continued operation of an underling organization. This is in contrast to your email, for example; if Gmail shuts down, you’d lose access to your Gmail messages.  Crytopgraphically verifiable: It should be possible to prove control of the identifier cryptographically.  Resolvable: It should be possible to discover metadata about the identifier.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How are DIDs used? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>As identifiers in the Trinsic system, DIDs serve two primary functions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Publicly identifying credential issuers  Privately identifying relationships (connections)  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Credential issuers need to be publicly identifiable if they want the credentials they issue to be verifiable. We use a blockchain to post the issuers’ DID, which acts as a public key. The issuer signs the credential attributes with the corresponding private key.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each relationship in the Trinsic system is called a connection. When you make a connection, you create a DID just for that relationship and share it with the counterparty. When you want to send messages, you encrypt them so that only the counterparty can decrypt the message using the DID you shared with them. This creates a super secure, peer-to-peer channel to interact. The identifiers for these connections are kept privately in your (and the counterparty’s) wallet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about DIDs, feel free to <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">contact us</a> or read the W3C’s DID specification at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/</a>.</p>

  <p>The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has served as a catalyst for digitization in many companies and led to an increase in remote work and adoption of the bring your own device (BYOD) policy. Every device and digital service that employees use is a potential gateway into company networks and thus poses a security risk. The risks are magnified even more when privileged accounts enter the equation because they enable access to critical data. Given the immediacy and speed with which companies had to shift from office to remote work, security concerns were often neglected leading to an increase in successful cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Facing this situation of increased risks and attack vectors, companies need to have foolproof security in place to keep their data safe and secure. IT teams should start with the very basics such as giving the company staff cybersecurity awareness trainings and monitoring remote access. While it has become a well-known fact that Privileged Access Management (PAM)&nbsp; is an integral part of cybersecurity in modern companies, Secure Compliance Management (SCM) and&nbsp;User Behaviour Analytics (UBA) perhaps have not been given proper attention in the security world yet.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/remote_workforce_security"></a>

<p>As organizations have accelerated their investments in digital initiatives, business and app teams have embraced the DevOps model, a process that speeds up software delivery. DevOps enables businesses to be agile enough to quickly adapt or be the first to market, which can have a tremendous impact on the bottom line.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s time for identity to join the DevOps party. For far too long, identity initiatives have been stretched to their limits while struggling to keep pace with application growth. DevOps is starting to gain traction in the identity space—and for good reason, since identity is a key part of application onboarding. Without collaboration between identity teams and DevOps teams, many of the intended benefits of DevOps can quickly unravel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is DevOps? 
<p>The DevOps methodology for software development breaks down traditional silos by eliminating manual tasks and replacing them with automation via code so that releases and updates can be pushed out faster and more frequently. At its core, DevOps improves the efficiencies between app development and IT operations or infrastructure teams. Previously, developers would make manual requests to identity teams or IT ops and lose valuable time. In DevOps, the identity teams enable the software to be consumable via APIs or infrastructure-as-code, the preferred methods for developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the DevOps model has specific tools for implementation. The most common include Docker, which enables software in images or “containers,” and Kubernetes, the orchestration engine that manages containers. These tools allow developers to easily spin up infrastructure and perform updates with minimal interruption.</p>

If you’ve already begun your PAM rollout, this event is a great chance to confirm you’re setting the appropriate milestones and see how others demonstrate success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/mature_pam_ecosystem"></a>

 The GiD Report #125 — Everyone v. Apple, Discord’s Groups&nbsp;vision <p>If you haven’t had a chance to check it out ye, check out our first employee profile interview featuring Erik! This was a fun&nbsp;one:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-erik-westra-head-of-globalid-labs-57fe63b5f1ba">Meet the Team — Erik Westra, head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>  <p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Quick updates on the war against Apple’s App&nbsp;Store  Facebook’s multi-pronged fight with&nbsp;Apple  Discord’s long term vision (it sounds a little like&nbsp;Groups)  The shifting challenges of platform moderation  Symbolic: ExxonMobile booted from&nbsp;Dow  Stuff happens   1. We’ve been covering the battle between Tim Sweeney’s Epic Games and Apple’s App Store so a couple of quick updates for&nbsp;you. <p>First, the initial judge ruling, via The Information:</p><blockquote>A federal judge denied a request by Epic Games for a temporary restraining order that would have forced Apple to allow Fortnite, a popular Epic videogame, back into the App Store. But that same judge granted another request by Epic to stop Apple from kicking it out of a developer program.</blockquote><p>….</p><blockquote>In a court filing, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Epic had not shown that it was at risk of irreparable harm from Apple, which removed Fortnite from the App Store last week after Epic began violating its policies. Epic modified Fortnite to bypass an Apple payment mechanism, which in turn enabled Epic to avoid paying Apple the standard 30% commission it collects on in-app transactions.</blockquote>Photo: Mike Deerkoski<blockquote>But the judge ruled that Epic was more persuasive about the harm that could have resulted from another matter — a threat by Apple to deny Epic access to developer tools for its iOS and Mac operating systems. Epic depends on those tools for the development of Unreal Engine, an Epic product used by many outside companies to build&nbsp;games.</blockquote><blockquote>The judge said that Apple had “chosen to act severely” and that denying Epic access to the developer could have hurt games made by independent companies. The judge ordered Epic to file a motion for a longer-term injunction by Sept. 4 and a hearing it on the matter is scheduled for Sept.&nbsp;28.</blockquote><p>Apple has also made peace with Wordpress creator Automattic:</p><blockquote>Apple says it has come to an agreement with Automattic, which operates the WordPress content management system application, after Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg announced on Friday that Apple had blocked updates for the iOS version of WordPress until he agreed to add in-app purchases.</blockquote><p>The first couple of skirmishes but the war is far from&nbsp;over.</p><p>In any case, Ben Thompson thinks <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/">Apple’s App Store policy is bad for innovation, bad for customers, and ultimately bad for&nbsp;Apple</a>.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/from-kingmaker-to-autocrat-how-game-makers-went-to-war-with-apple">From Kingmaker to ‘Autocrat’: How Game Makers Went to War With&nbsp;Apple</a>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402547/fortnite-epic-games-apple-ios-macos-two-different-games">Fortnite is splitting into two different games because of Epic and Apple’s&nbsp;fight</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnite-makers-apple-fight-leaves-some-developers-wary-11598274027?mod=djem10point">‘Fortnite’ Maker’s Apple Fight Leaves Some Developers Wary</a>  Ben Thompson — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/">Rethinking the App&nbsp;Store</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3htFFcoo6Lc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Linus weighs in on Apple vs Epic&nbsp;Games</a>   2. In part because Facebook has joined the chat. That’s because Apple’s policies are a threat to Mark Zuckerberg’s long term vision of making Facebook more of a super app in the vein of&nbsp;WeChat. <p>He made that pretty clear in a company wide town hall last week, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/zuckerberg-apple-monopoly">reported by Buzzfeed</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a swing at Apple on Thursday, calling the iPhone maker’s app store monopolistic and harmful to customers during a companywide meeting.</blockquote><blockquote>“[Apple has] this unique stranglehold as a gatekeeper on what gets on phones,” Zuckerberg said to more than 50,000 employees via webcast. He added that the Cupertino, California–based company’s app store “blocks innovation, blocks competition” and “allows Apple to charge monopoly&nbsp;rents.”</blockquote><p>Mark has a point and it’s one reason why China has superapps while the rest of us don’t. Apple has set it up so that the iOS itself is the superapp — further entrenched by its deep integration of features such as payments and now identity.</p><p>It’s not Facebook’s only tiff w/Apple,&nbsp;BTW:</p><blockquote>A new fight between Facebook and Apple over the mechanics of ad tech is surfacing an industry divide over user privacy and spotlighting longstanding dilemmas about the tracking and use of personal information online, Axios’ Kyle Daly&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Privacy advocates have been sounding alarms for years about tech firms’ expansive, sometimes inescapable data harvesting without making much headway in the U.S. But the game could change if major industry players start taking opposite&nbsp;sides.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Facebook warned advertisers Wednesday that a coming change to Apple’s iOS could devastate revenue for ads that sends users straight to the App Store to install an app — an approach that’s used widely by developers including mobile game&nbsp;makers.</blockquote><p>Like I said, a lot is at stake and both sides are in it for the long&nbsp;haul.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/f20e9b">Briefing: Facebook Says Apple Changes Could Kill Part of its Ads&nbsp;Business</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-warns-advertisers-on-apple-privacy-changes-5018b903-c2af-43cb-afef-4f53ce7b0f2a.html">Facebook warns advertisers on Apple privacy&nbsp;changes</a>  <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/zuckerberg-apple-monopoly">Mark Zuckerberg Said Apple Has A “Stranglehold” On Your&nbsp;iPhone</a>  <p>3. Because the battle between Facebook and Apple is just starting to heat&nbsp;up.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-00909c64-4f0d-4233-bb83-e8a4f90ef61a.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook and Apple are fighting an increasingly high stakes battle over user privacy and access to the iOS App Store, deepening a rift between two of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley, Axios’ Scott Rosenberg and I&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: By trading accusations, Facebook and Apple could just be handing more ammo to critics and regulators — but at the same time, conflict between these giants could be read as a sign of competitive life and a rebuttal to antitrust charges.</blockquote><p>A sign of the&nbsp;times:</p><blockquote>Our thought bubble: Historically, the big tech companies have maintained power by dominating a key market while competing with one another at the edges. The Apple-Facebook fight shows that they’re now willing to take swings at each other’s core businesses.</blockquote> 3. The thing is, Apple’s approach also bucks the macro trend. More apps want to do&nbsp;more. <p>Consider Discord, <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-d2587314-f65c-4cf0-b20f-50ab02564d47.html">via&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Discord began in 2015 as a way for gamers to talk to one another before, during, and after play. Now, the chat company is pursuing a far broader vision: to be the Slack for your non-work&nbsp;life.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: In the age of COVID-19, more than ever before, people need the online equivalent of social spaces like bars, restaurants and&nbsp;stages.</blockquote><blockquote>How it&nbsp;works:</blockquote>  Discord allows people to create their own online community space, to set and enforce rules and decide whether to remain invite-only or open it to the&nbsp;public.  Users can share messages in various channels, chat privately and have group discussions. More recently, the company has added group video&nbsp;chat.  Discord calls each community’s space a “server,” but it’s not a server in the sense of a separate computer controlled by the user. Users can run servers without needing system-administrator knowhow.  This arrangement has pros and cons. It means Discord controls the data and is responsible for complying with law enforcement. But it also means the service can enforce its own code of conduct, handling trust, safety and security.  <p>One way to think about it: all of these various products are really just various combinations of a few core building blocks: identity, messaging, and payments (and groups!).</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/line-launches-digital-asset-wallet-and-blockchain-development-platform">LINE Launches Digital Asset Wallet and Blockchain Development Platform — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-confirms-acquisition-of-vr-startup-spaces-87449f9f-d2b3-4294-a33c-c7377ba90b48.html">Apple confirms acquisition of VR startup&nbsp;Spaces</a>   4. The thing about bringing people together on a platform (through identity, messaging, and payments) is that humans have a tendency to do really amazing things but also some really nasty things. And one of the big takeaways from this latest tech cycle is how we optimize the former and mitigate the&nbsp;latter. <p>A recent battleground has been Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits platform liability from user behavior.</p><p>But the days of that laissez-faire approach could be coming to the&nbsp;end.</p><p>AT&amp;T is firing the latest salvo in that movement:</p><blockquote>AT&amp;T will tell the Federal Communications Commission that the agency should craft rules to shrink tech’s longstanding legal shield, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: AT&amp;T is a telecom giant and, since buying Time Warner, a major force in media and entertainment — both industries that have butted heads with Silicon Valley. The company is now launching this fresh attack as tech is under attack in Washington.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: On Monday, AT&amp;T is previewing comments it will make to the FCC Wednesday on reinterpreting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields tech companies from liability over content their users&nbsp;post.</blockquote><blockquote>The company will ask the FCC to modify Section 230 so that tech platforms don’t get such broad immunity.</blockquote><blockquote>It will also argue that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google should be forced to be more transparent about the decisions they “make on a daily basis,” like how they rank search results and feature news&nbsp;stories.</blockquote><p>Plus <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-825d6da0-1bc2-406c-ba1b-3e246574c5f2.html">the latest from&nbsp;FB</a>:</p><blockquote>After initially taking no action on militia pages organizing an armed counter-protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Facebook said Wednesday that the pages violate a just-enacted policy that imposes stricter limits on QAnon, militia and other extremist groups.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Facebook’s handling of the issue raises fresh questions about its ability and willingness to enforce policies in time to prevent violence rather than after the&nbsp;fact.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/thailand-protests-social-media">How the Battle for Thailand Is Being Fought on Twitter — CoinDesk</a>  Youtube on platform moderation — <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/responsible-policy-enforcement-during-covid-19">Responsible policy enforcement during&nbsp;Covid-19</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/f">/f</a> — <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/post-no-evil">Post No Evil | Radiolab | WNYC&nbsp;Studios</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/greg</a>— <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gun-sellers-use-new-tactic-to-deal-on-facebook-marketplace-11598270872">WSJ News Exclusive | Gun Sellers Use New Tactic to Deal on Facebook Marketplace</a>   5.

This test asked participants to research and digitally present a day trip to Nairobi for German tourists and order a pizza through a delivery app. Kevin only used Word in his presentation because he was uncomfortable using PowerPoint or Excel, he failed the pizza task because he neglected to download an app, and he struggled to complete the final questionnaire on his own. Many participants let their computer batteries run out during the test, and only 56% managed to order a pizza by downloading an app on their smartphones. <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020.05_Techsavvy-report-on-experimental-qualitative-research.pdf">Cenfri’s test</a> found that, despite assumptions around the tech savviness of Kenyan youth, the country has a dearth of digital&nbsp;skills.</p>Source: Cenfri<p>As countries transition to digital economies, we see increasing digitalisation of personal and professional lives, whether it’s using <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/bangladesh-economy-runs-on-facebook/">Facebook to buy parrots</a> or <a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a> to hire remote software developers. It’s no wonder that improving digital literacy and filling digital skills gaps is top of the agenda in many countries, especially in Africa, the youngest and fastest-growing continent where millions of young people are preparing for the future of&nbsp;work.</p><p><a href="http://www.cariboudigital.net">Caribou Digital </a>and <a href="http://www.cenfri.org">Cenfri</a> have been working on various digital skills and upskilling initiatives in Africa, supported by the <a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/">Mastercard Foundation</a>. We — Isabelle and Annabel — recently came together to facilitate an online discussion on Youth and Digital Skills for the Future, as part of ODI’s ‘<a href="https://www.odi.org/events/17037-global-consultation-youth-and-digital-technologies-sub-saharan-africa">Youth and Digital Technologies in sub-Saharan Africa</a>’ consultation. Incorporating insights from this session, here we share our thoughts on skills gaps for youth in a digital age: What’s happening? What could be done&nbsp;better?</p> What are digital&nbsp;skills? <p>While some jobs require advanced digital skills, such as cloud computing and data analytics, everyone needs basic digital skills to thrive and survive in a digital economy. To better understand what types of digital skills are needed, Cenfri has developed the following categorizations:</p>  Consumer digital skills are the capabilities that all individuals need to function socially, economically and politically in a digital society: using messaging or social media, making an online purchase, filling in an online application for a passport, navigating a&nbsp;search.  Productive digital skills are the skills that individuals require to apply existing digital technologies for productive purposes: selling goods or services via a digital platform, using programs like Excel or Word for business purposes, and online advertising.  Developer digital skills are the skills required to develop, customize or modify digital technologies and digital infrastructure: coding, data analytics and data science, creating and applying AI and IoT technology, cyber security, network administration.  E-leadership digital skills are the skills required to conceive and execute business models to deliver public or private goods by utilizing digital technologies.  <p>In our ODI session, experts shared their thoughts on the challenges and opportunities of digital skills training. Sarah Boateng, Founder of <a href="https://www.igeaenterprise.org/">IGEA Enterprises</a> asserted that “how to browse the net safely and navigate spam are simple but crucial skills which need to be taught.” Basic, or consumer digital skills are mostly self taught, but usually require someone, a friend or an agent, to demonstrate what to do and share tips on what to look for and what to avoid. Muigai Samuel, the ICT Director for Tharaka Nithi County Government in Kenya, added that, above all, the critical skills for young people are “early introduction to basic computing and access to the internet”.</p> Who’s filling digital skills&nbsp;gaps? <p>The training ecosystem is vast, and youth (by some <a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/strategy/#slide5">definitions this includes those in their mid-thirties</a>) are being upskilled on digital skills, both online and in person, through many different channels. Schools to universities, private learning institutions to NGOs, and employers to peers — each has a role to play. We touch on insights from a few&nbsp;below.</p> Schools <p>Some schools are now teaching digital skills, with some governments trying to make ICT part of the core curriculum. Rwanda has taken this one step further, introducing “smart classrooms” and the one-laptop per child initiative. <a href="https://www.chronicles.rw/2020/01/03/implementation-of-smart-classroom-reaches-over-50-schools-education-ministry/">55% of schools have smart classrooms,</a> but lack of electricity has hampered further progress. In 2017 Kenya launched their <a href="http://icta.go.ke/digischool/about-digischool/">DigiSchool program</a>, and South Africa and Ghana have made ICT compulsory. But this is not without its challenges. Cenfri’s recent study on <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020.06_Skills-for-a-digital-economy.pdf">‘Skills for a Digital Economy</a>’ found that the variability in the quality and supply of ICT teachers, a theoretical rather than practical curriculum, and infrastructure challenges — such as <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/03/01/589519475/computer-teacher-with-no-computers-chalks-up-clever-classroom-plan#:~:text=Computer%20Teacher%20With%20No%20Computers%20Chalks%20Up%20Clever%20Classroom%20Plan,-Listen%C2%B7%203%3A08&amp;text=Frimpong%20Innocent-,Owura%20Kwadwo%20Hottish%20illustrates%20a%20window%20of%20Microsoft%20Word%20using,High%20School%20in%20Kumasi%2C%20Ghana.">this Ghanaian ICT class with no computers</a> — hamper these initiatives. Combined with the fact that Africa has the lowest rate of school enrollment and the highest drop-out rate, relying on schools to provide digital skills is beset with problems.</p>DigiSchool Kenya.

However, despite the use of <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/why-covid-crisis-not-edtechs-moment-africa">EdTech doubling in Africa in May</a>, as a response to school closures amid the COVID-19 pandemic, adoption is still low. <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/why-covid-crisis-not-edtechs-moment-africa">One study found</a> that just 19 million out of over 450 million children in Africa are using Edtech, and most of these ‘users’ are consuming it by watching TV. Mobile phones are the primary way in which Africans access the Internet, but the cost of data and low smartphone penetration continue to limit meaningful learning.</p><p>A number of private learning institutions also provide training on digital skills, from coding academies to training institutes <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/03/how-nigerias-decagon-has-taken-up-andelas-baton-in-training-software-engineers/">focused on building the next generation of African software engineers</a>. While <a href="https://techcabal.com/2020/07/14/deep-dive-nigerias-technical-talent-landscape-from-1963-to-2018/">the growth of the technical training industry</a> over the last decades has been impressive, these institutions tend to train higher-educated individuals on specific, more advanced digital skills with the ability to train only a small number each year. These institutions also have to grapple with <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1710480/andela-lays-off-400-developers-what-it-means-for-local-ecosystems/">global competition for such&nbsp;talent</a>.</p><a href="https://decagonhq.com/">Decagon</a> in Nigeria takes software engineers through an intensive six-week training program.

This research specifically looks at the role digital platforms (from e-commerce to ride-hailing) play in filling skills gaps. While difficult, and expensive, <a href="https://www.transformationalupskilling.org/about">their research</a> reveals that all platforms are making heavy investments in training the small-scale vendors and self-employed individuals who earn a living across their platforms. This investment in training reveals the significant skills gaps that exist within the workforce.</p>Driver-partners at the launch of the Uber and Old Mutual Financial Literacy Sessions.

Organisations take it upon themselves to accelerate and bring such talents up to speed on these skills.” — Head of HR,&nbsp;MNO</p> Peer/Self-Learning <p>In Kenya, 83% of all employment opportunities are found in the informal sector. Formal education does not readily supply the unique digital skills needed to navigate these jobs. <a href="https://mse.financedigitalafrica.org/">Caribou Digital’s research into how micro-entrepreneurs in Kenya use digital tools</a> for business found that many digital skills were acquired through peer or self-learning. For example, <a href="https://mse.financedigitalafrica.org/2019/01/upskilling/">YouTube videos</a> and online support groups — like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/591998057577730">Facebook groups for online article writers</a> — on social media platforms are popular modes of skills acquisition.</p><p>The market needs a multi-pronged approach to learning digital skills, firstly to meet the diverse content needs for learning within the four different types of digital skills, and, secondly, to meet the needs of learners from different life situations with different time and money resources. Given the number of youth who are not in education, training, or formal employment, peer and platform learning is an important resource. During the ODI session, Catherine Fitzgibbon, an independent development consultant working on a project with FSDA, described challenges identified in a project to boost smartphone usage with youth in Kenyan slums, “many youth still want a trainer or facilitator to support them in attaining more nebulous skills such as ‘business’. One comment was that they could not ask questions to the online&nbsp;videos.”</p> The skills gap isn’t just a digital&nbsp;one <p>But we shouldn’t just be thinking about digital skills when preparing youth to thrive in the digital age. According to the IFC (2019), roughly 65% of children entering primary school today will end up working in a job that doesn’t exist yet. Fundamental to job-readiness is continuous learning — the ability to adapt and&nbsp;evolve.</p><p>At Caribou Digital we’ve thought a lot about the range of skills needed for the future of work. In doing so we created a simple ‘<a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/skillsforadigitalage/">Skills for a Digital Age’ framework</a> that outlines a broad set of skills — from digital literacy to financial and soft skills — and a list of suitable and innovative delivery channels that support varying levels of digital access. This dynamic framework can be used across any demographic, in any country, when thinking about the skills needed to access meaningful and fulfilling work.</p>Recruitment platform Jobberman<a href="https://www.transformationalupskilling.org/jobberman"> trains their job seekers in soft skills</a>.

Primary schools have the most inclusive reach for children, especially girls, to be exposed to and build confidence with digital&nbsp;skills.  Adaptive curriculums: build skills for employability, through practical projects, problem solving and presentations. Enabling teachers to introduce new ways of learning the content through “real life” projects can build skills in teamwork, communication and critical thinking.  Exposure to digital businesses: industry-linked e-leadership exposure and training opportunities for rising stars with mentorship. The opportunity to be placed in a digitized company to experience how it operates can provide a fast track for&nbsp;youth.  Enabling environment: access to devices and the cost of data remain a challenge for young people. Community hubs or access points provide a way for youth to get online and learn digital skills with access to a human facilitator to ask questions or seek support from. <a href="https://ajiradigital.go.ke/">Ajira</a> and the <a href="https://www.close-the-gap.org/what-we-do/Digitruck">Digitrucks</a> are some examples of&nbsp;this.  <p>The future of work is exciting, but, in order to thrive in the digital age, individuals need to be equipped with a variety of skills, not all of which are strictly digital. Many channels exist to teach these skills, but certain limiting factors — access to smartphones, electricity, literacy — can hinder even the best laid upskilling plans. We hope that by looking at the bigger picture these skills gaps, digital and otherwise, will start to&nbsp;close.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/how-do-we-develop-work-ready-youth-in-a-digital-age-e0ad006d162d">How do we develop work-ready youth in a digital age?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
