 Valuations in our sector are rocking — with no signs of slowing&nbsp;down. <p>Best-in-class, scalable technology solutions that exceed customer expectations are in high&nbsp;demand.</p> Precis <p>2020 saw a rush of adoption and evolution in eCommerce and online presence, not created by but fuelled in pace by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>By sector we are referring to technology, and fast-growing subsectors digital identity and verification needs and facilitations, the financial technology space, and all eCommerce interactions in this next internet era. Fintechs are consistently part of challenger banking now, or neobanking, upending the oligopolistic traditional financial services practice. This sector is bringing along fast-moving partners and symbiotic cutting-edge solutions that meet and drive customer expectations and behaviour. For clear reasons, the need for safe and trusted digital tools is quickly spreading to all arenas, including verified identity.</p> Safe Harbour <p>Tom Kennedy has been remunerated by KABN Systems NA in the past twenty-four months. He holds a long position in KABN (CSE:KABN) at the time of publication.</p><p>His research is intended for the sophisticated investor to assess market developments and company performance and make insights. His comments are in no way intended as a solicitation to trade in any securities. All comments are subject to Risks and Uncertainties outside of the control of the&nbsp;author.</p><p>Please see the Disclosure Statements at the end of document.</p> The US and Canadian tech sectors are in favour right now, sped up by the&nbsp;pandemic <p>In Canada and the US, and in fact across the globe, technology is a sector in significant favour and flux, and is attracting a lot of interest right&nbsp;now.</p><p>Dozens of new companies over the past few months have found private investor groups in multiple seed rounds, and many are hitting the public markets via IPOs and RTOs for more exposure and access to capital. The M&amp;A cycle is seeing a lot of activity too. Incumbent players are moving fast on new developments to bolster their product offerings and keep up with the customer and market demands. Financial investors are searching for the next unicorn, or more likely a puzzle piece positioned to be gobbled up at handsome valuations by leveraging vertical integrations or amalgamating user bases into their&nbsp;own.</p><p>Internet deals in the US led the way in Q4/20, with almost double the dealflow Healthcare saw in second place. While we do not expect this pace to continue its linear growth, we do expect that 1) Canada typically lags the US markets, and 2) the horse has already left the barn. While KABN’s timing appears to have been excellent, execution demand will only increase as these players are expected to demonstrate they are worth premium valuations.</p><p>Figure 1: Q4/20 was all about internet&nbsp;deals</p>Source: PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree™ Report Q4&nbsp;2020. The stock market is supportive of valuations <p>The stock market is very useful for valuation as buyers and sellers commit to pricing every day trading is open. Over the past two years, we have seen a cyclical shift away from certain sectors like commodities, consumer goods, and traditional financial services towards technology.</p><p>There are many ways to illustrate this point. We compare the Dow Jones industrial Average, a metric of the broad US markets, against the Technology subsector, over the past two years, in Figure&nbsp;2:</p><p>Figure 2: Tech Stocks are just beginning to outperform</p>Source: Investing.com; Tom&nbsp;Kennedy. The pandemic didn’t create this upcoming Tech Boom — but it didn’t&nbsp;hurt <p>While the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had huge exogenous impacts on markets and consumer habits, we contend it did not create this evolution. That said, it has clearly sped things&nbsp;up.</p><p>One anecdotal way to explain adoption is that inevitably the customer is likely to embrace a more convenient, safer, cheaper, or better alternative brought on by technology eventually. The exact timing however is often difficult to pinpoint. During the pandemic, many people chose to or were strongly encouraged to purchase food online. This may be an activity they had never engaged in before and might not even have the technology. So they end up buying groceries that arrive at their door in good time and good order, or a prepared meal, and they enjoy it, and are now committed online shoppers. According to 451 Research, a boutique eCommerce research firm in the US, eCommerce spending rose by 23% year over year in 2020 over 2019. These kinds of numbers represent rapid adoption that will not reverse to pre-COVID levels.</p><p>We would note the broader market has also done very well during the pandemic, which is helpful to enhancing access to capital for any subsector.</p><p>A different way to look at the relative performance of tech versus the broader market is seen comparing the value of $1 invested (all figures USD for this point) on 23 March, 2020 to 22 January, 2021. That dollar would be worth $1.95 now, relative to $1.67 for a buck in the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>This represents an alpha, or relative outperformance, of the tech subsector, at 16.8% over that timeframe which is approximately 10 months of data. A couple of caveats are that we have chosen the US market for more robust data but further believe the US market is an excellent proxy for Canada. That said we have not normalized for the exchange rate, but there are so many things from elections to interest rate movements and virtually infinite economic minutiae that affect all durations of currency fluctuation. In addition, Canada typically lags the US, particularly in market developments. This element enhances our point if true and furthermore contributes to the benefits of obtaining a wider US investment audience both from a valuation and adoption perspective.</p><p>Figure 3: Value of $1 invested at pandemic market&nbsp;bottom</p>Source: Investing.com; Tom&nbsp;Kennedy. The Customer will ultimately drive adoption — and that’s where we believe KABN can&nbsp;excel <p>Global professional services firm Accenture surveyed 47,000 customers on their digital banking practices in their Accenture 2020 Global Banking Consumer Study. Our interpretation is that the customers can be segmented logically by range of adoption, from Traditionalists to Pioneers, and they are rapidly adopting digital interactions with a focus on humanized elements (“Congratulations, your loan is approved!”) with security and online threats being a major theme. Note that ‘humanized’ and ‘personalized’ are two different important factors. Humanized means counteracting the user feeling their requests are being served by a computer program, while personalized refers to a customized experience with their online interactions that feels tailored to their needs, attitudes, and utility rather than fees seemingly for a beige product suite with few alternatives. Well, guess what incumbents: there are fast-moving disruptors with better and better mousetraps.</p><p>Trust in interactions has also fallen precipitously as seen in by the survey’s results, led by bank institutions and insurance, but broadly across all major categories. Trust in banking fell to 37% in 2020 (from 51% of customers trusting their bank in 2018), Insurers fell to 32% (40% — 2018) and Online Payments to 21% (from 30% Trust in&nbsp;2018).</p><p>KABN is uniquely placed to play a role in all these personalized, customer-centric interactions. The customer stands to gain online safety and confidence, the customer owns and can transparently monetize their own identity, and Liquid Avatar stands to be a customized key, wallet, and armour to open empowered and expanded online presence and functionality.</p> Two recent transactions — the announced sales of Kount and SoFi — indicate takeout valuation goalposts <p>Two relevant transactions were announced thus far in 2021. The first was Kount, which announced an acquisition for US$640 MM in cash by Equifax (EFX:NYSE). The second was the acquisition of fintech startup SoFi for US$8.65 BB by one of Social Capital’s special purpose acquisition corporations.</p><p>So to valuation: in each of these cases, the takeout premiums were impressive, and de-emphasize revenues in favour of what SoFi refers to as “WINNER TAKES MOST.” We know what this means. My thesis is that the firms with best-in-class products that are in a position to respond to the massive growth in online eCommerce are going to share a huge pie, not take the whole thing. And the value they are in a position to create is driving buyers to pay up for years of as-yet unrealized performance.</p><p>Take <a href="https://kount.com/">Kount</a>, a leading provider of anti-fraud solutions to thousands of North American&nbsp;brands.</p><p>They have two significant assets, one being a robust proprietary data library and the other being a “secret shopper” type process whereby they test your company’s system for fraud protection. Kount then operates as a high end security consulting firm with bespoke solutions for clients’ eCommerce suites.</p><p>This drove a valuation we estimate at &gt;13x trailing twelve months’ (TTM) revenue, a number that obviously demonstrates the value of their non-revenue performance. They appear cash flow breakeven for at least another full year, as Equifax speaks to the value they will add in over two years of future performance as part of the basis of their purchase price. Equifax constantly runs the risk of becoming a dinosaur every passing day and needs the shot in the arm that is found in new and promising technology. That said, they have the liquidity to acquire new products and teams rather than build them in-house so they can quickly leverage for their existing customers and cross-sell for internal use and customer acquisition alike. Equifax is no stranger to security challenges across their own customers, being dealt a blow in 2017 over a security breach that exposed over 150 million customers’ private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Social Capital’s offer to acquire <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a> represents a significant going-public premium. SoFi is widely recognized as a central market disruptor in financial services right now. This transaction represents an acquisition by a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, not dissimilar to an RTO (reverse takeover) method of going public. This is effectively a financial transaction with a lofty premium in spite of the lack of any synergies or strategic development other than going&nbsp;public.</p><p>SoFi is a fintech pioneer that is disrupting the banks, being vastly more customer friendly and customer focused, and offering a far lower cost model given the internet infrastructure rather than bricks and mortar banking. The valuation being paid by venture capital firm Social Capital implies 13.6x 2025E forecast Adjusted Net Income on figures released by Social Capital. To provide a nearer term perspective, this implies a valuation of 13.9x 2020E Adjusted Net&nbsp;Revenue.</p><p>This means the buyer has already pre-paid for five full years of success culminating in projected results to be announced around now in 2026, at a 50%+ percent premium to current banking institutions’ one-year forward earnings. In the case of SoFi, the SPAC shell saw its value soar, meaning investors see more room above and beyond the premium’s baked in accomplishments. We would also note there are normal considerable growth milestones yet to be accomplished by SoFi that their growth relies upon, notably the receipt of a federal banking&nbsp;license.</p> Summary <p>In summation, we believe the market is entering a new period of non-standard valuations for best-in-class technology that delivers on customer expectations. We expect this will continue all through 2021 and into the foreseeable future.</p><p>We will leave with a parting thought: Merriam-Webster Dictionary has added the word “crowdfunding” for 2021. Things are developing so fast even the dictionary is trying to stay relevant.</p><p>KABN is potentially well-positioned to thrive in this fast-paced environment.</p><p>© 2021 Thomas Kennedy.

<p>Hundreds of millions of cards have been stolen from online retailers, banks and payments companies before being sold for cryptocurrency on dozens of online marketplaces. According to Elliptic’s analysis, the founder of one of the most popular carding marketplaces, Joker’s Stash, has retired having amassed a fortune of over $1 billion.</p> 
<p>Every time you make a purchase with a credit or debit card, your card details are transmitted and stored in computer systems. Many of the major hacks of retailers and other companies are motivated by getting hold of these card credentials.</p> 
<p>Stolen cards have value because they can be used to purchase high-value items or gift cards, which can then be resold for cash. This process is known as “carding”, and has become a key part of the cybercriminal’s playbook. Carding is very profitable in its own right, but it is also used to help launder and cash-out cryptocurrency obtained through other types of cybercrime.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Joker’s Stash - the King of Carding</p> 
<p>Over the past six years, Joker’s Stash rose to become the largest online seller of stolen credit cards and identity data. It is an example of a carding AVC (automated vending cart), which allows large volumes of cards to be sorted, filtered and purchased for Bitcoin with immediate delivery. In the image below you can see these cards categorised and searchable by country, bank, expiry date and other attributes. The going price for a single card on Joker’s Stash ranges from $1 to $150, with those at the upper end coming complete with the cardholder’s name, address and social security number.</p>

 What We’re Building in 2021, and&nbsp;Why  Summary <p>This post describes <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean’s</a> 2021 product roadmap. It reflects our shift from achieving early product-market fit (0 →1), to that of traction (1 →N). The roadmap includes fixing gas costs via multiple chains, Data Farming to further incentivize data consumption, fine-grained permissions, and streaming data services. There will be continued improvements in the core Ocean developer tools, Ocean Market, and OceanDAO.</p>Ocean 2021 Roadmap&nbsp;Summary Outline <p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. We describe Ocean’s maturation from targeting product-market fit (0→1) towards traction (1→N). We then describe how we think about traction, then drill down in further and further detail from key performance indicators, to traction hypotheses, and finally to the 2021 product roadmap by quarter. Let’s get&nbsp;started!</p> From 0→ 1 (The&nbsp;Past) <p>From Ocean’s inception until the end of 2020, the focus for Ocean was getting product-market fit (“0 → 1”) around <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">unlocking data</a> [1]. In early 2020, we published our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">2020 roadmap</a>, and by the end of 2020 we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-in-2020-c5297e73584f">had met&nbsp;it</a>.</p><p>Let’s review the major items. In fall 2020, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v3-is-now-live-b47c0e73f52a">released</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-posts-413b2dd33e8f">Ocean V3</a>. It was a huge release for us. It included two products to publish / buy / consume / stake on datasets / services:</p>  <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market webapp</a> — for data publishers, consumers, and&nbsp;stakers  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean developer tools</a> — core software libraries &amp; contracts for developers to integrate with other apps or build wholly new&nbsp;apps  <p>In Dec 2020, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">released</a>:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki">OceanDAO</a> — a community-curated grants DAO for growth &amp; long-term sustainability.  <p>The reception to all three products has been enthusiastic. There are tens of teams building on Ocean core software, Ocean Market has hundreds of datasets with more than €5M TVL [2], and OceanDAO has a steady cadence of monthly funding cycles to teams which promise positive value. There’s also steady chat in Telegram and Discord channels surrounding all three products, and a vibrant weekly videochat town&nbsp;hall.</p><p>The most important outcome was: People started to treat data as an&nbsp;asset.</p><p>We’d designed for this, by wrapping each dataset as an ERC20 token (datatoken), for use in DeFi. MetaMask became a data wallet, and Balancer a data DEX. People launched new data assets as Initial Data Offerings. People bought data assets not just to consume, but also to speculate. People staked on data AMM pools, not just to curate but also to provide liquidity. The perennial question “how do you price data?” got answered definitively: the market prices the data. Trading volume is over 100 times the consume volume; this is a good thing because trading and liquidity are preconditions for markets to form. We just witnessed the birth of the open Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p> To 1→ N (The&nbsp;Future) <p>In short, Ocean has a first toehold in product-market fit (“0→1”). Data is being treated as an asset; this is the foundation going forward. Many users are able to get real value from Ocean’s core product offerings. There’s still room to improve each of these products, for more users. Let’s focus on “more users”. The overall goal is ubiquity — we want Ocean to be used everywhere as key IT infrastructure for the planet, side-by-side with DNS, Bitcoin, and other emerging blockchains and protocols. To achieve ubiquity, we need sustained growth over long periods of time. The label ”traction” encapsulates the goal of growth over time. Therefore the focus for Ocean from 2021 onwards is traction (“1→ N”). Importantly, $OCEAN is <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">engineered</a> to grow as traction&nbsp;grows.</p><p>We’ve already started on the traction path, by having rapid iterations with users, to get feedback and translate that into improvements in each of the products (and all the planning, design, construction, etc that happens in between). For example, Ocean Market has seen remarkable evolution in just the few months it’s been live, due to these rapid cycles — from bug fixes to handling fraudulent actors to better-aligning incentives of publishers with&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>That’s a near-term approach to improve traction. We can structure this more rigorously for longer time&nbsp;periods.</p> Ocean Traction&nbsp;Strategy <p>Here’s our traction strategy (inspired by the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369">Traction</a>):</p>  Have target key performance indicators (KPIs)  Have hypotheses of how to grow those&nbsp;KPIs  Try the most promising hypotheses, and observe how they&nbsp;do  Double down on the hypotheses that do the best and prune the&nbsp;rest.  Once those experience diminishing returns, repeat the process with new hypotheses  <p>The next three sections outline (i) the KPIs, (ii) hypotheses, and (iii) specific plans respectively.</p> 2021 KPIs <p>In Dec 2020 and early Jan 2021, the Ocean core team met several times for planning 2021. Traction was the name of the&nbsp;game.</p><p>The following traction-oriented KPIs emerged. We aim to grow each of these indicators.</p><p>Data consumer/provider traction</p>  Value of data consumed in USD. This is particularly important — it’s a good indicator of value being created in this new data&nbsp;economy  Number of datasets / services&nbsp;offered  <p>Staking &amp; DeFi traction:</p>  Total Value Locked of OCEAN &amp; datatokens  Number of DeFi protocols with OCEAN &amp; datatokens as first-class citizens  <p>Developer &amp; community traction:</p>  Number of active high-quality dapps using&nbsp;Ocean  Number of GitHub contributors, external maintainers &amp; support, active ambassadors  Number of community members, and content&nbsp;creators  Value of monthly grants distributed by OceanDAO, while retaining quality  <p>Enterprise/government traction:</p>  Number of engagements. Specifically, for a dedicated handful of partners, maximize their success towards real-world production deployment   2021 Traction Hypotheses <p>With these KPIs in hand, we brainstormed on hypotheses of ways to drive them. (And of course we also included many ideas from the past too.) There were many great ideas! We then filtered to our favorites. Here’s the distillation of that, grouped according to three pillars: (I) Bottom-up, (II) Top-down, and (III) DeFi. Let’s elaborate on each&nbsp;pillar.</p><p>I. Bottom-up: Ocean Market users, developers, startups. Main activities:</p>  Drive growth of Ocean Market. Improve user experience (UX), including reducing gas costs. Further optimize incentive structure. Add virality. Help data publishers, consumers, and liquidity providers make money. Provide arbitrage opportunities.  Help people build with Ocean libraries. Improve developer experience (DX). Help teams make&nbsp;money.  Fund teams for building, outreach, unlocking data. Via OceanDAO (community-curated grants), Shipyard (core-team curated grants), and Data Economy Challenge (prizes). It’s especially important to grow OceanDAO, since it will decentralize Ocean further and position Ocean for long-term sustainability. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Details&nbsp;here</a>.  Integrations. Integrate more datatoken / service types: streaming data, oracles, etc. Deploy on more chains: Eth → many (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">details here</a>). Integrate to more crypto apps: wallets, DEXes, DAOs, and more. Integrate to existing AI tools like scikit-learn, Anaconda, TensorFlow, OpenMined, and&nbsp;OpenML.  <p>II. Top-down: enterprises, governments. Main activities:</p>  Business development and services support, starting with POCs but leading to live deployments on massive scale. Help enterprises turn their data into value, including data “on their books” rather than as a liability. Help governments implement data policies with the help of&nbsp;Ocean.  Service partners. Growing a network of service partners to support these enterprise and government activities (to offload reliance on core&nbsp;team).  <p>III. DeFi. Main activities:</p>  Data Farming. It’s similar to liquidity mining but emphasizes consuming data (versus pure speculation). <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Details&nbsp;here</a>.  Work closely with DeFi projects. For each, get OCEAN as a first-class citizen, then follow up with datatokens. Conduct many experiments, from stablecoins to insurance, and double-down on what works&nbsp;best.  Data DeFi “snowballs”. Incentivize DeFi applications that make more money with more data, leading to a positive feedback loop on Ocean DeFi usage (“snowball effect”). This includes arb bots, trading systems, and yield farming tools that use AI for decision&nbsp;making.  <p>These traction pillars complement each other. All three have real-world use cases. All three involve users that have data, and want data. Bottom-up has low latency in feedback (hours or days), enabling rapid improvements in the products. Its exponential nature promises huge impact over the long term. Top-down demonstrates use cases on large brand names, typically has large numbers attached, and the added credibility helps influence policymaking around data. While top-down may not scale as well, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">doing non-scalable things</a> can really help traction in early days. DeFi has some of the best aspects of the others: like bottom-up it’s low latency and exponential in nature, and like top-down it has large numbers attached. And, it’s&nbsp;fun.</p> 2021 Ocean Product Roadmap, by&nbsp;Quarter <p>With the traction-oriented KPIs and traction hypotheses in hand, the Ocean core teams for product, ecosystem, etc did extensive planning. We reconciled this with the needs of our enterprise collaborators.</p><p>Below is what we arrived at, for our 2021 plans, organized quarterly. These plans support the three traction pillars, and in turn (we hope) help to drive the KPIs. We also reserve the right to change our plans based on learnings in the rapidly evolving crypto environment.</p><p>The plans focus on Ocean products; dovetailing this there are extensive activities in ecosystem, enterprise, and communications towards the 2021 traction&nbsp;goals.</p> Q1/2021 Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q1/2021. The highlight is fixing gas costs, and Compute-to-Data in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p>  Fix gas costs. Gas costs on Ethereum mainnet have become exceedingly high <a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1358110993495318528">and may not abate</a>. We are addressing this by deploying Ocean contracts and running Ocean Market on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">&gt;1 chains</a>. <a href="https://www.purestake.com/news/moonbeam-and-ocean-protocol-partner-to-bring-a-new-data-economy-to-the-polkadot-ecosystem/">Moonbeam</a> and other chains are in the works. Each chain will include an OCEAN bridge to Ethereum mainnet. At least one will be ready by end of&nbsp;Q1.  Ocean Market: has <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Compute-to-Data</a>. This enables buying &amp; selling of private data from Ocean Market webapp&nbsp;itself.  Ocean Market: allow more than one pool for each datatoken. This helps migrating from one pool to another, and is a first step towards Ocean Market linking to other AMM pools, order book based exchanges, and&nbsp;more.  Ocean Market: fewer bugs, faster. This includes continued bug fixes, use TheGraph for Total Value Locked (<a href="https://messari.io/article/how-to-interpret-total-value-locked-tvl-in-defi">TVL</a>), and&nbsp;more.  OceanDAO: streamline flow to reduce friction for people creating proposals and voting. Grow the amount of funding, while <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/On-ROI">ensuring quality projects</a>.  Ecosystem, enterprise and communications activities that dovetail the products. This includes experiments in DeFi initiatives using OCEAN or datatokens.   Q2/2021 Targets <p>We have the following goals for Q2/2021. The highlights are the first deployment of Data Farming, an OCEAN-backed stablecoin in Ocean Market, and supporting more than one datatoken type.</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data Farming</a>: first deployment. This program incentivizes data consume volume. We will start by allocating a modest amount of OCEAN, then allocate more in each cycle as data consume volume grows. As we learn, we will refine the&nbsp;program.  OCEAN-backed stablecoin in Ocean Market. Having prices and liquidity set (optionally) in a stablecoin reduces variance due to fluctuations in OCEAN. A stablecoin backed by OCEAN, like <a href="https://medium.com/opendao/ocean-opendao-uma-a-new-stablecoin-269241dd8c5d">$OceanO by OpenDAO</a>, helps align interests between Ocean Market users and the broader Ocean community.  Architecture for more than one datatoken type. This refactor includes smart contract changes and a security audit. It allows us to move metadata to the ERC20 contract itself, which we will also do. The added flexibility will make possible a variety of datatoken types, including more fine-grained permissions, fee rate flexibility, and&nbsp;more.  Multi-chain: improve support by deploying to more chains, and enabling Ocean Market users to see data assets across several chains at once. Over time (not necessarily this quarter) support bridges for datatokens and cross-chain liquidity by leveraging developments in cross-chain technology.  OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.   Q3/2021 Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q3/2021. The highlights are ramping up Data Farming, fine-grained permissions, and supporting more data services.</p>  Ramp up Data Farming. We will build on the learnings from Q2 to further scale up the OCEAN allocated, to further catalyze data consume&nbsp;volume.  3rd Party Markets: fine-grained permissions using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role-Based Access Control</a> (RBAC) while retaining datatoken ERC20 mental model. Helps marketplace instances to control which actors can publish assets in that marketplace instance, view assets, and consume data assets. This is for 3rd party markets; Ocean Market will remain as open-ended as possible.  Data Services: support two more data services as data assets. Possibilities include WebSockets (streaming data), Chainlink, TheGraph, Streamr, GraphQL streaming data, and more; we will prioritize as we&nbsp;go.  Ocean Market: Ratings &amp; Comments. On-chain non-gameable ratings and comments for data&nbsp;assets.  Multi-chain, OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.  <p>Q4/2021 Targets</p><p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q4/2021. The highlights are better staking and helping the community to monetize&nbsp;better.</p>  Better staking. People can stake OCEAN in data pools without having to buy the data asset in the process. This will use Balancer V2. In general, it will better align the incentives of publishers, consumers, and liquidity providers / stakers / curators.  Help community monetize. For people running their own marketplaces (as dedicated apps, or in wallets, etc), enable potential for fees in publishing, swapping, staking, and consuming, with flexibility on setting the&nbsp;fees.  Market: trustless &amp; convenient urls, to retain Ocean Market’s current convenience while removing its having brief custody of&nbsp;urls.  Data Farming, Data Services, Multi-chain, OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.   Conclusion <p>Up until the end of 2020, our goal was to get initial product-market fit for Ocean (0→1). Now that we have a foothold on that, our focus going forward is traction (1→N). This article presented our KPIs, our hypotheses of how to achieve those, and finally specific product plans towards implementing hypotheses.</p> Notes <p>[1] “0 to 1” is a concept popularized by Peter Thiel in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the&nbsp;Future</a>.</p><p>[2] For an up-to-date value of Total Value Locked, please refer to the stats at the bottom of <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/</a> page</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

  <p>Hi everyone and welcome to chapter 14 of 2020! It’s been a little while since we talked about standards for passwordless so we’re excited to tell you about some new enhancements and features in FIDO2 land that you'll start seeing in the wild in the next few months!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
 Specification Status 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) Level 2</a> specification is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Process-20200915/#RecsCR">Candidate Recommendation</a> at the W3C. "Level 2" essentially means major version number 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The version 2.1 of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20201208/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20201208.html">Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)</a> specification is a Release Draft at the FIDO Alliance. This means the spec is in a public review period before final publication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new draft versions are on their way to becoming the next wave of FIDO functionality (as of the writing of this blog, we support Level 1 of WebAuthn and CTAP version 2.0). We think you might want to hear about what we think is especially fun about WebAuthn L2 and CTAP 2.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enterprise Attestation (EA) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enterprise Attestation is a new feature coming as part of WebAuthn L2 and CTAP 2.1 that enables binding of an authenticator to an account using a persistent identifier, similar to a smart card today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO privacy standards require that "a FIDO device does not have a global identifier within a particular website" and "a FIDO device must not have a global identifier visible across websites". EA is designed to be used exclusively in enterprise-like environments where a trust relationship exists between devices and/or browsers and the relying party via management and/or policy. If EA is requested by a Relying Partying (RP) and the OS/browser is operating outside an enterprise context (personal browser profile, unmanaged device, etc), the browser is expected to prompt the user for consent and provide a clear warning about the potential for tracking via the persistent identifier being shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authenticators can be configured to support Vendor-facilitated and/or Platform-managed Enterprise Attestation. Vendor-facilitated EA involves an authenticator vendor hardcoding a list of Relying Party IDs (RP IDs) into the authenticator firmware as part of manufacturing. This list is immutable (aka non-updateable). An enterprise attestation is only provided to RPs in that list. Platform-managed EA involves an RP ID list delivered via enterprise policy (ex: managed browser policy, mobile application management (MAM), mobile device management (MDM) and is enforced by the platform.</p>

 Authenticator Credential Management and Bio Enrollment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credential Management is part of CTAP 2.1 and allows management of discoverable credentials (aka resident keys) on an authenticator. Management can occur via a browser, an OS settings panel, an app or a CLI tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of how the Credential Management capability is baked into Chrome 88 on macOS (chrome://settings/securityKeys). Here I can manage my PIN, view discoverable credentials, add and remove fingerprints (assuming the authenticator has a fingerprint reader!) and factory reset my authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking on "Sign-in data" shows the discoverable credentials on the authenticator and allows me to remove them. This security key has an Azure AD account and an identity for use with <a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/">SSH</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bio Enrollment allows the browser, client, or OS to aid in configuring biometrics on authenticators that support them. This security key has one finger enrolled. I can either remove the existing finger or add more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of authenticator credential management via a CLI tool, <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/">ykman</a> from Yubico.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Set Minimum PIN Length and Force Change PIN 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CTAP 2.1 allows an RP to require a minimum PIN length on the authenticator. If the existing PIN does not meet the RP’s requirements, a change PIN flow can be initiated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An authenticator can also be configured with a one-time use PIN that must be changed on first use. This is an additional layer of protection when an authenticator is pre-provisioned by an administrator and then needs to be sent to an end user. The temporary PIN can be communicated to the end user out of band. We see this being used in conjunction with Enterprise Attestation to create a strong relationship between an authenticator and a user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Always Require User Verification (AlwaysUV) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AlwaysUV is part of CTAP 2.1 and allows the user to configure their authenticator to always prompt for user verification (PIN, biometric, etc), even when the Relying Party does not ask for it. This adds an extra layer of protection by ensuring all credentials on the authenticator require the same verification method.</p>

 Virtual Authenticator DevTool 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one is not tied to updates of either specification but we love it and wanted to share! Chrome and Edge (version 87+) now include a virtual authenticator as part of DevTools. It started as a Chromium extension back in 2019 and is now native! Oh, and the <a href="https://github.com/google/virtual-authenticators-tab">code is on Github</a>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a great tool for testing, debugging and learning! Try it with one of the awesome WebAuthn test sites: <a href="https://webauthnsample.azurewebsites.net/">Microsoft WebAuthn Sample App</a>, <a href="https://webauthn.io/">WebAuthn.io</a>, <a href="https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn-technical/registration">Yubico WebAuthn Demo</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access the tool, open Developer Tools ( <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts">F12 or Option + Command</a><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts">+ I</a> ), click the Menu icon on the top right (…) then More tools and WebAuthn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling the virtual authenticator environment will allow you to create a new authenticator by picking a protocol (CTAP2 or U2F), transport (USB, Bluetooth, NFC or internal), resident key (discoverable) and user verification support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As new credentials are created, you’ll see them listed and the sign count will increase as the credential is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consumers can leverage their financial data to improve their financial health, gain access to financial services, and enhance control over their finances. In order to benefit from these financial outcomes, consumers provide access to their financial data to end users through data access providers. If data access providers truly want to empower consumers, they must protect that data and ensure that control of the data remains firmly in the hands of the consumer. And a commitment to protect data in word only isn’t enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data access providers that share financial data they have assembled for the purpose of lending, insurance, and employment, must adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Operating as a Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA) is the best way to ensure a consumer-first lending approach that both protects and empowers borrowers. Anything less is just words.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this in greater detail.&nbsp;</p>
 The FCRA and Financial Data Sharing 
<p><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/report-basics/fair-credit-reporting-act-fcra/">The Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> protects consumers by establishing and protecting the right for individuals to dispute inaccurate data in consumer reports and get those errors fixed. In order to maintain transparency and ensure accuracy, the Act also requires that consumers have access at any time to any personal financial data provided for credit or insurance eligibility decisioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While FCRA has historically applied to credit bureaus and certain specialty CRAs, like tenant screening and medical information companies, the Act has a broad scope of coverage and is not limited to traditional credit reporting or a narrow set of CRAs. Third-party data access providers that power financial data permissioning between lenders and consumers use a different type of data sharing model for which FCRA compliance provides an equally critical component of protecting consumers when they access credit and other financial services.</p>
<p>As it stands, the FCRA applies to consumer reports that<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-reporting-agency.asp"> CRAs</a> provide to third parties for certain permissible purposes described in the FCRA, such as determining a consumer’s eligibility for credit or insurance. Consumer reports can only be provided and used for these permissible purposes. If data access providers, also known as data aggregators or data agents, are assembling a consumer’s financial data and sharing it for the purpose of credit or insurance decisioning, shouldn’t those providers be considered CRAs, and shouldn’t the FCRA apply to their data sharing?</p>
<p>In order to protect and empower consumers, we think so.</p>
 Empowering Consumers with Compliant Data Sharing 
<p>FCRA compliance is the only sure way to guarantee fairness, accuracy, and transparency when data access providers assemble consumer financial data and provide it to lenders or insurers to make credit or insurance decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A current regulatory interpretation of the FCRA suggests that an organization does not become a CRA when it forwards financial data to a third party at a consumer’s request because they are simply engaging in “permission-based sharing” on behalf of the consumer. Finicity believes this interpretation of the FCRA was meant to address different circumstances, such as where a mortgage broker forwards a consumer’s application and credit report to prospective mortgage lenders at the consumer’s request. This and other “conduit”-like functions fall outside the FCRA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not believe, however, that this interpretation was intended to cover situations where a data access provider or other party “assembles” consumer data to provide to financial data users. Such a broad reading of the “permission-based sharing” interpretation would run counter to the purpose of the Act and undermine the protections the FCRA was created to uphold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can’t data access providers simply promise protections to consumers? Such assurances are of course important, but can vary from provider to provider. Consumers are best served when all data access providers are held to a common standard of consumer protection. Operating as a CRA requires that data access providers adhere to the FCRA and provide specific dispute and disclosure processes that enable consumers to access and view their data, dispute any errors, and understand how their data is being used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a data access provider is delivering consumer data it has assembled to creditors for use in credit decisioning, and is not functioning as a CRA, it is not adhering to the FCRA and not protecting consumers as well as it could.</p>
<p>With open banking and digital financial services continuing to pick up speed, it’s more crucial than ever that the industry demonstrate that the consumer-permissioned data sharing process is conducted fairly, accurately, and with transparency for the consumer. Those positive outcomes follow when a data access provider, in appropriate circumstances, is functioning as a CRA and is legally required to adhere to the FCRA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only when such protections are in place can consumers reliably enjoy the empowerment and improved financial outcomes they deserve. And the financial services industry can similarly benefit from the growth and innovation that comes from the increased acceptance of leveraging consumer-permissioned financial data for the benefit of consumers.

<p>Finicity releases detailed analysis affirming that data aggregators should be deemed CRAs and subject to FCRA requirements</p>
<p>SALT LAKE CITY, Utah – February 11, 2021 – Finicity, a Mastercard company and leading provider of open banking solutions, has produced a detailed whitepaper with analysis showing why the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) should apply to providers of data aggregation services (“data agents”) in certain circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCRA protects consumers by establishing and protecting the right for individuals to dispute inaccurate data in consumer reports and get those errors fixed. The growth of consumer-permissioned data sharing in lending, insurance, and employment means that FCRA compliance will become a critical component of consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As Open Banking puts consumers in control of their financial data and gives lenders a more complete view of consumers’ creditworthiness, it’s critical that the sharing of financial data is conducted fairly, accurately, and with the utmost transparency,” said Steve Smith, Co-founder and CEO of Finicity. “Leveraging the protections of the FCRA will provide a vital regulatory framework that gives everyone in the financial ecosystem confidence in all of these areas, as well as manageable, familiar compliance standards for the data agents behind growing aggregation capabilities for underwriting use cases.”</p>
<p>Lenders have increasingly relied on new forms of financial data, such as information about a consumer’s bank account transactions, which can enable better, more effective credit-decisioning for lenders. This data supplements the traditional credit score to expand the lenders’ view of a borrower’s financial health, and ultimately stands to increase financial inclusion. Not only does this financial data give lenders a more thorough credit review process, it also empowers consumers with control over their own financial data, which they can grant or revoke access to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the emergence of third-party data aggregators and their ability to provide financial data for the purposes of credit decisioning, FCRA compliance is essential to protecting the consumer,” said Chi Chi Wu, Staff Attorney with the National Consumer Law Center.</p>
<p>Finicity believes this new credit process also necessitates that it function in concert with fair reporting principles: data should be accurate, consumers should have access to their own data, and they should know when and how their data is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December 2019, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the federal banking agencies released an Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit Underwriting. In the Interagency Statement, the agencies recognized the consumer benefits of considering cash flow data in credit decisions and noted how consumers “can expressly permission access to their cash flow data”—through data agents—to enhance transparency and consumer control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFPB is expected to propose new rules around consumer-authorized access to financial data in early 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity is releasing a detailed white paper “FCRA and Data Agents” with analysis of the mechanics and benefits of FCRA compliance for data aggregators. The full white paper can be downloaded at:&nbsp; <a href="https://info.finicity.com/fcra-data-agents/">https://info.finicity.com/fcra-data-agents/</a></p>

Privileged accounts have traditionally been given to administrators to access critical data and applications.

One area in sharp focus is DevOps support which has become essential to many organizations looking to become more responsive and innovative. Application developers and other agile teams increasingly need privileged access to essential tools, and several PAM vendors are responding to this demand.</p>

<p>Press Release</p>



<p>J Cromack, Managing Director of MyLife Digital, has been named as one of DataIQ’s top 100 most influential people in data. Cromack was acknowledged for his ongoing dedication to protecting data rights.</p>



<p>The DataIQ power table, developed in partnership with data visualisation expert Tableau, has been used to track the rise of data scientists, data governance professionals, and chief data and analytics officers since 2014.</p>



<p>Cromack was recognised as a key influencer in the data space, ranking amongst the most prominent data enablers on the country’s first and only fully-curated list of the most powerful data and analytics practitioners. “As an enabler, my focus is on helping my clients maintain the utility of, and build, their first party data assets and ensure the data is fully compliant with global data protection regulations,” says Cromack of his role in data protection and privacy.</p>



<p>Together, both Cromack and MyLife Digital are fighting to change the way that consumer data is handled, advocating for greater transparency and control on behalf of customers. As part of this, MyLife Digital has created a scalable consent and preference management platform that empowers consumers to make smarter, more informed decisions over how their data is used, while also supporting businesses in their efforts to build stronger relationships and instil trust in consumers through secure data management.</p>



<p>He said, “I’m delighted to be included in the DataIQ 100, it is an incredible accolade and excellently reflects the amazing work that the team at MyLife Digital have been doing to help organisations adopt more ethical frameworks to use personal data. We’re very proud to have built great technology that helps businesses grow trust through data understanding while empowering consumers to make decisions on how their data can and can’t be used.”</p>



<p>The coveted spot on the DataIQ 100 list comes just months after Cromack’s nod at the 2020 DataIQ awards, where the data expert was named&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataiq.co.uk/articles/articles/dataiq-awards-2020---privacy-and-trust-champion-j-cromack-mylife-digital">Privacy and Trust Champion</a>&nbsp;of the year. He was recognised for his ongoing support in protecting individual data rights in the digital world, and for his appreciation of the importance of building trust between organisations and their customers. Cromack was also a runner up in the Data for Good category.</p>



<p>As one of the country’s top data influencers, Cromack is planning to use his status to better promote the importance of privacy UX and data ethics, which the MyLife Digital team predict will be hot topics throughout 2021. Data ethics is a key area of interest, and Cromack and his team are currently developing plans to educate businesses on this subject, shifting away from tracking technologies and moving closer towards authenticated journeys. MyLife Digital is on track to release a Data Ethics whitepaper in the spring.</p>

So,&nbsp;if you don’t have Australian&nbsp;citizenship or&nbsp;permanent residency,&nbsp;or if you are representing a&nbsp;recruitment agency or an&nbsp;offshore/provider, then this&nbsp;is not for you. We understand you may be an awesome candidate, or have access to great candidates, but we will not consider such applications at this time.




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a Graduate or Junior UX/UI Designer for our Australian team, where you can help shape the API-of-Me.




 




What is the <a href="https://dev.meeco.me/">API-of-Me</a> you might ask?




 




It is an emerging platform that enables the collection, protection and exchange of personal data. Our main objective is to provide a suite of developer tools and APIs to companies and organisations to allow them to build privacy first solutions




 




We are passionate about building a new economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organizations enter a win-win relationship and build a new, more meaningful relationship. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more.




 




Don’t hesitate to apply, no matter what your background is. We would like to build a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia and Belgium, and collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, each with a unique personal data story.




 About the&nbsp;Role 




This is an exciting opportunity to start your UX career with a technology start-up working to improve the world! Meeco is a growing team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK and we are looking for a junior UX/UI designer to join our Adelaide based design team.




 




This role is ideally suited to someone who doesn’t necessarily have commercial experience in the UX field, but is excited and passionate about user experience and how design can help humanise technology.




 




You will be working closely with our Chief of Design, and you will be involved in the full design process. The following will help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis:




 





  Help to gather and evaluate user requirements  Conduct UX research  Brainstorm and workshop design solutions  Contribute to developing user personas, customer journey maps, storyboards and user flows  Contribute to wireframing and high-fidelity designs  Contribute to creating design-based prototypes  





 




We use a variety of industry standard tools including Figma. It is not a requirement that you have experience in using any of these tools, but a willingness to learn and self-directed education is required.




 





 About You 





 




We are looking for someone who is either studying or has recently finished a course in UX or similar fields. You will have worked on at least two UX projects that you are proud of and be willing to present them and explain your decisions (these can be personal projects or student projects).




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the center, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical or design solutions.




 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have great mentors to show you the ropes. An open mind, a desire to learn and being able to incorporate constructive feedback is essential.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most.




 




The following is our wish-list. It is not necessary that you have all this experience, butthe more you have or can pick up quickly will increase your chances of success in the role:




 





  Be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in UX/UI, either through your study or personal projects  Experienced in using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Affinity or Adobe design suite  You have experience in using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Affinity or Adobe design suite  Keeping up to date with the latest UI/UX design and usability trends and techniques  Understand what a design system is  Understand and have experience with web development technologies such as Javascript and CSS  





 




This is a job where we&nbsp;support&nbsp;remote work.&nbsp;However, we do have an office in Adelaide. Given the mentoring aspects of the role, we would like you to be in the office at least three days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.&nbsp;




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and be self directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed.&nbsp;We love you asking for help!




 





 What We Offer 




We pay a competitive start-up&nbsp;package&nbsp;based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 





 What We Have Achieved 




We&nbsp;are&nbsp;early&nbsp;pioneers&nbsp;in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012. You can read more on our achievements and announcements on our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/">blog</a>.&nbsp;




 




Funding; our founder bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community. &nbsp;&nbsp;Search for Meeco on-line and you will see our consistent focus in helping build a global personal data economy. If you would like to know more about our crazy, wonderful, roller-coaster start up journey check out this recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtoy2wpKPFA">keynote at the MyData Conference in Helsinki</a>, or these recent podcasts such as <a href="https://howtobemoderatelysuccessful.buzzsprout.com/1400926/7158607-building-a-business-to-solve-the-personal-data-problem-with-katryna-dow-from-meeco-me">this on entrepreneurship</a> or <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/data-minimisation-meeco-katryna-dow/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=data-minimisation-meeco-katryna-dow">this on identity</a> featuring our founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow">Katryna Dow</a>.




 




Awards: We have won&nbsp;eight&nbsp;international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands and Germany for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: In December 2019 we launched our secure data vault inside KBC’s (Belgium) banking app and&nbsp;next month&nbsp;we are launching a media platform&nbsp;for kids&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it</a>&nbsp;These are just two great examples of how enterprises and other start-ups are using our technology to developer better Privacy and Security by Design personal data solutions.




 




Innovation:&nbsp;Through&nbsp;2020&nbsp;we doubled our engineering team along&nbsp;with some really interesting&nbsp;blockchain/distributed ledger&nbsp;projects&nbsp;which we are currently&nbsp;productising&nbsp;to launch throughout&nbsp;2021.

By reading this you have reached the end, so if you feel you are the right person for the job, all you have to do is contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jointheteam@meeco.me">jointheteam@meeco.me</a>




 




Please include&nbsp;what you like about the role, why&nbsp;you&nbsp;may&nbsp;want to join,&nbsp;any questions along with your&nbsp;resume and&nbsp;confirmation of your Australian citizenship or residency.




 




Last time we advertised we had hundreds of applications. Whilst we were delighted it took us a few weeks to consider the long-list and juggle interviews between Australia and Europe. If you meet the criteria,&nbsp;we will be in touch with you&nbsp;as soon as possible.



We’re all looking forward to meeting you soon!&nbsp;

<p>Credible v0.1 pushed to <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/credible">GitHub</a> with its core functionality enabled, <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">documentation</a>, and is moving towards stability for white-labeling.</p><p>Today, Spruce is open-sourcing under the Apache 2.0 license an early developer release of Credible (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/credible">GitHub repository here</a>), a native mobile wallet for W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers built on <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">DIDKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter">Flutter</a>. We were able to package the DIDKit library written in Rust into a Flutter application running on both Android and iOS, using C bindings and <a href="https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop">Dart’s FFI</a> capabilities. A special thank you to <a href="https://github.com/brickpop/flutter-rust-ffi">brickpop/flutter-ffi-rust</a> for paving the way in the use of this technique, which inspired our own implementation’s architecture.</p>DIDKit’s Architecture<p>We hope you enjoy this release, and if you would like an invitation to the iOS TestFlight or Android Play Beta store builds of Credible, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/hqgP9f">enter your email</a> to receive an invite&nbsp;soon.</p> Who this is&nbsp;for <p>We believe that there will be no “one size fits all” credential wallet because the user experience must be appropriately tailored to each use case. Workflows involving trusted information tend to be extremely sensitive to context, with vast differences in the kinds of information used, methods of verification, and user interfaces from situation to situation. For example, the following use cases will demand completely different interfaces:</p>  A hospital wants to allow its qualified medical staff and pharmacists to digitally sign and verify prescriptions, respectively.  A trading desk wants to set position limits based on a trader’s digital authorizations issued by the&nbsp;firm.  A user wishes to demonstrate their history of transactions with a merchant, granting them special status and benefits at another venue through a commercial partnership.  <p>Comparing just these three, there’s a lot of variety that no single user experience can truly satisfy. They all share a need to make important data verifiable and portable, but the difference in their user experiences shows how unlikely it is for one overarching “wallet interface” to rule them&nbsp;all.</p><p>Instead, we are striving to build a solid, general-purpose technological foundation suitable to be tailored for specific use cases and workflows. This is the wallet counterpart to the rich, growing toolkit supplied by DIDKit, the two pillars of a reference architecture for creating trusted interactions at&nbsp;scale.</p> Credible’s core technologies: VCs and&nbsp;DIDs <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> are a cryptographically-signed, contextualized, and highly portable data format used to represent beliefs about reality, such as someone’s educational certifications, employment history, and licenses. They can also be used to represent beliefs about non-person entities (NPEs) such as code repositories, IoT devices, and data sets. Credible brings the ability to receive with, safely store in, and present VCs from your smartphone, making them truly&nbsp;yours.</p><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> are a kind of URI that can be universally resolvable across the Internet, public blockchains, and other data sources. They are used in conjunction with a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID method</a> to establish public key-based control authority of a “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-controller">DID controller</a>” and enable service discovery of “service endpoints.” People may manage several DIDs each to keep different aspects of their life separate and private. DIDs may also be managed by non-person entities, such as software agents, industrial equipment, and computer servers. Credible currently supports the use of a single DID from your smartphone, with multi-DID support on the&nbsp;roadmap.</p><p>VCs and DIDs may be used together in powerful patterns, built from the fundamental issuance, storage, verification, and revocation workflow. DIDs can be used to cryptographically sign VCs, and because most DIDs can be resolved to their public keys, anyone can then verify the produced VC as authentic and tamper-proof, thereby increasing their trust of the information inside. Credible currently supports the use of DIDs to request, store, verify, and present VCs. Future versions of Credible will also allow for issuance and revocation.</p><p>Credible ships out of the box with support for the <a href="https://did-tezos-draft.spruceid.com/">Tezos DID method</a>, which we have jointly authored with the Tezos ecosystem. The development of this DID method, as described in our <a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/didkit-v0-1-is-live-d0ea6638dbc9">DIDKit release post</a>, will be able to take full advantage of future <a href="https://www.tezosagora.org/period/40">protocol upgrades</a> on the Tezos public blockchain to provide best in class decentralized identity-specific support across the whole stack, down to the VM bytecode. We especially look forward to the use of <a href="https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/sapling-integration-in-tezos-tech-preview.html#:~:text=Shielded%20transactions&amp;text=In%20a%20shielded%20transaction%20the,to%20as%20the%20shielded%20pool.">shielded transactions</a> to increase privacy while retaining the availability of DID resolution, and the use of <a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/tickets-on-tezos-part-1-a7cad8cc71cd">tickets</a> to allow for sophisticated on-chain permissioning while exercising DID document&nbsp;control.</p><p>Currently, the only server interactions that Credible will make are through URLs scanned from QR codes.

<p>As the first covid-related health pass certified by ID2020, we’re proud to offer our support to this initiative to create an interoperable blueprint for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=identitysolutions&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6765232832974487552">#identitysolutions</a>&nbsp;and restore our economies and lives.</p>
<p>Starting today, BLOK BioScience – as part of the BLOK Solutions family – will work towards building widely accepted, secure, privacy-first standards for health passes, in the good company of a growing number of leading global organisations.</p>
<p>Of the initiative, our CTO Areiel Wolanow says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several companies – including our own – have brought already health passport solutions to market, and many more are in the process of doing so.&nbsp;At the same time, most of the world’s countries are trying to figure out what they need from a health passport, or if they want one at all.&nbsp;With both requirements and solutions in such a state of flux – and likely to remain so – the key to having solutions that remain viable and actually help manage this pandemic is for those solutions to be interoperable.&nbsp;Most of the health passport solutions currently on the market claim to be interoperable — as long as you accept their own solution as the base framework for any such collaboration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we really like about ID2020’s Good Health Pass is that it enables true interoperability, setting a basis for collaboration that is truly independent of any one solution while enforcing preservation of the values that led us to build a solution in the first place.&nbsp;We are very happy to endorse Good Health Pass, and commit its adoption to our product roadmap.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">original release on the launch from the GHPC Medium channel </a>below.</p>
 Original Good Health Pass Collaborative release 
<p>Today,&nbsp;<a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a>&nbsp;announced the launch of the&nbsp;<a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>&nbsp;along with more than 25 leading individual companies and organizations in the technology, health, and travel sectors — including the&nbsp;Airports Council International (ACI),&nbsp;Commons Project Foundation,&nbsp;COVID-19 Credentials Initiative,&nbsp;Evernym,&nbsp;Hyperledger,&nbsp;IBM,&nbsp;International Chamber of Commerce (ICC),&nbsp;Linux Foundation Public Health,&nbsp;Lumedic,&nbsp;Mastercard,&nbsp;Trust Over IP Foundation, and others.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Good Health Pass Collaborative&nbsp;is an open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative to create a blueprint for interoperable digital health pass systems that will help restore global travel and restart the global economy.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every segment of the global economy, but none as profoundly as<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/industries-most-and-least-impacted-by-covid19-from-a-probability-of-default-perspective-september-2020-update">&nbsp;travel and tourism</a>. Last year, airlines lost an estimated<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-11-24-01/">&nbsp;$118.5 billion USD</a>&nbsp;with related impacts across the economy in excess of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unwto.org/impact-assessment-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-on-international-tourism">$2 trillion USD</a>.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the announcement, the Collaborative also released its first white paper, entitled,&nbsp;<a href="https://goodhealthpass.org/good_health_pass-a_safe_path_to_global_reopening">Good Health Pass: A Safe Path to Global Reopening</a>.</p>
 Collaboration Among a New Ecosystem of Players 
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s one thing the world agrees on — we need to address the health concerns today to support a return to normalcy,” said&nbsp;Ajay Bhalla, President of Cyber &amp; Intelligence at Mastercard. “Delivering a global, interoperable health pass system can only happen if we come together in a way that meets the needs of everyone involved. This Collaborative will be critical in helping to define how we connect the pieces that will bring travel back safely, spark job creation and jumpstart the world’s economic engine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various efforts are currently underway to develop digital health credentials systems — both vaccination and test certificates — for international travel. Yet, despite this race to market, it is unlikely that a single solution will be implemented universally — or even across the entire travel industry. Thus, it is critical that solutions are designed from the onset to be interoperable — both with one another and across institutional and geographic borders.</p>
<p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is not intended to supplant existing efforts but rather to help weave them together, fill gaps where they may exist, and facilitate collaboration among a new ecosystem of stakeholders, many of whom have never worked together before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Fragmentation is a risk we simply cannot ignore,” said&nbsp;ID2020 Executive Director Dakota Gruener. “To be valuable to users, credentials need to be accepted at check-in, upon arrival by border control agencies, and more. We can get there — even with multiple systems — as long as solutions adhere to open standards and participate in a common governance framework. But without these, fragmentation is inevitable, and travelers — and the economy — will continue to suffer needlessly as a result.”</p>
</blockquote>
 Global Travel &amp; Digital Health Credentials 
<p>COVID-19 test results are already required for entry at some airports and at international borders. But existing paper-based certificates are easy to lose, unnecessarily expose sensitive personal information, and are prone to fraud and counterfeiting.</p>
<p>By contrast, digital health credentials can be printed (e.g., as a QR code) or stored on an individual’s mobile phone. They enhance user privacy and “bind” an individual’s identity to their test result or vaccination certificate, thus enabling real-time, fraud-resistant digital verification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our health data consists of the most sensitive personal information, deserving of the strongest privacy,” said&nbsp;Dr. Ann Cavoukian, Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security By Design Centre. “Release of our health data must be under our personal control. The Good Health Pass does just that: With Privacy by Design embedded throughout, you control the release of your digital health data, and to whom; all de-identified and decentralized. Privacy and functionality: Win/Win!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;World Health Organization&nbsp;recently convened the&nbsp;Smart Vaccination Certificate Consortium&nbsp;to establish standards for vaccination certificates, but no analogous effort currently exists for test certificates. Given that it is expected to take years for vaccines to be universally available globally, widespread testing will remain an essential public health tool — and one that must continue alongside vaccination to ensure a safe and equitable return to public life.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Good Health Pass Collaborative&nbsp;has defined four primary requirements that digital health credential systems for international travel must satisfy:</p>
 
 Cross-border:&nbsp;Solutions must work at airports, airlines, ports-of-call, and borders worldwide and comply with international and local regulations. 
 Cross-industry:&nbsp;Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. 
 Secure &amp; privacy-protecting:&nbsp;Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. Solutions must comply with all relevant security, privacy, and data protection regulations and must be able to bind the presenter of the credential to the credential itself at the required level of assurance. 
 Frictionless:&nbsp;Solutions must seamlessly integrate into testing and travel processes, thus enhancing and streamlining the experience for individuals and airlines alike. Solutions must not add new material costs for travelers. Optimally, validation processes will be contactless to maintain or enhance hygiene. 
 
<p>The Collaborative welcomes the participation of policymakers and representatives of government agencies; companies in the health, technology, and travel sectors; and civil society organizations who share a commitment to safely restoring international travel and economic activity while simultaneously ensuring that equity, privacy, and other civil liberties are protected.</p>

  Introduction 
<p>Cozy is a versatile open-source personal cloud used to gather your personal data in a safe place. You can <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/en/tutorials/app/">develop</a> any client-side application to manipulate existing data types, called <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/cozy-doctypes/">doctypes</a>, or simply create your <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-client/schema/">own</a>.<br>
As a result, many types of data can be stored in a single database instance. It is then crucial to be able to efficiently query data so the user can smoothly retrieve it.</p>
<p>Over the years, we witnessed many different use-cases of data manipulation at <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a> and gained some experience about scalability issues and common traps developers might fall in when dealing with databases.</p>
<p>This article aims to give a short overview of the most common mistakes we saw (and - let’s admit it - sometimes made!) about data indexing and querying. The concepts we discuss here are rather generic and can be applied to many database engines, both SQL and No-SQL. In the following, our examples primarily assume a <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> database, as this is the one used in Cozy, but we provide pointers to the equivalent concepts for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, which are some of the best known database engines, respectively in SQL and document-oriented No-SQL.</p>
<p>Our example uses <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client">cozy-client</a>, a Javascript library that provides an API to simplify the interaction with the  Cozy <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack">backend</a>, for authentication, realtime, offline, etc. And most importantly, it provides interfaces to query the database and deal with the indexes.</p>
 Indexes: the what and the why 
<p>Index: why?</p>
<p>Indexing data is useful as soon as your database grows and data cannot be retrieved in a reasonable time through full-scan queries, i.e. by scanning the whole database.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you don’t want to query all you data at once: you use filters to restrict the selected data. It is typically done through a <code>where</code> clause in SQL, a <code>find</code> method in MongoDB or a <code>selector</code> in CouchDB.<br>
You might also want to retrieve data in a particular order, by sorting it, or selecting only certain fields to be returned.</p>
<p>While it is possible to do such tasks on the client side, they are generally delegated to the database server to ensure scalability. After all this is its job!<br>
However, there is no magic here: you cannot expect a database to automatically deal with large amount of data in a perfectly suitable way for your needs.<br>
This is where indexes takes place: they are used to tell the database how to organize data in such a way that your queries can be efficiently run, even though the database contains millions of elements.</p>
<p>ℹ️ Index is obvisouly not the only thing to keep in mind when dealing with databases, but we focus exclusively on it for this article, for the sake of conciseness.</p>
<p>Index: what?</p>
<p>An index is a way to organize documents in order to retrieve them faster.<br>
To give a simple and non-database comparison, a recipe book might have an index listing all the recipes by their name with their page number. If the reader is looking for a particular recipe, this index avoids him to scan the full book to find it.</p>
<p>The principle is the same for database indexes: we want to avoid scanning the whole book (which can be a table, a collection, etc) each time we are looking for specific data: even though computers are way faster than humans to scan data, this task can be very time-consuming when dealing with thousands or millions of documents.</p>
<p>In more formal terms, time complexity of a query run on a database with <code>n</code> documents will be <code>O(n)</code> without index, as it requires to scan all documents sequentially.<br>
There are many types of indexes in the litterature. One of the most common index structure is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-Tree</a>: it is the default in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/indexes-types.html">PostgreSQL</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/">MongoDB</a>. This index structure performs in <code>O(log n)</code> in average, which guarantees a very fast access time even in large</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a practical point of view, B-trees, therefore, guarantee an access time of less than 10 ms even for extremely large datasets.<br>
—Dr. Rudolf Bayer, inventor of the B-tree</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In CouchDB, the indexes are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+ Trees</a>, a structure derived from the B-Trees.<br>
The indexed data are document fields. When indexed, it is called keys, and are organized as a tree, with the documents stored in the leafs nodes. So, finding a particular document means browsing the tree, from the root to the leaf.<br>
The keys are organized by their value: if we suppose a node with two keys <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code> and three children, the leftmost child node must have all its keys inferior to <code>k1</code>, the righmost child’s keys superior to <code>k2</code>, and the middle child’s keys between <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code>.</p>
<p>In the Figure below, borrowed from the <a href="https://guide.couchdb.org/editions/1/en/btree.html">CouchDB guide</a>, you see that each node has three keys, but in the CouchDB implementation, a B+ Tree node can actually store more than 1600 keys.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This design is very efficient for range queries: in the example above, a query looking for documents having an indexed field between 1 and 3 will browse the tree to find the first document position (with a key of 1) and then get the next two contiguous documents.</p>
<p>ℹ️ In  the following, we refer about “B-Tree”, that can indifferently be applied to B-Tree or B+ Tree: the main concepts remain the same in both cases and their differences are not relevant in this discussion.</p>
<p>Traps with indexes</p>
<p>Indexing data is not as easy as it might look. There is not one way to index, which must depend on you data model and the queries you need to run for your application. But, as you will see in this article, keeping in mind how the indexes - here the B-Tree - work in background helps a lot!</p>
<p>ℹ️ Each database engine has its own way to index data with its own specificities. Therefore, we do not focus on the indexing itself but rather on the common traps that you might encounter when designing indexes for an application, which can be applied to most of the databases, as long as a B-Tree is involved.</p>
 Pagination 
<p>When there is too much data to handle at once on the client side, it is good to implement pagination. This consists of splitting a <code>Q</code> query into several <code>Qi</code> sub-queries so the client can progressively retrieve data and update the UI accordingly.</p>
<p>ℹ️ From a UX perspective, there are different strategies to implement pagination. Typically if you data is rendered as a list, you can either have a ‘Load more’ button at the bottom or automatically detect the need to fetch more data when the user is at the end of the list.</p>
<p>We focus here on how to split <code>Q</code> and the consequences on the performances.</p>
<p>A simple way to do it consists of combining a <code>limit</code> and <code>skip</code> parameters to the query.</p>
<p>💡 Those parameters are available in <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html">CouchDB</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.skip/">MongoDB</a> or <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/queries-limit.html">PostgreSQL</a> (in SQL, <code>skip</code> is called <code>offset</code>).</p>
<p>Let’s assume <code>Q</code> retrieves 1000 documents. You can implement pagination by running <code>Q</code> 10 times by setting a <code>limit</code> to 100 and <code>skip</code>  the number of already retrieved documents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>⚠️ This pagination method does not scale and can be very bad for performances! Let’s see why.</p>
<p>This method actually breaks the B-Tree indexing logic: there is no way to efficiently skip a fixed number of data in such a tree, so skipping documents consists of normally running the <code>Q</code> query and then splitting the results starting from the <code>skip</code> number of documents, until the <code>limit</code>.<br>
Thus, instead of taking benefit from the tree traversal to efficiently start each <code>Qi</code>, the <code>skip</code> forces the query to start each query from the first document of the tree, and perform a sequential scan from there.</p>
<p>In the schema below are represented the scanned documents for <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, <code>Q3</code>, assuming a <code>limit=2</code> to simplify the drawing.<br>
<code>Q1</code> needs to scan 2 docs, <code>Q2</code> 4 docs and <code>Q3</code> 6 docs.<br>
The boxes in grey are the documents scanned by <code>Qi</code>  and the boxes in green the documents actually returned. We can see that each <code>Qi</code> with <code>i &gt; 1</code> needs to scan useless documents, this behaviour being worse for each new query.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fortunately, there are simple and efficient ways to perform pagination.</p>
<p>In CouchDB, you can use <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html#pagination">bookmarks</a>, that you can see as a tree pointer to indicate where to start the query. This is simply a string returned by each  <code>Qi</code> that you can pass as a parameter for the next query:</p>
<p></p>
<p>By doing so, each <code>Qi</code>  starts at the end of the previous query, avoiding unecessary scan:</p>
<p></p>
<p>💡 This bookmark system does not exist in MongoDB or PostgreSQL. However, you can still benefit from efficient pagination by using the last document key returned by the previous query. As the tree is organized by keys, <code>Qi</code>  will be correctly positioned in the tree, that is, at the end of the previous query. See this <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset">article</a> for more details about a SQL approach and this article for a <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@arpitbhayani/fast-and-efficient-pagination-in-mongodb-9095flbqr#approach-2-using-id-and-limit">MongoDB</a> approach.</p>
 Non-contiguous rows 
<p>When designing indexes, it might help to keep in mind how the B-Tree are structured, notably when dealing with multi-fields indexes.<br>
Indeed, if you need to query several fields of a same index, you might perform sub-optimal queries if you are not careful.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example to illustrate how such situation could occur. <code>Q</code> is a query for a To-do application that retrieves tasks by their creation date and category, respectively <code>created_at</code> and <code>category</code>.</p>
<p>To do this, you first create an index on those two fields, in this order. Then, you perform a query, for instance to get all the tasks made in 2020 in the "work" category. With <code>cozy-client</code>, this can be expressed like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Below is represented a sample of the scanned index data: it starts from <code>2019-01-01</code> and stops at <code>2020-01-01</code> as the the data is sorted by its first row, the <code>created_at</code>.<br>
Then, for each scanned row of this interval, the entry is returned if it has a "work" category. The returned rows for the query are represented in green.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The problem here is that you might scan unnecessary rows: in the example above, you can see a “sport” task made the 2019-01-03. It is not a big deal if the "work” category represents the majority of the tasks, but it is a pity if there are only a few of them. Imagine you have 1000 tasks for this year, with only one being in a "work” category: you’ll have to scan the 1000 tasks to only find one element, so 99.9% of the scanning is actually unnecessary.</p>
<p>In order to make this query efficient, you need to make an index that will organize data in contiguous rows.</p>
<p>Let’s take back our example, but this time by changing the index order: you first index  <code>category</code> and then <code>created_at</code>.</p>
<p>The index data is now organized as follow:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, the very same query can be efficiently processed: the "work” category is first evaluated in the B+ Tree, which return all the relevant rows, sorted by <code>created_at</code>. Then, the range is easily found now that all the rows are contiguous and only the returned rows are scanned.</p>
<p>💡 When creating an index, carefully think about how your data will be organized and which query will need to perfom. The performances can dramatically vary depending on your design, with several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>💡 When dealing with a query with both equality and range, you should first index the equality field. If you are interested about this, you can learn more <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/searching-for-ranges/greater-less-between-tuning-sql-access-filter-predicates">here</a> for a SQL approach.</p>
<p>However, it is not always possible to keep this design: you might need a more advanced concept called partial index.</p>
 Partial index 
<p>In the previous section, we saw that a query should be able to be run on contiguous rows in an index to maximize performances. However, this is not always possible when dealing with more complex queries.</p>
<p>We introduce here partial indexes. They are used to express predicates that will be evaluated at the indexing time. Data is then indexed only if it matches the predicates.</p>
<p>This can actually be useful in several situations:</p>
 
 Queries without contiguous rows 
 Queries with existence predicates 
 Queries with constant values 
 
<p>Let’s dig in these cases and see how it can be useful!</p>
<p>Queries without contiguous rows<br>
Let us consider a query looking for tasks created after 2019, that are NOT in the “work” category:</p>
<p></p>
<p>⚠️ The rows cannot be contiguous in the index because of the negative predicate, <code>$neq</code> (for not-equal). The index will have to scan all the rows to find those without the “work” category and filter out the ones without the correct date range.</p>
<p>By using a partial index with the negative predicate, this query becomes efficient as only the tasks without a “work” category will be indexed, by the <code>created_at</code> field.</p>
<p>The query is now:</p>
<p></p>
<p>💡 Note it is no longer necessary to index the <code>category</code> field: therefore, the index will be smaller, more efficient and will take less place on disk.</p>
<p>Queries with existence predicates<br>
The <code>category</code> field might be optionnal in your To-do application. In this case, it might be useful to check its existence:</p>
<p></p>
<p>⚠️ This query will typically return nothing in CouchDB. This is because a document will be indexed only if the indexed fields exists in the document. So a task without a set <code>category</code> will never be indexed.</p>
<p>A partial index solves the issue, as it will simply evaluate the existence of the field on indexing time:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Queries with constant values</p>
<p>You might need to retrieve documents based on a field value that you know will never change. For instance, you might have a <code>status</code>  field that is set to “ARCHIVED” when the task is archived.<br>
To retrieve these tasks, you can directly use a partial index:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this case, a partial index is useful to reduce the index size as you avoid to index the <code>status</code> field.</p>
<p>💡 Lightweight indexes take less space on disk and are more efficient both for lookups and updates, so this optimization could be worth it if you have a lot of data to handle.</p>
<p>💡 Partial indexes are useful to keep contiguous rows in indexes, to use existence predicates and to decrease indexes size. Depending on your use-cases and data volumetry, you could benefit a lot from partial indexes!</p>
<p>💡 In SQL, you can create partial index simply by specifying a <code>WHERE</code> clause in the index definition. See how to do it with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/indexes-partial.html">PostgreSQL</a>. In <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-partial/">MongoDB,</a> the principle and syntax is quite similar to <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html#find-partial-indexes">CouchDB</a>.</p>
 Cozy Contacts: a real-world use-case 
<p>Theory is great, but let us illustrate what we discussed by a concrete example and how the performances dramatically improved in our <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-contacts">Contact</a> application, thanks to partial indexes.</p>
<p>In Cozy, there are several ways to import contacts: you can typically import them directly from a vcard file or use the <a href="https://github.com/konnectors/cozy-konnector-google">Google konnector</a> to automatically synchronize contacts with your google account. And, because Cozy is an open-source platform, anyone can come up with a new way to import contacts, potentially with their own contact format.<br>
Because of this, we implemented an asynchronous <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/apps/#services">service</a> that periodically checks when new contacts are added, and migrate them in the expected format for the Cozy Contacts app.</p>
<p>However, because this service is asynchronous, we cannot expect to have all contacts migrated when the user opens the application. So, we ended up with two queries run to retrieve contacts:</p>
 
 A query to retrieve migrated contacts (<code>Q1</code>) 
 A query to retrieve non-migrated contacts (<code>Q2</code>) 
 
<p>Both those queries were checking the existence of a special document field for each contact to know if the contact is migrated or not. However, as we previously discussed, a missing field cannot be indexed in CouchDB. Therefore, <code>Q2</code> was actually making a full-scan index to evaluate the non-existence of this field. As a result, this query was taking a lot of time to complete, as soon as the user had a lot of contacts.<br>
And the worst part is that <code>Q2</code> actually returns nothing most of the time, as the contacts are migrated only once!</p>
<p>So, <code>Q2</code> was an excellent candidate for partial indexes: we implemented <code>Q2.1</code> that finds contacts with the missing field through the partial index: this way, the document is still indexed when the field is not here. You can find its actual implementation <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-contacts/blob/f562ff661bf3957d6af807d520886c117f580c0d/src/helpers/queries.js#L70-L99">here</a>.</p>
<p>The diagram below show the performance impact by comparing the execution time of the three queries in the most common scenario: <code>Q1</code> returns 1000 contacts while <code>Q2</code> and <code>Q2.1</code> returns nothing.<br>
<code>Q2</code> complexity is <code>O(n)</code> with <code>n</code>  the total number of contacts, while both <code>Q1</code> and <code>Q2.1</code> are <code>O(log n)</code>. Note <code>Q2.1</code> does not even appear in the diagram because it only takes few ms to perform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, using a partial index improved the overall queries performances by a factor 2 for 1K contacts, and by a factor 8 for 10K contacts. Neat!</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We hope this little index tour gave you some insights about performances and data indexing.<br>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>The recent SolarWinds incident has shed a light on an area of cybersecurity that is not frequently in focus. Better said, it is “again has shed a light”, if we remember the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-heartbleed-bug-in-openssl-probably-the-most-serious-security-flaw-in-years" title="Hearbleed incident">Heartbleed incident</a> that happened back in 2014. Back then, my colleague Alexei Balaganski wrote in a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/lessons-learned-from-the-heartbleed-incident" title="blog post">blog post</a> that “software developers (both commercial and OSS) […] should not rely blindly on third-party libraries, but treat them as a part of critical infrastructure”.</p>
<p>What we need is a defined approach and consequent enforcement of what, in a slightly awkward manner, is called C-SCRM or Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management. This concept includes enforcing software security from the very beginning of its development cycle. It is not only about cloud services and COTS (commercial of the shelf) software but applies to any type of software that is procured or self-developed, including software in things and devices as well.</p>
<p>Consequently, we must extend the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/zero-trust-nowhere-near-the-end-of-the-story-yet" title="Zero Trust paradigm">Zero Trust paradigm</a> beyond networks, security systems, and identities and apply it to all types of software. Don’t trust software, period.</p>
 What does Zero Trust stand for? 
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/zero-trust-as-a-concept-for-trust-and-security" title="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</a> has been defined over 10 years ago as a concept that focused on removing implicit trust from network architectures and enforcing strict identity verification and access controls for every user or device. “Trust but verify” might be a popular saying, but the motto of Zero Trust has always been “Don’t trust. Verify”. This is the quintessence of the Zero Trust approach that has <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero_trust_paradigm" title="evolved since then">evolved since then</a> to other areas of security, beyond the network, including identity and device security.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a paradigm, not a tool. It helps in architecting cybersecurity infrastructures and in defining concepts for operations. Given that security needs to be verified and enforced in multiple places – as the concept states – it involves a range of technologies to implement such a Zero Trust paradigm in an IT infrastructure.</p>
 What happened in the SolarWinds incident? 
<p>The <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/understanding_solarwinds" title="SolarWinds incident">SolarWinds incident</a> was an attack that became public in December 2020 but had been running at least for several months beforehand. The installers for SolarWinds’ Orion monitoring platform had been backdoored. Unfortunately, that software is (or has been) running in many organizations, including major cloud data centers. Several other software vendors like Microsoft and FireEye have reported that they’ve been breached through the use of SolarWinds products.</p>
<p>What this attack demonstrated is that even large software vendors with strong cybersecurity background can be compromised due to the inherent software and cybersecurity supply chain risks. Unfortunately, most organizations trust the software they procure and use, instead of verifying its security. And, unfortunately, verification is not easy to do and has its limits. But it can be done, it must be done, and it results in increased security. However, some products you can purchase might go as far as explicitly demand that customers disable their antimalware tools before installing them. This is the complete opposite of the idea of Zero Trust.</p>
 What is Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management? 
<p>Before looking at the specifics of software security (secure software, securing software), this leads to the broader theme of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/resch/cscrm-is-essential-for-digital-business" title="C-SCRM">C-SCRM</a>. This discipline applies the broader Supply Chain Risk Management to software and IT services and addresses the inherent cybersecurity risks. This is not only about using SaaS services or COTS software, but also about software in connected devices and things such as sensors, machines, control devices, etc.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Risk Management looks at the risks regarding both the reliability of supply chains and risks and damages derived from suppliers, from misconduct (e.g. child labor) to quality issues.</p>
<p>C-SCRM tries to assess and mitigate the risks that come from IT, particularly software, specifically regarding the availability of IT and – as the name implies – security.</p>
 What does C-SCRM include? 
<p>Going into detail would be beyond the scope of this post. However, you may want to listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve2_2020_06_02_schuetze2" title="this talk">this talk</a> of my colleague Christopher Schuetze on the necessary components of an effective C-SCRM approach.</p>
 How to apply Zero Trust on Software Procurement 
<p>In essence, we can’t trust software, in whichever form we receive and use it without validating its integrity and security first. Software security must be consequently enforced and verified, including measures such as</p>
 
 Secure design and coding practices: While concepts like “secure by design” are being discussed for many years, they are still not implemented everywhere. Now is the latest time to start working on it. This also includes modern software testing principles. 
 Software composition analysis: Any reused code such as open-source libraries must be constantly tracked. Where is it used? Which version is in use? Are there known vulnerabilities and patches for them? Which coding practices are in use by the suppliers of this code? 
 Static and dynamic code analysis: There is a range of tools for static and dynamic code security, which can be used to identify security issues in code. These practices should be extended to areas like API design as well. 
 Organizational controls: This all must become part of the ISMS (Information Security Management System), with defined and enforced controls. 
 Security analytics: Last not least, security analytics can help to identify anomalies in software. While operational analytics has been a part of DevOps for years, it should be expanded to cover security telemetry and forensics as well – such integrated platforms are already available. 
 
<p>A good summary of this is provided by my colleagues Matthias Reinwarth and Alexei Balaganski in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/post_solarwinds_security" title="episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast">episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast</a>.</p>
 How to check for Software Security 
<p>To quote Alexei Balaganski again, from <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/lessons-learned-from-the-heartbleed-incident" title="what he wrote backin 2014">what he wrote back in 2014</a> as a recommendation following the Heartbleed incident:</p>
<p>“One of those approaches, unfortunately neglected by many software vendors, is hardening applications using static code analysis. Surely, antimalware tools, firewalls and other network security tools are an important part of any security strategy, but one has to understand that all of them are inherently reactive. The only truly proactive approach to application security is making applications themselves more reliable.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, code analysis tools […] don’t get much hype in media, but there have been amazing advances in this area since the years when I’ve personally been involved in large software development projects. “</p>
<p>There is a lot of solutions available to improve code security and mitigate risks in the software supply chain. It is about using these the right way, integrated into a holistic C-SCRM approach. You’ll find further information in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/post_solarwinds_security" title="episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast">episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast</a> on post-SolarWinds software security strategies.</p>
 The extended Zero Trust approach: Don’t blindly trust software 
<p>Zero Trust must be extended and cover software security, for software in any form (embedded, COTS, as-a-service) and regardless of whether it’s home-grown or externally procured. “Don’t trust. Verify” – this is as essential for software as for identity, devices, or networks.</p>

  <p>Tip: This tutorial is part of our series on integrating Okta with popular infrastructure as a code solution. If you’re not into Chef, check out our <a>Ansible</a>, <a>Puppet</a>, and <a>Terraform</a> tutorials.</p>

<p>Chef cookbooks are a great way to manage infrastructure at scale. However, like other configuration management tools, Chef works best when cookbooks don’t change often. This is easy to accomplish in typical server setup and configuration tasks like install Nginx and tweak conf file. However, it can get tricky with server managing server accounts and credentials as people join or leave your ops team and as you need to rotate server keys.</p>

<p>To tackle identity in servers with automation, Ops teams usually take two approaches: push SSH keys for every user or integrate servers with an LDAP or AD.</p>

<p>Pushing SSH Keys for every admin on every server has significant security implications and requires a lot of effort when an admin leaves the company or when keys need to be rotated. And that can go bad as soon as someone accidentally shares a secret key.</p>

<p>Integrating a large server infrastructure with LDAP or AD – usually done using PAM modules – requires a lot of work. LDAP and AD are monolithic – built to run on the intranet – and not good when you have servers in multiple places, requiring site-to-site VPNs, among other hoops. Do you want to run an HA middleware service blocking your ability to scale in the cloud? This is a pain point no Ops Engineer wants.</p>

<p>However, there’s a third approach: integrate Cloud SSO to secure servers. In this tutorial, we will do that by seamlessly injecting Okta into your Chef Infrastructure as Code to effectively <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/07/shift-identity-left-secure-devops-automation-with-okta/">Shift Identity Left</a>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: To follow this tutorial, you need to have an Advanced Server Access (ASA) team provisioned from your Okta Org. If you don’t have an existing ASA team, you can sign up for free <a href="https://app.scaleft.com/p/signupV2">here</a>, which requires an Okta Administrator to <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/setup/getting-started.htm">configure</a>.</p>

 Create a project and get an enrollment token in ASA 

<p>In Okta ASA, projects work as a collection of servers that share the same access and authorization controls. In a project, you define which users and groups from Okta can access your servers, when they can do so, and what they are allowed to do in the server (i.e. run only certain commands). Any changes in your project (users, group assignments, authorization) are periodically updated in your servers (providing idempotency for identity and access management).</p>

<p>Servers enroll in your project to apply the same security configuration using an ASA agent with a project enrollment token. The ASA agent periodically checks for updates in Okta to update the server configuration.</p>

<p>To get your servers running with Okta, let’s create a project and get an enrollment token:</p>

 
   Access Okta ASA as Administrator. 
   Click Projects and then select or create a new project. 
   Click Enrollment &gt; Create Enrollment Token. 
   Enter a name (i.e. <code>chef-token</code>) and click Submit. 
   Copy the enrollment token: 
 

<p></p>

 Download and configure cookbook 

<p>In your terminal, navigate to your chef home and clone our sample cookbook:</p>

   <code>cd $CHEF_REPO/cookbooks
git clone https://github.com/okta-server-asa/asa-chef-example.git
cd asa-chef-example
</code>   

<p>Optionally, review the cookbook contents:</p>

 
   The <code>recipes/install-asa.rb</code> is the default recipe of the cookbook. It:
     
       Installs the ASA server agent using the appropriate package for your distro (<code>node['platform_family']</code>) 
       Defines the name of your server in ASA (canonical name) 
       Enrolls your server into the ASA project using the enrollment token you got in the previous section 
       Starts the ASA server agent 
     
   
   The <code>recipes/uninstall-asa.rb</code> uninstalls the ASA server agent from your machine. 
   The <code>kitchen.yml</code> provides specs for testing this sample cookbook in Chef’s Kitchen (with VirtualBox and Vagrant). 
   The <code>test/integration/default/default_test.rb</code> provides specs for validating the sample cookbook. 
   The <code>attributes/default.rb</code> file stores the enrollment token for registration in ASA. 
 

<p>Edit the <code>attributes/default.rb</code> file, replacing <code>ENROLLMENT_TOKEN</code> with the token from ASA:</p>

   <code>default['asa_enrollment_token'] = 'ENROLLMENT_TOKEN'
</code>   

<p>To confirm your configuration has no typos, enter <code>cookstyle attributes/default.rb</code>:</p>

   <code># cookstyle attributes/default.rb
Inspecting 1 file
1 file inspected, no offenses detected
</code>   

 Test cookbook 

<p>Now that we have the cookbook set, let’s see it in action. To do this, I’ll use <a href="https://kitchen.ci/">Chef Test Kitchen</a> as a harness environment, and apply the cookbook to multiple Virtual Machines.</p>

<p>Tip: The sample cookbook has a script (<code>kitchen.yml</code>) that sets our test environment automatically using VirtualBox VMs managed with Vagrant.</p>

 Launch test kitchen 

<p>In your environment with Chef workstation, install VirtualBox and Hashicorp Vagrant. (If you have a mac and homebrew, you can run the commands):</p>

   <code>brew install virtualbox --cask
brew install vagrant --cask
</code>   

<p>Enter <code>VBoxManage list bridgedifs | grep Name</code> to get your computer network interface name that will be used by the test VMs (ideally, a network interface with the internet. In my case, its en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort):</p>

   <code># VBoxManage list bridgedifs | grep Name
Name:            en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)
Name:            bridge0
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-bridge0
Name:            llw0
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-llw0
Name:            en12: USB 10/100/1000 LAN
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-en12
</code>   

<p>Edit and save the <code>kitchen.yml</code> file:</p>

 
   In lines 25-29, define the list of servers/VMs you want to test. You can remove a specific server or distro by adding a comment (<code>#+ space</code>). Example: <code># - name: centos-7</code>. 
   In line 35, paste the network interface name that will be used to bridge network connections. For example: <code>- ["public_network", { bridge: "en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)" }]</code> 
 

<p>To set up your kitchen, enter: <code>kitchen create</code></p>

<p>Chef Test Kitchen will download and launch all VMs in VirtualBox. This may take some time.</p>

<p>To confirm your kitchen is running, enter: <code>kitchen list</code></p>

<p>The list will show you the VMs with the last action Created:</p>

   <code># kitchen list
Instance                    Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action  Last Error

asa-chef-oracle-82          Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
</code>   

 Run cookbook in the test kitchen 

<p>To install and enroll your servers on ASA, enter <code>kitchen converge</code>.</p>

<p>Chef will execute the cookbook and enroll all your servers in ASA.</p>

<p>In ASA, you will see your server enrolled in your project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>To confirm the recipe worked, enter <code>kitchen verify</code>:</p>

   <code>-----&gt; Verifying &lt;asa-chef-oracle-82&gt;...

</code>   

<p>At this moment, your servers are enrolled in ASA. That means you can access your servers with users and groups from Okta associated with your project.</p>

 Test access to servers with Okta 

<p>Now that all servers are enrolled in Okta, let’s access the servers as a user:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/sft.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1610060131465000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1omaR8RXzvDBwm3OddiJVk">Install the ASA agent in your workstation</a> (required to access servers as a user): <code>brew install okta-advanced-server-access --cask</code></p>

<p>To set up the ASA agent, enter <code>sft enroll</code> and follow the instructions in the screen.</p>

<p>To see your servers, enter <code>sft list-servers</code>.</p>

   <code># sft list-servers
Waiting on browser...
Browser step completed successfully.
HOSTNAME                    OS_TYPE  PROJECT_NAME         ACCESS_ADDRESS
asa-chef-ubuntu-1804        linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.101

asa-chef-oracle-82          linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.105
</code>   

<p>To ssh into your server, enter <code>sft ssh &lt;name-of-your-server&gt;</code>:</p>

   <code># sft ssh asa-chef-ubuntu-1804
/home/frederico_hakamine #  
</code>   

<p>Note: Wait… what Okta ASA does for the login?</p>

 
   Okta ASA secures access to Linux and Windows servers in SSH and RDP connections using the server agent (the same one that enrolled the server in your project earlier). 
   The ASA server agent, in addition to subscribing your server to a project, also works alongside native OS features such as sudo, users, and openssh to control access during runtime and to capture any login events for audit inspection. 
   Because the agent is light and does not require firewalls and monolith LDAP or privileged access servers, it can be easily distributed across any infrastructure (IaaS, VM, or physical) and embedded in your DevOps tools. 
   To grant users access to servers, ASA operates a programmable Certificate Authority service as part of its SaaS, that issues ephemeral SSH Client Certificates for each authenticated and authorized request. The keys are issued only after ensuring both user and his/her device complies with the organization’s security policies. 
   The use of ephemeral keys provides many benefits. It eliminates the use of static keys and credentials for server access, ensures that both users and machines are audited before any new ssh connection, simplifies access revocation, eliminates the risk of “super account overuse”, and simplifies access audit. 
 

 What’s next? 

<p>After testing the cookbook on your Chef Kitchen, you can use it in your Chef Infra. To do so, tweak the cookbook (i.e. store the enrollment token on chef-vault or a data-bag), upload (<code>knife upload asa-chef-example</code>), and add the cookbook to specific roles and environments within your infrastructure:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can also turn on additional features in Okta ASA, such as setup sudo grants, time-based access, use of bastion hosts, and SSH session capture just to name a few. All these features reduce the load on your cookbooks and allow provide consistent account configuration across multiple servers.</p>

Before we dive into explaining this amazing opportunity, we don’t want to waste your time. So,&nbsp;if you don’t have Australian&nbsp;citizenship or&nbsp;permanent residency,&nbsp;or if you are representing a&nbsp;recruitment agency or an&nbsp;offshore/provider, then this&nbsp;is not for you. We understand you may be an awesome candidate, or have access to great candidates, but we will not consider such applications at this time.




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Lead&nbsp;for&nbsp;our&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;team, where you can help shape the API-of-Me.




 




What is the <a href="https://dev.meeco.me/">API-of-Me</a> you might ask?




 




It is an emerging platform that enables the collection, protection and exchange of personal data. Our main objective is to provide a suite of developer tools and APIs to companies and organizations to allow them to build privacy first solutions.




 




A&nbsp;secure data enclave that allows&nbsp;people&nbsp;to keep their data safe and share information with&nbsp;the people and organisations they trust.&nbsp;We are passionate about building a new economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organizations enter a win-win relationship by building mutual trust in how data is collected, protected and shared.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a>&nbsp;to learn more.




 




Don’t hesitate to apply, no matter what your background is. We would like to build a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia and Belgium, and collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, each with a unique personal data story.




 About the&nbsp;Role 




We are a global team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK.&nbsp;The platform team currently consists of 17,&nbsp;responsible for designing, implementing, supporting and documenting several services that, all together, form the backbone of our platform.




 




Currently our technology stack consists mainly of several Ruby on Rails, Elixir and Java components for the backend services.&nbsp;For&nbsp;frontend,&nbsp;we primarily&nbsp;use&nbsp;Javascript and Dart for smartphone and&nbsp;decentralised applications, based upon blockchain&nbsp;and distributed ledger&nbsp;technology.




 




We’re a company that embraces innovation, so it is likely that&nbsp;our&nbsp;technology stack will&nbsp;continue to evolve and&nbsp;change. We are not averse to adding other technologies if the need arises for specific services.




 




We take pride in building software that is easy to understand, clean, well-structured and properly tested. We have formed our own opinions on how to write good code that are a result of programming for more than two decades. Sometimes, we have even found ourselves going against the popular vote on several topics.




 





  We favour the explicit over the implicit  We treat frameworks as tools and not as an unquestionable authority  We embrace the relational database and its possibilities and as such treat it as a first order citizen.   





 




The following&nbsp;will&nbsp;help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis:




 





  Being a technical leader; mentoring, triaging problems, offering a guiding hand  Coming up with a detailed plan on how to approach high-level requirements including tasks and&nbsp;estimations  Supporting the team to allocate and distribute the work according to individual capabilites  Designing and implementing&nbsp;new services&nbsp;with business logic called from&nbsp;existing &amp; new&nbsp;endpoints  Investigating bug reports that inevitably occur, helping a colleague identify problems  Reviewing and approving Pull Requests  Implementing data integrations to&nbsp;enable end-users access public&nbsp;and&nbsp;private&nbsp;data, this might include open banking,&nbsp;social, health, wearable, weather, travel or IoT&nbsp;data  Working&nbsp;with the&nbsp;latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> &amp; <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a>&nbsp;Standards&nbsp;for&nbsp;implementations for distributed ledger&nbsp;implementations including Verifiable Credentials, Distributed Identity including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>  Working on leading-edge payments solutions including micro-payments and tokens  Contributing to a more transparent, open and trust-based personal data eco-system.    





 About You 




We are looking for someone who has a deep understanding of how to write RESTful resources exposed as APIs, cares about clean code (a lot) and is ready to learn (a lot). It is a big plus if you have experience writing these web-based applications in Ruby on Rails and/or in building decentralized applications in blockchain technologies.




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the center, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical solutions. Google won’t help you as much in this case as it requires a combination of existing tech and emerging solutions. One class of technology that we are exploring and see great potential is in the distributed ledger space. A good understanding and professional experience building decentralised applications or dealing with DLT is a big plus.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most.




 




In addition to established experience as a developer, we expect that you have&nbsp;at least&nbsp;2+&nbsp;years experience in steering a team. using an agile methodology, be it scrum or a derivative.




 




You&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;support&nbsp;our executive team (Technology, Product, Design and Commercial&nbsp;Officers) in&nbsp;writing&nbsp;up&nbsp;technical proposals, along with translating Meeco’s technical&nbsp;vision&nbsp;into practical goals that support the&nbsp;commercialisation of&nbsp;our&nbsp;products.&nbsp;




 




The&nbsp;following is our crazy wish-list. It is not&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;that you have all this experience, but the more proven competencies you have will increase your chances of success in the role:




 





  You have taken lead on directing and implementing solutions to complex, unbounded (technical) problems based on limited scope&nbsp;  You have a track record of setting direction for teammates  You know how to take steps in improving the quality of existing and future software  You are comfortable communicating your ideas both verbally as well as written. We love to create diagrams to describe future systems.  You have used more than one programming language to build software, which can&nbsp;of course include&nbsp;hobby&nbsp;and passion&nbsp;projects  We have a soft spot for functional programming, so maybe you have too  We build both&nbsp;backend&nbsp;and frontend&nbsp;applications, so&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;any relevant frontend programming experience, especially with JavaScript, TypeScript and/or Angularjs&nbsp;would be awesome  You have used languages with built-in concurrency models like Go, Erlang, or Elixir  If you have a language you love, tell us about it!  You have a good understanding of what goes on in a RDBMS, especially Postgresql. You are familiar with devops&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft Azure&nbsp;would be a bonus.&nbsp;  You know how to use Docker and Kubernetes.  





 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have a team to show you the ropes. A good set of solid programming skills, natural leadership and to care about our mission is&nbsp;all you need.




 




You might have a&nbsp;computer science or related degree,&nbsp;or you might not. This is not what we are about. We care about what you know now and how you are improving yourself every day.




 




This is a job where we&nbsp;support&nbsp;remote work.&nbsp;However, we do have an office at Stone &amp; Chalk at Docklands in Melbourne. Given the leadership and mentoring aspects of the role,– we would like you to be in the office at least three days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.&nbsp;




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and self directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed.&nbsp;We love you asking for help!




 What We Offer 




We pay a competitive start-up&nbsp;package&nbsp;based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 What We Have Achieved 




We&nbsp;are&nbsp;early&nbsp;pioneers&nbsp;in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012. You can read more on our achievements and announcements on our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/">blog</a>.&nbsp;




 




Funding; our founder bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community. &nbsp;&nbsp;Search for Meeco on-line and you will see our consistent focus in helping build a global personal data economy. If you would like to know more about our crazy, wonderful, roller-coaster start up journey check out this recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtoy2wpKPFA">keynote at the MyData Conference in Helsinki</a>, or these recent podcasts such as <a href="https://howtobemoderatelysuccessful.buzzsprout.com/1400926/7158607-building-a-business-to-solve-the-personal-data-problem-with-katryna-dow-from-meeco-me">this on entrepreneurship</a> or <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/data-minimisation-meeco-katryna-dow/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=data-minimisation-meeco-katryna-dow">this on identity</a> featuring our founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow">Katryna Dow</a>.




 




Awards: We have won&nbsp;eight&nbsp;international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands and Germany for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: In December 2019 we launched our secure data vault inside KBC’s (Belgium) banking app and&nbsp;next month&nbsp;we are launching a media platform&nbsp;for kids&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it</a>&nbsp;These are just two great examples of how enterprises and other start-ups are using our technology to developer better Privacy and Security by Design personal data solutions.




 




Innovation:&nbsp;Through&nbsp;2020&nbsp;we doubled our engineering team along&nbsp;with some really interesting&nbsp;blockchain/distributed ledger&nbsp;projects&nbsp;which we are currently&nbsp;productising&nbsp;to launch throughout&nbsp;2021.

Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon&nbsp;receipt.</blockquote>Photo: Pewdiepie/YouTube<p>So not only are corporations and institutions leaning into Bitcoin and crypto, you’ll be able to buy a Tesla with&nbsp;BTC.</p><p>It’s another giant leap toward mainstream adoption.</p><p>My Wall Street had some thoughts on how such moves might impact potential regulation:</p><blockquote>I think the most bullish thing is to have at least one large public American company with significant holdings as the government undertakes writing regulations. It’s super bullish to have the government writing regs knowing that they don’t want to crush the market value of significant corporate holdings. It’s different if they think they’re just crushing drug dealers and money launderers.</blockquote><p>Makes sense.</p> 2.

Dynamics in groups often mirror those of peer-to-peer messaging apps: People share, spread, and receive information directly to and from their closest contacts, whom they typically see as reliable sources. To make things easier for those looking to stoke political division, groups provide a menu of potential targets organized by issue and even location; bad actors can create fake profiles or personas tailored to the interests of the audiences they intend to infiltrate. This allows them to seed their own content in a group and also to repurpose its content for use on other platforms.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-groups-are-destroying-america/">Facebook Groups Are Destroying America</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knew-calls-for-violence-plagued-groups-now-plans-overhaul-11612131374">Facebook Knew Calls for Violence Plagued ‘Groups,’ Now Plans&nbsp;Overhaul</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/technology/how-to-fix-facebook-groups.html">NYTimes: How to fix Facebook&nbsp;Groups</a>  <p>Discord has its own trust&nbsp;issues:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/discord-scammers-lure-users-to-fake-exchange-with-promise-of-free-bitcoin">Discord Scammers Lure Users to Fake Exchange With Promise of Free Bitcoin — CoinDesk</a>   5.

					 <p>It’s hard to overstate the importance of an organization’s culture. Culture is an organization’s instinct; it determines what an organization will do in response to a given situation.</p>

					 <p>Situations constantly evolve from internal execution, stakeholder interactions, external collaboration, and more. I’ve seen first-hand toxic cultures that drive talented people away and supportive cultures that retain incredible talent despite all odds. I’ve seen how cultures can lead to transformative innovation and stagnant inaction. I’ve seen individuals change because of the culture they’re immersed in, and I’ve seen individuals change the cultures they’re a part of for the better. Ultimately, an organization’s culture determines its destiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At Trinsic, we’re addressing one of society’s hardest problems—establishing trust. It’s easy in person to prove who we are on, but digitally it’s impossible. That creates a trust deficit that costs our economy billions of dollars. We believe that as trust increases, the world and its useful services will be more accessible to people who need them. In order to tackle this, we need brilliant, passionate people and a culture where those people will thrive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At Trinsic, that culture is one of ownership, building, and friendship.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Ownership 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Owners are different than renters, borrowers, or hired guns¹. Owners are motivated intrinsically to make things happen and to solve problems. Ownership opens the mind to new possibilities, causes people to learn and grow faster than they otherwise could, and is extremely fulfilling. But it’s also challenging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Owners know what they’re in charge of and are accountable for their work. Owners are ambitious and motivated by the mission. Owners seek to win together with their colleagues for the good of the mission, not to get credit for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone at Trinsic has equity in the company. That means everyone is literally an owner and is incentivized to act in the best interest of the firm as a whole. Everyone, from the founders to new interns, has meaningful decision-making authority over their domains of ownership which are transparent to everyone.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Building 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Builders are skillful craftspeople who take intentional care to create. We build for the long-term in an iterative, step-by-step fashion. We all take skillful, thoughtful action toward creating long-lasting results. We are calculated, action-oriented do-ers and keep our eye single to the mission as we build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone at Trinsic is an individual contributor. There will never be roles which are strictly management (at least, not for a very long time); engineering leaders will never stop writing code, and business leaders will never stop developing the business. Decisions are made quickly, and people are never blocked from taking action.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Friendship 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Friends are enjoyable to work with, and at Trinsic we’re friends with one another. We are eager to befriend new kinds of people because we believe humanity is beautiful, and different people and perspectives will make us better. Friends are inclusive, honest, ethical, and supportive. Friends are trustworthy and communicate clearly about work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone at Trinsic is encouraged to develop relationships with others on the team. As a remote team, we are intentional about developing these relationships in work and play. Deceit, harassment, intimidation, and other inappropriate behaviors are intolerable. We care about and root for each other, both professionally and personally.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Journeys 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Startups can be likened to other kinds of difficult journeys. There are obstacles and challenges along the way to a worthwhile outcome. Some kinds of journeys are challenging but predictable. Others are uncharted and require creativity and resilience to succeed.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Mountaineers embark on a journey to reach new heights; some of which are death-defyingly dangerous or require tactful execution to succeed. Many difficult mountaineering journeys are impossible to accomplish solo; they require a team of sophisticated and trusted allies to accompany.</p>

					 <p>Trinsineers are people who’ve agreed to take the journey to make the world more accessible to people everywhere. We’re a team of&nbsp;people who happen to be working together inside a legal entity called Trinsic. This journey is not a casual stroll, but an expedition. As Trinsineers, we’re developing a culture that is not only helping us accomplish our goals but bringing fulfillment and enjoyment along the way. Trinsineers are owners, builders, and friends.</p>

If ownership excites you, you’re passionate about building great things, you’re friendly &amp; like other friendly people, and want to work on something with a *huge* potential for impact, we’d love to talk with you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Check out our&nbsp;<a href="http://work.trinsic.id/">Careers</a>&nbsp;page and get in touch.

<p>Munich and Hamburg, February 9th, 2021 – IDnow (www.idnow.io), a leading provider for Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions and M-TRIBES, end-to-end software provider for transportation companies, announce their strategic collaboration. As part of the partnership, M-TRIBES integrates IDnow’s digital, AI-based identification solution into its platform to provide legally required customer identifications – quick, reliable and user-friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>M-TRIBES integrates IDnow AutoIdent into its M-TOOLS technology platform in order to enable companies, in the areas of car sharing, car rental, urban mobility (including free-floating sharing of scooters, e-scooters, e-bikes) or fleet management, to use legally verified identification of users. The digital identification component verifies users in the smartphone app or web application to ensure that they are who they say they are and authorizes the use of the service. IDnow AutoIdent can be used to confirm the customers age or validity of ID or driver’s license documents in a legally compliant manner. IDnow is a leader in digital identity verification with artificial intelligence (AI) trained with millions of data points to securely verify potentially 7 billion customers from 193 different countries. Through the collaboration, M-TRIBES ensures that the identity management component of the software platform can be deployed to customers in the international mobility industry.</p>
<p>“More and more business processes in the mobility and transport sector are taking place digitally. Innovative, customer-oriented mobility concepts and services require simple and reliable handling that guarantees maximum security for all parties. This is the only way to implement future projects economically, securely and for maximum customer satisfaction at the same time. Digital identification plays a central role in this context. We are very much looking forward to the partnership with M-TRIBES and believe that the interlocking of leading, highly specialized technologies creates future viability for modern concepts,” explains Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>
<p>“Access to best-in-class software enables transportation companies around the world to become digital champions. The seamless integration of IDnow’s AI-based identity verification into our M-TOOLS technology platform is a key building block to increase operational efficiency and improve the customer experience across a wide range of mobility offerings,” said Patrick Arle, CEO &amp; Founder of M-TRIBES. “Partnering with IDnow is another step in our strategy to integrate state of the art digital tools and capabilities into our technology platform.”</p>
<p>The solution is used, by mobility service providers such as EWE Go GmbH, a subsidiary of the energy provider EWE AG. “We were in need of a solution for the legally required process of identification that runs digitally, quickly and reliably. We have achieved this with the integration of IDnow / M-TRIBES. The service, not only delights our on-site users, but also our own operations team,” says Lukas Schneider, Business Development Manager at EWE Go GmbH.</p>

  <p>Congratulations to Jeff Bezos and the entire Amazon team on their incredible accomplishment of building the most highly valued company on the planet and revolutionizing the face of retail as we once knew it. I am confident that Jeff will successfully tackle even more interesting challenges and projects during the next phase of his career.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His announcement last week prompted me to reflect on Amazon’s pioneering work in the areas of ecommerce, cloud computing, supply chain and logistics. Who could have predicted an online bookstore would fundamentally change the world of retail by transforming the role of technology in our daily lives and that identity would play such an integral part?</p>

<p>I believe there is another, even more important reason why Amazon has become so successful.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the company adopted a radical approach to building exceptional digital experiences. Amazon set the standard for making it easy to shop online and create an experience where identity becomes nearly invisible. Thanks to Amazon, our expectation of a standard digital ecommerce experience is to click “buy” and find a Prime box on our doorstep the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a consumer, I appreciate that Amazon recognizes me whenever I log in, regardless of where I am or what device I’m using. They’ve removed so much of the friction inherent in the identity experience and purchasing processes that Amazon has become the first - and usually only – place I shop online. I rarely have to log into Amazon, and I can’t remember the last time I had to reset my password - a frustration I seem to encounter too often on other sites. The effortless experience at Amazon hasn’t meant I’ve had to compromise my security or privacy. The company has proven you don’t have to choose one or the other. For example, they recognize if I’m shopping from a friend’s mobile phone. To ensure it's me, Amazon completes a few quick security checks, and I’m back to making my purchases. That proactive outreach gives me peace of mind and allows Amazon to safeguard its customers.</p>

<p>So what can we all learn from Amazon? And how does identity play a role in delivering Amazon-like experiences?</p>

<p>At ForgeRock we don’t think anyone should have to settle. Our aim is to enable digital experiences that make <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">access smarter</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">more secure and more personalized</a>.&nbsp;Whether you’re at work, at home or on the go, getting stuff done online shouldn’t be a hassle. I envision a world where you never login again. That’s not a distant reality. The technology exists today to create online experiences that feel natural and let you get stuff done without passwords or usernames. Instead we’ll be identified by new and safer credentials, such as behavioral biometrics and other <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">passwordless authentication</a> methods. </p>

<p>There are two Jeff Bezos quotes I turn to often for inspiration when I need a reminder about why the ForgeRock Identity Platform matters:&nbsp;</p>

  “We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.”&nbsp; 
	 “The best customer service is if the customer doesn't need to call you, doesn't need to talk to you.” 
 <p>We’re dedicated to helping all organizations replicate Amazon-like experiences. I see it happening already with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/our-customers">customers</a> like the BBC, Allianz, Geico and so many others. At ForgeRock, we’re going to keep innovating and pushing the industry forward to ensure that Amazon is just one of many places where your digital identity gives you an easy button to getting things done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We're exploring a number of "Headless" combinations at Fission. The first one is with the Ghost Content Management System (CMS). We use Ghost to run this blog and want to start using it to integrate with and power our home page, so it's a great place for us to start.</p><p>The basic pattern of "Headless" is that your authors and editors login to a server based system with all the authoring and editing tools they are used to, but then the "head" – the usual template system and user facing website – isn't used. Instead, a modern front end framework is custom designed and built to take the published content of the CMS and host it. This fits great with the Fission app publishing platform.</p><p>After we've got the basics of a headless publishing workflow setup with Fission, we'll move on to using our Webnative framework to add personalization at the edge, but that will come in later posts.</p><p>Aside from Ghost, we're also looking at <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-wordpress/1448">Headless WordPress</a> and <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-drupal/1513">Headless Drupal</a>. Let us know in the forum if you've got other Headless projects that you'd like to combine with Fission!</p> Build a Next.js Blog powered by Headless Ghost and Fission <p>Follow the tutorial below to get started with your own Headless Ghost, or <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost">visit it on Github for the README version</a>.</p><p>You want to have a modern static website/app built with React, deployed to a CDN (even a <a href="https://ipfs.io/">distributed</a> one), and loading super fast for visitors and search engines.</p>
<p>You want to avoid the headaches and costs of managing and securing servers for traditional content management systems (CMSs) like Ghost and WordPress.</p>
<p>That's what static site generators (like Next.js, Gatsby, and <a href="https://staticgen.com/">others</a>) are for, right?</p>
<p>But, you don't want to have to retrain every writer and content creator on your team to use Markdown and Git. Ghost and WordPress are familiar, pretty, and usable. They have been iterated over years to be approachable by almost anyone.</p>
<p>What do you do? That's right you cut the CMS' head off 🔪</p>
<p>More politely, you decouple the interface used for authoring content from the systems used for rendering and distributing it.</p>
<p>With CMS and website decoupled, you can protect the CMS inside an intranet without exposing it to outside danger, or even use it as a desktop word processor running only on your machine, as I'll show you in this tutorial.</p>
<p>To make things easier we've made a template Next.js website that connects to Ghost and pulls content from it. Follow along and try it out. Feedback welcome :)</p>
 
 
 <a>✨&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started</a>
 
 <a>👻&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting Up Ghost</a>
 
 <a>Public or Local Ghost?</a> 
 <a>Setting Up Local Ghost</a> 
 <a>Exposing the Ghost Content API</a> 
 
 
 <a>💻&nbsp;&nbsp;Running Next.js Locally</a> 
 <a>🌐&nbsp;&nbsp;Deploying to Fission</a>
 
 <a>🔰&nbsp;&nbsp;Fission CLI Install and Sign Up</a> 
 <a>🌱&nbsp;&nbsp;Register New Fission App</a> 
 <a>🚀 &nbsp;&nbsp;Aand... Launch!</a> 
 <a>🤖&nbsp;&nbsp;(Semi-)Automatic Deployment with the GitHub Action</a> 
 
 
 
 
 <a>🙏&nbsp;&nbsp;Show your support</a> 
 
 
<p>This starter template is based on the official <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript">blog-starter-typescript</a> from <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a>.</p>
<p>We changed it only enough to make it possible to fetch and publish blog posts from the Ghost CMS, while keeping the ability to write Markdown files in the git repo. It's a purely additive change.</p>
<p>There's also a GitHub Action to build and publish the static website to Fission. It works automatically on pushes to the git repo, and can be triggered manually after updating the content on Ghost. (The default Ghost webhook isn't customizable to trigger a GitHub Action, but that can be added as a plugin.)</p>
<p>The Markdown blog posts are stored in <code>/_posts</code> as files with frontmatter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.</p>
<p>The Ghost blog posts are fetched using Ghost's Content API library.</p>
 ✨&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started 
<p>Let's start by making this starter yours:</p>
 
 
<p>Click Use this template at the <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost">starter page on GitHub</a></p>
<p>That will make a copy of the starter into a new repo under your account with a fresh git history. You can pick a different name for it too; in that case replace <code>nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost</code> with your chosen name below.</p>
 
 
<p>Clone the repo (replace with your own URL):</p>
 <code>git clone git@github.com:fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost.git
</code> 
 
 
<p>cd into the repo:</p>
 <code>cd nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost
</code> 
 
 
<p>Install dependencies</p>
 <code>yarn
</code> 
 
 
<p>All command-line instructions and directory paths from now on assume the current directory is the root of the cloned repo.</p>
 👻&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting Up Ghost 
 Public or Local Ghost? 
<p>Running a local Ghost instance is good for testing. But also, if you have no need for a Ghost instance running all the time out on the internet (for example, if you are the only author) you can do this for your production website, using Ghost locally for its nice interface if you prefer that to editing Markdown files. No servers to secure, no bills to pay.</p>
 Setting Up Local Ghost 
<p>If you have a Ghost instance running already somewhere, move on to the next step. If you don't, you can set one up on your own machine with Docker.</p>
<p>To create a local Ghost instance with Docker, run the following at the root of your repo:</p>
 <code>yarn ghost-local-create
</code> 
<p>Ghost data will be stored at <code>./ghost</code>, which is in <code>.gitignore</code> by default. In a private repo you can choose to commit that too and have your Ghost content versioned and available whenever you need it.</p>
<p>There are other scripts like <code>ghost-local-start</code>, <code>ghost-local-stop</code>, and <code>ghost-local-remove</code> which you might find handy to manage the Docker container.</p>
<p>After Docker downloads and sets up Ghost, it will be accessible on your browser at <a href="http://localhost:3001">http://localhost:3001</a>.</p>
<p>Next you need to create an admin account on your newly-created Ghost. To do that, visit the admin interface at <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost">http://localhost:3001/ghost</a> and follow the wizard.</p>
 Exposing the Ghost Content API 
<p>I'll use <code>http://localhost:3001</code> for the examples, but you can replace that with your Ghost URL if you have an instance already running somewhere else.</p>
 
 Go to the admin interface at <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost">http://localhost:3001/ghost</a> 
 On the left-hand sidebar, click on "Integrations" 
 On the Integrations screen, click on <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost/#/settings/integrations/new/">+Add custom integration</a> 
 Give it a name, like <code>nextjs</code>, and click "Create" then "Save" 
 
<p>Now the important part:</p>
 
 On the same screen, you'll find two fields we need: Content API Key and API URL 
 Copy those into a new <code>.env.local</code> file, like this: 
 
 <code># .env.local
# replace values with your own
GHOST_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
GHOST_API_KEY=2a9356e4a5214c883ba886e58e
</code> 
<p>⚠️ This file is ignored by git by default. Don't commit <code>env.local</code> to git unless you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>Alright! Ghost part's done.</p>
 💻&nbsp;&nbsp;Running Next.js Locally 
<p>Next.js is the missing static website head to our headless Ghost. Let's stitch them together! This should be enough:</p>
 <code>yarn dev
</code> 
<p>Your blog should be up and running at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>! (If anything unexpected happens, please post an <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost/issues/new">issue</a>.)</p>
<p>Now you can change the Next.js website code and the content on Ghost, and iterate quickly on them in the browser.</p>
<p>Note: live-reload works for Next.js code and Markdown files; to see changes to Ghost content you need to refresh the page.</p>
 🌐&nbsp;&nbsp;Deploying to Fission 
<p>When you're ready to publish, the first step is exporting your website to a set of static files:</p>
 <code>yarn build
</code> 
<p>That should create a directory at <code>./out</code> with all your ready-to-publish files.</p>
<p>Next we use the Fission CLI to send that out onto the internets.</p>
 🔰&nbsp;&nbsp;Fission CLI Install and Sign Up 
<p>To install the Fission command-line interface using brew, run:</p>
 <code>brew tap fission-suite/fission
brew install fission-cli
</code> 
<p>For more ways of installing the Fission CLI, please check the <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/installation">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't have a Fission account, you can create one without leaving the command-line by running:</p>
 <code>fission setup
</code> 
 🌱&nbsp;&nbsp;Register New Fission App 
<p>You can pick a subdomain or let Fission choose a random one for you.</p>
<p>To host the Next.js website at a random subdomain on <code>.fission.app</code>, run:</p>
 <code>fission app register
</code> 
<p>To choose your own subdomain, use the <code>--name</code> option like this:</p>
 <code>fission app register --name my-beautiful-subdomain
</code> 
<p>That will create a <code>fission.yaml</code> file. This one is safe to commit to git, and you should do that if you want to use the GitHub Action to build and deploy the website for you. Make sure there is a line saying <code>build: ./out</code> in it. That's the directory where Next.js puts the exported website files.</p>
 🚀 &nbsp;&nbsp;Aand... Launch! 
<p>One last step:</p>
 <code>fission app publish
</code> 
<p>And you're done! Your website should be up at a random URL returned to you by the Fission CLI or at <code>my-beautiful-subdomain.fission.app</code> if you used the <code>--name</code> option. Yay!</p>
 🤖&nbsp;&nbsp;(Semi-)Automatic Deployment with the GitHub Action 
<p>If you don't want to run the build locally and deploy to Fission every time you make a change to the Next.js code or Markdown files (who does?), this starter comes with a GitHub Action that automates that for you.</p>
<p>To get it working you need to set up 3 secrets for your repo. To do that, go to the "Settings" &gt; "Secrets" screen on your GitHub repo, then create a "New repository secret" for each of these:</p>
 
 <code>GHOST_API_URL</code> 
 <code>GHOST_API_KEY</code> 
 <code>FISSION_KEY</code> 
 
<p>The values for the <code>GHOST_API_</code> fields are the same ones you used for the <code>.env.local</code> file above.</p>
<p>The <code>FISSION_KEY</code> was created and stored locally for you by the Fission CLI when you set it up. Here's how you get it:</p>
 <code>cat ~/.config/fission/key/machine_id.ed25519 | base64
</code> 
<p>With all 3 secrets set up, you can trigger the <code>deploy</code> action manually by clicking on "Run workflow" &gt; "Run workflow", or see it in action after your next <code>git push</code>.</p>
 
<p>Note:</p>
<p>⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;To fetch the content from Ghost, the GitHub Action must be able to access the URL entered in the <code>GHOST_API_URL</code> secret.</p>
<p>If you are running a local Ghost instance on your machine, <code>http://localhost:3001</code> won't be visible to the outside.</p>
<p>A simple way of exposing your local Ghost instance to a publicly-accessible URL is by using one of the <a href="https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling">open source alternatives to ngrok</a> or <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> itself.</p>
<p>With ngrok you do something like this:</p>
 <code>ngrok http 3001
</code> 
<p>⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;This is great for testing, but not secure. Look into using <code>https</code> if you're going to rely on this and don't want your Ghost API key and data to leak.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>Why "(semi-)" automatic then? 🤔</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glad you asked. The GitHub Action can detect when you push to the GitHub repo because there's a built-in "on push" event that can be used to trigger it.</p>
<p>But when you create a new post on Ghost or update an existing one, GitHub needs a way of finding out about it so it can run the deploy action. There's no <code>git push</code> event happening, so the trigger is usually a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event">webhook</a> (i.e. a POST request you send to a GitHub API URL.)</p>
<p>🙂&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, Ghost comes with the built-in ability to send webhooks when content changes happen.</p>
<p>🙃&nbsp;&nbsp;Unluckily, though, Ghost doesn't let you customize the payload that goes in the webhook requests it sends, and GitHub requires a certain field to be present telling it which <code>ref</code> (usually a branch) you are referring to.</p>
<p>Bottom line: after changing things on Ghost, you need to trigger a build manually.</p>
<p>You can do that via the GitHub interface ("Actions" &gt; "Continuous Deployment" &gt; "Run workflow" &gt; "Run workflow"), or by running the handy script we added to this starter:</p>
 <code>GITHUB_USER=your-username GITHUB_REPO=your-repo GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token trigger-github-deploy-action.sh
</code> 
<p>Here's how you can get an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">auth token</a>.</p>
<p>This situation is definitely not ideal, and can be solved with Ghost plugins, but we wanted to stick to the basic install.</p>
 🙏&nbsp;&nbsp;Show your support 
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost">give a&nbsp;&nbsp;⭐️</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;if you liked this project! We appreciate it :)</p>

<p>One of Jolocom’s founding principles is its mission to forward the establishment and maintenance of standards in our industry. As such, we are very happy to have our team member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaichristianwagner/">Kai Wagner</a>, serving as an active board member of <a href="https://inatba.org/">INATBA</a> (the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications) as well as being the co-chair of the organization’s Identity Working Group.</p>



<p>It was in this role that Kai chaired a recent INATBA event, a roundtable discussion based on the organization’s position paper, <a href="https://inatba.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-INATBA-Decentralised-Identity-001.pdf">Decentralised Identity: What’s at Stake?</a>, published in late 2020. Joining Kai were four fellow stakeholders, each with their own view on where decentralized identity is at present and how it should take shape over the months and years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sitting around the virtual table with Kai were <a href="https://twitter.com/thekaryl?lang=en">Karyl Fowler</a>, CEO of Transmute, a software company working within the sector and active member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation’s (DIF) steering committee. Also from the US came <a href="https://twitter.com/aniltj?lang=en">Anil John</a>, technical director of the US government’s Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Silicon Valley Innovation Programme.</p>



<p>Joining them was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/loretta-anania-2765898/">Dr. Loretta Anania</a>, scientific officer at the European Commission’s DG Connect who, through funding, helped get INATBA off the ground and was there in her capacity as project officer of eSSIF-Labs. And finally, from Belgium came <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielduseuil/">Daniël Du Seuil</a>, convener of the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework and the national Belgian self-sovereign identity (SSI) project leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, written over the course of a year by six key authors, was produced by INATBA with the aim of defining the expectations for an open and innovative market in decentralized identity. It analyzes the current state of SSI developments and opens up discussion of the next steps, taking a clear stance on how INATBA would like to see development continue, making demands of the key stakeholder groups and setting goals for the future of SSI.</p>



<p>Answering the paper’s core question of what’s at stake, it gives three essential scenarios:</p>



  Ideal – full convergence of SSI technology with interoperability by default.  Functional – partial convergence resulting in detached ecosystems.  Dysfunctional – no convergence and isolated, locked-in ecosystems.  



<p>With an awareness that the INATBA paper’s ideal position might be seen by some as “utopian”, Kai then went round the table to gauge the participants’ initial responses to it.</p>



<p>Responding first was Karyl, who agreed wholeheartedly with the INATBA position both from her perspective as a member of DIF and as a business person. Without achieving interoperability, she said, we “risk implementing a solution that further locks individuals out of mobility – socially and otherwise – as well as locks businesses out of future business agility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karyl added: “We don’t want to implement innovation that takes two steps back.”</p>



<p>Anil, having told the audience of his earlier doubts that blockchain was the universal panacea some of its champions believed it to be, went on to say, “I tend not to buy into the techno-utopianism of self-sovereign identity.” Despite this, Anil also said, “I do believe in personal agency and control.”</p>



<p>This, he explained, was the starting point for work he was funding to try to create a competitive ecosystem of services, noting, “As a US government agency, we have often been walked into a corner by vendors and told this is the only magic thing that will solve your problem.”</p>



<p>“We are not interested in being locked into another platform. If you want to go down that path, you need to ensure that there exists a competitive ecosystem of service providers that actually interoperate at a base level on the security and privacy side. That is the motivation for us.”</p>



<p>With 30 years of experience funding Internet research for the European Commission and time spent at MIT before that, Loretta explained that this, the funding of research, was core to her perspective on prioritizing investments. Specifically, with eSSIF-Lab she is supporting the strategic planning for the next generation Internet and laying the foundations for the proposed new European digital ID. To do this, Loretta said, we need to discover “how to put more trust in the network, a more decentralized trust framework and more permissionless autonomy to safeguard accountability and cherish&nbsp; free speech on the Internet.”</p>



<p>“Open is easy to say and hard to do,” she added. However, with the European Commission’s plan to make the next decade one of twin transition, putting green and digital into everything it does, Loretta noted that, although this will be difficult, it is also a beginning and that, especially when standards are being set, “It’s important to be there,&nbsp; involved at the beginning.”</p>



<p>Daniël, coming from a perspective of wanting to empower citizens, made it clear he thought the INATBA paper addressed important questions about the evolution of the technology and its adoption. “It’s not that easy,” he said. Both public and private sectors need to know the best ways to migrate from the current centralized to new, decentralized systems.</p>



<p>SSI, he argued, could be the answer to what the new call for a European digital ID is looking for. If the European digital ID is all about empowerment, privacy and new models of data sovereignty, it needs to be technology neutral. In the end, Daniël noted, the question is always the same: How can we empower the citizens?</p>



<p>With Kai tying up the common threads between the panelists’ first responses, he noted a clear difference between the US and European approaches. While in Europe the exploration and funding of research into digital identity technology and SSI came from a perspective of data sovereignty for citizens, in the US there was a broader requirement. Here, there was a desire for no system lock-in for all types of exchanges – such as the provenance of goods and information as well those of private identities. As such there was a difference in the motivation behind the funding of projects on either side of the Atlantic. However, as these were essentially similar if not the same problem, how could we ensure that the solutions that emerge were compatible?</p>



<p>Here, Loretta was quick to come in, arguing that use cases were key, both in making sure that we’re not trying to solve problems that don’t exist and that we are solving those that do. But, she went on to say, Loretta didn’t believe that the core problem was seamless compatibility, rather it was one of waste. And that the answer is data minimization. “The internet of waste is about unsustainable pollution, consuming resources at a time when the green transition is our biggest problem.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think that it’s an impossible task,” she said. But, for now, we should look to the use cases, “start small and use the best possible solution.”</p>



<p>In his experience, said Anil, “Everybody talks interoperability but seems to have a different idea of what it is.” He went on to argue that true interoperability requires two things. Firstly, that there are standards and specifications baked into the implementation of the technology, which is proven by publicly open, interoperable test suites that are developed and available to make sure that anything is conforming to the standards. And secondly, you need to do end-to-end matrix testing between implementations. Only then can you ensure both conformity to standards and genuine interoperability at product and vendor level. These two principles were something that all the participants generally agreed with.</p>



<p>In the light of this, Anil explained that the Department of Homeland Security had decided that interoperability test suites themselves could not be developed and owned by the companies being funded by them and carrying out the research. They should be owned and available independently – under the WC3 umbrella. “It makes sense for global collaborations,” he argued, “to work for the common benefit of our citizens.”</p>



<p>Agreeing, Karyl also put forward her belief that the way business owners or individuals come to the conclusion that interoperability is important is very use case-dependent. It’s easier to see in public sector applications. “We have to acknowledge that for each of these use cases, there are existing standards,” she said, addressing the fact that switching technologies is a costly affair and not one that businesses can take on lightly. “In many cases, what we’ve found is that a lot of these processes are not standard across regions or even within industry itself… Technology is not a silver bullet. If we implement it on a process that is fundamentally not serving the way that we’re interacting in the 21st century, we’ve just created more problems.”</p>



<p>Returning to the issue of standards, Daniël suggested that we need to think both of domain standards and technology ones. With a new technology, he argued, you need stability. You don’t need lots of new initiatives all the time and, at the moment, the technology is not mature enough to say that interoperability can be arranged in one way or another. We all know what the end goal is, Daniël said, but getting there isn’t going to be easy.</p>



<p>At this point, Kai took the opportunity to put a final question to the panelists. “If we actually want to get closer to some kind of proper interoperability,” he asked, “what is the kind of interaction we want to enable, irrespective of the use case, that should then serve as a basis for further work?”</p>



<p>A passionate Anil leapt in to answer this, saying that the hardest part when it comes to interoperability is following what he called the three Ps: “Pipes, payloads and policies.”</p>



<p>Pipes, he said, are the protocols you need to agree on. Payload is the data format of what’s moving through the pipes. Everything else is the policy construct that you put in place to make sure that everybody’s talking about the same thing.</p>



<p>He also argued, in agreement with Karyl’s earlier comments, that “rip and replace is not a strategy or path to success,” saying you can’t expect any sector to tear up its existing infrastructure just because something “bright and shiny” turns up. Technologists need to understand where people are and meet them there, providing something that reuses the technology those people have already spent a lot of time and money setting up. What we need to do is “provide connectivity to the new.”</p>



<p>Karyl addressed matters from the perspective of an American seeing how things are progressing in the EU, and recognized how productive having the public sector buying into the need for interoperability and standards was. This, she said, was liberating as it would redefine what was pre-competitive and where a business’s value lay. As a business, working with your competition rather than against it could only be productive as you could tackle problems together rather than in parallel. It was liberating for innovation.</p>



<p>However, Karyl also recognized that regulation and policy are, in use cases, the things that will define what is pre-competitive. It will look different when considering education, or global trade, or identity – be it an individual’s, an enterprise’s or an organization’s.</p>



<p>Agreeing with Anil, Loretta said that, in the EU, “We build on what works.” In her experience, standardization takes decades. “Do not underestimate,” she said, “the amount of effort that the EU had to put in to get a passport that’s recognized in one country to be also recognized in all the others.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, standards were not the right place to start, Loretta argued. “I don’t start with standards,” she explained. “I start with people who have good ideas, who are innovative.”</p>



<p>“I totally agree that standardization is a long process,” said Daniël, going on to argue that for him, interoperability is next to security in its importance. However, regulation is also essential as openness will not come easily. “It’s not something that emerges naturally,” he noted.</p>



<p>With that, and the clock running out, Kai called for the panellists closing thoughts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadly, Anil had already had to leave the table. Karyl meanwhile suggested that eventually interoperability and the development of standards are key to driving adoption. Without that, she argued, we would be locking businesses out of a more agile future and locking individuals into limited mobility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coherence with common standards will come, thought Loretta, and that ultimately people will vote with their feet. However, reiterating her earlier point, it will take time, she said. “But I’m patient.”</p>



<p>Striking an optimistic final note, Daniel said he thought that this is an interesting time. Right now, both industry and the public sector are interested in decentralized identity and what it can offer them. Now, he argued, we need to prove that this technology really works. If we collaborate in an open way then interoperability will come.</p>

   Unpacking the Realities of Identity Assurance Level (IAL) and Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) to Make Compliance Easier&nbsp; 

<p>No matter how much security and interoperability it brings, the thought of ‘compliance’ always brings a resigned sigh. Yet, from the U.S. Federal Government (Fed) to state and local governments and educational institutions (SLED), complying with guidelines and standards is a must not only for security but for interoperability and cost reduction.</p>

<p>Digital identity is at the heart of addressing many government specifications and guidelines. In this post, we’ll unpack two assurance levels, identity assurance level (IAL) and authenticator assurance level (AAL), within the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST’s SP 800-63-3</a> Digital Identity Guidelines. For more detailed information on implementing IAL and AAL using ForgeRock Intelligent Access, read <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-nist">ForgeRock and NIST Special Publication 800-63-3</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s begin.</p>

<p>In the current revision (revision 3) of SP 800-63, NIST replaces the idea of a single level of assurance (LOA) with three different types of assurance, each with three levels:</p>

  Identity assurance level (IAL) 1-3 
	 Authenticator assurance level (AAL) 1-3 
	 Federation assurance level (FAL) 1-3 (I’ll write about FAL at a later date) 
 <p>Each assurance type is so specific that NIST provides an 80+ page special publication to each, 800-63A, 800-63B, 800-63C, respectively.</p>

<p>Why are there three levels of assurance for each assurance type? Simply put, the levels of assurance are directly related to the potential damage caused if data is compromised.</p>

  Assurance level 1 covers less sensitive data such as publicly available information. 
	 Assurance level 2 considers sensitive data such as for official use only, or personal data. 
	 Assurance level 3 includes highly sensitive data such as financial data, or personnel data. 
 <p>Before we dig in further, let’s clear up the relationship between identity proofing and authenticators, as this distinction is important. Identity proofing is required during account creation and, in some cases, periodically throughout the lifecycle of the identity. Once a claimant’s identity has been proved, and while still in the account creation process, the claimant registers the authenticators (such as username and password, biometrics, etc.) These authenticators are used to access the account in the future. In general, an applicant proves his identity once but repeatedly authenticates.</p>

<p>Back to the task at hand: IAL and AAL.</p>

<p>Identity Assurance Levels (IAL) as Described in NIST SP 800-63A Enrollment and&nbsp;Identity Proofing</p>

<p>To achieve an identity assurance level, an applicant proves he, she, or it (e.g., a computer or a thing) has a real-life identity. This proofing process extends from self-asserted proof in IAL1 to highly scrutinized physical evidence in IAL3, where proofing requires the physical presence of both the applicant and a trained and authorized representative of the authorizing agency.</p>

<p>By far, most agencies seek IAL2 proofing of an applicant and use trusted sources to help prove someone is who they say they are. Examples of trusted sources include issuers of smartcards (such as CAC and PIV), driver’s licenses, student IDs, teachers union credentials, and first responder credentials.</p>

<p>Other than self-asserted proof, IAL proofing sometimes involves a third party that specializes in identity proofing, such as PII matching, biometric analytics, credit verification, demographic matching, etc. This may sound complicated, yet agencies find a quick path to IAL compliance at any assurance level using ForgeRock’s Intelligent Access toolset combined with third-party identity proofing technologies from our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">partner network</a>. Details are provided in the paper <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-nist">ForgeRock and NIST Special Publication 800-63-3</a>.</p>

<p>Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL) as Described in NIST SP 800-63B Authentication and Lifecycle Management</p>

<p>SP 800-63B covers ‘authenticators’, or the mechanisms used to access an account. Authenticators are as simple as username/password or as complex as a multifactor cryptographic challenge-response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also covered within SP 800-63B are ‘authentication factors’, which include: something you know (password, PIN, etc.), something you have (a one-time password fob, etc.), and something you are (such as biometrics like your thumbprint, iris, or face pattern).</p>

<p>Authenticator assurance levels determine how confident we are that the claimant possesses and controls the authenticators tied to their account. There are three AAL assurance levels. Each assurance level requires one or more distinct authentication factors.</p>

  AAL1 is the lowest assurance level and only requires a single authentication factor and an authenticator such as a simple username and password. AAL1 is used to access publicly available information like commissary prices, open courses, or public services. 
	 AAL2 is more stringent than AAL1 in that it requires two distinct authentication factors, such as a username and password (something you know) and a one-time-password pushed to a device (something you have). AAL2 is used to secure accounts with access to sensitive information such as personal data, agency internal but not classified data, the claimant’s student or financial data, etc.&nbsp; 
	 AAL3, the highest assurance level, extends AAL2 by requiring:&nbsp; 
   Hardware-based authenticators 
	 An authenticator that provides impersonation resistance (such as biometrics) 
	 Proof a cryptographic key is in the claimant’s possession.&nbsp; 
 <p>AAL3 is used to secure an agency's most sensitive data, such as a facility security officer’s duties, a university registrar, or any other function that requires access to the most sensitive information held by an agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To support authenticators, both hardware and software, government and publicly funded non-federal organizations require a flexible, yet robust, identity platform to orchestrate all AAL compliance levels. This is where ForgeRock comes in.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>, government and publicly funded non-federal organizations leverage <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports">industry-leading authentication and identity features</a> in conjunction with hundreds of pre-integrated identity proofing and authenticator options made available through our partners in our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">expansive Trust Network</a>. Because of ForgeRock’s comprehensive functionality, you can build an authentication journey that meets or exceeds all 800-63A and B compliance requirements. Additionally, if you require<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/federation"> federated single sign on</a>, there are ForgeRock modules to help you quickly achieve any 800-63C assurance level. In short, you can orchestrate all 800-63-3 assurance levels (IAL1-3, AAL1-3, FAL1-3).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more details on how ForgeRock can help you achieve NIST’s SP 800-63-3 specifications, read <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-nist">ForgeRock and NIST Special Publication 800-63-3</a>. And stay tuned for additional blog posts on this topic.</p>

  <p>Rockstar is a Chrome extension that adds features to the Okta dashboard. What sort of features, you might ask? The most popular ones include:</p>

 
   Exporting Okta data like Users, Groups, and Apps 
   Debugging SAML 
   Exploring the Okta API 
   The ability to assign admin privileges to a user from the user page 
 

<p>You’ll need to be an Okta administrator to use rockstar. If you don’t already have an Okta account where you’re an administrator, you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up for a free developer account from Okta here</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’re logged in to your Okta account, you can follow along with the rest of this blog post to learn how to use rockstar!</p>
 CSV Export for Okta Users, Groups, and Apps 

<p>While Okta can import users from a CSV, it doesn’t have the ability to export them in that same way.</p>

<p>The ability to export data from Okta is one of the most used capabilities in rockstar. While there are several other methods of exporting data from Okta, rockstar has some unique capabilities that set it apart from other solutions.</p>

<p>To export data from Okta in a CSV format, you’ll need to navigate to the location in the Okta that has the data you want to export. For example, to export the users from Okta, do the following:</p>

 
   From the Directory menu, select People 
   In the hovering rockstar menu, click “Export Users” 
 

<p></p>

<p>You should now see a window that looks like the one below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this window, you can select the columns that you want to have exported to CSV. For example, in the image above, the columns “User Id”, “Status”, etc are selected to be exported.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can filter the things that Okta will export to CSV using a query filter. Because the query box is just a thin wrapper around the Okta API, it requires a specific format in order to do the searches - i.e. <code>q=</code>, or <code>filter=status</code> … etc.</p>

<p>To export all of your users from Okta, just leave the query box blank.</p>

<p>Once you are ready to export users from Okta, click the “Export” button. When you’ve done this, rockstar will start exporting data from Okta, taking care to respect the concurrent and per-minute rate limits that Okta sets on the APIs that rockstar uses for exporting data.</p>

<p>Once your export is completed, you should see a downloaded file in Chrome with a name that looks like <code>Exported Users YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS.csv</code></p>

<p>Note that rockstar is able to export more than just users, groups, and apps from Okta. Rockstar can also export other types of data like group members, group rules, directory users, apps, app users, app groups, app notes, network zones, YubiKeys, mappings, admins, and more.</p>

 Exporting Apps 

<p>For another example of exporting data from Okta using rockstar; here is how you can use rockstar to export a list of your Okta apps. This is useful when you want to have a holistic view of what apps are currently being used, what type of sign-on Method they’re using (SAML, OIDC, SWA, etc), and whether the app is active. On a deeper level, you can see what the template of the user name is.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Having an overview of the apps in your Okta tenant allows for easy auditing and management.  Because the file is exported in .CSV format, you can manipulate it to make it easy for you to read and use.</p>

 SAML Debugger 

<p>If a SAML application isn’t working as expected, the typical approach is to use a tool like “SAML Tracer” to decode the SAML Assertion that Okta is sending to another application. However, there are two issues with using SAML Tracer to debug SAML:</p>

 
   The extension requires that you give it permission to inspect data from every website you visit 
   Once you have a decoded SAML Assertion from SAML Tracer, it can be tricky to find the parts of the SAML Assertion that matter. 
 

<p>Rockstar addresses both of those concerns:</p>

 
   It only requests permission from Okta-related domains (okta.com, oktapreview.com, etc) 
   The SAML Assertion that rockstar displays comes with helpfully highlighted sections, as seen above 
 

<p>To use the SAML debugging capabilities in rockstar, visit the end user dashboard, and in the rockstar menu, select “Show SSO”. Doing this will add a “Show SSO” link below your apps. To see the SAML assertion that a SAML app would generate, click on the “Show SSO” link for that app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you click on the “Show SSO” link, rockstar will fetch a SAML assertion for that app from Okta and then display it in a window, helpfully highlighting the most important parts of the assertion. It will look like this:</p>

<p></p>

 Exploring the Okta API 

<p>Learning a RESTful API like the Okta API can be daunting, especially if you haven’t spent time with a RESTful API before. The usual way to learn an API is to use a tool like Postman, or maybe even open a terminal on your computer and use a command-line tool like <code>curl</code>.  However, doing either of those things requires setting up your environment, putting in variables, your API keys, client secret, client id, etc. And for someone starting out, that is a very intimidating thing to do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, because tools like Postman and <code>curl</code> depend on an API key, that API key will expire after 30 days of non-use. This means that you’ll often find yourself needing to regenerate an API key, usually when you’re in a hurry and would rather be doing something else.</p>

<p>By using rockstar, you can quickly start exploring the Okta API. This is because rockstar will make use of your existing Okta session. Because of that, you’ll never need to worry about generating an API key, or having an API key expire.</p>

<p>Inside of rockstar, you get a list of dropdown commands that will allow you to see what type of GET commands are available for you to choose from. Then, you will be able to see the response directly below; all within the Chrome window.</p>

<p>To open the API explorer, simply click on the “API Explorer” link in the rockstar window. This will open a window that gives you a simplified interface to make API requests to Okta. If you haven’t yet memorized every single Okta API endpoint, rockstar helpfully lists the most commonly used endpoints for you!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Here are some examples of using rockstar to explore the Okta API:</p>

 Getting a list of users 

<p>To get a list of users, open the API Explorer, click on the URL endpoint box, select <code>/api/v1/users</code> from the menu, then click the Send button. You should see a list of users, like in the screenshot below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you might have noticed, every Okta API endpoint returns data in the JSON format, but for some kinds of data, JSON can be unwieldy to look at visually. Because of that, when possible, rockstar will helpfully format some JSON data into a table, while still returning the JSON underneath as well. You can see the original JSON response by clicking on the “JSON” link in the output:</p>

<p></p>

 Getting information on a single user 

<p>To get detailed information on a particular user, navigate to that user in the Okta interface, and then click the “Show User” link in rockstar</p>

<p></p>

<p>Clicking that link will provide you with the API response for that user, which contains a detailed list of attributes for that particular user.</p>

<p></p>

 Getting group membership for a user 

<p>To make an API request that fetches the group membership information for a user, navigate to a user in the Okta interface, click the “API Explorer” link in rockstar, then select the <code>/api/v1/users/${userId}/groups</code> URL. You will now see a list of groups that your user is a member of:</p>

<p></p>

 Easier assignment of admin privileges to users 
<p>In Okta, assignment of admin privileges is a multi-step process, requiring you to open the Security menu, select Administrators, click the “Add Administrator” button, enter in the user you want to grant privileges to, select which privileges you want to grant the user, then clicking the “Add Administrator” button. I’m feeling exhausted just typing all of that!</p>

<p>With rockstar, we address this by directly granting the user administrator privileges directly from within the user’s individual profile page!</p>

<p>To do this, navigate to the user you want to grant administrator privileges to, then in rockstar click the “Administrator Roles” link:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Assuming that you are logged into Okta as an administrator, you will be presented with a list of admin privileges that you could be assigning to this user. Click on any of the links to grant the user that particular administrator privilege. For example, to grant a user “Read Only Administrator” privileges, click on the “Grant Read Only Administrator” link.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In addition to granting permissions, rockstar also allows you to instantly revoke admin privileges; reducing the need to dive deep into the Admin console.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Simpler and quicker workflows make rockstar a very handy tool to have when administering a large set of users in Okta. Reducing the need to deep dive into the product menus is continuing to prove to be a beneficial feature for Okta admins out there.</p>

 How do you get it? 

<p>Now that you have an idea of some of the things that you can do with rockstar, it’s time for you to install it and try it out for yourself! Here’s how:</p>

<p>By Li Jun, Founder of Ontology &amp; <a href="https://protocol.sagamarket.io/">SAGA Protocol</a>. Originally posted in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/data-regulation-in-2021%3A-more-small-steps-or-a-giant-leap-2021-02-04">NASDAQ</a>.</p><p>We are living through an activist period of data regulation that will dictate how our economies function for generations to come. Most industries have precedents for regulation that go back centuries, in the case of banking, pharmaceutical, and industrial relations, or at least decades in the case of environmental regulation and telecoms. Even antitrust, that other great set of regulatory concerns facing big technology companies, seems to be based on theories that were formulated around the turn of the twentieth century.</p><p>Data regulation is being designed from first principles before our very eyes. It draws from notions of individual privacy, and is heavily influenced by world events from national security regulation following 9/11 to a reckoning on data collection in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. Technical considerations are also feeding into regulation, in particular the ability of machine learning technology to help with medical treatment or predict crime using ever larger data&nbsp;sets.</p><p>Where previously data regulation has been a knee-jerk response to high-profile events, both the tech and government sectors have matured enough to move beyond hard cases making bad law. The introduction of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018 set a new, unprecedented global standard for data protection, while the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) came into play on New Year’s Day last year. This brought data regulation much closer to what we see in Europe, and with California the home of US tech, this arguably amounts to de facto regulation of the whole country. Similar laws have also been passed in countries such as Canada, New Zealand, China, and South Africa, bringing with them a new global age of data regulation.</p><p>With 2020 firmly in the rearview mirror, how will the industry evolve over the next 12 months to meet growing needs? This could be the year where data privacy legislation finally gets road tested and we are provided some case law by which to assess their effects. In 2020 the pandemic put a dampener on enforcing non-compliance GDPR penalties, as many prominent UK fines that had been announced were postponed and reduced. British Airways had to <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/british-airways-fined-20m-over-gdpr-breach">pay £20 million</a> of a fine originally set at £183 million, while Marriott Hotels <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlypage/2020/10/30/marriott-hit-with-184-million-gdpr-fine-over-massive-2018-data-breach/">had to pay £18.4 million</a> out of £100 million. The economic hardship played a big role, as both companies operated in sectors that were decimated by the pandemic, but regulators will not want to be seen as a soft touch. We can expect the honeymoon to end and an increase in fines issued during 2021, as European regulators establish themselves again and their international equivalents flex their muscles for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>While much of the conversation around data regulation focuses on privacy, data localization is another trend we can expect to see more of this year. This refers to a legal requirement that data be stored within specific regional or national borders, forcing multinationals to create local storage facilities to house data sourced from a given country. In 2020 this issue became international news when the Trump administration threatened to force the sale of TikTok’s US business in the name of data localization, or data sovereignty. For the government to interfere with a private company to this extent caused some to talk about a new Cold War, fought with proxy companies rather than proxy states. In the process, it elevated data localization to an urgent consideration for data lawyers and lobbyists. This issue is not going away, and international governments are likely to mirror the US approach and demand special treatment for their citizens’ data. This is also expected to put considerable pressure on international tech companies dealing with non-democratic regimes.</p><p>In the wake of the extended trade negotiations surrounding the UK’s decision to leave the EU, and the growing consternation between the US and China, it will be no surprise to see data sovereignty become an issue for nationalist politicians. Just as trade restrictions are touted in order to protect jobs, data restrictions will be suggested to protect citizen information and intellectual property. Countries that have created artificial intelligence companies in particular will become more inclined to see data as an asset that is important for economic success and national security. A growing interplay between individual privacy and nationalism with economic and national security components will define the politics and regulation of data in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Finally, empowering the growing data-driven economy by connecting data in a decentralized way will be key if the industry is to evolve. We are beginning to see emerging technologies such as blockchain adopted in data sharing and this too will have a major impact on regulation. Most recently in Britain, two hospitals are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-blockchain/british-hospitals-use-blockchain-to-track-covid-19-vaccines-idUSL4N2JQ3FD">using a distributed ledger</a> to keep tabs on the storage of Covid-19 vaccines and the distribution of doses. As real-life use cases become increasingly common, this could be the catalyst for further regulation, most likely driven by the EU or US. President Biden’s pick to lead the SEC has previously stated that <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/a-cryptocurrency-a-security-depends">cryptocurrencies are under regulated</a>, and the first mover in 2021 could shape global regulation, just as GDPR did for privacy. Technology and data are defining our economy and culture, and they will in turn be defined by how they are regulated. 2021 may be the year where we finally see how this plays&nbsp;out.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/data-regulation-in-2021-more-small-steps-or-a-giant-leap-f62f018e91ea">Data Regulation In 2021: More Small Steps Or A Giant Leap?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ardor-use-cases-blockchain/">Sustainability, Loyalty, Gaming: How Ardor is Attracting Real-World Use Cases for Blockchain</a> 

<p>Coinspeaker: Many companies and initiatives had spotted the potential for blockchain to solve real-world challenges. But like anything of value, it takes time to build, test, and iterate. Jelurida, the Swiss software firm behind the Ardor platform, has a team that’s been around in blockchain and systems development long enough to become very familiar with this cycle. Two of Jelurida’s co-founders were involved with the Nxt blockchain, which launched in 2013. Jelurida took over the operation of Nxt, which still runs today, in 2016. However, Ardor has been the firm’s flagship platform since its launch in January 2018. All tech innovations aside, what’s impressive about Ardor is the fact that over the three years since it launched, it’s become a go-to platform for projects looking to apply the features of blockchain to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>Julian Hayes from Veneto Privacy shares some tips and tricks for businesses considering organisational controls around data protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why are organisational controls so important? 
<p>Organisational controls are often an underestimated part of data protection compliance but critically important in order for organisations to demonstrate compliance.</p>
<p>It’s really important that your organisation is set up with a framework around data protection and security. Beyond legal obligations, it makes good business sense, allows for proper control and utilisation of data, and can even help streamline process costs.</p>
<p>With a few simple process measures, some enthusiasm and the right tools, organisations can still thrive with their data processing activities safe in the knowledge that structures are there to keep them on the right track.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Data management programme 
<p>A data management programme is a living project with continuous cycles enabling organisational activities that support good data privacy practices. Standard components of a good programme would feature:</p>
 
 Data Protection Training &amp; Communications plan for the year. 
 Data Privacy Management Group, managing data retention, security and access controls and Data Protection Impact Assessment reviews. These assessments require expert knowledge in data protection and security in order to establish the legal basis for the processing, what security measures are required, establishing whether a balancing test of legitimate interest is required and having oversight of the full extent of the processing. 
 Data Curation, ensuring data integrity, utility and interoperability within the organisation and its other data processes. 
 Data Governance, an integral part for the programme with key decision makers appointed where high-level decisions are made on data protection and security risks. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Privacy Culture 
<p>It’s always good to capitalise interest in data protection from colleagues within your organisation and let them assist you with your data protection programme objectives, with meetups, information sharing and privacy representation for their departments. At Veneto Privacy, we’ve implemented formal and informal data privacy working groups and have seen first-hand that this privacy culture can grow compliance maturity for organisations making the Data Protection function, with the support of these advocates as a more integrated and trusted unit.</p>
<p>In setting up a Data Privacy working group, it’s always good to set out clear objectives for all stakeholders and what their responsibilities are in their participation. Some items the group can help the Data Protection function manage include:&nbsp;Product &amp; Service plans for the forthcoming quarter; reconciling the Register of Data Processing (Article 30 GDRP) for data processing activities in their business unit; co-ordinating on investigations or regulatory enquiries; and of course cascading changes in the data protection landscape that may impact on the business. These advocates can be the eyes and ears of data protection for you!</p>

 Training and Knowledge 
<p>Your business can have the best internal processes for reporting data protection breaches, but these are worthless when staff have not been trained to be able to react or even identify a data breach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Data Governance 
<p>Who does the buck stop with?&nbsp; Who is responsible for the management and ownership of data? Without a governance structure and clear accountability within defined roles (CTO, CEO etc.) your organisation cannot say it has implemented ‘organisational measures’ under Article 32 of the GDPR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Does our business need a Data Protection Officer? 
<p>Yes, if your organisation processes large amounts of personally identifiable data or the processing involves large scale systematic processing of such data. Importantly, the Data Protection Officer needs to have independence in some decision-making processes and should not be conflicted when it comes to determining privacy risks.</p>
<p>Further, organisations based outside of the EU that offer services within the union must by law appoint an EU Representative based within the territory, who can be contacted by consumers and data protection authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Policies 
<p>Having policies in place internally that support both security and data protection are critically important for organisational compliance, and even more important is that these are communicated to all levels of the organisation, whether it’s big or small. Policies allow colleagues to understand the ‘dos and don’ts’ when it comes to handling data and are the go-to resources to identifying an escalation path when they come across an issue.</p>
<p>Basic policy structures usually comprise of the following items:</p>
 
 Information Security Policy –&nbsp;Setting out minimum security requirements for handling data in the organisation and often including a data classification procedure based on the information’s sensitivity. 
 Data Protection Management Policy – Establishing what steps need be made in protecting personally identifiable data, where a Data Protection Impact Assessment may be required, how to contact the Data Protection Officer and defined ownership of data within the organisation. 
 Data Breach Management Policy – This is a critical policy which ideally would be co-owned with your Information Security team in order to have a solid policy established that enables identification of alleged data breaches, triage, deep-dive investigation and whether notification to the authorities of impacted parties is required.

  <p>Tip: This tutorial is part of our series on how to integrate Okta with popular Infrastructure as a Code solution. If you’re not into Ansible, check out our <a>Puppet</a> and <a>Terraform</a> tutorials.</p>

<p>I love using Ansible to deploy and manage configuration at scale. However, like any other configuration management solution, Ansible works best when playbooks don’t change often. This is easy to accomplish when you manage only server artifacts and binaries, but it can get tricky if your playbooks manage user accounts and credentials that will change quite often as people join, change roles, or leave your team.</p>

<p>To overcome this, admins would typically look at distributing SSH keys or using some sort of 3rd party LDAP/AD for login.</p>

<p>Distributing SSH Keys has major maintenance implications since it requires a lot of work anytime you need to rotate keys. If you use SSH keys for user logins, the recommendation is to rotate keys often – to reduce risks in case the keys are compromised – plus every time an admin leaves the company.</p>

<p>Integrating your infra to an AD/LDAP server – usually using a PAM module – may be even more challenging, since this type of server is usually monolithic and hosted on-prem. Getting a robust integration here is a tall order. From site-to-site VPNs (making your AD available everywhere) to adding additional servers (keeping compatibility across a variety of server distros), this is the kind of pain no Ops Engineer would like to sign up for.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will overcome both issues by seamlessly injecting Okta into your Ansible Infrastructure as Code to effectively <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/07/shift-identity-left-secure-devops-automation-with-okta/">Shift Identity Left</a>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: To follow this tutorial, you need to have an Advanced Server Access (ASA) team provisioned from your Okta Org. If you don’t have an existing ASA team, you can sign up for free <a href="https://app.scaleft.com/p/signupV2">here</a>, which requires an Okta Administrator to <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/setup/getting-started.htm">configure</a>.</p>

 Create a project and get an enrollment token in ASA 

<p>In Okta ASA, projects work as a collection of servers that share the same access and authorization controls. In a project, you define which users and groups from Okta can access your servers, when they can do so, and what they are allowed to do in the server (i.e. run only certain commands). Any changes in your project (users, group assignments, authorization) are periodically updated in your servers (providing idempotency for identity and access management).</p>

<p>Servers enroll in your project to apply the same security configuration using an ASA agent with a project enrollment token. The ASA agent periodically checks for updates in Okta to update the server configuration.</p>

<p>To get your servers running with Okta, let’s create a project and get an enrollment token:</p>

 
   Access Okta ASA as Administrator. 
   Click Projects and then select or create a new project. 
   Click Enrollment &gt; Create Enrollment Token. 
   Enter a name (i.e. <code>ansible-token</code>) and click Submit. 
   Copy the enrollment token: 
 

<p></p>

 Download and configure playbook 

<p>Clone our sample playbook <code>git clone https://github.com/okta-server-asa/asa-ansible-example.git</code></p>

<p>Optionally, review the <code>asa-playbook.yml</code> contents.</p>

<p>The playbook installs the Okta ASA server agent binaries. It supports multiple Linux distros using the server distro family to identify the ideal installation tasks:</p>

   <code>  tasks:     
    #INSTALL
    - name: Install Debian
      include_tasks: asa-samples/install-debian.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"
    
    - name: Install RedHat
      include_tasks: asa-samples/install-redhat.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
    
    - name: Install Suse
      include_tasks: asa-samples/install-suse.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Suse"
</code>   

<p>After installing the agent binaries, the playbook:</p>

 
   Defines the name of your server in ASA (canonical name) 
   Enrolls your server into the ASA project using the enrollment token you got in the previous section 
   Starts the ASA server agent 
 

<p>Edit the <code>asa-ansible-example/asa-playbook.yml</code>. On line 3, replace <code>&lt;hosts&gt;</code> with the hosts you want to enroll in ASA:</p>

   <code>-
  name: Install SFT
  hosts: &lt;hosts&gt;
</code>   

<p>If you have SUSE Linux servers, install the Ansible Galaxy module for zypper: <code>ansible-galaxy install community.general.zypper</code></p>

 Test playbook 

<p>Now that we have the playbook set, let’s see it in action. To do this, I’ll apply the playbook on a few servers to see how it works.</p>

<p>Enroll servers using the ansible-playbook command <code>ansible-playbook asa-playbook.yml -i &lt;inventory&gt; --extra-vars "asa_enrollment_token=&lt;token&gt;"</code>.</p>

<p>Replace:</p>

 
   <code>&lt;inventory&gt;</code>: with your inventory file (or any list of servers) 
   <code>&lt;token&gt;</code>: with the enrollment token from ASA 
 

<p>Ansible will run and register your servers, and return the following:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In ASA, you will see the servers enrolled in your project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this moment, your servers are enrolled in ASA. That means you can access your servers with users and groups from Okta associated with your project.</p>

 Test access to servers with Okta 

<p>Now that all servers are enrolled in Okta, let’s access the servers as a user:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/sft.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1610060131465000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1omaR8RXzvDBwm3OddiJVk">Install the ASA agent in your workstation</a> (required to access servers as a user): <code>brew install okta-advanced-server-access --cask</code></p>

<p>To set up the ASA agent, enter <code>sft enroll</code> and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>To see your servers, enter <code>sft list-servers</code>.</p>

   <code># sft list-servers
Waiting on browser...
Browser step completed successfully.
HOSTNAME                    OS_TYPE  PROJECT_NAME         ACCESS_ADDRESS
asa-ansible2-centos         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.101
asa-ansible3-centos         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.102
asa-ansible4-suse           linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.103
asa-ansible5-suse           linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.104
asa-ansible4-ubuntu         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.105
asa-ansible5-ubuntu         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.106
</code>   

<p>To ssh into your server, enter <code>sft ssh &lt;name-of-your-server&gt;</code>:</p>

   <code># sft ssh asa-ansible4-ubuntu
/home/frederico_hakamine #  
</code>   

 Wait, I have questions 

<p>What is Okta ASA doing?</p>

 
   Okta ASA secures access to Linux and Windows servers in SSH and RDP connections using the server agent (the same one that enrolled the server in your project earlier). 
   The ASA server agent, in addition to subscribing your server to a project, also works alongside native OS features such as sudo, users, and openssh to control access during runtime and to capture any login events for audit inspection. 
   Because the agent is light and does not require firewalls and monolithic LDAP or privileged access servers, it can be easily distributed across any infrastructure (IaaS, VM, or physical) and embedded in your DevOps tools. 
   To grant users access to servers, ASA operates a programmable Certificate Authority service as part of its SaaS, that issues ephemeral SSH Client Certificates for each authenticated and authorized request. The keys are issued only after ensuring both user and his/her device complies with the organization’s security policies. 
   The use of ephemeral keys provides many benefits. It eliminates the use of static keys and credentials for server access, ensures that both users and machines are audited before any new ssh connection, simplifies access revocation, eliminates the risk of “super account overuse”, and simplifies access audit. 
 

<p>Can I use this playbook with other Ansible provisioning modules?</p>

<p>Yes. You can use this sample with any other module available in <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index.html">Ansible</a> or the Ansible Galaxy. This includes provisioning modules to IaaS providers and Hypervisors, such as <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws">AWS</a>, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/vmware">VMWare</a>, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/google/cloud">GCP</a>, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/openstack/cloud">OpenStack</a>, and <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/azure/azcollection">Azure</a>. To do this, use the inventory plugins available with these modules to capture the inventory of servers and tags to apply the playbook.</p>

 What’s next? 

<p>After testing the playbook on some hosts, you expand it to more servers. To do so, tweak the playbook. You can, for example, store the enrollment token in <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/user_guide/vault.html">Ansible’s vault</a>, and also secure access to the Ansible controller with ASA using the same playbook. – i.e. update your <code>asa-playbook.yml</code>, changing the hosts to <code>local</code>, and then run the playbook pointing to local:</p>

<p><code>ansible-playbook  -c local -i localhost asa-playbook.yml --extra-vars "asa_enrollment_token=&lt;local&gt;"</code></p>

<p>You can also turn on additional features in Okta ASA, such as setup sudo grants, time-based access, use of bastion hosts, and SSH session capture just to name a few. All these features reduce the load on your playbooks and provide consistent account configuration across multiple servers.</p>

<p>Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, open-source blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data, discusses that while investors are integrating ESG factors into investment decisions, data privacy still remains one of the most pressing issues facing organizations today.</p><p>*NOTE* <a href="https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/why-privacy-should-be-esg-investors-next-big-priority/">originally published in Global Finance &amp; Banking&nbsp;Review</a></p><p>Investors are increasingly integrating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors into investment decisions in the hope that sustainable businesses offer less risk and long-term return on investment. Against this backdrop, data privacy and data management remains one of the most pressing issues facing organizations today.</p><p>Just recently, BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/blackrock-calls-for-climate-change-disclosure-expects-sustainable-investing-to-continue.html">predicted</a> a “tectonic shift” among investors towards sustainability-focused companies, which he believes is accelerating at an even greater speed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the largest money manager in the world, BlackRock has immense power in driving markets, however they are not alone: most large investment banks believe investing in sustainable companies is the future, a move that also helps to mitigate risk in uncertain times.</p><p>With sustainable investment surging, the risk of privacy and data breaches grows higher, as these relatively nascent investments may not have effective data management protocols in place. It is for that reason that the next big trend to join sustainable investing will be data privacy and data management.</p><p>When investors analyse companies they are thinking of investing in, they conduct thorough reviews of the companies’ finances, internal and external processes, hiring procedures, data management protocols, market position adherence to regulations such as GDPR and CCPA; the list is endless. At a time when cyber attacks and data breaches are happening more frequently than ever before, ensuring effective data management safeguards are in place is crucial to a company’s performance, especially one that is likely to receive increased investment. Investment firms must discern how the organization safeguards its system against an attack or fraud. How an organization safeguards its data against such attacks could set it apart as a waste of an investment, or a high profit deriving enterprise with sustainability at its&nbsp;core.</p><p>By integrating new measures such as Privacy-Enhancing Technology (PET) and decentralized identity solutions, organizations can stay ahead of the curve and, in doing so, increase attractiveness, competitive advantage, and revenue streams. These benefits can undoubtedly be enjoyed by sustainable companies, but also by those looking to enhance their market position while playing catchup with the now more popular than ever ESG-focused companies. The popularity of sustainable investments may soon outweigh that of companies that cannot put sustainability at the forefront of their business objectives, meaning that these companies must now find other ways to remain competitive and attractive to prospective investors. Maintaining industry leading data management processes can greatly assist with&nbsp;this.</p><p>Ensuring comprehensive data management procedures is also financially beneficial for companies seeking an edge over their competitors: according to a <a href="https://www.ponemon.org/">report completed by the American Ponemon Institute</a> in 2020, the average cost of a data breach was $3.86 million. This cost, in tandem with the impact on a companies’ share price, could be devastating for many companies seeking to maximize their position. Safeguarding these procedures also makes it easier to ensure adherence to regulations such as GDPR, breaches of which bring with them significant financial implications. For example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/technology/google-europe-gdpr-fine.html">Google was fined $57 million in 2018</a> for a breach of GDPR, forcing the company to amend their data management processes. The bottom line is that effective data management makes a significant difference not only to the profitability of a company, but also to the reputation. This is similar to the reputational concerns wrought upon companies that disregard sustainability: reputational damage costs&nbsp;money.</p><p><a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3325397/idc-expect-175-zettabytes-of-data-worldwide-by-2025.html">IDC predicts</a> that by the year 2025, 175 trillion gigabytes of new data will be created around the world. With more and more people working from home, away from the often greater data protection offered by physical servers in-office, company data will be at a far more significant risk than before in years to come. As hybrid working and cloud computing become the norm, vulnerabilities will emerge and with them, hackers too. Research has shown that the greater the amount of data at stake, the greater the number of hackers that exist. Bad actors will remain a feature of the data ecosystem, but preventative measures are actionable and achievable. Companies in every industry; from sustainable investments and investment banking, to blockchain, healthcare,and commerce, can enhance their market position by adopting privacy-enhancing technology and decentralized identity solutions to ensure the risk of data breach is minimized.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/why-privacy-should-be-esg-investors-next-big-priority-4f5f15a5a986">Why Privacy Should Be ESG Investors’ Next Big Priority</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Intake<p>At Spruce, we’re building a product suite to manage all aspects of the data supply chain. Here’s the latest from our development efforts</p> Intake <p>Intake is a smarter onboarding tool for businesses via secure document collection and processing. These artifacts can then be used as evidence to generate and issue credentials to the counterparty that originally uploaded&nbsp;them.</p><p>The focus on development has been on three&nbsp;areas:</p>  Frontend styling, specifically for creating forms, and for users receiving information requests.  Event logging to give a complete picture of every action a counterparty has taken from opening a request to submitting information.  We have set up CI/CD towards end-to-end testing and continuous feature deployments.   DIDKit <p><a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a> is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>  <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">DIDKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi">ssi</a> library released under Apache License, Version 2.0. Tagged release version&nbsp;0.1.0.  Implemented <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a>  Implemented linked data proof type for Tezos DID method (<a href="https://did-tezos-draft.spruceid.com/">did:tz</a>).  Built DIDKit CLI and HTTP server as Docker&nbsp;images.  Improved DID resolution support.  Adjusted API to allow for multiple DID methods derived from&nbsp;keypair.  DID method implementations modularized, making it easier to support more DID&nbsp;methods.  Updated Rust interfaces to use asynchronous I/O.  Documentation website launched: <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/</a>  Added more example shell&nbsp;scripts.  Added a CHAPI wallet implementation example.  Added a Spring Boot example application with sign-in powered by the previously mentioned CHAPI wallet example implementation using&nbsp;DIDKit.  Added Makefile targets to build static DIDKit library files for `aarch64-apple-ios` and `x86_64-apple-ios`.  (Unmerged) Added WASM build support using `wasm-pack`.  (Unmerged) Added Node.js build support using `neon-bindings`.   Credible <p><a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">Credible</a> is Spruce’s native credential wallet for the consumption, storage, and presentation of Verifiable Credentials on Android and&nbsp;iOS.</p>  Updated to make use of the official `v0.1.0` release of&nbsp;DIDKit.  Credible has now been built on iOS for the first time after DIDKit was updated, to build for `aarch64-apple-ios` and `x86_64-apple-ios`.  The settings were updated to include a personal profile page and pages with various notices (privacy, terms and conditions, licenses, etc).  There is now a DID sharing option available for&nbsp;users.   did-doge <p>As a quick experiment to demonstrate method interoperability, we’ve put together a <a href="https://did-doge.spruceid.com/">draft specification</a> for a <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/did-doge">DID Method</a> for the Dogecoin blockchain. Additionally, we plan on making a light rust implementation that integrates with&nbsp;DIDKit.</p><p>Our specification draws heavily from the work on <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">did:btcr</a> due to structural similarities. We managed to further improve upon the did:btcr spec with new privacy-preserving benefits.</p><p>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact">leave us a message</a>, and we will respond within 24&nbsp;hours.</p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">LinkedIn</a></p>

				 <p>This article is part of a growing set of articles called Pattern Breakers. This series helps highlight how the world’s pattern breakers change the world around them. The articles provide tactical and strategic approaches to breaking the patterns that are holding back your novel technologies. Each of the articles in the series will be adjusted and updated over time.&nbsp;</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>Let’s imagine you have created something that changes the world. Your approach to solving problems is radically different and far more effective and efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can describe how your technology can be used to solve really hard problems – making them easy.&nbsp;You know it truly changes the world.</p>
<p>But you can’t make progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of the world beating a path to your door, you’re pushing harder and harder to make minimal progress.</p>
<p>Your marketing, business development, and sales teams talk about all the excitement in the field. But your tech doesn’t create blowout projects. You give your kit away, you pay for organizations to use it, you get paid to deploy.</p>
<p>…but the momentum doesn’t come. In fact you’re feeling like you haven’t moved at all – or moved backwards.</p>
<p>Your API is amazing and developers rave about how easy it is to use and how thoughtful it is. Your SDK works on iOS and Android and is a thing of beauty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means it likely isn’t your technology – though there are most certainly pieces in the technology that can be improved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your big problem is that you are breaking an existing pattern.&nbsp;Patterns help people understand complex things. They are there to simplify things – including the change required to get to a given state. If you’re asking to break a pattern you’re breaking the comfort with the existing pattern.</p>
<p>Being a Pattern Breaker is hard. You’re facing many obstacles.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inertia – Your potential customers are either solving their problems a different (harder, less efficient) way and it is working; or they have put the problem in a “too hard to solve” bucket. 
 Hysteresis – Organizations are like organisms. Changes in one area cause things to shift and the organism works to bring things back to its known state. 
 Early Adopters – they aren’t what you think you need. 
 Old Way Works Well Enough – this is partly momentum and partly messaging. 
 Don’t Grok It – You think they understand what you’re presenting but they don’t. (hint: if your customer groks the word “grok” you’re probably talking to the wrong person. 
 Momentum – more physics here – you need momentum to overcome the inertia in existing systems. 
 Incremental Change Isn’t Exciting – incremental change where percentages point improvements are all you can see are hard to convince. Tweaking the old ways is how we look to solve this kind of problem not big change. 
 
<p>Over time the bullets above will be fleshed out with discrete articles – with strategies and tactics that help you look at the situation better. This is the framework that we use with our clients. They have been applied for over a decade with success in some of the hardest organizational areas. While some approaches are simple, it is the subtle use and application that makes all the difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep being awesome.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Darrell</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.fico.com/ultrafico/themes/custom/ultrafico/assets/UltraFICO_Infographic_Consumer_Cobranded.pdf">FICO</a>, “79 million people in the U.S. have [credit] scores below 680, a common lender threshold of acceptable credit.” And “53 million people in the U.S. do not have enough data in their credit files to generate a FICO® Score.” With low scores or no scores, these tens of millions of Americans don’t have access to loans to help them take the next step in their financial journey. Additionally, many Americans don’t have access to other financial products and services that could help them be more financially stable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These consumers aren’t seeing the benefits of <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview">financial inclusion</a> or, as the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview">World Bank</a> puts it, “access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs—transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance—delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.”</p>
<p>While these consumers may not have credit in the traditional sense or access to financial services, many have money flowing in and out of their accounts and may be perfectly <a href="https://www.finicity.com/financial-inclusion-cash-flow-analytics/">capable of repaying their debts</a>. So how can financial inclusion improve to include those who would be excellent candidates for financial products and services, even if their credit scores are low or nonexistent? Here are two crucial ways to improve financial inclusion:</p>
 
 Financial institutions need to look at the whole picture of financial health—not just the traditional measures of creditworthiness or simply the propensity to repay. 
 Consumers need to have access to financial services and products in place of high-risk, nontraditional lenders or accounts. 
 
<p>Keep reading to learn why these are important and how to make them happen.</p>
 A Holistic Picture of Financial Health 
<p>Currently, lenders gauge creditworthiness by looking at <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/five-c-credit.asp#:~:text=The%20five%20Cs%20of%20credit%20are%20character%2C%20capacity,capital%2C%20collateral%2C%20and%20conditions.">the five Cs of credit</a>:</p>
 
 Character. What is reflected in the applicant’s credit history? 
 Capacity. What is the applicant’s debt-to-income ratio? 
 Capital. How much money does the applicant have? 
 Collateral. Does the applicant own an asset that can back the loan? 
 Conditions. What is the purpose of the loan? What is the amount involved? And what are interest rates like? 
 
<p>While these five Cs are definitely good indicators to take into account, financial institutions miss out on lending opportunities when these are the only criteria they look at. Lenders should look at the whole picture of financial health, which includes indicators besides good credit. These can include bank account health, responsible spending behavior, and bill payment history.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sharecare.com/health/financial-planning-health-care/article/5-steps-to-a-healthier-bank-account">Bank account health</a> is a great indicator that consumers are responsible with their finances:</p>
 
 They are prepared for financial crises. They don’t overspend and they have started a retirement account. 
 They have both a savings account and an emergency savings account. 
 They <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/banks/articles/how-much-money-should-you-really-keep-in-checking-account/">stay above the minimum balance requirement</a> for checking accounts. 
 
<p>When consumers demonstrate responsible spending behavior, they avoid <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111813/five-rules-improve-your-financial-health.asp">lifestyle inflation</a> and stick to a budget. Their expenses do not exceed their income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill payment history not related to credit may include utilities, internet and phone, and subscriptions. If consumers are paying all their bills and paying on time, they’re likely a good candidate for financial services.</p>
<p>Financial inclusion improves when financial institutions look at the whole picture of financial health and not just the traditional measures of creditworthiness or simply the propensity to repay.</p>
 High-Risk Loans 
<p>Currently, consumers with low or no credit typically have access only to <a href="https://www.netcredit.com/high-risk-loans">high-risk loans</a>. These loans often charge high fees and interest rates, may require big-ticket items for collateral, and may put a cosigner on the hook if the loans are not repaid. Payday lenders, for example, can legally charge annual interest rates of up to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loansharking.asp">400 percent</a>. Clearly, high-risk loans are not a responsible or sustainable way for consumers to improve their financial situation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the best loans out there are typically available only to people with high credit. While interest rates are currently very low, “borrowers will likely face stricter lending standards as lenders try to protect against the coronavirus downturn,” writes <a href="https://loans.usnews.com/personal">Zina Kumok for U.S. News</a>. While these loans are great options for those who qualify, standards for qualification are high and unattainable for many borrowers.</p>
<p>Financial inclusion improves when borrowers have access to financial services and products in place of high-risk, nontraditional lenders or accounts.</p>
 Bridging the Gap between Financial Exclusion and Financial Inclusion 
<p>To bridge the gap between what is currently available and what could be available, consumers and lenders need to have access to alternative data. This data can be provided through transactions and account details via open banking connections.</p>
<p>Two examples of this solution are Experian Boost and UltraFICO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/score-boost.html">Experian Boost</a> is a service that can do the following:</p>
 
 Raise FICO® Scores quickly 
 Give credit for paying non-credit-related bills 
 Give consumers free access to their Experian credit report and FICO® Score 
 Provide Experian credit monitoring and alerts 
 
<p>An <a href="https://www.fico.com/ultrafico/">UltraFICO</a> Score aims to enhance consumers’ FICO® Scores by taking sound financial behavior into account. If consumers consistently have cash on hand and their accounts maintain a positive balance, their UltraFICO Score may actually be higher than their FICO Score. According to <a href="https://www.fico.com/ultrafico/themes/custom/ultrafico/assets/UltraFICO_Infographic_Consumer_Cobranded.pdf">UltraFICO</a>, there are “15 million people in the U.S. who can receive an UltraFICO Score, even if [they] don’t have enough credit history to generate a FICO Score.”</p>
<p>An UltraFICO Score is generated instantly, giving you access to good credit decisioning as soon as you need it. With the ability to improve or create traditional credit scores, consumers have greater access to traditional loans and lower interest rates, giving them a boost towards their financial goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20200925171922/Finicity-Lend.pdf">Finicity Lend</a> data services are another resource to improve financial inclusion. Made possible by our open banking platform, Finicity Lend gives consumers the power to permission data access and gives lenders access to the data they need to make credit decisions. With Finicity Lend, lenders can make decisions that benefit them and consumers, and consumers are empowered to be fully involved in the process.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans are currently financially excluded, so improving financial inclusion is crucial to help them reach their financial goals. When financial institutions look at the whole picture of financial health, and when consumers have access to responsible financial services and products, financial inclusion improves and everyone benefits.</p>

<p>Vanaf vandaag, 4 februari, accepteert ook Woonnu brondata via Ockto bij het beoordelen van hypotheekaanvragen. Hierdoor versnelt het hypotheektraject doordat er 2 documenten minder aangeleverd hoeven te worden, de gegevens in één keer goed zijn en ze gemakkelijk digitaal kunnen worden opgehaald en aangeleverd bij Woonnu. Het gaat om data van UWV, Mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl en MijnOverheid.nl. Dat betekent dat het handmatig aanleveren van de werkgeversverklaring en Mijnpensioenoverzicht (MPO) voor de hypotheekaanvraag overbodig is. Een flinke stap in de digitalisering van de hypotheekaanvraag bij Woonnu.</p>



 Snel een volledig klantbeeld 



<p>Intermediairs kunnen met Ockto hun klanten op een eenvoudige, veilige en efficiënte manier gegevens laten aanleveren die zij nodig hebben voor het maken van het hypotheekadvies, de inventarisatie. Niet alleen van het UWV en Mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl, maar ook van MijnOverheid.</p>



 Hypotheekacceptatie op basis van brondata 



<p>Woonnu en hypotheekverwerker Quion zetten met het gebruik maken van brondata via Ockto een stap in het versnellen van het hypotheekacceptatieproces. Op deze manier hoeven er minder documenten los aangeleverd te worden, wat de foutkans verkleint. Bij Woonnu gaat het om de werkgeversverklaring en het pensioenoverzicht, daarbij hoeft het legitimatiebewijs pas bij het bindend kredietaanbod aangeleverd te worden. De stukkenlijst geeft vervolgens aan welke documenten nog wel aangeleverd moeten worden.</p>



 Toekomstbeeld: documentloze hypotheekacceptatie 



<p>Woonnu streeft naar een zo volledig mogelijke digitalisering van de hypotheekaanvraag. Dit is een eerste stap in deze richting. Op termijn zullen er meer gegevens op basis van brondata gevalideerd kunnen worden. Het doel is te komen op een hypotheekacceptatie zonder losse documenten.</p>



 Over de Ockto en de Brondata Service 



<p>Steeds meer partijen bieden mogelijkheden aan om digitaal informatie te delen, maar vaak ieder op zijn eigen manier. Daarom heeft Ockto samen met diverse ketenpartners de <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/hypotheekacceptatie/">Brondata Service</a> ontwikkeld. Met deze nieuwe standaard kan de consument zijn data veilig delen met verschillende partijen binnen de hypotheekketen.</p>



 Over Woonnu 



<p>Woonnu B.V. is een Nederlandse hypotheekaanbieder opgericht in 2020 en is een zelfstandige dochter van Nationale-Nederlanden Bank N.V. (NN Bank). Woonnu biedt eigentijdse hypotheekoplossingen voor de aankoop en/of verduurzaming van woningen en beloont duurzaam wonen met een duurzaamheidskorting op de hypotheekrente. Met Woonnu speelt NN Bank in op de toenemende vraag naar platformen waarbij institutionele investeerders in de Nederlandse hypotheekmarkt kunnen stappen. Het is een hybride regie platform, waarbij financiering niet alleen komt vanuit investeerders. Ook NN Bank zelf is investeerder. Als platform biedt Woonnu hiermee investeerders de mogelijkheid om samen de vergroening van de Nederlandse woningmarkt te financieren.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Oh, how time flies! It seems that the whole story of Zero Trust as a revolutionary concept for designing computer networks began just yesterday, but it’s been over a decade already. In fact, the very idea that was later somewhat awkwardly named “de-perimeterization” was being discussed nearly 20 years ago. Back then, in the early 2000s, years before the era of the cloud and ubiquitous presence of smart mobile devices, organizations were already feeling the pressure to reorganize their networks for the digital transformation – establishing communications to their partners, contractors, and even customers, building API-based public interfaces to their data siloes and embracing the early ideas of Internet-scale computing.</p>
<p>In 2009, John Kindervag, back then with the analyst firm Forrester, has come up with the idea that networks should be designed without implicit trust, enforcing strict identity verification and least-privilege access policies for every user, device, or application, regardless of whether they are located in the former local area network or somewhere on the Internet. The deceptive simplicity of the idea and the catchy name appealed to both industry experts and the public, and for over a decade Zero Trust has been one of the hottest buzzwords in IT.</p>
 Zero Trust: so close and yet so elusive 
<p>Alas, it seems that Zero Trust has been also one of the most elusive buzzwords as well. Back in the same 2009, Google has introduced BeyondCorp, a security framework created as a result of a sophisticated cyberattack on their internal infrastructure and aimed to prevent similar breaches in the future. BeyondCorp shifted access controls from the perimeter to individual devices and users. In a sense, it was a reference implementation of Zero Trust that the company has deployed internally. Now everyone wanted to be like Google!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, being like Google turned out to be somewhat complicated to achieve. Most organizations were looking for off-the-shelf solutions that would completely replace their existing network infrastructures: they were planning on “buying Zero Trust”. Turned out, Zero Trust doesn’t work this way. The very foundational principles of the concept show that Zero Trust is not a product or even a technology – first and foremost it requires a major paradigm shift in many aspects of IT and even core business processes of an organization. The only sensible way to achieve Zero Trust is a long journey where every step solves a specific problem and also strategically brings you a bit closer to the “holy grail”.</p>
 The gift that keeps on giving 
<p>On the bright side, however, even if the concept itself turned out to be quite hard to get hold of, it has created entirely new markets for innovative security, compliance, and IAM solutions. Without Zero Trust, we would not have software-defined networking and microsegmentation, no cloud access security brokers (CASB), and definitely no Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) platforms. And when the COVID pandemic radically changed our society, the solutions that evolved from the original concept have made our lives a bit easier and safer.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a hundred years before Zero Trust, Vladimir Lenin once said: “The electron is just as inexhaustible as the atom, nature is infinite…”. Well, it seems that this idea is just as applicable to the notion of Zero Trust: over a decade after its conception, it keeps on giving…</p>
<p>But why am I writing this post anyway? Well, two things. First, last week Google has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp-enterprise">BeyondCorp Enterprise</a>, the direct descendant of their original Zero Trust solution. Some of the new features include agentless design (in fact, Google Chrome will be the platform’s agent, but you probably have it already), integrated threat and data protection, and simplified deployment. It seems that after 12 years in development, Google believes that Zero Trust has finally reached the product stage. Is it too ambitious a claim?</p>
 Come to the Zero Trust side 
<p>Hopefully, we’ll find out soon how BeyondCorp Enterprise fares against competitors – after all, the Zero Trust market is already pretty crowded, with both large companies like Microsoft, Cisco, or Akamai and more specialized vendors like Okta or Pulse Secure already have their own solutions to all your Zero Trust needs. When it comes to the potential ease of deployment and agentless operations, one could, for example, argue that Microsoft's ubiquitous presence on desktops (with Windows), in data centers (with Active Directory), and in the cloud (with Azure AD and Office 365) would make it an even <a href="https://aka.ms/ztguide">more enticing choice</a> for customers.</p>
<p>After all, the key obstacle to adopting Zero Trust beyond just standalone “quick win” deployments is the need to make the model work in every layer of your IT, from devices and networks to applications and data. Without a carefully planned strategy, it may end up wasting enormous efforts and resources. But how to avoid a Zero Trust disappointment?</p>
<p>Well, here comes a great opportunity to find it out yourself! KuppingerCole is planning an online event on Zero Trust on February 17th, with a focus on “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/zero-trust-reality">Making Zero Trust a Reality</a>”. We’ll be discussing a broad range of topics and technologies that enable or are enabled by Zero Trust and show how they can solve the very tangible challenges your company is facing during these difficult times.</p>

<p>Crypto News Flash: Development activity is the raisin d’etre for blockchain platforms. Those projects that manage to attract developers often find it a snowball effect, where a few successful launches serve as a showcase of the platform’s potential, which attracts more developers. One example of where this is visible is in the Ardor blockchain, which launched in early 2018. Over the last three years, Jelurida, the Swiss software development company that operates Ardor, has been working hard to attract developers. As Ardor now supports a multitude of real-world use cases, the work has paid off, with more activity on the way in 2021. Achieving a balance between ready-made features and near-limitless customization options has paid off for Ardor. The platform has become a hub of development activity, with numerous applications gaining traction</p>

<p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>Here’s a quick update on KILT’s plans for the next few months as we get closer to mainnet launch. We’ll continue to update you on milestones and partnerships via this blog, our <a href="http://twitter.com/kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a> channels and our <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/newsletter/">newsletter</a>. But first, a brief overview.</p><p>KILT provides a base layer for verifiable credentials in the Web 3.0 world. We’re building a permissionless trust infrastructure for real-world business cases like our <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/fractal-kilt-protocol-and-polkadex-collaborate-to-provide-decentralised-kyc-solution-for-exchange-d9d0f8c18163">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://thelosangelestribune.com/2021/01/20/degenics-com-aims-to-provide-anonymous-personal-genetic-testing-through-a-decentralized-blockchain-platform/">genetics testing</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-france-gaia-x-cloud-platform-eu-tech-sovereignty/">cloud computing</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/dena-selects-energy-web-to-build-prototype-identity-registry-for-germanys-energy-market-2580f53b2d20">energy</a> partnerships. We’re also exploring collaborations in climate change and&nbsp;gaming.</p><p>Why does KILT need a parachain?<br>The opportunity to launch on Kusama and iterate with other fast-moving Polkadot projects is very attractive. A Kusama parachain could provide core functionality for KILT including:</p>  The ability to finalise blocks and thus secure our network, even while KILT is backed by a relatively small collator network. This provides extra security to the KILT Blockchain.  KILT would be able to provide its DIDs (Decentralised Identifiers) and Verifiable Credentials through the Relay Chain to other parachain projects inside the ecosystem.  This would provide enormous network effects for the KILT Blockchain.  KILT would soon be able to utilise functionality from other parachains, such as smart contract systems and&nbsp;oracles.  <p>We aim to go live with a Kusama parachain as soon as possible, because many ecosystem projects intend to use KILT functionality and we want to provide this at the earliest possible&nbsp;time.</p><p>Consequently we will participate in the first Kusama parachain auctions, and aim to start our mainnet on Kusama shortly after securing a parachain slot. We also anticipate the development of a Kusama to Polkadot bridge, which would enable us to provide the KILT functionality to Polkadot parachain projects.</p><p>For this reason we decided to switch around the launches of KILT and Polimec. KILT mainnet will now launch first. Later we plan to launch an upgraded version of Polimec that already incorporates KILT functionality.</p><p>What’s scheduled next</p>  KILT secures parachain slot on Rococo (29 January&nbsp;2021)  Parity team launches Kusama parachain auction&nbsp;timeline  KILT wins auction to secure parachain slot on&nbsp;Kusama  KILT implements mainnet, PoS migration and governance  Polimec upgraded version&nbsp;launches  KILT roadmap — how we plan to roll out KILT Protocol (click to enlarge or view on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/parachains/">kilt.io</a>)<p>With the Kusama parachain, KILT shall gradually go live as a fully decentralised protocol. We’re excited about the new possibilities for our partners, builders and the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Later KILT may bid for a Polkadot parachain slot and move the KILT Parachain to the Polkadot network. This possible upgrade is one of the decisions to be made by the KILT community, via the protocol’s future governance model.</p><p>Initial KILT Collator Programme</p><p>And as we move from testnet to mainnet, KILT plans to start the Initial KILT Collator Programme in February. If you are interested in running a KILT collator node, please email us at collators@kilt.io.</p>

 January Edition <p>Welcome to our monthly roundup — January edition, as always I’m bringing you the scoop of the month. If you have been reading the regular updates we share in Telegram or Twitter, you probably already know that we’ve now got a working Elemental Chat application and that we are hard at work preparing the Holochain and Holo infrastructure so that we can release it to all hosts. We are almost&nbsp;there!</p><p>If you’re wondering what exactly we’ve been working on at Holo and Holochain this past month — the wait is over! Let’s jump right&nbsp;in.</p> New Year, New&nbsp;Energy <p>The first Dev Pulse of the new year is going to be a short one. That’s not because nothing’s happening — in fact, it’s partly because there’s a lot going on, and I need to get back to it. Holochain RSM is growing up, and it’s time for both veteran and new devs to start developing on it. (That means that new developer documentation is coming&nbsp;soon!)</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 88 — <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/new-year-new-energy/">New Year, New&nbsp;Energy</a></p> Testing, Testing, Testing (and some goodies for developers) <p>The big focus of the last couple weeks has been testing Holochain, by way of testing Elemental Chat on HoloPorts. We’ve narrowed down the scenarios where performance decreases, and we’re doubling down on making Holochain work well in those scenarios.</p><p>I’ve also got a grab bag of news for developers — tools, promises of tools, and breaking changes in Holochain that should make your life a bit&nbsp;easier.</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 89 — <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/testing-testing-testing-and-some-goodies-for-developers/">Testing, Testing, Testing (and some goodies for developers)</a></p> Moving HoloFuel up on the&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Yes, you read that right! We are actually ahead of where we expected to be in some ways. While it is taking a while to complete infrastructure testing because that is one of the most complex aspects of our work, we have been able to move many other activities forward. Because of that we decided to shift the HoloFuel application up in the roadmap. Here is what it looks like with the new changes. <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">Check it out on our website where you will find more&nbsp;details</a>.</p> Holochain RSM Migration Guide <p>while there’s not a lot of code samples in the guide, it does point out ways that we’ve been able to learn things over the past couple years. We’ve been able to leverage Rust in better ways for the SDK, which means app devs are able to cut their code 50–60% and write more ergonomic code in the process. We’re also taking advantage of advances in concurrency libs from the Rust ecosystem to remove deadlocks and race conditions and generally make this crazy distributed computing thing more efficient.</p><p>So the migration guide + the HDK docs (not available online, unfortunately), plus the new holochain codebase might be interesting for other RiB devs to explore. <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/blog/holochain-rsm-migration-guide/">Check out evolving Migration Guide from Redux to&nbsp;RSM</a></p> Regular Holo Dev Updates on&nbsp;Twitter <p>If you are curious about the — hot from the press dev updates — those can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_">Twitter</a>.</p> Low Code&nbsp;Zone <p>A series focusing on simple hApp dev solutions for real humans.

One such signature scheme is known as CL signature that is named after its <a href="https://jan.camenisch.org/">Jan Camenisch</a> and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/alysyans/">Anna Lysyanskaya</a> in a series of papers from 2001 to 2004 [CL01, CL02, CL03, CL04]. CL signature popularized Anoncreds, and it also served as a cryptographic building block in Identity Mixer (Idemix) and Hyperledger Indy projects.</p><p>Here, we first discuss two important concepts for understanding CL signature—the discrete logarithm problem and cryptographic commitment—and then outline subprotocols of CL signature. Finally, the application of CL signature on selective disclosure is discussed.</p> Discrete Logarithm Problem <p>Given real numbers y and a, the value of m from an expression y=a^m can be calculated by evaluating a logarithm of y to base a, i.e. m=log_a(y). The term m = log_a(y) can be easily calculated when all a,m,y&gt;=0 are Real numbers. However, when y and a are members of a sufficiently large discrete group G, finding m becomes extremely difficult. This is known as the discrete logarithm problem, which serves as the foundation of many modern cryptographic protocols, including CL-signature.</p> Cryptographic Commitment <p>A commitment scheme is a cryptographic protocol that allows one to commit to a message while keeping it hidden to other parties, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. A commitment scheme that is considered here is known as the Pedersen commitment. In its simplified version, a commitment c of a message m is simply c = a^m where a is a member of a large discrete group G. The commitment c can be sent to another person, called the receiver, and the receiver will not be able to calculate m due to the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.</p><p>At a later time, the message m can then be revealed to the receiver. The receiver then verifies that the message m is really the one that was committed by checking that the expression a^m is really equal to&nbsp;c.</p><p>A more detailed discussion on Pedersen commitment can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/ped">here</a>.</p> CL signature <p>Originally, CL signature is based on the strong RSA (SRSA) assumption. As a result, its key sizes are very long to provide sufficient security against ever faster prime factorization algorithms and computers. There has been an improvement on this issue by using paring-based cryptography.</p><p>Here, for simplicity, we discuss the signing algorithm base on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_RSA_assumption">strong RSA (SRSA) assumption</a>. We consider two parties, namely an issuer, a holder, and a verifier. The issuer signs a signature on blocks of messages (or attributes) for the holder, and the holder then shares the messages together with the signature to the verifier. We assume that the holder has L messages m_1, m_2, m_3,&nbsp;…, m_L. The CL signature scheme consists of 3&nbsp;steps:</p>  Key generation  Signature generation  Signature verification   1. Key generation (Issuer) <p>First, the issuer generates two random numbers {p,q} that form a secret key. From the private key p and q&nbsp;, the issuer calculates</p><p>and then generate L+2 random numbers from a quadratic residue modulo&nbsp;n</p><p>The variables a_1, a_2, a_3,&nbsp;..., a_L, b, c, n form a public key for the&nbsp;issuer.</p> 2. Signature generation (Issuer) <p>First, the issuer generates a random prime e and random number s&nbsp;. Given input L messages m_1, m_2, m_3,&nbsp;…, m_L, the issuer computes the value v such&nbsp;that</p><p>The variables(e, s, v) forms the signature of the input L messages m_1, m_2, m_3,&nbsp;…, m_L&nbsp;.</p> 3. Signature verification (Holder and Verifier) <p>Given the signature (e,s,v) of messages m_1,&nbsp;..., m_L the holder can use the issuer’s public key a_1, a_2, a_3,&nbsp;..., a_L, b, c, n to verify that the signature is generated correctly by checking that the LHS and RHS of the following equation are&nbsp;equal.</p><p>After the holder is in possession of the signature, the holder can then share the messages m_1,&nbsp;..., m_L and the signature (e,s,v) with the verifier. The verifier can then use the issuer’s public key and follow the same signature verification algorithm to verify&nbsp;that</p>  the signature is really signed by the&nbsp;issuer  the messages m_1,&nbsp;..., m_L have not been changed or tampered with since the moment the signature is generated.  <p>This process allows the messages to be tamper-proof.</p> Selective disclosure <p>In the signature generation and signature verification algorithms above, the holder has an option to&nbsp;either:</p>  directly send a message m_i to the signer/verifier, and the signer/verifier can then compute (a_i ^ m_i) mod n;&nbsp;or  compute (a_i^m_i) mod n, which is the commitment of m_i, and sends it to the signer/verifier.  <p>Given the hardness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm">discrete logarithm problem</a>, the signer/verifier will not be able to compute the holder’s m_i from the commitmenta_i^m_i mod n. Therefore, the holder can selectively disclose which message(s) (or attributes) are revealed to the issuer/verifier. As a result, the issuer is capable of generating a valid signature without full knowledge of all messages. Similarly, the verifier is capable of verifying that the holder really possesses the messages even if the verifier does not gain full knowledge of all messages.</p><p>For example, the holder possesses 3 messages m_1, m_2, m_3. The holder could reveal m_1, m_2 and send a_3^m_3 mod n to the issuer to sign. Once the holder obtains the signature from the issuer. The holder can reveal m_2 and sends a_1^m_1 mod n, a_3^m_3 mod n together with the signature to the verifier. The verifier can finally verify that the holder possesses valid m_1, m_2, m_3—that have not been tampered with—even without the knowledge of m_1,&nbsp;m_3.</p><p>These capabilities laid the foundation for realizing and popularizing Anoncreds. In the final part of <a href="https://medium.com/finema/anonymous-credential-part-3-bbs-signature-26797721ca74">this series</a>, we discuss a sophisticated signature scheme for Anoncreds, which is known as the BBS+ signature.</p> References <p>[CL01] Jan Camenisch and Anna Lysyanskaya.

<p>After completing many major milestones in 2020, the Dock team is looking forward to another year of building innovative solutions, driving adoption, and engaging with our community.</p><p>Today we’re excited to share our <a href="https://www.dock.io/roadmap">updated roadmap</a> for 2021, which aims to take further steps for removing inefficiencies and centralized control from the issuance and management of credentials. In addition to working toward this goal, we will continue our efforts to increase adoption of the Dock offerings through enhanced features and user experience.</p><p>Below are high-level descriptions of the upcoming milestones:</p><p>Ledger Wallet Support (Q1)</p><p>The team has been hard at work to enable users to store the new Dock mainnet token on <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s">Ledger Nano S</a> hardware wallet. At the time of writing, we have submitted a new app for DOCK support to the Ledger team and are waiting for the review process to be completed. We will keep the community posted on our progress and release detailed instructions once this milestone is completed.</p><p>Delegatable Credentials (Q1)</p><p>We are currently working on a feature that will enable credential issuers to delegate, to other entities, the ability to issue and revoke verifiable credentials. We expect this feature to serve many important use cases in which a central entity (e.g., government) allows other groups (e.g., private test centers) to manage verifiable credentials (e.g., professional license) on its behalf.</p><p>Chainlink Oracle Integration (Q1)</p><p>Dock is integrating <a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a> to our mainnet using its <a href="https://data.chain.link/">price feeds</a>, so that the services on the network can be priced in USD. Read our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-integrating-chainlink-to-price-credential-services-in-usd/">earlier blog post</a> to learn more.</p><p>Dock Token Migration Ends (Q1)</p><p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-token-migration-part-4-the-migration-begins/">earlier post</a>, the Dock token migration will end at midnight (GMT) on March 7, 2021, and all token holders must swap their ERC20 tokens to the new, native tokens before then.</p><p>Proof of Stake (Q2)</p><p>During the second quarter of 2021, we will further decentralize and democratize the Dock network governance by transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus protocol and allowing token holders to vote on key decisions. More details are available <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/gov-pos">here</a>. This phase will also provide the community with one of our most requested features, <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">staking</a>.</p><p>Dock Server and Wallet (Q2)</p><p>We’ve received lots of valuable feedback from the community over the past year, and many users have requested that we provide a wallet with which they can easily store and manage Dock tokens and credentials. As a starting point for this effort, we will build the cloud version of the Dock wallet, run on the Dock server.</p><p>Dock App v0.1 (Q3)</p><p>In Q3 of 2021, we will deliver a cross-platform app that serves as the mobile version of the Dock wallet. The app will allow users to store Dock tokens, send and receive tokens, as well as present verifiable credentials from their devices. The first version of the app will be launched as a private alpha, and as discussed below, tested intensively before being evolved into a beta version.</p><p>Dock App v0.2 (Q4)</p><p>Once the first version of the app is completed, the team will invite a select group of community members to try it and provide feedback. We will then build a new iteration, version 0.2, based on the user feedback. We plan on performing extensive penetration testing on the app at this stage as well, and distributing the new version to a wider audience once completed.<br></p><p>Our team is looking forward to achieving these exciting milestones and continuing to grow Dock’s offerings. We will, as always, keep the community updated through our blog (to which you can subscribe below) and social media channels.</p>

<p>Mercoledì 10 febbraio, Igor Marcolongo e Daniele Citterio – rispettivamente Head of Business Compliance e Chief Technology Officer in InfoCert – saranno i relatori in un webinar sul tema Identità digitale europea e Self-Sovereign Identity.</p>



<p>Il webinar è organizzato dall’Associazione Prestatori di servizi di Pagamento (APSP)e si svolgerà il 10 febbraio 2021 dalle 10:00 alle 11:00.</p>



<p>L’applicazione di Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) nel campo dell’identità digitale è una pratica sempre più diffusa e, oggi, anche la Commissione Europea sta riflettendo sulla possibilità di sviluppare una identità digitale europea basata su questi concetti.</p>



<p>Nel corso del Webinar parleremo delle evoluzioni in corso, faremo una panoramica su DIZME – un network di servizi promosso da InfoCert che sfrutta i vantaggi di una Identità Digitale Self Sovreign, basata su tecnologia Blockchain – e ne illustreremo le potenzialità.</p>



<p>Più in dettaglio parleremo di:</p>



  ipotesi di identità digitale europea nella revisione del Regolamento eIDAS;  Self-Sovereign Identity e applicazioni della DLT all’identità digitale;  DIZME, governance e opportunità di partecipazione.  



<p>Per prenotazioni e informazioni è possibile inviare una e-mail a <a href="mailto:francesca.rossetti@apsp.it">francesca.rossetti@apsp.it</a>.</p>

			<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.engage.hoganlovells.com/knowledgeservices/viewContent.action?key=Ec8teaJ9VaqgJXpiSpeTQMxgHJMKLFEppVpbbVX%2B3OXcP3PYxlq7sZUjdbSm5FIetvAtgf1eVU8%3D&amp;nav=FRbANEucS95NMLRN47z%2BeeOgEFCt8EGQ0qFfoEM4UR4%3D&amp;emailtofriendview=true&amp;freeviewlink=true">Luxembourg’s regulator, the CSSF, adopted a bill</a> that explicitly recognised the possibility of using distributed ledger technology for the dematerialisation of securities.</p>
<p>The regulation is moving quickly across Europe: Tokenized securities now fall under the same rules and regulations as traditional financial instruments in many other European countries including <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/content/dam/cliffordchance/briefings/2020/10/security-token-offerings-a-european-perspective-on-regulation.pdf">France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the UK</a>.</p>
 What will this new bill in Luxembourg mean for tokenized securities?&nbsp; 
<p>The Bill is a continuation of the law passed in 1 March 2019. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after it was introduced we saw a surge in demand from financial institutions in the region. Curiosity was sparked in Luxembourg and in wider European markets. Most importantly, it gave market actors the confidence they needed to start utilising the technology operationally. In the coming months, we expect the same to happen across the industry due to this recent regulatory development.</p>
 How can market actors adopt the technology? 
<p>For market actors to adopt the technology and benefit from the automation and transferability improvements, they need to do so in a compliant manner. Control and regulations still needs to be enforced. Therefore, proven and open-source security token standards like the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX protocol</a> are essential as they allow assets to be represented on the blockchain compliantly. They enable agents appointed by the issuer to exercise control over assets and ensure the securities can only be held by eligible investors.</p>
 What do we expect to happen in the year ahead?&nbsp; 
<p>We believe the regulation will give even more confidence to the financial services sector in Luxembourg and beyond. So far, Luxembourg has been one of the most proactive jurisdictions in Europe with its first law in 2019. However, this needed to be developed and last week’s law will bring more clarity and more confidence to asset owners. Real estate closed-end funds are currently the asset class that benefits the most from this new form of securities and we expect this to accelerate in 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://tokeny.com/weinvest-leverages-blockchain-technology-to-increase-its-real-estate-funds-value-proposition/">WeInvest</a>, <a href="https://www.finimmo.com/">Finimmo</a>, and <a href="https://tokeny.com/digibrixx-democratizes-real-estate-via-tokenization/">Digibrixx</a> are already tokenizing real estate assets in Luxembourg, showing the way for digitization to other fund servicers.</p>

  <p>Without question, comparing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce identity and access management (IAM)</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga">identity governance and administration (IGA) </a>providers is a massive undertaking. The stakes are high to meet digital transformation requirements, support and secure a remote workforce, and be prepared for future disruptions. And, sadly, ramifications of a poor IAM and IGA purchase decision live long.</p>

<p>You need to evaluate IAM and IGA providers not only for their ability to meet your current requirements, but also those to come. But, what are they? And, how do you know you’re asking the right RFP questions for your unique needs?</p>

<p>We’re here to help with a highly informative <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/workforce-iam-eval-guide">Workforce IAM Evaluation Guide</a>. The guide starts with a review of what to look for in an IAM and IGA solution in order to address <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/modernizing-workforce-iam">today and tomorrow’s workforce demands and trends</a>. For example:</p>

  Enabling remote work with trusted internal apps that can be accessed anywhere 
	 Giving users secure and appropriate levels of access to resources, systems, and apps while constantly verifying that access at scale 
	 Opening externally to third-party systems, apps, and identity-driven API ecosystems 
	 Securing digital workplace IoT “things,” such as robotics and sensors, as well as their associated data and system integrations 
	 Enabling a seamless migration of identities across systems to support evolving needs, such as reorganization or mergers and acquisitions 
	 Decreasing the strain on IT departments, resources, and administrators 
 <p>The guide also discusses that, in order to achieve all of the above and more, an IAM and IGA solution should include a series of strategic identity components that go beyond the basics of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">single sign on</a> <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">(SSO)</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/tag/multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>, authorization, and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, in order to ensure that you give users secure and appropriate levels of access to resources, systems, and apps and constantly verify that access at scale, you need a solution that takes the basic identity components ‘identity management’ and ‘identity governance’ to the next level. This includes integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with your current identity systems. Using AI and ML, you can quickly collect and analyze identity data such as accounts, roles, and entitlements to identify security access and risk blind spots, as well as assist managers and approvers who conduct access reviews and approvals. The result is not only improved remote workforce security and operational inefficiency, but reduced costs as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet, how would you know to ask providers about this capability if you don’t know it exists?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asking the right IAM and IGA questions in your RFPs has long term consequences for your organization. The right purchase decision can result in:</p>

  An empowered and efficient workforce 
	 Reduced risk and fraud 
	 Accelerated legacy modernization and digital transformation 
	 Improved regulatory compliance 
	 Reduced costs 
 <p>So, now that you are aware of AI- and ML-informed IGA here are several RFP questions you should ask providers:</p>

  Does the provider offer AI and ML capabilities to extend the governance functionality? 
	 Can the AI engine consume data from other sources?&nbsp; 
	 Is the solution flexible enough to work with other IAM solutions and data sources, or is it limited to the provider’s platform only? 
 <p>ForgeRock has a fannatical commitment to our customers’ success. We wrote the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/workforce-iam-eval-guide">Workforce IAM Evaluation Guide</a> so you can be sure you cover all your bases when evaluating and comparing identity solution providers. It includes a list of basic and strategic IAM and IGA components, definitions (written in layman’s terms for those on your team unfamiliar with identity), as well as RFP questions to help make your selection process easier and comprehensive.</p>

<p>If you’re in the process of evaluating workforce IAM and IGA providers, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/workforce-iam-eval-guide">download our guide</a> and please let us know how we can further assist.</p>

For example, if you’re creating a user account with the Okta API, you’ll need to include your API key in that request for it to succeed. Because API keys grant access to API calls which may change important data or incur significant charges. It is therefore important that the keys are not used by unauthorized users. There are a number of common mistakes that developers make that expose API keys to the outside world.</p>

<p>Today, we are going to create an API key for three different APIs. We will show, with examples, the common mistakes that developers make that expose these keys. You’ll see specific vulnerabilities and learn the best ways of avoiding these mistakes. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>PS: The code examples for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/api-key-best-practices-and-examples">GitHub</a>.</p>

 How to Obtain and Use an Okta API Token 

<p>Okta provides APIs for authenticating users and validating tokens. To use Okta APIs you need to have an Okta account. If you don’t have one already, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up for a free Okta account</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s how to create an API token in Okta: Select API &gt; Tokens. Then, hit Create Token. Give the token a name such as <code>Okta-API</code>, then hit Create Token. A dialog will be created containing the token. Copy it and store it in a safe place as you won’t be able to obtain it again. If you lose the token simply create a new one.</p>

<p>When making an API call, the token needs to be added in an Authorization HTTP request header. The token type must be <code>SSWS</code>, which is the proprietary authentication scheme used by Okta. Replace <code>00...3</code> with the actual token.</p>

   <code>Authorization: SSWS 00...3
</code>   

<p>An API call using the API token can be made using <code>curl</code>. Replace <code>${OKTA_API_KEY}</code> with the API token and replace <code>${OKTA_DOMAIN}</code> with the domain obtained from the developer console. Do not use the domain containing the string <code>-admin</code>.</p>

   <code>curl -s -H "Authorization: SSWS ${OKTA_API_KEY}" https://${OKTA_DOMAIN}/api/v1/meta/types/user
</code>   

<p>After running this command, you should see a JSON string containing one or more user details.</p>

 How to Obtain and Use an Open Weather Map API Token 

<p>OpenWeather provides an API for obtaining weather data. To use the API, you need to sign up at <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Weather API</a>. You can create a free account or pay a subscription to get access to more features. Once you have signed up and validated your email address, you will be sent an API token. You have to wait for up to a few hours for the token to be activated.</p>

<p>The API token needs to be sent with each API request. The token determines which APIs can be accessed and applies limits on the number of API calls that can be made per minute. The API can be tested by visiting this URL with your web browser, replacing <code>API_KEY</code> with your API key: <code>http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&amp;APPID=API_KEY</code></p>

<p>Notice that the request is over HTTP, not HTTPS, and the API key is a query parameter.</p>

 How to Obtain and Use a Google Maps API Token 

<p>Google Maps has an API for embedding maps and location-oriented services in web pages and mobile applications. This service is billable, but you get $200 free usage per month, which is enough for most applications.</p>

<p>First, you need a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account. There is a free trial <a href="https://cloud.google.com/gcp">Google Cloud Platform</a> which gives new customers $300 of free credit, valid for 12 months.</p>

<p>Next, you need to create a project. Log into the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com">Cloud Console</a>. From the hamburger menu in the top left select APIs &amp; Service &gt; Dashboard. Select + ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES. Next, select Aps JavaScript API. Click on ENABLE and after a short wait, you will be taken to the Google Maps Platform page.</p>

<p>From the hamburger menu in the top left select APIs &amp; Service &gt; Credentials. Next, hit CREATE CREDENTIALS &gt; API Keys. A dialog will pop up displaying the API key. Copy it and store it safely. You will see a warning: Restrict your key to prevent unauthorized use in production. This is important. Hit RESTRICT KEY.</p>

<p>Each key can be restricted to one application type. We are going to use the key for a website so, select HTTP referrers (websites). A Website restrictions section will appear. Select ADD AN ITEM. Enter your website domain in the form <code>*.example.com/*</code>. Hit DONE.</p>

<p>Next, select Restrict key. Then select Maps JavaScript API. Hit SAVE.</p>

<p>The API key must be included in every Maps JavaScript API request, replacing <code>YOUR_API_KEY</code> with the actual key.</p>

   <code>  &lt;script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&amp;callback=initMap"
  type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

 Issues with API Keys Compiled into Mobile Applications 

<p>Many Android and iOS mobile applications obtain data from API calls. This means that the API keys need to be sent with each API request. Consider the following Swift code which is part of the file <code>Weather/WeatherModelBad.swift</code>:</p>

   <code>class WeatherModel : ObservableObject {
    private let apiKey: String
    private let apiUri: String
    @Published var weatherData: WeatherData
    
    init(location: String) {
        apiKey = "a1b2c33d4e5f6g7h8i9jakblc"
        apiUri = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + location + "&amp;appid=" + apiKey
        updateWeather()
    }
}
</code>   

<p>So, what is wrong with this code? There are several things which are bad practice.</p>

<p>First of all, it is bad practice to hard code things that can change such as URLs. They should always be stored in property files.</p>

<p>Much more seriously, the API key is hardcoded (the value given in the example is not an actual key). This means that the key will get compiled into the application. So, what are the consequences of this?</p>

<p>First of all, the code will get checked into a repository such as GitHub. This means that anyone with read access to the repository is able to see and use the API key. This is even worse if the developer wants to share the code and checks it into a public repository.</p>

<p>PS: GitHub scans public repositories on commits for secrets such as API keys. If a secret is detected it will raise a security alert and the owner of the repository will receive warning emails.</p>

<p>Next, say that the developer runs into a problem and posts a question on StackOverflow. The question will often include the problem code. If that code contains an API key, then anyone who reads the question can see and use the key!</p>

<p>One solution is to put the key into a property file. An obvious, but very poor choice would be to put it into the <code>Info.plist</code> file. This is a poor choice because <code>Info.plist</code> will almost certainly get checked into a repository, which may be public.</p>

<p>A better option is to create a separate property file, in our example <code>Weather/Open-WeatheMap-Info.plist</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;API_KEY&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;a1b2c33d4e5f6g7h8i9jakblc&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, change the code to use the property file:</p>

   <code>class WeatherModel:ObservableObject {
    private let apiKey: String
    private let apiUri: String
    @Published var weatherData: WeatherData
    
    init(location: String) {
        guard let filePath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "Open-Weather-Map-Info", ofType: "plist") else {
            fatalError("Couldn't find file 'Open-Weather-Map-Info.plist'.")
        }
        let plist = NSDictionary(contentsOfFile: filePath)
        guard let key = plist?.object(forKey: "API_KEY") as? String else {
            fatalError("Couldn't find key 'API_KEY' in 'Open-Weather-Map-Info.plist'.")
        }
        apiKey = key
        apiUri = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + location + "&amp;appid=" + apiKey
        updateWeather()
    }
</code>   

<p>Finally, and most importantly, add the property file to <code>.gitignore</code> so that the property file never gets checked in:</p>

   <code>*.xcodeproj
Open-WeatheMap-Info.plist
</code>   
<p>Although this approach prevents the API key from being checked into GitHub, the key is still present in the compiled application. It can easily be extracted from the application binary. The most secure approach is to use a proxy server so that the key is not required in the application.</p>

 Issues with API Keys in JavaScript 

<p>JavaScript is code downloaded from a server and run on a client machine. There are inherent security risks to running arbitrary code which is why web browsers run JavaScript in a tightly controlled sandbox. Many websites need to obtain data by making API calls from JavaScript. This typically requires passing an API key with each request.</p>

<p>Calling an API from JavaScript means that any API key needs to be in the JavaScript code. This makes the key easily visible by viewing the page source. We have already seen that Google requires the API key to be embedded in JavaScript. We have also seen that Google strongly recommends that you restrict the API key. The restrictions mean that the key can be made public without compromising security.</p>

<p>The API key restrictions have two parts. First of all, the key is restricted by domain. Only JavaScript from one of the allowed domains can make a successful API call. Secondly, the key is restricted to specific API endpoints. Each key should only be able to call the API endpoints that are required, for example just the Google Maps API endpoint.</p>

 Issues with API keys in Other Applications 

<p>API calls can also be made from applications written in languages such as Go and Python. Again, it is an important security principle not to hard code configuration values, particularly secrets such as API keys. A good way of doing this is to pass configuration values through environment variables. These are read at run time by the application. This also means that different environment variable values can be passed to configure for development, staging, and production environments.</p>

<p>The following example shows the contents of <code>Okta.go</code>:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "net/http"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    apiKey := os.Getenv("OKTA_API_KEY")
    domain := os.Getenv("OKTA_DOMAIN")

    uri := "https://" + domain + "/api/v1/users"
    client := &amp;http.Client{}
    request, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", uri, nil)
    request.Header.Add("Authorization", "SSWS "+apiKey)
    response, err := client.Do(request)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error " + err.Error())
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    defer response.Body.Close()

    body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)

    var users []map[string]interface{}
    json.Unmarshal(body, &amp;users)

    for _, user := range users {
        profile := user["profile"].(map[string]interface{})
        fmt.Println(profile["firstName"].(string) + " " + profile["lastName"].(string))
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The Go code makes the same API request that was used to test the Okta API key. The API key and the domain are read from environment variables. The code then constructs the URI, sets the Authorization header, and makes the REST call. The response is decoded to extract the users’ names. The code can be run by first setting the environment variables to valid values:</p>

   <code>export OKTA_DOMAIN=dev-123456.okta.com
export OKTA_API_KEY=0...3
go run Okta.go
</code>   

<p>You do of course need to set the environment variables. This is often done using a script such as <code>~/.profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code>. Be careful not to check the script into a repository such as GitHub.</p>

 How to use a Proxy Server for SPAs 

<p>Another means of protecting API keys is to use a proxy server. A proxy server implements a subset of the required API. All requests are forwarded to the real API using the API key. As client applications make API calls through a proxy, they do not need to know the API key. Access to the proxy server can be restricted by requiring the client to authenticate.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to build a proxy server for the Google Maps API. The reason for this is that the API is very tightly coupled with the JavaScript embedded in the web page. Google goes to lengths to restrict the API key, so a proxy server adds an unnecessary complication.</p>

<p>We are going to build a single page application (SPA) that accesses the Open Weather API via a proxy server. The SPA consists of an HTML page and JavaScript that makes requests to a proxy server. A simple Go web server will serve this static content. The proxy server is another Go web server that extracts the API key from the environment and forwards the request to the real API.</p>

<p>First, create the web page <code>WeatherSPA/index.html</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Weather&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;
        &lt;script src="control.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1 id="name"&gt;Weather&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;div class="centred"&gt;
            &lt;img id="icon" src=""/&gt;
            &lt;p id="weathermain"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;form id="weatherForm"&gt;
                &lt;label for="location"&gt;Location&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;select id="location" name="location"&gt;
                    &lt;option value="berlin,de"&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/option&gt;
                    &lt;option value="chicago,us"&gt;Chicago, USA&lt;/option&gt;
                    &lt;option value="paris,fr"&gt;Paris, France&lt;/option&gt;
                &lt;/select&gt;
                &lt;input type="button" value="Get Weather" onclick="onlocation()"/&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The page has a form that allows a location to be selected. It also has placeholder elements where the weather data will be displayed.</p>

<p>Next, create a JavaScript file <code>WeatherSPA/control.js</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>function onlocation() {
    fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/weather", {
        method : "POST",
        mode: 'cors',
        body: new URLSearchParams(new FormData(document.getElementById("weatherForm"))),
    })
    .then((response) =&gt; {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(response.error)
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data =&gt; {
        document.getElementById('name').innerHTML = data.name;
        var weather = data.weather[0];
        document.getElementById('weathermain').innerHTML = weather.main;
        seticon(weather.icon);
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        document.getElementById('weathermain').innerHTML = error;
    });
}

function seticon(icon) {
    document.getElementById("icon").src = "http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/" + icon + "@4x.png";
}

seticon("10d");
</code>   

<p>The function <code>onlocation()</code> is called when the form is submitted. It makes a POST request to the proxy server http://localhost:8000/api/weather, passing the form data. The response JSON object is decoded and the placeholder elements are updated with the response data.</p>

<p>The web servers will be written in GO. We, first of all, need to load the dependencies:</p>

   <code>go mod init apikeys
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get github.com/gin-gonic/static
</code>   

<p>Next, we need a web server to deliver the static content. We will use a simple Go and Gin server. The Go code is in <code>WeatherServer/main.go</code>:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-contrib/static"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./WeatherSPA", false)))
    r.Run(":8080")
}
</code>   

<p>This code creates a Gin server instance and configures it to serve static content from the <code>WeatherSPA</code> directory. It then starts the server listening on port 8080.</p>

<p>Next, we create the proxy server in the file <code>WeatherProxy/main.go</code>:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "net/http"
    "os"

    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func Weather(c *gin.Context) {
    location := c.PostForm("location")
    uri := "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + location + "&amp;APPID=" + os.Getenv("OPEN_WEATHER_TOKEN")
    response, error := http.Get(uri)
    if error != nil {
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": error.Error()})
    }
    defer response.Body.Close()
    body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)
    c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
    c.String(http.StatusOK, string(body))
}

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.POST("/api/weather", Weather)
    r.Run(":8000")
}
</code>   

<p>This creates a Gin server listening on port 8000. It responds to POST requests to <code>/api/weather</code> by calling the <code>Weather()</code> function.</p>

<p>The <code>Weather()</code> function extracts the location from the form data. It then constructs the URI for the actual API call using the location and the API key which is extracted from the environment variable <code>OPEN_WEATHER_TOKEN</code>. Next, it makes a GET request to the API and extracts the JSON string from the response. Finally, it sets the CORS header to allow the client browser to allow the request and returns the JSON string in the response body.</p>

<p>We can now test the application by starting the two servers from two command prompts and point a browser at http://localhost:8080.</p>

   <code>go run WeatherProxy/main.go &amp;
go run WeatherServer/main.go
</code>   

<p>The web page should be displayed. Select a location and hit the <code>Get Weather</code> button to see the current weather at the location.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Secrets such as API keys are potentially dangerous if they get into the wrong hands. They can be used to change and delete data. They can also access expensive services which can incur large costs. Many APIs require an API key to be sent with each request. This means that client applications such as websites and mobile applications need to have access to API keys.</p>

<p>Developers are on the front line when it comes to information security. Simple mistakes, laziness, and worse time-saving hacks can have serious and potentially expensive consequences.</p>

<p>Never hard code API keys into source code. The only exception to this is JavaScript APIs, such as Google Maps, where the key is tightly restricted. It is quite common to store API keys in files. In which case ensure that the file is in the <code>.gitignore</code> file and verify that it will not be checked in on the next commit.</p>

<p>When posting questions or answers to websites such as StackOverflow, it is common to post code examples. Make very sure that the code does not contain any secrets.</p>

<p>It is important that developers always follow best practices. Always consider using environment variables, proxy servers, and secret stores when working with secrets such as API keys.</p>

Ripple’s response to the&nbsp;SEC: <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ripple-responds-to-sec-lawsuit-over-xrp-sales">Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is ignoring that the XRP cryptocurrency has utility, fintech startup Ripple alleged in its response to a securities complaint filed by the regulatory agency.</blockquote><blockquote>In a Friday filing, Ripple Labs pushed back against the SEC’s allegations, which claim the San Francisco-based firm violated U.S. securities laws for over seven years by selling $1.3 billion worth of XRP&nbsp;tokens.</blockquote><p>But wait, there’s more. Ripple also filed a Freedom of Information Act Request with the&nbsp;SEC.</p><p><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/29/ripple-bitcoin-ethereum-sec-documents/">Fortune</a>:</p><blockquote>The cryptocurrency company Ripple has taken the unusual step of filing a Freedom of Information request with the Securities and Exchange Commission, asking the agency to release documents concerning its determination that Bitcoin and Ethereum — the two most popular digital currencies — are not securities.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>In a letter, Ripple asked for any correspondence between the agency and those who helped create Ethereum, including Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin. It also asks for letters between former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, agency staff and members of Congress.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>For its part, the company says it has never claimed that owning XRP amounts to an ownership claim in Ripple, which has long tried to persuade banks and financial institutions to use its software — and XRP — as facilitate global money transfers. The company also asserts that the price of XRP is not correlated to Ripple’s business activities, and notes that other agencies, including the Justice and Treasury Departments, have characterized XRP as a currency not a security.</blockquote><blockquote>In this context, Ripple’s demands for SEC correspondence about Bitcoin and Ethereum appear to be an attempt to portray the agency’s lawsuit as arbitrary and unfair. In particular, Ripple is likely to focus on the SEC’s 2018 conclusion that Ethereum is not a security — even though the Ethereum conducted a so-called “Initial Coin Offering” that gave outside buyers an opportunity to buy into the project&nbsp;early.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1355750510200901632">Greg Kidd</a>:</p><blockquote>Forcing the [SEC] to reveal why it’s picking winners and losers rather than putting out clear guidelines and sticking to its mission. Score one for transparency.</blockquote><p>In case you missed our podcast: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-01-the-secs-crypto-turf-war-and-why-xrp-isn-t-a-security-c3180d05f2aa">EPISODE 01 — The SEC’s crypto turf war and why XRP isn’t a&nbsp;security</a></p> 2.

Yet, with notable bipartisan agreement, they think Big Tech’s power must be&nbsp;checked.</blockquote><p>Lawmakers not only agree, they’re suddenly well positioned. <a href="https://www.axios.com/georgia-results-sweep-away-techs-regulatory-logjam-ffe6ef79-f4b3-46af-b4e2-fc2a3c7a09e1.html">Axios</a>:</p><p>The big picture: Many Democrats want to hit Big Tech with new antitrust laws, updates to Section 230, privacy legislation and more.

Read of the week: Straddling the line between privacy and moderation. <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249391/signal-app-abuse-messaging-employees-violence-misinformation">The Verge</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/vs">/vs</a>):</p><blockquote>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</blockquote><blockquote>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the&nbsp;world.</blockquote><blockquote>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look&nbsp;like.”</blockquote><blockquote>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after&nbsp;all.</blockquote> 5. Facebook and Apple continue to squabble over&nbsp;privacy. <p>As Greg <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-03-should-we-trust-facebook-2fa14098a737">likes to say</a>, it’s Godzilla v. Mothra. (And in the end, Tokyo is destroyed.)</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-roll-out-privacy-measures-despite-facebook-objections-11611810002">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The clash between Apple Inc. AAPL +1.94% and Facebook Inc. FB +2.00% intensified as the chief executives of the two tech giants squared off in public remarks over privacy, the impact of algorithms and competition and offered dueling visions of the future of the internet.</blockquote><blockquote>Without naming Facebook directly, Apple CEO Tim Cook leveled a blistering condemnation of “conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms” in a speech Thursday as he discussed a new privacy tool the iPhone maker plans to roll out in the next several months. Mr. Cook also tied recent social unrest to a broader argument that app-tracking tools are turning consumers into advertising products.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg singled out Apple Wednesday as one of its most formidable competitors and accused the company of using its platform to interfere with how Facebook apps work.

<p>A 2019 study from the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/business/rbf/workingpapers/RBF19_012.pdf">University of St. Andrews School of Management</a> gave financial management apps to participants and measured how having those apps affected the participants as compared to a control group. At the end of the study, the proportion of those who were confident about loan repayments to those who weren’t was <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/business/rbf/workingpapers/RBF19_012.pdf">17.2 percent</a> higher in the test group than in the control group. With a little information and guidance, the participants became more confident about their finances—and that is key to financial inclusion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financial inclusion improves when consumers have access to and control over their personal financial data. At Finicity, our open banking platform puts consumers in control of their data, which in turn leads to better financial literacy, inclusion, and outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how access and control improve financial inclusion, giving consumers better opportunities to make and reach their financial goals.</p>
 Access through Open Banking 
<p>In the past, and even still today, consumers’ access to their financial data has largely been limited to monthly paper or PDF statements. But recent innovations have improved consumer access, allowing consumers “to access and consolidate statements electronically and to <a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20200630022703/The-Finicity-Perspective-1.pdf">better understand their financial situation</a> through personal financial management and budgeting tools.”</p>
<p>How does this increased access help consumers? With data and fintech apps and services at their fingertips, consumers become more financially literate. It’s a simple equation: knowledge plus basic skills plus financial motivation equals better financial behaviors.</p>
<p>In the same <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/business/rbf/workingpapers/RBF19_012.pdf">University of St. Andrews study</a> cited above, the authors found that using fintech apps was a gamechanger for the participants: “[The participants] expressed greater confidence in their understanding of loan repayments and demonstrated improved financial literacy…. Those receiving the smartphone apps proved more resilient when subject to a financial shock and were more likely to keep track of their income and expenditure.”</p>
<p>To help improve financial inclusion, financial institutions can give consumers access to their data through open banking connections and provide fintech apps that help consumers become more financially literate. The standard to aim for is “account ownership equals data ownership.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does this look like in practice? It looks like consumers being able to give third-parties permission to access their financial data on their behalf. It looks like the ability to see and access their data easily within their financial institution’s web portal. It looks like consumers reaping the benefits of big data on an individual and household basis.</p>
<p>Financial inclusion improves when consumers have access to their financial data in standardized, meaningful ways. That way, “individuals and families across the socioeconomic spectrum [have] access to financial tools once reserved for the wealthy. Whether it’s personal financial management tools, the ability to contribute data to credit scoring, or participating in peer-to-peer payment platforms, <a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20200630022703/The-Finicity-Perspective-1.pdf">access to personal financial data</a> changes lives.”</p>
 Control through Consumer-Permissioned Data 
<p>Once consumers have access to their data, control is the next crucial ingredient for financial inclusion. Historically, consumers haven’t had much control over how their data is used, who has access to their data, how frequently their data is accessed, or how long their data is retained. Without control, access doesn’t mean much.</p>
<p>Today, consumers have more control over their data than ever. Consumers are now able to “opt-in” their financial data, which can help streamline the loan-application process, give them access to better loan terms, and improve their generic credit scores. This level of control is possible through <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/oauth-connect/">OAuth connections </a>that provide tokenized access so consumers can permission and revoke these tokens at any time from the financial institution. Tokens also keep account details with the financial institution enhancing security and lowering risk.</p>
<p>With this relatively high level of control, what should be next to improve financial inclusion? Informed consent is a good place to start. Consumers need to have intuitive navigation experiences using language that is easy to understand. It’s not informed consent if consumers don’t understand the information!&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make informed consent possible, financial institutions should provide a standardized permissions interface. <a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20200630022703/The-Finicity-Perspective-1.pdf">Consumers should be able</a> “to easily view, modify, add, and revoke permissions across their library of financial services. When permissions are buried out of reach, consumers do not have the control they deserve. Power only exists when control can be exercised and managed.”</p>
 Access and Control in Practice 
<p>At Finicity, we aim to help financial institutions and consumers improve financial inclusion through consumer access and control. To improve consumers’ access to and control over their financial data, we’ve connected financial institutions and payroll providers via financial data APIs, enabling consumers to permission their data for use in third-party applications or solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, our <a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20200925171922/Finicity-Lend.pdf">Finicity Lend</a> solution gives consumers and lenders access to the following data:</p>
 
 Assets 
 Income 
 Employment 
 Cash flow 
 Transactions 
 Statements&nbsp; 
 Scoring attributes 
 
<p>This data can be used for everything from personal loans to small business loans. It’s real-time data that consumers can grant third parties access to in order to speed up the loan process. Its usefulness doesn’t end there, though. This data can also be used in just about any financial app, from budgeting to accounting to investments to account initiation and payments. The data is also FCRA-compliant so consumers can see the data used and dispute any inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Apps and services like these help improve financial inclusion. As the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/business/rbf/workingpapers/RBF19_012.pdf">University of St. Andrews study</a> found, people with access to this kind of information experience</p>
 
 improved “financial knowledge, understanding and basic skills,” 
 a greater likelihood to plan for the future, 
 a “greater sense of self-efficacy and a greater confidence in their ability to improve financial decision-making through engaging with technology,” and 
 “better financially capable behaviours.” 
 
<p>Financial inclusion improves when consumers have access to and control over their personal financial data. Access and control allow consumers to be full participants in their financial journeys, giving them the best chance to make and reach their financial goals.

<p>Erik van der Mars is per 1 februari gestart bij Ockto als Director International Operations. Hij gaat zich richten op het vormgeven van de Ockto dienstverlening in Europa en het opzetten van de internationale organisatie.</p>



<p>Ockto stelt consumenten in staat om veilig persoonsinformatie te delen met dienstverleners die deze informatie nodig hebben. Nederlandse klanten zien de Ockto dienstverlening ook graag in het buitenland beschikbaar komen. Hier speelt Ockto met de internationalisatieplannen op in. Dit is onder andere mogelijk met de introductie van Europese wetgeving zoals de AVG, PSD2, EIDAS en de nieuwe EU Data Governance Act.</p>



<p>Robert Harreman, CEO van Ockto: ‘We zijn al enige tijd aan het broeden op het internationaliseren van onze dienstverlening. Natuurlijk moesten we daarvoor eerst in Nederland een goede basis leggen. Nu is het voor ons het moment om de eerste stappen richting het buitenland te zetten. We zijn blij dat we Erik daarvoor hebben kunnen aantrekken.’</p>



 
 
<p>De afgelopen 15 jaar is Van der Mars actief geweest binnen de fintech sector. De laatste jaren waren zijn werkzaamheden vooral gericht op het laten groeien van platformen in de e-Invoicing en Payments markten.</p>



<p>Van der Mars:&nbsp;‘Ik kijk er naar uit om de innovatieve dienstverlening van Ockto te introduceren in landen als Duitsland en Frankrijk; zowel voor de consument als de financiële dienstverlener digitaliseren en vereenvoudigen we met het Ockto platform de gegevensuitwisseling voor diverse financiële processen. Denk hierbij aan het afsluiten van een hypotheek, of het verbeteren van KYC-processen. Niet alleen Nederlandse consumenten en dienstverleners zijn hier blij mee, ook in de landen om ons heen willen ze af van het zoeken in schoenendozen en rondschuiven van papier.’</p>

<p>Is Compliance the Next Wave for&nbsp;DeFi?</p><p>If 2020 was the year that crypto reached a turning point in mass adoption, 2021 will be the year of compliant decentralized financial products. Last year, we saw crypto develop financial products into what we call decentralized finance; yield farming, staking, and other financial mechanisms showed that cryptocurrencies can be used for more than holding or as means of payment. 2020 will be remembered for more than stronger mass adoption, it was also the year that international regulatory bodies and local regulators took a much more aggressive stance, especially in the field of anti-money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a stack of applications running on blockchain technology with the aim of creating multiple types of financial services and products. These applications have been promoted as a means of empowering users and developers to create unique peer-to-peer experiences which normally, would seldom happen in the traditional finance sector due to stringent regulations.</p><p>DeFi apps have brought an improvement on FinTech by introducing the concept of staking. Therefore, the DeFi ecosystem allows users to take out a loan on one platform, leverage a trade on another platform, and exchange it back to the base asset through a decentralized, blockchain-enabled exchange. Through this aspect of staking, DeFi has a wide range of use-cases, hence outperforming traditional financial services.</p><p>Although DeFi has enjoyed huge success since its inception, the industry is facing some risks and challenges which might affect users and its adoption by mainstream organizations. For instance, data collection methods in DeFi are still being developed and there have been many hacking instances. Also, there is a shortage of regulatory compliance experts offering support in order to solve regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Regulatory scrutiny in this industry is crucial in order to inject trust and attract more mainstream organizations and investment from high net worth individuals. Regulatory oversight ensures the availability of information that links users and transactions on these applications, which can be retrieved when the need&nbsp;arises</p><p>For more on the FATF’s Travel Rule: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/what-does-the-fatf-travel-rule-mean-for-crypto-users-9db7fb8bf68e">What does the FATF Travel Rule mean for Crypto Users? | by Shyft Network |&nbsp;Medium</a></p> What is compliant DeFi <p>Compliance in the DeFi sector means that the participants adhere to the same rules as traditional financial services. The laws that are set out for capital markets and the entire financial sector differ across states and governments, but they are classified into Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti Money Laundering (AML), and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p>The selling point in DeFi is its association with blockchain technology which advocates for decentralization. Therefore, DeFi activities are also permissionless which is different from the traditional system that requires potential users to traverse a myriad of regulatory verification systems before being able to participate in the global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>DeFi projects have had issues with compliance, as they allow users to join and leave at their leisure. They are also censorship-resistant, further complicating the possibility of compliance.</p><p>The need for compliance in the DeFi space means that the applications should adhere to KYC, AML, and CFT guidelines, which can influence users and allow for collaboration with traditional financial organizations. Additionally, compliance to traditional financial regulatory guidelines can lead to mass adoption and serve a greater number of&nbsp;people.</p><p>The nature of DeFi applications obstruct any steps towards compliance, hence the need for bodies such as the Shyft Network that provide greater&nbsp;support.</p> Potential Solutions <p>DeFi’s challenge is not unprecedented, traditional finance met these not too long ago; since financial operations, including payments and settlements, retail investment, etc., regulators have been trying to curb illegal operations, i.e., money laundering. Some of these solutions require creative engineering so they can fit decentralized models without exposing users’ personal information.</p><p>Our Co-Founder, Juan Aja, explained potential solutions to the DeFi regulatory challenge in an op-ed piece on Cointelegraph, (read: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/it-s-time-to-mature-we-need-compliant-decentralized-finance">It’s time to mature: We need compliant decentralized finance (cointelegraph.com)</a>). Among those solutions, the following stand out because of their ease of implementation, and their feasibility in terms of adapting existing structures to a decentralized regulatory compliant framework, like the Shyft&nbsp;Network:</p>  Whitelisted addresses. A list of items/IP addresses that once they receive an initial validation are granted access to a certain system or protocol. In the case of DeFi, we could have one or two trusted anchors that could validate an address and conduct Know Your Customer diligence on the user. Once the user has been validated, all other projects within the same trust channel — i.e., a group of virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, that have agreed to follow the same set of rules and to collaborate within a well-delineated platform — can give that user access to products and services without having to redo the entire KYC process. <br>The advantage here is twofold: The user only shows private documents to one or two entities, thus reducing the surface area of attack for any potential data hacks, and the VASPs can have access to a larger user pool without having to increase compliance costs. A system like this could also enable individuals and entities who are excluded from traditional banking, savings and trading ecosystems due to geopolitical reasons to invest in yield-bearing products, alternatives to lending and high-interest accounts. DeFi is an alternative for these citizens and business owners to save, earn and transact.  AML- and GDPR-compliant systems. Institutional capital markets are strictly regulated and supervised by local and international regulatory bodies; the goal is to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist operations. With an attestation framework, projects can verify and comply with existing AML regulatory requirements and attract institutional capital while protecting users’ privacy by not requiring them to create copies of their personally identifiable information.  Audited codebases and third-party certifications. There are plenty of blockchain projects out there that are not built under minimum acceptable standards, and it’s difficult for every user to go through the codebase and verify that the code is doing what it is meant to do. By having third-party validators go through the code — attesting to its integrity, functionality and reliability — the bar would be raised, making these projects more competitive and safer for investors.  <p>The Shyft Network Solution to Compliant DeFi: Shyft Network’s solution does not entail any fundamental changes to the DeFi sector but rather will augment the industry making it more secure and efficient with minimal&nbsp;risk.</p>  Veriscope GDPR/AML Compliant Discovery Mechanism. A key focus for Shyft Network has been the creation of Veriscope, an identity and data exchange network that helps VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) like crypto exchanges, adequately comply with the FATF Travel Rule for virtual assets and service providers. Veriscope is a decentralized solution that will enable VASPs and other projects sanctioned by regulatory authorities, the opportunity to comply with regulations while protecting user data and continuing to remain decentralized.  Whitelisted Addresses and Proof of Identity. Shyft Network enables both decentralised and centralised entities to continue operating seamlessly meaning they will be lending, staking, and providing liquidity without fear of falling victim to bad actors. DeFi participants will be required to provide proof of their identity that will be used to whitelist their addresses. Whitelisted addresses will be able to interact with both the decentralised finance providers and mainstream institutions freely as they bear a higher level of&nbsp;trust.  Risk Assessment Mechanism for all DeFi Projects. Shyft Network will also continually monitor all wallet addresses interacting with DeFi smart contracts and regularly query them for risk assessment purposes. The result of these queries will be used to generate reports and score addresses on a set risk evaluation scale to establish the trust levels of various participants. The Shyft Network will make this information readily available for DeFi platforms interested in making assessment of various participants. Most importantly, addresses found to be in violation of the set guidelines will be blacklisted to protect others from potential nefarious actors.

 Primo ad essere attivato in Italia, il servizio diminuisce drasticamente i tempi di permanenza degli utenti nei centri vaccinali, azzera i rischi di errore procedurale e riduce i costi di gestione. 



 



<p>Roma, 2 febbraio 2021 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione a livello europeo, ha avviato con successo una collaborazione con la ASL Roma 1, una delle più grandi aziende sanitarie italiane, per digitalizzare la procedura di raccolta del consenso informato di tutti coloro che, nell’ambito territoriale coperto dall’azienda sanitaria, hanno aderito e aderiranno alla campagna vaccinale anti Covid-19.</p>



<p>La ASL Roma 1 è la prima azienda sanitaria italiana ad aver attivato questo servizio, partito lo scorso 28 dicembre presso l’Hub vaccinale del Santa Maria della Pietà – in concomitanza con l’avvio ufficiale della campagna vaccinale in Italia – e disponibile anche presso gli altri centri vaccinali gestiti dalla ASL: l’Ospedale Santo Spirito, l’Ospedale San Filippo Neri e la Casa della Salute Prati-Trionfale.</p>



<p><a>La raccolta del consenso informato dei vaccinandi è obbligatoria e richiede necessariamente che essi lo sottoscrivano con firma autografa. Grazie alla ProxySign Interactive Trust Platform di InfoCert, l’intero processo è stato digitalizzato attraverso una procedura semplice e pienamente conforme alle normative: dopo il riconoscimento del vaccinando attraverso la sua tessera sanitaria, il personale dell’ASL procede ad effettuarne l’anamnesi e ad inserire tutti i dati al terminale. A seguire, il titolare dei dati – cioè il vaccinando – appone sul tablet dell’operatore due firme grafometriche (Firme Elettroniche Avanzate – FEA), che vengono immediatamente recepite e verificate dal sistema: tutto in pochissimi minuti e senza nessun passaggio cartaceo.</a></p>



<p>In tal modo viene reso più rapido, sicuro ed efficiente il processo operativo, diminuendo i tempi di permanenza degli utenti all’interno del centro vaccinale, azzerando i rischi di errore procedurale e riducendo significativamente i costi di gestione a carico dell’ASL.</p>



<p>“In un momento così difficile come quello che stiamo vivendo, ci rende davvero orgogliosi essere riusciti a contribuire concretamente e in tempi estremamente rapidi alla semplificazione dell’operatività di una campagna vaccinale di portata storica”, dichiara Danilo Cattaneo, Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert, Tinexta Group. “In questa collaborazione con la ASL Roma 1, a beneficio dei cittadini della Capitale, abbiamo messo a frutto l’esperienza già maturata in tutti quegli ambiti nei quali il rispetto delle rigorose normative di settore è un fattore chiave”.</p>



<p>La soluzione di InfoCert consente di gestire qualsiasi tipologia di documento PDF che necessiti di raccogliere informazioni in modalità interattiva, ha tempi di implementazione rapidissimi, garantisce piena compliance normativa ed è già predisposta per la conservazione digitale dei dati sensibili, come previsto dalla legge.</p>



<p>“La campagna vaccinale anti Covid è la più grande iniziativa di sanità pubblica mai realizzata nel nostro Servizio Sanitario e soltanto nel nostro territorio coinvolgerà un milione di persone. Occorre quindi un’organizzazione molto efficiente e al tempo stessa sicura – commenta Angelo Tanese, Direttore Generale della ASL Roma 1 – Questa collaborazione con InfoCert consente di fornire un servizio migliore ai cittadini ed è anche il segno tangibile della possibilità di generare innovazione attraverso una partnership virtuosa tra pubblico e privato.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

These interactions might include registering for a service, submitting an application or opening an account.

 <p>2020 is behind us and yet still so present in our daily lives at the beginning of 2021.</p>
<p>This will undoubtedly be the year of rebuilding our economies, of accepting remote work and distance learning with increasingly data-intensive digital tools, and also the year that will perhaps finally usher in this collective awareness of the challenges of digital security and sovereignty. The companies we work with on a daily basis are clearly demanding better control over their customers' data, so that it can be used for more purposes. Europe's political decision-makers are getting restless with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-european-data-governance-data-governance-act">recent publication of the Data Governance Act</a>, which finally foreshadows the end of the era where the citizen is the product.</p>
 A look back at our 2020 highlights 
<p>We have taken incredible steps this year with your support:</p>
 
 Two new applications have been integrated in your Cozy to offer you more uses and control: <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Pass</a>, a French and open source password manager and <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Notes</a>, a collaborative text editor 
 Nearly 70,000 data-conscious individuals have already adopted a personal cloud 
 A partnership that we are really proud of was created with CEMEA and the support of Secours Populaire Français, the Afnic Foundation, the Samu Social de Paris and Framasoft to fight against digital exclusion 
 A partnership with <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/en/gandi-a-new-hosting-provider-for-your-cozy/">Gandi</a> allows their customers to create a Cozy space on their own domain. You will stay because you can leave. 
 Cozy Cloud has been rewarded by the <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/en/award-cozy-cloud-as-a-mydata-operator/">NGO MyData as MyDataOperator</a> 
 Cozy was chosen as the data platform for its energy savings service offered at the Data Challenge thanks to Métropole Grand Lyon 
 Cozy Cloud is not the only alternative to offer personal data store as Sir Tim Berners Lee has published a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/08/tim-berners-lees-startup-inrupt-releases-solid-privacy-platform-for-enterprises/?guccounter=1">new version of Solid, personal data store for businesses</a> 
 The European Commission published Data Governance guidelines that provide for a regulated trusted third party status 
 Our projects in the education field will continue in 2021 with even more features to accompany <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/fr/education-cloud-personnel/">distance learning for students and teachers of the Academy of Rennes</a>. 
 
<p>All these events contribute to the achievement of our mission: democratizing the digital home.</p>
 Our last developments 
 
 A password management application <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a> 
 A text editor Cozy Notes 
 New banks and the possibility to create recurring operations in <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#bank">Cozy Banks</a> 
 Connectors developed by our community 
 Constant improvements and optimizations for the synchronization application with your computer. 
 A simpler and more intuitive design in Cozy Drive to encourage content sharing and the remote work 
 
<p>We continue to believe that it is possible to manage your personal data with a single tool. This is why we are constantly working to make our solution more complete and simple to use.</p>
 What we are planning for yoU 
<p>As there's a first time for everything. Here is our roadmap for the first months of 2021:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moving your Cozy<br>
From now on, you can move your Cozy to another provider at any time without losing data.<br>
Moving your Cozy is more than a data export, you can take it with you in one click :</p>
 
 all your data (so you don't forget anything) 
 your applications and configurations (so you don't have to reconfigure anything) 
 your shares and contacts (so you don't lose your network) 
 more than data portability, service portability! (everything without exception) 
 
<p>Drive: Certified document management<br>
Today, your Cozy allows you to retrieve your documents such as invoices and contracts from the client area of your online site. We go further by offering you to certify all the documents coming from the official website. A guarantee of security and conformity for all your administrative procedures!</p>
<p>Notes : An editor enriched with images and other collaborative features*.<br>
At the beginning of 2020, we launched a Cozy Notes text editor that was acclaimed by our users but remained in its beta version. We decided to add value to it by adding collaborative features.</p>
<p>Desktop: Selective Synchronization<br>
You have been waiting for it... for a long time and it finally arrives! Soon, you will be able to choose which folders in your Cozy will be synchronized with your computer.</p>
<p>Mobile: Augmented pdf viewer<br>
The idea is to give you a new experience when you open a pdf from your web or mobile application.</p>
<p>Security: Access protection by pin code, touch ID and face ID.</p>
<p>Office suite: Integration Only Office<br>
Do you have an office suite?, I can't leave Google Drive if you don't have an office suite, I can't leave Google Drive if you don't have an office suite, I can't leave Google Drive if you don't have an office suite... Good news: you will finally leave Google (for real) thanks to the integration of the <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/fr/">Only Office suite</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, we have big plans for you in 2021. Some of them will be tested in the next few days, so get ready to discover them.</p>
 To conclude...but it is just the beginning 
<p>We wish you all a wonderful year. Thank you for your time during this crazy year, your support, your encouragement and your enthusiasm for the announcement of the new applications. Enjoy every moment.<br>
From far away on our cozy cloud.</p>
<p>The Cozy Cloud team.</p>

   Identity and Access Management Improves Digital Experiences 

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is the United Kingdom’s largest government department. The organization is implementing an identity-based digital transformation in order to reduce fraud, keep costs down and help citizens more easily and securely access benefits. I had the pleasure of speaking with James Randall, the Lead Identity and Trust Architect for DWP, who gave us a peek into the department’s strategy and execution.</p>

<p>Q. DWP is the UK’s largest public service department and largest distributor of benefits. Who are you serving and at what scale?</p>

<p>We are responsible for welfare, pensions and child maintenance policies for more than 20 million customers. Through our welfare systems such as Universal Credit, we encourage people to be financially independent by providing assistance and guidance to help them back into employment. We also administer the UK state pension service as well as a range of other benefits including child maintenance and support for people with ill-health.</p>

<p>Q. Tell me about your role within the organization.</p>

<p>My role is to design and execute our digitization strategy. I work within the DWP Digital Group - a team of people who manage the DWP’s digital estate and all the electronic services. Specifically, I’m the lead architect for identity trust and my focus is on identity verification and identity-based access. We are using technology to combat fraud while fostering accessibility and ease-of-use for our citizens. The citizen is the focus of our work: We are tasked with providing a personalized experience while also protecting citizens’ privacy. We also want to keep costs low, driving value for money in order to protect the public purse.</p>

<p>Q. What role does identity play in your digitization strategy?</p>

<p>Identity is at the center of our strategy. It is imperative that we allow citizens easy access to the information we hold while protecting their privacy. We need to determine that people are who they say they are on multiple channels including face-to-face, chat, phone, web, etc. Once identified, we need to authenticate users quickly and easily in order for them to securely interact with the services we provide.</p>

<p>But identity can be tricky, particularly in the UK. In Estonia, for example, they have a national identity card which citizens can use to establish their identity across government, health and banking sectors easily and it works really well; their citizens can move smoothly through government systems without having to constantly reaffirm their identity. In the UK this is not the case. As a society we have a different view on the use of government-issued ID cards and that’s OK, it just means that the identity challenge is more complex in countries like the UK; of course, that’s also what makes it so interesting!</p>

<p>We have tried to solve this problem before, of course, with GOV.UK Verify -- a bold attempt to establish a government identity approach that would facilitate better citizen interaction with government systems. We learned a great deal from Verify and it was heavily used by the DWP, specifically on our Universal Credit service. But it was not perfect and we found that it was often very hard for some of our more vulnerable citizens to use. That’s why we are now building our own service, which is known as the Dynamic Trust Hub. We are taking loads of learning from Verify and we are working across government to ensure our internal approach can complement, reuse and support other departments wherever possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q. What more can you tell us about the Dynamic Trust Hub?&nbsp;</p>

<p>We created the Dynamic Trust Hub, which is based on the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>, with help from Accenture and we have deployed it into AWS. The Dynamic Trust Hub will allow individuals access to the department’s numerous digital services, reusing a single identity that they should only have to prove once. The ‘dynamic’ nature of the Trust Hub relates to the way it will manage the citizen journey based on what they are trying to do, reducing complexity where possible but ensuring, when necessary, effective identity and security controls are put into place to protect citizens’ data. The Dynamic Trust Hub implements a policy-based approach so it can support federated credentials and mandate multi-factor authentication and govern access to citizen data held across different benefit lines. It will do so in a way that will provide for a joined up and, hopefully, a more pleasant experience for all our citizens.</p>

<p>Q. Many agencies globally are facing threats of fraud. Is that an issue at DWP?</p>

<p>Reducing fraud and error is a massive consideration for DWP so we’re always looking for ways to reduce that. With the Dynamic Trust Hub, we are implementing solutions to combat identity fraud and inappropriate access. The department already operates a sophisticated fraud service and the Dynamic Trust Hub will allow us to incorporate that intelligence into every customer transaction. We’re running risk solutions that identify patterns and risk engines that flag issues to agents and systems before they become truly problematic.</p>

<p>Q. Does combating fraud conflict with usability for consumers?</p>

<p>It can be difficult to install safety protocols that don’t hinder the user experience. The Dynamic Trust Hub will support the development of risk profiles based on an individual’s behaviour. With ForgeRock, we can put speed bumps into place that alert agents and systems to potential fraud. But we can also remove those speed bumps for a citizen who exhibits less risky behavior for a smoother experience. ForgeRock helps to make it easy to deliver a personalized customer journey. We can say, “Yes, we know that person and that person is safe.”</p>

<p>Q. Tell us about your identity journey.</p>

<p>We have a significant number of legacy systems as well as an increasing number of modern solutions supporting specific benefits, but we knew we needed to update our capabilities that center on identity. But identity thinking at the complex level required by the department was relatively new to us; We took about six months to investigate and fully understand our needs and the technology that could assist us. From there, we identified the capabilities and outlined our specific needs. We decided we needed Identity and Access Management to create a real-world identity store and a transaction risk management solution that builds up a citizen’s credibility over time.</p>

<p>We then sent a Market Analysis paper to various identity vendors, we narrowed the candidates down to six and then eventually to two with whom we tested and built fully operational prototypes. We found that ForgeRock had the most comprehensive capabilities like delegated access, user access and risk execution. We also like the modular nature of ForgeRock’s products. I have confidence that ForgeRock is future-proofing our architecture, bringing good things to bear down the road.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q. How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect DWP? Did you believe you were prepared?</p>

<p>I am not sure anyone can truthfully say they were prepared for the pandemic and obviously it has had a profound impact on DWP not only as a large, complex organization but, more importantly, on our operations teams with a substantial increase in demand for the national services we provide. Speaking from the perspective of our team in Identity and Trust, I think we handled the situation extremely well. We not only moved overnight to a 100% home working environment but also managed to accelerate some of our inflight activity to support the significant increased demand on our wider operations, without which some of our major benefit lines would not have been able to support citizens as well as they have through this crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q. Any future plans you can share?</p>

<p>Just that we have very ambitious plans to continue to roll out new services that allow people to more quickly and easily get the help they need.&nbsp;</p>

 Setting up a dynamic raft based Quorum network for development and testing using&nbsp;Helm.  Motivation <p>Following <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/build-a-minimal-quorum-network-90c59ec22226">this</a> informative article provided by my colleague <a href="https://medium.com/@turfa">Majd</a>, in which you can learn the basics about Quorum and how to set up a minimal Quorum network using docker containers, we decided to take things a bit further and use our knowledge to provide a dynamic Quorum setup deployable to Kubernetes. In our <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/quorum-raft-helm-template">GitHub repository</a>, we provide a Helm chart and some scripts which aim to make developing and testing on Quorum a lot faster and easier. This article will provide some insights regarding the setup and the functionalities of the&nbsp;project.</p> Tooling &amp; Prerequisites <p>For our setup, we need a running Kubernetes cluster and Helm. Helm enables us to deploy a preconfigured network to a running cluster using the concept of charts. This, in combination with some scripts, gives us the ability to dynamically add and remove nodes to and from the&nbsp;network.</p> Minikube (Kubernetes) <p><a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">Minikube</a> is one of the multiple tools which you can use to spin up a Kubernetes cluster locally. Other viable options are <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> or <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/">kind</a>. Those tools are widely used to develop and test applications on local infrastructure, before deploying them to the target infrastructure.</p> Helm <p><a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/kubernetes-helm-charts/">Here</a> is a pretty good explanation of what Helm does and how it is connected with Kubernetes:</p><blockquote>In simple terms, Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm is the K8s equivalent of yum or apt. Helm deploys charts, which you can think of as a packaged application. It is a collection of all your versioned, pre-configured application resources which can be deployed as one unit. You can then deploy another version of the chart with a different set of configuration.</blockquote> Dynamic Nodes <p>Now that we know the technical requirements we can take a closer look at the actual <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/quorum-raft-helm-template">repository</a>. The intention for this setup was to use Quorum on Kubernetes. As we did not find any solutions for this besides <a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys/qubernetes">Qubernetes</a> — the officially supported way to deploy Quorum to Kubernetes — we decided to create our own deployments using Helm. This in particular has the benefit of being more flexible than the officially supported way where Kubernetes deployments get generated once and have to be regenerated and redeployed everytime you need another setup. Using our dynamic approach you will be able to keep the network running while adding or removing&nbsp;nodes.</p> Quorum Configuration <p>The following code shows the values.yaml file in which most of the action will take place. Those values are used to dynamically fill a set of templates which you can then reuse for the number of nodes you want in your network. The setup also allows you to modify some additional configurations regarding the deployment such as input parameters for Quorum and&nbsp;Geth.</p><p>The values file additionally takes input for the nodes which are going to be deployed to the cluster. Some of those values are needed for adding a node to a raft based Quorum cluster and others give some additional functionality like enabling or disabling endpoints.</p><p>Under endpoints, RPC, as well as WebSocket endpoints, can be turned on and off. This in particular is used for communication inside the cluster. Additionally — if needed — you can enable the ingress controller to easily access nodes from outside the cluster. If you have Ingress enabled you can access the nodes at http://&lt;cluster-ip&gt;/quorum-node&lt;n&gt;-rpc or http://&lt;cluster-ip&gt;/quorum-node&lt;n&gt;-ws. Nodekey and enode represent the key material for a raft node, they can be generated using the bootnode command provided by Geth. The key value is a Geth Keystore file which holds the account credentials for a Geth account. Only with the combination of bootnode credential and Geth account, the node will be able to function properly. Note that example credentials as provided in the repository should never be reused in any production environment.</p> Reusing Templates <p>The above values will then be used to fill in the provided templates. Those templates usually take values for exactly one node/deployment.</p>templates needed to deploy a single&nbsp;node<p>By looping through the nodes object of the values file at the top of each template, we can reuse these for every new node added to the values file. Here's an example for a PersistentVolumeClaim:</p> Deploying and Updating the&nbsp;Chart <p>Now, let's start with deploying the network to a running Kubernetes infrastructure.</p><p>Upgrades, after changing the configuration of your network can be installed by&nbsp;using:</p> Adding New&nbsp;Nodes <p>Besides adding and removing nodes by modifying the values file manually, we also implemented a more convenient way to do this. For this, we provide multiple scripts that allow us to add and remove specific as well as multiple&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>In the following, I will use the addNodes.sh script to dynamically add new nodes to a running&nbsp;cluster.</p><p>The addNodes.sh script now allows me to decide how many nodes I want to add to the cluster. I choose to add 2 additional nodes and the script automatically generates the corresponding credentials, adds them to the values file, and upgrades the deployed Helm&nbsp;chart.</p><p>Note the additionally generated value raftId. This value is required for every additional node as it enables the flag “ — raftjoinexisting &lt;raftId&gt;” which is needed to properly add a new node to the initial 3 nodes&nbsp;cluster.</p><p>After updating the chart you can see that the new nodes have been added to the cluster. To confirm that the cluster is running and is properly synchronized you can run the following command, which will open a shell to Geth running inside the container. You can then use this open shell to inspect the state of raft (see below) or execute different geth commands. If the resulting nodeActive value is true, the node is properly synced with the cluster and ready to&nbsp;go.</p> Conclusion <p>All in all this project should help people to improve testing and development of Quorum networks running on Kubernetes infrastructure. Besides that, it is also a simple and convenient way to gather some experience using Quorum and experiment with various settings, especially if you have problems figuring out the right configuration for your cause. So if you want to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/quorum-raft-helm-template">repository</a> feel free to do so.

  <p>GitHub reconnaissance is a tactic that attackers use to gather information about their targets. Attackers analyze organizations’ GitHub repositories and check for sensitive data that has been accidentally committed or information that could lead to the discovery of a vulnerability.
For this tutorial, let’s build a scanner that automates the GitHub recon process! We will be scanning your GitHub repositories using the method mentioned in the “Tightening Up Your GitHub Security” post.</p>

<p>You will be working with Python, the GitHub REST API, and the GitPython Library. You will need to obtain a <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">GitHub personal access token</a> and <a href="https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#installing-gitpython">install GitPython</a>. 
Make sure that your GitHub personal access token has these permissions: <code>public_repo</code>, <code>read:org</code>, <code>read:packages</code>, <code>read:user</code>, <code>repo:status</code>
Before you dive into the code, here are the imports you need:</p>

   <code>import requests, tempfile, shutil, re

from git import Repo
from git import NULL_TREE
</code>   

 Finding Repositories 
<p>First, you will crawl through your organization’s account to find repositories to analyze. You need the GitHub API for this. The GitHub API endpoint is located at <code>https://api.github.com</code>.</p>

<p>You can set the “Accept” header to “application/vnd.github.v3+json” to specify that you are using the REST API v3. And you can provide the access token through an “Authorization” header.</p>

   <code>GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN = "{Insert your token here!}"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "token {}".format(GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN),
    "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
}
api_host = "https://api.github.com"

orgs = ["okta"]  # list organizations to analyze
users = ["vickie"]  # list users to analyze
</code>   

<p>List the organization and individual usernames that you want to analyze. Include the usernames of your organization as well as the usernames of your organization’s employees. Then, you’ll start by looking for additional usernames associated with your organization by querying the GitHub API for organization members.</p>

   <code>def requests_page(path):
    resp = requests.Response()
    try:
        resp = requests.get(url=path, headers=headers, timeout=15)
    except:
        pass
    return resp.json()


def find_members():
    """Find usernames associated with the organizations."""
    resp = []
    for org in orgs:
        path = "{}/orgs/{}/members".format(api_host, org)
        resp = requests_page(path)
    for user in resp:
        users.append(user["login"])
</code>   

<p>Optionally, you can look for contributors to your organization’s projects. You can also update your <code>users</code> and <code>orgs</code> list manually as you go.</p>

   <code>def find_contributors(org, repo):
    """Find the contributors of found repos and add to users list."""
    path = "{}/repos/{}/{}/collaborators".format(api_host, org, repo)
    resp = requests_page(path)
    for user in resp:
        users.append(user["login"])
</code>   

<p>Next, you scan the usernames for repositories and clone the repo into a temporary directory for analysis. You might have to figure out some permission issues with the GitHub API during this step. Make sure that your access tokens have the proper permissions!</p>

   <code>def find_repos():
    """Find repositories owned by the organization and users."""
    usernames = orgs + users
    usernames = set(usernames)  # dedupe the usernames
    for username in usernames:
        path = "{}/users/{}/repos".format(api_host, username)
        resp = requests_page(path)
    for repo in resp:
        if repo["fork"] == False:
            scan_repo(repo["git_url"])


def clone_repo(repo_url):
    """Create a temporary directory to hold the repo that we are analyzing."""
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    Repo.clone_from(repo_url, temp_dir)
    return temp_dir
</code>   

 Building a Wordlist 

<p>You can also build a list of keywords that might indicate vulnerabilities or an information leak. Add search terms based on your needs. You can incorporate regex patterns as well to scan for access tokens or keys with a known format.</p>

   <code>search_terms = {
    "hardcoded secrets": [
        "key",
        "secret",
        "password",
        "encrypt",
        "API",
        "CSRF",
        "random",
        "hash",
        "MD5",
        "SHA-1",
        "SHA-2",
        "HMAC",
        "api_key",
        "secret_key",
        "was_key",
        "FTP",
        "login",
        "GitHub_token",
        "-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----",
    ],
    "sensitive functionalities": [
        "auth",
        "authentication",
        "password",
        "pass",
        "login",
        "input",
        "file_input",
        "get",
        "user_input",
        "URL",
        "parameter",
        "read",
    ],
    "dangerous functionalities": [
        "import",
        "resources",
        "dependencies",
        "input()",
        "eval()",
    ],
    "development side effects": [
        "todo",
        "deprecated",
        "vulnerable",
        "vulnerability",
        "fix",
        "completed",
        "config",
        "setup",
        "dev",
        "removed",
        "HTTP",
        "HTTPS",
        "FTP",
    ],
    "weak crypto": ["ECB", "MD4", "MD5"],
}
</code>   

 Scanning Repositories 

<p>Now, let’s start scanning your repositories for keywords! You can use the GitPython library to iterate through the commits of each repository and scan for the strings in your dictionary. Finally, it displays the filenames and commit numbers that might be leaking information.</p>

   <code>class colors:
    FILENAME = "\033[1m"
    NORMAL = "\033[0m"
    WARNING = "\033[93m"


def find_strings(diff):
    print("{}{}{}".format(colors.FILENAME, diff.b_path, colors.NORMAL))
    blob_text = diff.diff.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")
    for category in search_terms:
        for term in search_terms[category]:
            if re.search(term, blob_text, re.IGNORECASE):
                print(
                    "Found term {}{}{} in this file. You should check if there are {}{}{} exposed.".format(
                        colors.WARNING,
                        term,
                        colors.NORMAL,
                        colors.WARNING,
                        category,
                        colors.NORMAL,
                    )
                )


def scan_repo(repo_url):
    temp_dir = clone_repo(repo_url)
    repo = Repo(temp_dir)
    branches = repo.remotes.origin.fetch()
    prev_commit = NULL_TREE
    # Searching commits for keywords
    for branch in branches:
        branch_name = branch.name
        for commit in repo.iter_commits(branch_name, max_count=100):
            print("=" * 25)
            print(
                "{}Searching commit {}.{}".format(
                    colors.FILENAME, commit.hexsha, colors.NORMAL
                )
            )
    diffs = commit.diff(prev_commit, create_patch=True)
    for diff in diffs:
        find_strings(diff)
        prev_commit = commit
    # remember to remove the tempfile
    shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_members()
    find_repos()
</code>   

 Eliminating GitHub Security Holes 

<p>In this post, you built a simple GitHub scanner that finds secrets accidentally committed to your organization’s repositories. If this is something that interests you, here are some related project ideas.
You can build a more powerful scanner! For example, you can build a tool that scans for the “Issues” section of GitHub to find vulnerabilities faster, or to find vulnerabilities that are not indicated by keywords. You can also build a larger and more diverse wordlist with regex patterns— what regex pattern would indicate credentials in a URL? Additionally, you can improve on the reporting of the current tool: give yourself the ability to filter by vulnerability type, or highlight the tokens and token types found in the commits.</p>

<p>After you’ve identified your GitHub weaknesses, here are a few steps that you can take to tighten up your GitHub security. First, every piece of sensitive data exposed through a public GitHub repository should be considered leaked. Therefore, you should rotate every credential found in your repositories. Next, fix or patch vulnerabilities that you have found via code analysis of these files. Again, these weaknesses should be considered public information and you should remediate them ASAP. Finally, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository">remove any additional sensitive information</a> from the repositories and commit histories!</p>

<p>Today’s consumers expect more than just empty brand promises — they want <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessibaker/2021/01/27/why-impact-proof-will-eat-brand-purpose-for-breakfast-in-2021/?sh=137995294c0f">proof</a> and your credibility as a company depends on it! Consumers are demanding better, but unfortunately we still see companies perpetuating bad practices and finding themselves in sticky situations. From human rights violations, like forced labour in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/23/thai-seafood-industry-report-trafficking-rights-abuses">Thai seafood industry</a>, to environmental destruction from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/magazine/palm-oil-borneo-climate-catastrophe.html">palm oil deforestation</a>, it is clear that we still have a long way to go. However, for companies that uphold their values through positive practices, we believe that supply chain transparency is the key to&nbsp;success.</p><p>Protect Your Reputation</p><p>The first, and most obvious, reason to adopt supply chain transparency is to lower reputational risk. If you aren’t involved in anything unseemly, then there shouldn’t be anything to hide. While there are some costs involved with adopting supply chain transparency, the long-term gains of avoiding a scandal are well worth&nbsp;it.</p><p>A <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/08/what-supply-chain-transparency-really-means">study</a> from MIT Sloan School of Management found that consumers are willing to pay 2% to 10% more for products that provide transparency. Being forthcoming in your practices will build consumer trust and respectability. <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/footprint-chronicles-fall-2010-update/story-19223.html">Patagonia</a> is a great example of a company that has strengthened customer trust by putting their values into practice.</p><p>Create a&nbsp;USP</p><p>Transparency keeps existing customers happy and creates a unique selling proposition that helps attract more conscious consumers. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyTLvzRu6fs&amp;feature=emb_logo">ad</a> from Standard Chartered shows how they are using transparency to create some really cool marketing material.</p><p>Improve Efficiency</p><p>You may be experiencing some hesitancy, but using blockchain technology to track your supply chain will ultimately streamline your processes. Documents are no longer lost along the way and business processes become easier for all actors involved — especially during audits or product&nbsp;recalls.</p><p>Comply with Regulations</p><p>Lastly, transparency is an essential tool to help you comply with regulations. After so many environmental and human rights violations, governments have put regulations (like the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp">Dodd-Frank Act</a>, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/conflict-minerals-regulation/regulation-explained/">EU Conflict Minerals Regulation</a>, and more) in place to hold companies accountable. Being proactive about supply chain transparency and traceability will help you to easily comply with current regulations and prepare for future developments.</p><p>We believe that transparency is a competitive advantage, and we have the technology to help you get there. Our MIMOSI Connect platform uses blockchain technology to help you gain visibility across your entire supply chain. MIMOSI Connect is customizable to fit your needs and can easily integrate with your existing systems. Our intuitive user interface is easy to use and is easily adoptable by your upstream suppliers. Let us help you create powerful connections with your customers and uphold your values. Responsible supply chains make stronger&nbsp;brands.</p><p>Learn more at <a href="http://www.peerledger.com/supply-chain">www.peerledger.com/supply-chain</a>.</p>

  Introducing the new HoloFuel App&nbsp;Design  Progress on Many&nbsp;Fronts  Moving HoloFuel up on the&nbsp;Roadmap   Introducing the new HoloFuel App&nbsp;Design <p>Last year we released the HoloFuel hApp to our community testers on a previous version of Holochain. The testing we did then, although focused on the Holochain infrastructure, allowed us to observe and listen, and for testers to provide incredibly valuable feedback. It set us up to reimagine HoloFuel as an application. So that our alpha test community can have an idea of what to expect, today we are sharing the new&nbsp;design.</p><p>HoloFuel will work both installed locally and also as a hosted application on Holo for use by any web user. We’ve spiffed it up and it now has a proper logo, a simpler UI, and a more intuitive UX. Here’s a quick&nbsp;tour.</p><p>HoloFuel will have a dashboard where users can see their balance, initiate transactions and respond to incoming notifications.</p><p>HoloFuel enables recipients to accept or decline transactions. The Transaction History can be filtered, sorted and searched.</p><p>Sending and requesting transactions is simple and easy with the new HoloFuel workflows.</p> Progress on Many&nbsp;Fronts <p>As you can see, we’ve been hard at work on design but design is not the only place we have been making progress.</p><p>If you have been reading the regular updates we share in Telegram or Twitter, you probably already know that we’ve now got a working Elemental Chat application and that we are hard at work preparing the Holochain and Holo infrastructure so that we can release it to all hosts. We are almost&nbsp;there.</p><p>However, it may be a bit harder to see how all the other details that get shared in those messages are having us progress towards the other milestones on our roadmap. Here are some specific accomplishments from the past several&nbsp;weeks.</p>  DNAs for Holo Hosting have been initially built or migrated to RSM including:<br> -Holo hosting DNA<br> -Service Logger<br> -HoloFuel<br> -Holo Registration  UI design has been started for all apps and is nearing completion for&nbsp;some  Our KYC partner has been selected and we’re working to complete registration flows inclusive of a new registration hApp  Hosting infrastructure has been internally demonstrated — the main feature left before full integration testing is to ensure that signals can work end-to-end in the hosted&nbsp;context  An early version of the HDK (Holochain Developer’s Kit) has been created for RSM with testing and feedback from community app developers  An automated testing framework that uses HoloPorts to test Holochain apps instead of services like AWS has been recently built. We’re using that right now to do the behavioural load testing for Elemental Chat.  <p>All this progress has had us take a fresh look at our roadmap and make a few&nbsp;changes.</p> Moving HoloFuel up on the&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Yes, you read that right! We are actually ahead of where we expected to be in some ways. While it is taking a while to complete infrastructure testing because that is one of the most complex aspects of our work, we have been able to move many other activities forward. Because of that we decided to shift the HoloFuel application up in the roadmap. Here is what it looks like with the new&nbsp;changes.</p><p>More importantly however is getting a sense of how much of the work is done. Below are our estimates of work completed for a few of the milestones that follow our infrastructure releases.</p><p>The past month has not only been a month of progress towards our milestones for Holo and Holochain. It has also been a month of social unrest and we’ve engaged in deep consideration of our place in the future of technology and how we want to contribute to society. As a team we’ve reflected on the concentrating tendencies of power and the responsibilities that come with inherently centralised technologies. We’ve also delved into a profound discourse about how Holochain is fundamentally different from Holo. The ways that these two technologies work together but are divergent will be a theme of exploration in our writings over the course of the next year. We look forward to the&nbsp;journey.</p><p>In closing, I want to again appreciate all of those in the app ecosystem and in the community of testers who continue to contribute their time and energy and who are a key part of the success of this project. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/holofuel-app-design-energises-our-progress-dfa29c97dccd">HoloFuel App Design Energises our Progress</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  IOP Community Report 2020 Q4 
Reminder: Our goal for 2021 is to become the de facto easiest and cheapest open-source standard for gatekeeper-free DID &amp; SSI solutions. Our key selling points include state of the art crypto features with the lowest barriers of entry.
 tags: <code>IOP</code> <code>community report</code> <code>2020</code> 
 Introduction 
For many of us, this has been an exceptional year with lots of ups and downsides. This report will try to give you some insight into the achievements and obstacles of our small, but dedicated team. Let's start with our obstacles so that we can finish boasting about our accomplishments.

Similar to most of you, we had to switch those nice and efficient one-on-one meetings for endless hours of video calls. But the main obstacle stemmed from the bureaucracy imposed upon us from the same system that we try to disrupt. The delays caused by the administration and paperwork due to government institutions were endless. Additionally, legal departments reduced their work time due to the health crisis, so even the things that should go smooth took more time.

Nevertheless, by the end of 2020, we are proud of our achievements and our agility to take up challenges effectively. We hit all our goals for this year and now we can look back to a successful year with a lot of improvement to the IOP Stack(tm). Of course, this is not an argument of being content with the current state. Instead, we can motivate ourselves to do even better and disrupt even more by looking back at our accomplishments of 2020.
 Accomplishments 
 
 [] We have grown the IOP Stack to a remarkable size 
 [] The IOP Stack is production-ready 
 [] We have designed the first SDKs in Typescript and Flutter. 
 [] We have expanded the Hydra Blockchain with SSI and DNS features 
 [] We have released the innovative and convenient Hydra web wallet
 
 [] We have added Keystore file generation/authentication to the web wallet 
 [] We have added mnemonic generation/authentication to the web wallet 
 [] We have added voting for delegates to this wallet 
 
 
 [] The whole infrastructure automatically builds and deploys which improves the quality of our updates 
 [] We have completed the full SDK in Typescript 
 [] We have developed a keyvault, which will become a very important piece of the future stack
 
 [ ] With some minor adaptions, this can be made blockchain independent 
 
 
 [] We have hired a promising developer, David De Troch, who is committed to become a new core developer in the IOP Project 
 [] We have released the first part of the developer introduction videos that explain our stack 
 [] We have integrated DID/SSI into the blockexplorer - Claims made and DIDs created can be publicly verified 
 [] We have integrated DNS into the blockexplorer - Schemas and domains can be registered and publicly verified 
 [] Last, but not least: we have published a<a href="https://developer.iop.global/"> developer portal</a> that contains the (SDK) documentation plus tons of tutorials 
 
 Pipeline(next few Months) 
 
 [ ] Enterprise API Portal: IOP Console 
 [ ] Launch a new product concerning digital asset ownership 
 [ ] An official joint venture with a German company 
 
We announce them as soon as we can. We need to wait until everything is complete and thoroughly tested. Concerning the joint venture, we have to ensure that all the details are finalized. Until then, stay tuned and watch our <a href="https://t.me/IoP_news">telegram channel</a> for news soon!
 IOP reporting for duty 
We are proud to announce that the underlying SSI/DID infrastructure is production-ready.<br> We arrived at a point where businesses can start to build apps and services on top of our stack. Projects with concrete ideas about a KYC or an identity solution should check out our technology.<br> Compare our possibilities and costs with other platforms and we are confident about (y)our future!<br> On top, you can apply for building a common joint venture or request for support how to integrate the stack to your ecosystem. Just get in touch with us!

A common problem with today's crypto is usability. This is improving at a steady pace. At IOP we integrated a <a href="https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/decentralized-dns-intro">decentralized DNS system</a>, which enables high-reputation actors to name wallets or record the data formats and workflows they use to increase discoverability, transparency and gain trust in the ecosystem.<br> In English: Wallet addresses, DID contracts can become human readable names like a website address is being read from a browser.

This year we are going to work with Morpheus on an open-source flagship app that incorporates our state-of-the-art features. This makes it easier for teams to start implementing solutions. They do not have to start from ground zero, instead, they have a worked-out example to go by. Additionally, we will gain experience with what we built and gain ideas for further features and improvements.

If you work in identity and access management and you are trying to transform to Industry 4.0, you should talk to us and try our framework out! We are helpful and glad to support everybody with knowledge transfer or joint ventures.
 New Year's resolutions 
Building the whole IOP Stack will take time. In the meantime, the goal is to become profitable with our existing portfolio, so that we can ensure the future of our business and lead in the privacy space. This can only happen with healthy and mutually beneficial partnerships. It is time for IOP to leave its comfort zone and look for applications that provide concrete value to its customers and partners alike.

Currently, <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFT) are becoming a hot topic in crypto. Our goal is to combine it with our existing stack and DeFi to create a completely new ecosystem. One year should be enough to try to make this unique combination ready for prime time in 2021 Q4.&nbsp;

Our dedicated team currently consists of experts, veterans, and one newcomer on the block. Behind the team, there is huge support from the community and the delegates. So we thank you all for keeping us company during our ups and downs! As our previous points have laid out, our ambitions are as high as ever. Therefore, another resolution is to expand our team with more fresh blood and energy. This is a necessary step for us to grow and achieve our goals. Ideally, this should also be reflected in the community. We would like to reach out to you! Spread word about our mission to find potential partners, business ideas, or new members for our community. We are confident that this will benefit all!
 BONUS: Cool ways to enter the IOP ecosystem!

   Strong Identity Governance can Protect Your Business and Increase Productivity 

<p>The risk of identity breaches to global organizations cannot be overstated. Cybercriminals continue to attack organizations across the enterprise and numerous verticals. As noted in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/2020-consumer-identity-breach-report">2020 ForgeRock Consumer Identity Breach Report</a>, unauthorized access (40%) is the number one attack method by cybercriminals in 2020. It’s no wonder there has been a 78% increase in compromised consumer records over the previous year. The point here is clear: organizations that are dependent on access predictions based on limited data and visibility are exposing their business to unnecessary risk. They need to evolve their current thinking and approach in order to better manage and control unauthorized user access.&nbsp;</p>

 The Silent Access Challenge: Entitlement Creep&nbsp; 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">Digital transformation</a>, securing the remote workforce, and growing regulatory compliance requirements like SOX, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA are putting global organizations under increasing pressure to achieve compliance – not just annually, but continuously. With so many new types of identities – customers, partners, workforce, citizens, machines, devices, bots’ APIs, applications, and microservices – security and IT teams are overwhelmed. Today’s identity governance solutions cannot keep up because they are based on manual, human reviews and fulfillment. As a result, organizations are blind to potential risks such as growing employee entitlement creep across the enterprise.</p>

<p>An employee’s roles, groups, and responsibilities can change dramatically over the course of their employment. When these changes are dealt with manually, it is easy to forget to remove some or all access from a previous role. This leads to entitlement creep, where employees gradually accumulate unnecessary permissions over time. As a result, when a user leaves an organization, he or she might have more access than IT knows about, so the user retains access to those overlooked or orphaned accounts.</p>

   &nbsp; 

 Organizational Blindspots Accelerate Entitlement Creep&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Access Compliance&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Staying compliant requires a lot of effort – especially when people change jobs, work on special projects, or leave your organization. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance</a> helps by automating the work it takes to enforce and demonstrate compliance. By implementing access policies, your organization can be confident that the right people are accessing the right information for the right reasons. And, it lets you quickly review and certify access for any user at any time.</p>

<p>Whether it is helping to comply with regulations such as SOX, HIPAA, GDPR, FISMA or CCPA,&nbsp; compliance is foundational to reducing your organization’s security risks. A failed compliance audit or lack of access controls can lead to users accumulating more entitlements or unnecessary permissions over time. This, in turn, can lead to inappropriate access privileges and potentially to larger issues as well, like unauthorized user access, or even a data breach.</p>

<p>Operational Inefficiencies&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity governance solutions are meant to automate access requests, approvals, and certification reviews. Unfortunately, the reality is that IT and security teams are buried in access requests, approvals, and certification reviews. As a result, they can end up manually approving access requests and rubber-stamping access certifications. This results in the overprovisioning of user access privileges – in this case, excessive or unnecessary entitlement assignments.&nbsp;This can lead to unauthorized user access to systems, applications, and proprietary business information, like personal identifiable information (PII), business strategies, competitive intelligence or company revenue projections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Business Enablement&nbsp;</p>

<p>Governing user access to applications and systems across an entire enterprise is a critical component to any security strategy. But it often presents one of the greatest challenges faced by security professionals. As employees, contractors, or temporary staff join the company, change jobs, take on different assignments, or eventually leave the company, organizations must constantly update access entitlements and policies to ensure that users only have access to what they need, while removing access they don’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many organizations today address this with manual processes executed by different people and different systems. Manual processes are not effective at addressing the issue for a number of reasons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Employees must wait to get the access they need to do their job.</p>

<p>2. They are more prone to errors.</p>

<p>3. Policies do not cover all needed access types and are often applied haphazardly.</p>

<p>4. They are &nbsp;much more costly than automated processes.</p>

<p>Eliminate Entitlement Creep with AI-Driven Identity Analytics&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you prevent entitlement creep in your organization? The answer lies in artificial intelligence <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">(AI)-driven identity analytics</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity analytics leverages AI and machine learning algorithms to consume and analyze vast data volumes to map out the user access landscape across the entire enterprise. By detecting user access patterns – both good and bad – identity analytics can quickly highlight excessive or unnecessary entitlement assignments and over-provisioned user access privileges. In turn, AI-driven identity analytics can automate the removal of high-confidence and low-risk access rights, lowering the risk of unauthorized users access across your organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my next blog, I’ll explain how your organization can eliminate entitlement creep with ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a>. In the meantime, be sure to read the new KuppingerCole white paper “<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/kuppingercole-overcoming-identity-governance-challenges-with-forgerock-autonomous-identity">Overcoming Identity Governance Challenges with ForgeRock Autonomous Identity</a>”.&nbsp;<br>

<p>Shyft Network was designed as an interoperable standard for use cases that require multiparty trust and validation. In order to enable more use cases across public and permissioned protocols, standards are required to extend the tools and options available for new user groups, institutional use cases, and traditional systems.</p><p>The use cases Shyft Network focuses on are ones where you don’t necessarily have 3rd party obligations or require counterparties to create trust across each other in order to be successful. Traditionally, solutions to this are done through legally binding agreements or established regulatory and legal requirements. In the context of decentralized systems, adding in legal processes and cross entity rules are both challenging and in many cases destructive to the openness of the system&nbsp;itself.</p><p>The role of Shyft Network’s infrastructure is to maintain openness and decentralization across any protocol, while enabling standard processes that allow for counterparty rule creation and consent to be combined in order to solve trust and counterparty obligation issues that are required in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>To put it simply, the transactions and interactions we engage in every day are largely based on trust and associations or validation of information and assets by other parties. The role of Shyft Network is to act as this trust layer, to bridge the gap between the traditional world and decentralized, in order to unify these ecosystems and further enable mass adoption and real-world interoperability.</p><p>The following explainer is meant to describe the use of SHFT, the native currency of the Shyft Network, and to outline only some of the major use cases of the currency and protocol standard.</p><p>Shyft Network Blockchain</p><p>In order to pay for services across intermediaries, DApps and participants, SHFT is used to both pay for the cost of security and operations, as well as a payment mechanism for the transmission of data and assets. This is similar to how existing blockchains function as Layer&nbsp;1’s.</p><p>Shyft Network Smart Contract&nbsp;suite</p><p>The goal in Shyft Network’s design is to act as a multi-layer protocol depending on the needs and requirements of its users. Rather than competing with other layer 1’s like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, Algorand, and more, Shyft Network was designed primarily as a very large smart contract infrastructure set. By taking this approach, the protocol can focus on cross-chain use cases and ways of unifying layer 1’s in order to build out a cross-protocol trust and compliant data&nbsp;layer.</p><p>Shyft Network runs three different core infrastructure stacks:</p>  A federated layer 1 (The blockchain): A public system for use cases that have a particular set of needs and requirements. This is primarily for enterprises and institutions (ie. Governments) who would rather focus on data origination and require a different trust model at the base protocol&nbsp;level.  Shyft Network Smart contract suite: The primary standards logic to enable all use cases, intermediary interactions, and tools for developers to build applications against Shyft&nbsp;Network.  Byfrost Bridge: An asset-staked bridging infrastructure for cross-protocol data and asset transmission. Byfrost was designed with the smart contract suite. The goal of Byfrost is to bridge the Shyft network smart contract suites together across protocols. Through this process, all of the history, use cases, and users that sit on Shyft Network can be utilized across other protocols, thereby unifying everything into a cross-chain data and asset availability layer.  <p>The rest of this post will focus on the use cases of Shyft Network and the SHFT currency within them rather than a technical deep dive into the primary infrastructures.</p><p>SHFT is a means of payment, a mechanism for bonding value, and an instrument for governance value capture. SHFT, depending on the use case, can be utilized in a multitude of ways which includes a monetary instrument and value capture system, as well as an authorization system for long-term validation.</p><p>SHFT is a currency for identity and data transmission, as well as a governance mechanism for coordination across ecosystems that enables entity-to-entity governance, compliant asset creation, and a system for compliant defi and other applications. Enabling a new side of the existing ecosystem will drastically expand the size of market participants and increase the size of asset participation across all decentralized projects, protocols, and marketplaces.</p><p>Identity, Counterparty Discovery &amp; User coordination</p><p>We believe that the next phase of progress for decentralized systems is in the creation of identity, reputation, and enhanced methods of entity creation and coordination. Users, entities (Dapps, Defi, institutions, enterprises, etc.), assets and data are primary interactions in everyday life. Shyft Network enables complex creation of these verticals to build a base standard for cooperation and transaction coordination.</p><p>Identity is very broad and extends to nearly every facet of life, which means defining initial use cases must be derived from critical issues and problems that we face and feel everyday. In creating Shyft Network, the contributing early participants and teams brought in problems and pains they had felt from the early days of the crypto ecosystem and worked towards solving&nbsp;them.</p><p>Identity</p><p>The SHFT token is used to pay for security and operations on the Shyft Network, as well as to enable data market payments across intermediaries involved in identity systems. The simplest example of this is the current project being developed on Shyft Network in collaboration with the Government of Bermuda. The Perseid project is the first national identity project aimed at leveraging a public blockchain protocol to create a national data market place and identity ecosystem. SHFT is the currency used to enable identities across the country, and pay for data services across institutions engaging in user-consent based identity.</p><p>Compliant DeFi &amp; Global Regulations: A global opt-in compliance and trust&nbsp;Layer</p><p>In order to ensure that the ecosystem continues to grow in cooperation with new regulations, we need systems that can bridge the gap and enable opt-in infrastructure to allow for regulated intermediaries and rules to be built across permissionless networks. This does not mean forcing people into compliant systems, but rather providing more options to allow for new user groups to be able to participate in the ecosystem. The future of institutional adoption requires compliance requirements and primitives to be a part of market infrastructure in order to actually utilize these&nbsp;systems.</p><p>This not only protects the ecosystems growth but allows us to tailor to the liquidity that exists outside of the ecosystem today. Compliant participants and liquidity in the traditional financial system is many orders of magnitude larger than the crypto economy, and being able to provide open infrastructure to these parties enables onboarding and regulatory clarity. Shyft Network was designed to enable these use cases, creating a cross-protocol environment for compliant liquidity, identity passporting and data transmission.</p><p>The FATF travel rule was the first global regulatory requirement placed on the ecosystem in June of 2019. Some of the largest crypto platforms, DeFi projects, and stablecoins including Binance, Bitfinex, Huobi, Aave, Tether, joined together to create Veriscope atop of the Shyft Network. These exchanges today are utilizing Veriscope to ensure user consent, data security, exchange to exchange verification and counterparty discovery. Regulations are inherently designed to centralize functions of systems, but through the design of our system, Shyft Network is the only solution that globally allows Bitcoin and other crypto ecosystems to maintain openness and decentralization while allowing users to comply with cross-jurisdictional requirements like the travel&nbsp;rule.</p><p>The SHFT currency is used to ensure spam prevention, prevent data attacks against exchanges and global users of the system, create payment and bonded asset channels for untrusted counterparties (a form of data market transaction) and over the long term helps maintain the governance system currently being directed and developed by the global coalition of digital asset companies.</p><p>The SHFT token is used to pay for the security of validation for crypto transactions that occur across participants in Veriscope. When a digital asset is withdrawn and sent from one platform to another, SHFT is used to request information from other platforms and to complete data transactions. With this, Shyft Network through Veriscope becomes a data side chain to public networks, currencies and tokens globally, and acts to ensure security and privacy are maintained across our open ecosystem.</p>

<p>Also known as “Data Privacy Day” outside of Europe.</p>



<p>2021 follows hot on the heels of one of the most disruptive years we have known in our lifetimes and, if the analysts are to be taken seriously, looks set to be a game-changer for the world of Privacy Tech. Possibly, a theme enhanced by the need to share data on mass due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rise of Privacy Tech has been creeping up over the last few years but to date has not hit the mainstream. Organisations have not had an incentive to counter their mass data accumulation and often can’t see beyond more is; well, more and therefore better?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year is the 40th anniversary of the introduction of Convention 108, the first legally binding instrument relating to data protection. With the treaty being in place for so long, we would like to believe that the concept of data protection is familiar to society at large. Unfortunately, the rate at which technology has evolved means that it is not always apparent what happens when you share your data and has left most people in the dark. 2021 marks the 15th annual Data Protection Day and aims to educate society on data protection issues and rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MyLife Digital believes that many positives can come from collecting, sharing, and using people’s data ethically. Products and services should be designed to deliver benefits to individuals, society, and organisations equally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is going to make the difference in 2021?</p>



<p>There are several forces coming together that will make significant changes to how society views and treats data protection.</p>



  Technology is still evolving – but demonstrating a change to reflect the human-centric needs of society. Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid project is one example of the change needed to give people control of their data  Regulation is evolving. GDPR introduced a step change and is seen as the benchmark for global data protection standards. The number of countries that have introduced or updated their data protection regulations in the last few years has increased significantly.  Regulators are learning how to act. Adtech is an elusive dark art, individuals’ data is regularly shared and used to create profiles to improve advert displays without individuals realising.&nbsp;  Activists are making noise. More advocates are challenging dark patterns relating to data protection. Individuals and groups have raised many challenges with regulators to ensure data protection is done right. Raising awareness and ensuring laws change to meet the needs of the people they protect.  People are becoming aware of data protection rules. Individuals are noticing that advert following them around the internet and starting to challenge this stalking behaviour.  



<p>What do the analysts say?</p>



<p>Gartner suggest a proactive approach to privacy and data protection helps organisations increase trust.</p>



<p>Privacy is becoming a reason for consumers to purchase a product, in the same way that “organic,” “free trade” and “cruelty-free” labels have driven products sales in the past decade.</p>



<p>“Privacy-first products are likely to follow this trend,” says Bart Willemsen, Vice President Analyst, Gartner. “To increase customer trust, executive leaders need to build a holistic and adaptive privacy program across the organisation, and be proactive instead of responding to each jurisdictional challenge.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-forhttps://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-for-the-future-of-privacy-2020/%20-the-future-of-privacy-2020/">https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-forhttps://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-for-the-future-of-privacy-2020/ -the-future-of-privacy-2020/</a></p>



<p>——————</p>



<p>Forrester too, predict that Privacy will become an imperative in 2021.</p>



<p>2021 will be a year of transition. As communities, consumers, and businesses leave the pandemic behind, they will embrace a new normal.</p>



<p>Three privacy-related trends will underpin this transition: 1) an ever-increasing appetite to collect, process, and share sensitive personal data from consumers and employees; 2) despite the recessionary economy, values-based consumers will increasingly prefer to engage with and entrust their data to ethical businesses; and 3) regulatory and compliance complexity in relation to data privacy will increase further.</p>

<p>__________</p>



<p>CMOs should be considering Consent and Preference Management</p>



<p>With both Forrester and Gartner predicting 2021 will be the year Privacy becomes an imperative, this following article in ITPro addresses why CMOs should be considering Consent &amp; Preference Management as a core component of the marketing stack.</p>



<p>“They must look for solutions that help them design and implement privacy as continuous engagement. This includes designing and orchestrating privacy touch-points and building portals that allow consumers to adjust their data sharing preferences,” says Iannopollo, a senior analyst at Forrester.</p>

<p>Initiative Will Build Upon Fractal’s Growing Base of 140,000&nbsp;Users</p><p>28 January 2021, Berlin, Germany and Tallinn, Estonia — Fractal, KILT Protocol and Polkadex today announced a partnership to create a decentralised KYC system for exchange customers. Polkadex and Fractal will use the KILT Protocol as the underlying infrastructure for managing the KYC credentials required by Polkadex, to simplify and streamline the onboarding experience.</p><p>KILT Protocol will integrate Fractal’s user-centric KYC/AML platform, which is built for compliance with global, regulated industries. BOTLabs GmbH (the company behind KILT Protocol) will provide a wallet as a browser extension for customers to hold their credentials, and make the wallet available to Polkadex for verification. Fractal and Polkadex will integrate KILT’s SDK to build out the platform.</p><p>The onboarding flow will be as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Fractal will automatically issue KILT-Credentials to Fractal’s current user base of 140,000 users who have previously KYC’d  Polkadex will ask new users for credentials  If the user has no credentials, they are directed to download and set up KILT’s&nbsp;wallet  If a user is not verified, Fractal guides them through identity verification and attests the KYC credentials when&nbsp;complete  When the user’s identity is verified, Fractal stores the credential hash on the KILT blockchain.   Decentralising the KYC&nbsp;Process <p>Polkadex is a fully decentralised, peer-to-peer, orderbook-based cryptocurrency exchange for the DeFi ecosystem built on Substrate, the same framework that powers Polkadot. To solve the problem of order matching with identified individuals, Polkadex uses a zero-knowledge proof of identity obtained from the KILT blockchain.</p><p>KILT Protocol stores customer data in a distributed manner, without giving any provider undue advantage through data aggregation. By integrating KILT, Polkadex does not need to store or access customer data or compromise their privacy to identify&nbsp;people.</p><p>“We envision a world of financial inclusion, creating bridges that transfer value from traditional money markets to a decentralised store of value and trust, thereby preparing the world for a tokenised future. KILT is a great way to achieve that without compromising the core principles of decentralisation,” said Gautham J, CEO of Polkadex.</p><p>KILT is an open-source fat blockchain protocol for issuing claim-based verifiable credentials that enable trust business models in a Web 3.0 marketplace. Built on Substrate, the protocol has multiple business applications and KILT is currently exploring partnerships in the energy, genetics, gaming and finance&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>“The alliance with Fractal and Polkadex is the first of many turnkey solutions the KILT ecosystem will offer for exchanges and DeFi projects. We’re proud to be part of substantive ecosystem collaborations with Substrate and Polkadot builders,” said Ingo Rübe, CEO of BOTLabs GmbH and Founder of KILT Protocol.</p><p>KILT and Fractal have collaborated for the past three years. Fractal has been utilised by many exchanges and ICOs, and is now developing an advertising marketplace that replaces the tracking cookie and gives control back to users. Fractal’s open-source protocol provides a standard for a fair and transparent exchange of ad information that will enable a data commons while ensuring data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>“We are excited to see decentralised identifiers being used beyond the concept stage. It will be a great user experience and hopefully a kickstart for a more decentralised web,” said Julian Leitloff, Co-founder and CEO of&nbsp;Fractal.</p> About Fractal <p><a href="https://www.trustfractal.com">Fractal</a> is an identification company. We are replacing the ad cookie to give users back control over their data. Fractal wants to create a data commons that will enable fair competition against a market duopoly with valued users and trusted ads. Fractal was founded in 2017 and is trusted by 140k verified crypto&nbsp;users.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io">KILT</a> is an open-source fat blockchain protocol for issuing claim-based verifiable, revocable, and anonymous credentials for Web 3.0. It allows users to claim arbitrary attributes about themselves, have them attested by trusted entities, and store the claims as self-sovereign credentials. The protocol offers a simple JavaScript SDK so useful applications can be built without requiring any blockchain development skills.</p> About Polkadex <p><a href="https://www.polkadex.trade">Polkadex</a> is a fully decentralised, peer-to-peer, orderbook-based cryptocurrency exchange for the Defi ecosystem built on Substrate, the same framework that powers Polkadot.

<p>Cybersecurity is the talk of the day in much of Europe. As an example, in Finland there was a recent case in which a private psychotherapy centre’s database was hacked and a considerable amount of sensitive client information was stolen. After this, the attackers made attempts to extort money from the victims by threatening to release the information to the public. </p>
<p>Cases like this are caused by compromised customer credentials, weak authorisation, and poor access control implementations. Solutions that were valid a few years ago might not be up to today’s challenges. It can be difficult for companies to protect their valuable customer data, especially if you rely on in-house built IAM (Identity and Access Management) solutions that nobody updates periodically. Ubisecure’s Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) easy to use solution lets you rapidly embed strong, proven CIAM (Customer IAM) capabilities into your applications. It allows you to improve security while letting your developers concentrate on your core business. In this blog, I tell you how to try these capabilities for yourself, in a no-commitment <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/free-idaas/" title="IDaaS free trial">IDaaS free trial</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Identity-as-a-Service? 
<p>IDaaS offers cloud deployment options of Ubisecure’s Identity Platform solution, including both identity management and access management tools. These are used to manage your company’s external identities, including your customers, partners, remote workers, subcontractors and other external stakeholders. </p>
<p>In short IDaaS is a CIAM system delivered as SaaS (Software-as-a-Service).</p>
<p>There are two main options for Ubisecure IDaaS deployment – private cloud and public cloud. The public cloud option is a single- or multi-tenant solution that offers core CIAM functionality and is fully deployed and operated by Ubisecure. The main focus of public cloud IDaaS is on the access management side, such as single sign-on (SSO), identity providers (IdPs) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).Private cloud IDaaS is a single-tenant solution that offers full IAM functionality – including more advanced identity management capabilities like Delegated Authority – and is deployed by the customer or a certified Ubisecure System Integrator partner. The platform is operated by Ubisecure. Ubisecure also provides on-premises and hybrid deployment solutions of its Identity Platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Ubisecure’s IDaaS free trial? 
<p>We offer everyone a chance to test a limited set of Ubisecure’s IDaaS capabilities for a 30 day trial period. You get free access to use the system during this trial period to give you a chance to ‘test drive’ the solution for yourself. The IDaaS free trial includes identity management and access management tools, and clear step lists to instruct you with each task. No previous experience of CIAM systems is required and you will learn how to do basic identity management tasks and how to register new applications with easy to use tools and graphical user interfaces. Find the registration link here on our website: <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/free-idaas/" title="www.ubisecure.com/free-idaas">www.ubisecure.com/free-idaas</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to use the IDaaS Free Trial 
<p>This free edition of Ubisecure IDaaS allows you to test some of the core capabilities of a CIAM solution. The trial includes user registration, identity management with self-service and administration user interfaces, and a trial console tool for application integrations using the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol. You don’t need to bring a test application for testing the integration; it’s provided to you as a part of the trial. </p>
<p>Next, we will take a look at the main use cases of the IDaaS free trial. In the example case below, Max Mustermann from Drive Tag Inc. registers an IDaaS trial account, operates both self-service and administration views of the identity management, and registers a test application with an IDaaS trial access management tool called Trial Console.&nbsp;</p>
 Registering for the IDaaS free trial 
<p>The first step in the IDaaS trial is the main user registration. Max clicks the registration link found from the Ubisecure <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/free-idaas/" title="website">website</a>. He then fills in the simple registration form, including a confirmation code sent to his email, and he becomes the main user of a new organisation. Then he can add and invite new users from his organisation to join the trial account.</p>
 <p>Max Mustermann from Drive Tag Inc. registers an IDaaS free trial account.</p> 
 Identity Management self-service view 
<p>Once Max has sent the registration form, he will receive an account registration confirmation email with a link to the Identity Management self-service view. </p>
 <p>Max receives a registration confirmation email with a link to the Identity Management self-service view.</p> 
<p>Max clicks the link, which forwards him to the IDaaS free trial sign-in window. Here, he can choose from different options including Identity Management, Access Management, OpenID Connect Tester Tool, Trial Documentation and sending an email to discuss with Ubisecure experts. He can also reset his forgotten password, in which case he’ll receive a link to his email to proceed with the operation. Max signs in to the Identity Management self-service view.</p>
 <p>Max signs into Identity Management.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;In the self-service view, Max can view, add, modify and delete his identity attributes (in the trial version, only mobile phone number can be configured) and change his password. Also, he can view his role information which is used to define the level of access rights to different applications integrated to the Ubisecure Identity Platform. At a later phase, Max will integrate a test application using the Trial Console Access Management tool.</p>
 <p>Max can view, add, modify and delete his identity attributes, change the password and manage his roles.</p> 
 Administration view 
<p>Next, Max switches to the Administration view, which is only available to main (administrator) users. Normal users can access only the Identity Management self-service view. Here, Max can manually add new users to his organisation or send registration invitation emails to them. Max can also view, add, modify and delete other users’ identity attributes, reset their passwords and manage their roles. </p>
 <p>Max deletes user ‘John Doe’ in the IDaaS trial Administration view.</p> 
 Application Integration 
<p>One of the main use cases of the Ubisecure Identity Platform is application integration. For this, the IDaaS free trial has a special access management tool called Trial Console. This tool simplifies the integration work and helps new users to register applications to the Identity Platform. </p>
<p>When registering an application, you only need to enter the redirect URI of your application. Trial Console then generates client credentials for your application to use with the OpenID Connect authorisation code flow.</p>
<p>To quickly get started integrating with Java or .NET technology, we offer sample applications with the source code, available on Github:</p>
 
 Java Spring Boot<br>
<a href="https://github.com/psteniusubi/spring-boot-sample" title="https://github.com/psteniusubi/spring-boot-sample">https://github.com/psteniusubi/spring-boot-sample</a> 
 NET Core<br>
<a href="https://github.com/psteniusubi/AspNetCoreSample" title="https://github.com/psteniusubi/AspNetCoreSample">https://github.com/psteniusubi/AspNetCoreSample</a>  
 
<p>For those who want to experience an OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration without coding we have a browser based tool, OpenID Connect Tester. This tools lets you view the OIDC flows and decoded claims within the ID token in detail.</p>
<p>In this example, Max Mustermann has clicked the Access Management link in the sign-in window (see picture 3) to open the Trial Console window. He then registers a test application to the Identity Platform. Open the IDaaS Trial Documentation section (see picture 3) to view clear steps on how to do the registration.</p>
 <p>Max Mustermann uses the Trial Console to register the OpenID Connect test application to the Ubisecure Identity Platform.</p> 
<p>Max registers the OIDC Tester tool with the Trial Console tool. The Trial Console is an IdP (Identity Provider) and the OIDC Tester is a client. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Max configures OpenID Connect Tester to be a client for the Trial Console (Identity Provider).</p> 
<p>Once the OIDC Tester application has been registered, Max can use the tool to monitor the OIDC protocol flows. Generally speaking, these flows are used to exchange information between the user’s browser, the application the user wants to access and the Identity Platform. With the OIDC Tester, Max can view authorization-, token- and introspection requests. Also, he can view the ID token and decode it to see the claims inside the token. To get more information about the protocol flows, see my colleague Petteri Stenius’ blog article on “<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/education/differences-between-saml-oauth-openid-connect/" title="The differences between SAML, OAuth and OpenID Connect">The differences between SAML, OAuth and OpenID Connect</a>”. </p>
 <p>Max can choose requests to monitor or decode an ID Token.</p> 
 Conclusion 
<p>IDaaS is the fastest way for you to introduce identity and access management capabilities into your web, mobile and desktop applications. According to Gartner, one of the leading research and advisory companies, by 2022 <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-steps-to-implement-single-sign-on/" title="IDaaS will be the chosen delivery model for more than 80% of new access management purchases globally">IDaaS will be the chosen delivery model for more than 80% of new access management purchases globally</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get familiar with IDaaS is to register for Ubisecure’s IDaaS free trial session and to start testing some of the core features of the solution. It is completely free and you can launch a test instance 24/7 from Ubisecure’s website. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  2020 Channel Partners of the Year: ProofID and Versent  <p>The Channel Partner of the Year awards go to our channel partners who exemplify, no matter the circumstance, the best of Ping. They have a positive impact on Ping’s business through growing our customer base, furthering beneficial alignment and engagement with our field, and making strong pipeline contributions to our company.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m pleased to announce not one but two recipients of the Channel Partner award—the North America Channel Partner of the Year and the International Channel Partner of the Year.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First I’d like to congratulate <a href="https://proofid.com/">ProofID</a>, our 2020 North American Channel Partner of the Year. &nbsp; ProofID saw outstanding success in 2020, selling Ping Identity products and bringing value-added services to customers to help transform their digital business initiatives. Together with Ping, they sold and implemented into several enterprise accounts. They continuously go above and beyond to meet and exceed the complex requirements of some of our most strategic customers.&nbsp;</p> <p><br> The other award goes to <a href="https://versent.com.au/">Versent</a>, our 2020 International Channel Partner of the Year. Championing the needs of the enterprise customer while professionally partnering with vendors is the Versent way. Being customer-first was certainly true in 2020 when it came to our joint success, as Versent worked together with Ping's Asia-Pacific team to successfully migrate many customers, including FlyBuys, Service New South Wales and Land Services South Australia, to cloud-based identity solutions. Their commitment to partnering with Ping Teams and delivering quality, transformative digital solutions are the reasons why Versent is pivotal in accelerating the new era of intelligent identity access management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

DIDKit, on the other hand, is ready to start processing real-world VCs with non-repudiable signatures right out the box. It’s licensed under Apache 2.0, and we will soon accept contributions under&nbsp;CLA.</p><p>Like most SSI systems that strive to be developer-friendly and performant above all else, we are tuning our projects to function optimally with one specific DID method: did:tz, which we are finalizing in parallel within the Tezos core developer ecosystem. We pride ourselves, however, on having built our module system in the most infrastructure-agnostic way possible, strictly conformant to the letter and the spirit of the DID core specifications.</p> DIDKit’s unique superpowers, and those of&nbsp;did:tz <p>This differs markedly from many wallets and SSI systems built for a specific blockchain ecosystem. Rather than conforming our core ssi libraries to the idiosyncrasies of did:tz and interpreting the core DID specifications accordingly, we designed the did:tz method to be the substrate for the most performant, formal verification friendly, and widely-interoperable verifiable data registry yet. We believe a DID method should organically earn traffic by being well engineered for important use cases, not by being in the right place at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>DIDKit, importantly, was designed to be modular and un-opinionated about anchoring and smart-contract-level concerns, at an arm’s remove from the did:tz design process. The core LD-Proof signing and verification engine that DIDKit wraps was designed from the beginning to work as securely and performantly as possible, regardless of which DID method drivers are compiled along with it or what kinds of DIDs and VCs it is consuming.</p><p>Our goal is for DIDKit to be a general-purpose, white-label engine at the core of almost any credential-handling data flow. We want it to be lightweight and flexible and performant enough for the widest possible range of contexts and topographies. This means that shell scripts, sysadmins, cross-application automations, and even web servers can start issuing verifiable W3C-conforming JSON-LD credentials to log events, store data, and send and receive signed, trustworthy messages.</p> Who needs this (and doesn’t know&nbsp;it) <p>If you’re new to SSI, and want to see close up how all the parts work, there’s no better way to get up to speed than building a prototype around DIDKit. DIDKit can be the server or command-line tool at the heart of your prototype, but you can also write a <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/example--core-functions-in-bash">batch generation script</a> in under a minute that gives you a huge corpus of dummy-data credentials to help you test or benchmark that prototype. And after you’re done building a working prototype, pop the hood and take a look at the inner workings, even if you’re new to cryptography and protocol-level work. (Don’t be scared off by it being written in Rust — anyone proficient in JavaScript should be able to parse it well enough, with a few <a href="https://www.codegram.com/blog/rust-for-js-developers/">pointers</a>.)</p><p>If it’s not a prototype you’re wrangling but a live, mission-critical legacy system, you are likely to prioritize flexibility. DIDKit, integrated via a Java or C foreign function interface, could be used to bring legacy systems and their data into the 21st century, seamlessly and reliably emitting VCs from deep in the racks of an on-premise mainframe or a server farm you need a security-clearance to&nbsp;patch.</p><p>More agile webs of “API businesses” and VC-powered marketplaces for services and cloud-native widgets have their own integration needs and dependency policies. DIDKit is lightweight enough to run on an IoT device, or in a microservice architecture, or in any number of next-generation API-to-API business contexts. Indeed, trustworthy and encrypted verifiable credentials might just be the quantum leap that enables a whole new level of cloud-native businesses, that can securely and confidentially process sensitive data in a zero-trust architecture.</p> Core Feature-set in&nbsp;v0.1 <p>DIDKit’s core feature-set is expanding steadily over time and we are committed to doing this development in the open, so feel free to engage with the repository directly on <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit/issues/new/choose">github</a>.

					  Impacts on the Digital Identity Landscape in 2021 <p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the five years that OWI has analyzed the evolution of the Digital Identity Landscape, we’ve found innovation to be a consistent linchpin; a reliable indicator of what the future might hold. In 2020, though, the pandemic’s impact was unprecedented. It forced enterprises, institutions, and governments to transform, prioritizing Digital Identity and placing it squarely in the sights of investors and end-users alike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than innovation, 2020 was the year of consolidation. Through the year, the rate of investment didn’t slow: a total of $247B was raised by 14,000 companies. The pandemic brought with it a need to offer a suite of Digital Identity offerings instead of a single solution or product. It created the potential for infinite regress in an already partnership-heavy market. Today, the market includes over 3,000 companies and is worth a staggering $210B, growing at a 19% CAGR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> The Digital Identity Landscape&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The OWI Digital Identity Landscape is a tool and framework we’ve developed to help provide an in-depth look at how Digital Identity applications are evolving and how intersections across solution segments are shaping next-generation strategies. Below is an example of one of the many framework overlays we use to assess the Landscape – click through the honeycombs to learn more about each segment. We will be publishing more landscape framework overlays and assessments throughout 2021.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Our unique honeycomb design provides a roadmap through the different solution segments within the space, showcasing not only their relationships and hierarchy but also identifying how they come together to address unique Digital Identity challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These challenges can include data, technology, business models, or other issues that arise within Digital Identity. The design also helps to identify use cases that drive demand in the space. With this knowledge, companies can understand what technology is available, what solutions segments have become mission-critical, where investments are flowing, and the spaces that require more innovation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As with every year, our Digital Identity Landscape provides insight into a dramatically shifting industry. What’s unique about this year is the adoption of Digital Identity awareness, interest, and use cases from a largely secondary set of users: The consumer. It’s a shift that moves the importance of Digital Identity – including privacy and security – from the back rooms of corporate offices and into people’s homes. In the maturation process of the industry, it’s a seismic opportunity, providing the potential for new lines of businesses and opening entirely new markets for the right strategies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> The Consumer-Driven Demand For Digital Identity&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The pandemic forced consumers and businesses alike to adopt more digital tools. This encouraged industry to improve procedures and make them easier for consumers to understand and handle. From the Landscape above, it’s clear that the adoption of Digital Identity tools has more room to grow in the form of digital credentials and eSignatures, Digital Identity Wallets, and Mobile Identity applications, among other segments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The difficulty of this trend is the lack of understanding, patience or time from the consumer side. The Digital Identity industry hasn’t done enough to quell many of these concerns. Take some of the most common issues identified within the consumer space:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Consumers feel the brunt of industry fragmentation. The average internet user in the US manages, on average,150 online accounts requiring a password, a number expected to double by 2022  Friction remains a massive problem. About 25% of all financial services applications are abandoned due to friction in the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, in part because current Identity Verification (IDV) procedures fail users  Consumers demand privacy and control. Nearly 80% of Americans are very or somewhat concerned about how companies use their data, according to a 2019 survey by Pew Research&nbsp;  The consumer education gap hasn’t narrowed. One in four consumers consider themselves uninformed about cybersecurity, while more than half say they could do more to protect their personal information online  Fraud and theft still exist. Identity theft and fraud cost 15.4 million consumers over $16 billion last year  <p>Two very important takeaways come from these consumer insights. First, consumers don’t want to have to pay to solve these problems. They don’t understand the issues involved and even fewer know the best way to circumnavigate the hurdles. It’s becoming a competitive advantage for enterprises that incorporate these fixes and solutions for the consumer, which led to a significant shift towards consolidation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, it creates an opportunity for forward-thinking organizations that offer a way to solve these issues for the consumer, more directly. This moves the identification industry from one that has focused on B2B or B2B2C designs, to one that can operate in B2C as well. This shift has homed in on taking current tools and technologies and presenting them more for the at-home customer rather than building specific tools unique to a consumer.</p> &nbsp;  Areas That Shifted In 2020 <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, Digital Identity continued to build on the shifts we have been charting since 2016. We’ve had the opportunity to measure the influence each segment has over its adjacent segments and refine our strategy offerings to more accurately predict trends. The result is a landscape with four new segments, mostly focused on cybersecurity, and a few consolidated segments, primarily centered in martech.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We often use our landscape framework to identify Golden Cog opportunities. These opportunities are extremely valuable as integrated partners because they are required to enable platform solutions. Golden Cogs can be found within the center of the framework (<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/2019-identity-landscape/">learn more about our Golden Cog Methodology here</a>). We used our framework and Golden Cog Methodology to correctly predict the expanded influence of Identity Proofing, Identity Resolution, and Mobile Identity as Golden Cog opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve consolidated the Identity Graphing and Identity Resolution segments into one unit, as a result of an increase in consumer demands. This played out with companies like <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/deal-book/friday-dealbook-11-20-2020/">Experian acquiring Tapad</a>. While we remain very bullish on the Identity Resolution market (they remain a Golden Cog Opportunity, after all), the bulk of companies didn’t make the appropriate shifts this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 also greatly impacted the landscape, as the world went from in-person to remote. Identity Proofing and Verification segments were the big winners on this front, shifting from enabling solutions within a stack, to becoming platform solutions of their own. &nbsp;Investors have supported this claim by buying into third-wave companies like Passbase, Persona, Berbix, and Veriff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the biggest movements this year occurred in the eSignature and Certs space, which shifted towards the Identity of Things solution segment. Certs, in particular, have an opportunity in the ID IoT platforms, which further prompted this move. Additionally, we saw an increase in the area of influence for Consent Management and Master Data Management platforms, splitting each of those out into their own segments, respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> Moving Through 2021 <p>&nbsp;</p><p>We expect to see many of these trends to continue through 2021. Expect consumer rights to expand, forcing companies to shift towards privacy-by-design, offering new opportunities for large B2C enterprises looking to enter the Digital Identity space. At the same time, Digital Identity companies will grow, merge, and acquire each other, forming integrated identity solutions instead of single point-solutions. To support this, private equity and strategic enterprises will continue investing in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’re only at the beginning of this journey. There’s a lot of work to do, but one thing remains clear: The opportunity for those who focus on building Digital Identity products and services remains enormous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> If you would like a briefing on the landscape or learn more about how to use it for your own growth strategy, we want to hear from you! <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/contact-us/">Click here to get in touch.</a>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Extending our continuous integration (CI) work, that you can read about in previous blogs (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/technical-announcements/identity-server-2020-1-now-available/" title="IDS 2020.1">IDS 2020.1</a> and <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/technical-announcements/ubisecure-identity-server-2020-2-is-now-available/" title="IDS 2020.2">IDS 2020.2</a>), we have added automated updating for our core components and third-party dependencies&nbsp;to remove known CVEs. Using an open-source universal dependency update tool combined with&nbsp;our continuous vulnerability scans, we are able to systematically and automatically make sure that the software is up-to-date and with as few vulnerabilities as possible.</p>
<p>Ubisecure Identity Server utilises a number of external components; Java, PostgreSQL, Tomcat, WildFly, amongst others. For example, within previous releases we have supported the use of PostgreSQL 9.6, used as a datastore for our Accounting Service and CustomerID portions of the Identity Platform. As PostgreSQL 9.6 is nearing its end of support, see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/" title="PostgreSQL Versioning">PostgreSQL Versioning</a>; we have updated our deployment testing to utilise PostgreSQL 12. For new installations, we now support using this long-term supported version of PostgreSQL. For existing installations, we will be testing and updating instructions to assist your move from 9.6 to 12.5 during the first half of 2021. The&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20211/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms" title="System recommendations and supported platforms">System recommendations and supported platforms</a>&nbsp;page has been updated to include new supported versions and which upgrade paths we have tested.</p>
<p>Ubisecure started the implementation of OpenID Connect in 2015 with Mobile Connect and has completed regular improvements each year to make sure that we are following the specifications laid out by the OpenID Foundation. In this development cycle we have started the self-certification for OpenID Connect Basic Profile. While we are compliant with all the common uses of OIDC, there are a few edge cases that need to be adjusted (response error codes, for example) to be fully compliant for self-certification of the OIDC basic test suite.&nbsp; We will be updating those minor deviations in the next release cycle. Similarly, the finalised specification for CIBA Core 1.0 has been reviewed during this development cycle and will require just a few modifications in the next release cycle. Completing the standard CIBA Core 1.0 specification will permit any developer to create their own CIBA integration to our Identity Platform.&nbsp;If you are considering utilising a Backchannel Authenticator please review the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html" title="CIBA specification">CIBA specification</a> to be ready to implement it later this year.</p>
 New in this release 
 Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for OAuth 2.0 
<p>One of the new features within this release is the support of Proof Key for Code Exchange (<a href="https://oauth.net/2/pkce/" title="PKCE">PKCE</a>). PKCE is an extension to the Authorisation code flow to prevent&nbsp;authorisation code interception attacks. Starting with SSO 8.7.0, the Identity Platform will check if a code_challenge and code_challenge_method is sent with the Authorisation Request and validate it against the code_verifier sent along the Token Request. The code_challenge_methods_supported&nbsp;are “plain” and “S256”. This initial implementation is supporting SSO as an OpenID Provider (OP), which means that if you already have a client using PKCE towards SSO, by updating to SSO 8.7.0 the previously ignored values will start to be validated. To enforce the use of PKCE by your clients see information about <a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20211/Client+configuration+reference+-+SSO" title="Client configuration reference – SSO">Client configuration reference – SSO</a>.</p>

 CustomerID REST API&nbsp;with SSO OAuth2 Access Tokens 
<p>With the latest version IDS 2021.1, Administrators of SSO are able to configure users or groups that have access to the CustomerID REST API. This will give you better security and an overview of who is using the APIs and when have they been used. Administrators of CustomerID are also able to disable the earlier used HTTP Basic authentication scheme (username and password) to ensure that the old way of calling the APIs is not used anymore. Moving forward in 2021, we will introduce access control (RBAC) to allow sharing access to CustomerID APIs, not only within your company, but to your customers and partners as well.</p>
 Lifecycle Management&nbsp; 
<p>We have focused on updating external components and third-party dependencies in our main components – SSO, CustomerID and Accounting. For example, the external components Tomcat and Wildfly have both been updated. Tomcat has been updated to 9.0.41 &nbsp;and&nbsp; Wildfly has been updated to 21.0.2.Final. Together with the third-party library updates, many identified CVE’s have been removed.&nbsp; Security is a never-ending process, so updating to this latest release of Identity Platform will help to secure your environment. A full list of updated dependencies can be found from <a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20211/3rd+party+licenses+-+SSO" title="SSO 3rd party licenses">SSO 3rd party licenses</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20211/3rd+party+licenses+-+CustomerID" title=" CustomerID 3rd party licenses"> CustomerID 3rd party licenses</a>.</p>

<p>Still misunderstood by many as a “victimless” crime, identity theft is often personally devastating, causing both economic and emotional suffering. It may take months or even years for the innocent to reclaim their lives—and the problem never fully goes away. Identity crimes have a lifelong impact, with one violation generating a domino effect throughout victims’ lives and on larger society as a whole.<br> <br> I recently sat down with Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, for the first episode of Ping’s podcast <a>Hello, User</a> to talk about the tremendous costs of identity theft. In “How Can Identity Theft Victims Be Made Whole Again?,” we discuss the perpetual nature of digital identity, the emotional and financial toll of identity theft on its victims, and the inconsistencies of cybersecurity approaches businesses use to protect their users from fraud. Here are the highlights of our conversation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Thursday, January 28th, 2021 InfoCert, and AUTHADA will meet a group of managers from some of the most important firms in the finance, insurance, utility, and automotive sectors in the DACH region in a virtual roundtable on Digital Identity.</p>



<p>The Digital Identity Virtual Roundtable offers an intimate online forum for finance and innovation leaders in the DACH region.</p>



<p>Since Covid-19 catapulted the entire economy several years forward in its evolution toward digital transformation, accelerating the digitization of processes enabling remote interactions is crucial to attract and retain customers.</p>



<p>In this context, securing digital transactions plays a key role in standing up to competition granting compliance and improving efficiency of processes.</p>



<p>Digital trust services can ensure that digital transactions are secure and legally binding, they guarantee compliance in archiving documents and improve overall efficiency, and digital identity is a fundamental step towards a truly efficient digital approach.</p>



  Why are digital trust services crucial to enable digital transformation?  Which type of digital trust services should organisations start with? Which business areas should be prioritised?  Why is digital identity a fundamental step in all digital transactions?  What are the current main innovations and value creation opportunities around digital identity services?

Our focus for 2021 at <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is to develop practical solutions for sectors with significant personal data challenges. One key sector is media, with a range of challenges including privacy, over-collection of data, transparency and personalisation.



We’re delighted to share that Meeco has been selected by <a href="https://mediamotoreurope.eu">MediaMotorEurope</a> to join their accelerator and mentorship programme to help solve some of the big challenges in today’s media world.




 









 What is MediaMotorEurope ? 




<a href="https://mediamotoreurope.eu/">MediaMotorEurope</a> is a 6 month accelerator programme for deep tech innovators designed to “build a strong European ecosystem fostering media and the creative industries.”




<blockquote>“MME aims to nurture high-potential European deeptech innovators, solving today’s most prominent media industry challenges and support them in building media solutions of tomorrow.”



<p></p></blockquote>




Approached and selected alongside <a href="https://mediamotoreurope.eu/startups/">20 other startups</a>, Meeco kicked off MediaMotorEurope on 21 January, 2021. The accelerator will provide an opportunity to showcase and expand Meeco’s capabilities into this important sector.




 What are the problems to solve? 




Media industry 4.0 is all about the marriage of physical and digital technologies. Key to success will be using digital technologies and data to prioritise innovation and turn innovation into customer value. Yet, lack of personal data and the erosion of people’s trust in organisations managing their data will hinder innovation in media content personalisation.




 




Meeco’s international award-winning, patented API platform is a global leader in the collection, protection and permission management of personal data. Meeco gives people and organisations the tools to access, control and create mutual value from personal data. This is the foundation to earn the trust required for media Industry 4.0 use cases.



As part of our MediaMotor collaboration, we’ll be pioneering two products:




 




1. Personal identity and payment wallet.




 




Meeco is at the forefront of developing and deploying decentralised identity and personal data wallets. We are on track to deploy a universal decentralised wallet that will both enable identity and micro-payments. This capability paves the way for the development of permission-based digital profiles, for advertising and product personalisation.



Meeco platform has a proven track record as a market leader at the forefront of personal data and identity management. Based on extensive experience developing proof-of-concepts, along with data regulation and changes to media consent, Meeco is well positioned to bring this capability to address the issues raised in the <a href="https://www.meeco.me/data">EU Data Strategy</a>, specifically calling for changes to how EU citizens data is accessed through social and media platforms.




 




2. KidTech 




 




We believe there’s a better way for better and safer way for digital development in the KidTech space. We want to validate the need for digital tools that foster well-being, designed for accessibility and a more inclusive society.



Children should have the freedom to participate in the digital world without tracking, ads, targeting, algorithmic manipulation and data mining. Some of the solutions we’ve developed focus on age verification, role-based access management, including parental controls, media and consent management.



One example at the forefront of this innovation is <a href="https://miks-it.com/">mIKs-it</a>, the safe multimedia app for kids the app we’re co-developing with <a href="https://heder.be/">Heder VZW</a>.




 




We’re looking forward to working with media partners involved in MediaMotorEurope to integrate our products as part of new ways to build ‘data trust’ with audiences.

 Messaging 
<p>Through the Messaging feature that can be utilised via T-REX Servicing, Issuers/Agents and Investors can establish a direct channel of communication.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in January 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>In capital markets, there can often be many intermediaries between Issuers and Investors. Brokers, Advisors, Custodians, CSDs or other counterparties sit between the Issuer and Investor, all of which operate on their own systems. Due to this, direct communication between the Issuer (or their delegated Agents) and their Investors is often difficult and indirect. Generally, the Issuer and their Agent(s) are unable to directly and quickly communicate with Investors and vice versa.</p>
<p>Through the Messaging feature that can be utilised via T-REX Servicing, Issuers/Agents and Investors can establish a direct channel of communication. Issuers can bring efficiency and ease to their Investor relations and operational interactions, for example in relation to corporate events, announcements, company results and other communications.</p>
<p>Our Messaging feature is integrated into the T-REX Servicing dashboard and offers:</p>
<p>Issuers and their Agent(s) to:</p>
 
 Instantly send or schedule messages to a single or group of Investors based on a number of properties, including their position status, Investor status (professional or retail), their country of residence and so on 
 Utilise conventional communication features such as message attachments, archive, forwarding, save messages etc 
 
<p>Investors to:</p>
 
 Directly receive investment information from the source, i.e. from Issuers and their Agents 
 View and respond to messages received from Issuers and Agents directly from their T-REX Servicing Dashboard 
 
<p>The utilisation of this shared infrastructure can act as a communication channel to re-establish, at scale, a direct relationship between Issuers and Investors. This communication channel is functional across the token’s lifecycle, from the initial issuance to its maturity.</p>

<p>CoinGape: Treecoin is developed on the Ardor blockchain, which is operated by Jelurida, a Swiss-based software development firm. Ardor is becoming something of a focal point for sustainability initiatives, having been selected as the platform of choice by Hot City, a project funded by the Austrian government to reward citizens for contributing to an effort in recycling waste heat sources. It also hosts Cycle4Value, an application that incentivizes cyclists to get out on their bikes and reduce the environmental impact of traveling. Unlike many public blockchain platforms that require extensive programming knowledge to launch an application, Jelurida offers a suite of out-of-the-box tools that make it easy for non-blockchain professionals to get up and running. For this reason, it appears to be making a name for itself among projects that are focused on delivering outcomes based on specific proven use cases, such as gamification and crowdfunding. In the case of Treecoin, it’s easy to see how these concepts can be applied to sustainability initiatives. After all, people respond well to incentives. The idea of earning a profit from investing in a reforestation project will be attractive to many investors who want to put their money where it makes a difference. </p>

<p>This was the first of our third-Thursday-of-the-month "Demo Days" that we'll be holding from now on. The Fission team takes this time to talk about new releases &amp; product updates, early demos of in-progress work, planned roadmap items and open Q&amp;A. We also invite the community to come and give app demos.</p> Meet the Team <p>We were joined by three new people this month. Philipp in 🇩🇪 Germany, Brian in 🇺🇸 Oregon, United States, and Helder in 🇧🇷 Brazil.</p><p>Philipp is working on the Account Dashboard, on both the Elm app and additional features in the Fission Haskell server.</p><p>Brian is working on the Filecoin Grant Project, and will be building the Backup App in Svelte.</p><p>Helder is working on a proof-of-concept around Headless Ghost, and will be moving on to assist with implementation of Fission's new home page, which will be using our current Ghost blog that you're reading this on.</p> Fission Product Updates &amp; Demos   Account Dashboard by <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/matheus23">@matheus23</a>: this is the account dashboard for Fission platform services. Everyone will manage their account basics there, but also security around device linking management, account recovery setup, and more. Developers will manage the apps that they publish on the platform. Built in Elm as all of our 1st party apps are, you can find it on github: <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/dashboard">https://github.com/fission-suite/dashboard</a>  App Generator by <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/bgins">@bgins</a>: a tool to help you create manifest files and other settings for Progressive Web Apps (PWA). Built in Elm, find it on github: <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/pwa-generator">https://github.com/fission-suite/pwa-generator</a>  Fission Github Publish Action by <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/walkah">@walkah</a>: For git-based-workflows and teams, add this to your code repo on Github to automatically publish to Fission. Consider it in alpha (we haven't made an official release yet), James will be writing more about it, but it is live and works today on github: <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/publish-action">https://github.com/fission-suite/publish-action</a>   Roadmap Items   CLI Linking: coming soon, developer account linking on your desktop.  <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/account-recovery/1432">Account Recovery</a>: we're working on an account recovery flow. With password-less logins tied to your devices and encryption, we need to design it in such a way that Fission can help you recover your private files, without having access to those files ourselves. We'll be sharing blog posts, flows, and security &amp; cryptography considerations as we roll this out.  <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/customized-login-branding/1431">Customized Login</a>: Make a custom branded sign-in experience without having to write your own login code. Include design, logo, and custom text as part of the authorization lobby. This will likely be our first premium paid developer feature.  <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-ghost-on-fission/1407">Headless Ghost</a>: this blog runs on Ghost. We're planning on re-doing the home page and integrating in the blog more directly in a "Headless" style. We'll be sharing open source code starter kits so anyone can build this.  Headless WordPress: many of the server-focused systems like Ghost and WordPress are seeing interest in "headless" mode: keep the editing interface, but have a static, serverless front end. We've got a mini project with a live customer, and we'll be using that as a test case and document and share how anyone can do this.   Community Demo<br> <p>Rosano, who <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/rosano-zero-data-apps-remote-storage/">joined us for a great discussion back on January 14th</a>, came back to do a demo and walk through of his <a href="https://hyperdraft.rosano.ca/">HyperDraft notes app</a>.</p> Video  Join us next time <p>We're experimenting with <a href="https://lu.ma">Luma</a> for registering for events.

Firstly, because we have the technology at our disposal, but most importantly because there’s a big problem that needs to be solved: passwords – the cause of the vast majority of data breaches today. This is why today pioneering organisations are using biometrics to identify people in the most convenient ways. However, the biometrics we have seen in the movies actually are not the best for today’s internet services. In this blog, I will explore a novel approach that has emerged in recent years: finger vein biometrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is finger vein biometrics? 
<p>Finger vein biometrics identifies a user based on the vein patterns in their fingers, which are unique to every person. It is also known as vascular biometrics, as the identifiable information is from the blood vessels beneath your skin. The magic behind it is that the haemoglobin — the iron-containing protein we all have in our blood — changes colour when it is exposed to near-infrared light or visible light. As a result, the reader can scan the user’s unique pattern of veins. The vein pattern is digitised, encrypted and securely stored on server side.</p>
<p>In this blog I’m using Hitachi’s finger vein biometrics solution (<a href="https://digitalsecurity.hitachi.eu/products/veinid-five/" title="VeinID Five">VeinID Five</a>) as the benchmark, since its technology uses a standard phone/laptop webcam as opposed to needing any specialised physical hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How does finger vein biometrics work in practice? 
<p>While all this sounds amazing, how does it work for a real person in a real situation? Let’s say Sarah wants to make a money transfer online. As with all biometrics, the first step is enrolment, which consists of reading your hand and storing that encoded information in a database (server side). I’ll point out here that your finger vein pattern is never stored – only a mathematical representation of it. From then on, Sarah will just wave her hand in front of a webcam to authenticate to the internet service and complete the money transfer. Simple and secure.</p>
 <p>Source: Hitachi Digital Security</p> 
<p>Finger vein biometrics has been in use for more than a decade for access control systems (people entering a building) and at ATMs (people withdrawing money), though in both cases by using a near-infrared reader device. When the world became as connected as it is today, finger vein biometrics proved its versatility and brought all its power to identify people on internet services.</p>
<p>Internet services can use finger vein biometrics either as the main authentication method or as a second factor method (multi-factor authentication/MFA). An example of MFA would be a user signing in with a password or social media login (first factor), but also needing to complete finger vein authentication (second factor) in order to gain access, increasing security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Main benefits of finger vein biometrics 
<p>For benefits of biometrics in general, see this blog: <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/biometric-authentication-business-benefits/" title="Biometric authentication: 5 business benefits">Biometric authentication: 5 business benefits</a>. Finger vein biometrics also has numerous further benefits; these are the ones that I consider to be the top five:</p>
 
 No special hardware required. (Again – specific to Hitachi VeinID Five.) The 720p camera you have in almost every smartphone or laptop is sufficient to read your vein patterns, saving a lot of money for people and organisations compared to requiring any specialised reader hardware. 
 Finger vein patterns are perennial. Finger vein patterns remain the same for many years; they don’t usually change. As a result, users don’t need to re-enrol down the line. 
 Personal data is never stored. In these times of many data breaches and cybercrimes, it is critical that personal data is well protected. Finger vein biometrics handles only a mathematical representation of the personal data (finger vein pattern). This information is securely transmitted to the identity repository (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/customer-iam/" title="CIAM">CIAM</a> system) and stored encrypted. No data is stored on the device, so if the device is stolen your biometrics are safe. 
 Unlikely to be forged. As the captured image of the finger veins is never stored, nobody can steal, copy and forge your unique pattern to impersonate you. This is very different to a password, which can easily be guessed/stolen. 
 No physical contact needed. Unlike fingerprint biometrics, there’s no need to touch any surface. Authentication is complete with a ‘wave’ to the camera. Finger vein biometrics is a hygienic method for today’s Covid and the post-Covid world. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Finger vein biometrics vs. fingerprint biometrics 
<p>So how different is finger vein biometrics to fingerprint biometrics? You might be thinking, my smartphone or laptop already has a fingerprint reader, and a few mobile apps already use it to authenticate me; isn’t the problem already solved?</p>
<p>Certainly, fingerprint authentication is already available both in mid-range smartphones and in high-end laptops. But although fingerprint biometrics also reads biological traits of our fingers, the method is much less reliable. Let us analyse this from three perspectives:</p>
 
 Fingerprint biometrics is controlled by the device manufacturer (e.g. Apple, Lenovo, Samsung) and not by the application or the authentication service. Applications have to trust whatever the phone or laptop sends as the authentication response. The company or organisation that owns the application does not have any control of the reliability of the verification. Contrastingly, finger vein biometrics are tied to an individual and not a device (and therefore can be used across multiple devices). 
 Built-in phone biometrics were designed for convenience, not for strong security. The accuracy of biometrics methods can be measured and fingerprint recognition shows a high false rejection rate (FRR) and low false acceptance rate (FAR). In contrast, finger vein biometrics has both a superior FRR and FAR. 
 Fingerprints can be forged – easily copied and later used to impersonate an individual. When a person touches a surface, their fingerprint is often left behind and criminals can copy it in order to steal the person’s identity. These leaks are not possible with finger veins, which again makes the duplication risk (and therefore unauthorised service access) extremely low. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Finger vein biometrics use cases 
<p>As of 2021, many internet services still lack a secure and convenient way of identifying users. The market needs a solution like this. Nearly every person now has a mobile phone with 720p camera (or better!). That’s a massive advantage for finger vein biometrics.</p>
<p>Finger vein biometrics is a formidable authentication method. However, its full power is unleashed when combined with Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). Let’s review three of these real-life scenarios.</p>
 Use case 1: Confirm a payment 
<p>A lot of financial services now have mobile apps. With many, you can open an app on your phone and quickly authenticate yourself by means of a password, or with your social media login. This is convenient to quickly check your account balance, or check if a refund has been credited etc. However, if you’re going to complete a higher-risk transaction – e.g. transfer money or make a big payment – you want to make sure that this is secure. Such a transaction requires stronger authentication than your password or social media login, so you can ‘step up’ the authentication to require finger vein biometric authentication at this point only. This reduces friction for simple tasks, while better securing high risk tasks.</p>
 Use case 2: &nbsp;Identity delegation 
<p>In this scenario, an administrator user gives power (delegate authority and access/rights) to another user to accomplish a task or take over a role. But before the second user takes this power, they have to prove their identity using strong authentication. This is where finger vein authentication comes into play. A remote employee receives an invitation to take the role of ‘purchasing assistant’ in an e-commerce service. They will first use finger vein biometrics to enrol in the system, then in the future they will complete purchases (according to the level of rights delegated to their identity) by holding their hand up to the camera and authenticating with finger vein authentication.</p>
<p>See a similar delegation with finger vein biometrics in action <a href="https://youtu.be/ZwqrujqAY6g?t=1193" title="here">here</a>.</p>
 Use case 3: Single Sign-On (SSO) 
<p>Today it is very rare that an organisation has just one internet service. The opposite is commonplace: many web services and mobile applications from one organisation. Using single sign-on with finger vein biometrics would allow users to seamlessly use SSO to easily switch between a financial planning application, an e-commerce site and another application without a new login. They don’t need a different set of credentials for each service. SSO is particularly powerful for financial services as it allows customers to be strongly authenticated and ready to access several services with one authentication.</p>
<p>See SSO with finger vein biometrics in action <a href="https://youtu.be/t6O2X31SU3g?t=326" title="here">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Try finger vein biometrics for yourself 
<p>Overall, finger vein biometrics is a reliable and convenient authentication method for internet services that beats fingerprint biometrics and other authentication methods.</p>
<p>The ubiquity of cameras on smartphones, tablets and laptops makes finger vein biometrics a solution that can be leveraged by any kind of service, for a wide range of users. Combine it with Customer IAM and you can see solid use cases that allow you to get the most benefits from this solution.</p>

 MYKEY Weekly Report 35 (January 18th~January 24th) <p>Today is Monday, January 25, 2021. The following is the 35th issue of MYKEY Weekly Report. In the work of last week (January 18th to January 24th), there is nothing to update last week and we list several tips on understanding MYKEY for your study and reference.</p><p>1. The recovery phrase is the highest permission of the MYKEY account, which is composed of 12 Chinese or English words. You can manage the account by the recovery&nbsp;phrase.</p><p>2. The password needs to be set to operate the regular business of MYKEY, such as transferring, operating dapps, turning on fingerprint payment, syncing the device, and changing the password when users first enable the blockchain feature, which is 8–20 digits with any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and&nbsp;symbols.</p><p>3. The emergency contacts are the security guardians of users’ MYKEY accounts. Emergency contacts are required when users lose their recovery phrases or need the security operation of accounts to take effect instantly. Especially when the recovery phrases are obtained by the others, if users have emergency contacts at this time, they can immediately replace the recovery phrases and the accounts will be&nbsp;secure.</p><p>4. The network fee is a billing unit in MYKEY. When transferring, using applications, or managing accounts, as long as transactions are sent to the blockchain, fees will be calculated and deducted from users’ network fee balance. The network fee consumption is subject to the actual cost of the blockchain.</p><p>!!! If you encounter any abnormal situation while using MYKEY, remember not to uninstall MYKEY APP, please contact MYKEY Assistant: @mykeytothemoon in Telegram.</p><p>!!! Remember to keep the 12-digit recovery phrase properly from [Me] — [Manage Account] — [Export Recovery Phrase] in MYKEY even if your account is not real-named.</p><p>About Us</p><p>KEY GROUP: <a href="http://keygroup.me/">https://keygroup.me/</a></p><p>MYKEY Web: <a href="http://mykey.org/">https://mykey.org/</a></p><p>BIHU: <a href="http://bihu.com/">https://bihu.com/people/1133973</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="http://t.me/mykey_lab">https://t.me/mykey_lab</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href="http://twitter.com/mykey_lab"> https://twitter.com/mykey_lab</a></p><p>Medium: <a href="http://medium.com/mykey-lab">https://medium.com/mykey-lab</a></p><p>Github: <a href="http://github.com/mykeylab">https://github.com/mykeylab</a></p><p>Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKpkcMxDMZL-OAVfQPodqgg">MYKEY Laboratory</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/35-mykey-weekly-report-january-18th-january-24th-5142c5ee4d01">35 MYKEY Weekly Report (January 18th~January 24th)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab">MYKEY Lab</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is proud to announce our support for a coalition of leading Europe-based technology companies, research institutions and not-for-profit organisations, joining forces to enable a more equitable digital economy.




 




Together, in January 2021 <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org/2021/01/21/new-coalition-launches-campaign-for-data-sovereignty-now/">we announced the launch of Data Sovereignty Now (DSN)</a>, a campaign that will press European policy makers at all levels to ensure that the control of data remains in the hands of the people and organisations that generate it.




 




The issue becomes ever more urgent as policies around Europe’s digital economy and data architecture start to solidify.




 




Together we are urging policy makers to align these capabilities to the European Union Data Strategy.




 




As a group we will work together to provide use-cases, examples, tools, reports and educational content to support this initiative. One such example is the Data Sharing Journal video series from <a href="https://www.innopay.com/en">INNOPAY</a>.





INNOPAY Data Sharing Journal : Data Sovereignty






 




Recently, INNOPAY’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianeterveen/">Mariane ter Veen</a> invited Meeco’s founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a>, to record an <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org/2021/01/18/when-you-invent-the-ship-you-invent-the-shipwreck/">episode of The Data Sharing Journal</a> discussing data sovereignty and soft infrastructure. This is a practical example of content aimed at raising awareness and deepening understanding of the benefits of a more trusted and transparent digital economy.

			 2021: Digital Assets Become Officially Accepted by Financial Institutions 
<p>Happy New Year and welcome to 2021’s first edition of Tokeny Insights. This time last year I wrote the <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-insights-january-2020-the-rise-of-defi/">newsletter</a> stating that Decentralized Finance (DeFi) would make big advancements. Since then, the DeFi industry has grown over 2500% in terms of value locked up in smart contracts. So, what for 2021?</p>
<p>2021 will be the year institutions officially and publicly embrace digital assets. Large corporations have already been doing so with crypto-assets. FinTechs such as Paypal and Square have adopted Bitcoin for their millions of users, institutions such as Microstrategy and Ruffer have announced over nearly $2bn in combined Bitcoin purchases. OTC trading firms have reported more institutions continuing to buy Bitcoin. There have been a string of optimistic predictions from the likes of JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, perhaps giving insight into their crypto positions.</p>
<p>These major capital market players are being encouraged by progressive regulation. Following Visa’s announcement that they were backing a major stablecoin, the US regulator announced that banks and saving associations can use public blockchains and stablecoins for settlement, a major milestone for the North American and global market. Luxembourg, which holds the most amount of funds in terms of value outside of the US, will also make a progressive announcement shortly. The market will continue to be educated this year and compounded by a large portion of FOMO from financial players, there will be further public blockchain adoption this year.</p>
<p>What does this mean for security tokens? Our industry will benefit from the increased adoption and reputation gain of digital assets. As crypto-assets get closer to becoming mainstream and accepted financial products, financial players will move their assets to the blockchain. Institutional grade custody solutions are therefore required. So far, the only custody solutions available have been made for crypto-assets, and in 2021 we expect to see some secure custody solutions for blockchain-based securities. Developments will be seen across the lifecycle and particularly the secondary market: they will realise the improved transferability of private securities.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>There are many ways to verify online Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment details for transfers. Voided checks, micro deposits, pre-validations and account scores all validate ACH account payment details in one form or another. They also take more time than is necessary and typically can only verify something rather than adding key data to what the consumer has provided.</p>
<p>This is where open banking and open banking platforms make verifying account details and speeding up the ACH payment process simpler for everyone. Consumer-permissioned data pulled straight from bank accounts makes verifying accounts simple. It can also provide account details like account owner or balances that make facilitating payments easier and less risky for both sides of the transaction.</p>
<p>Finicity’s open banking platform provides a complete suite of data services with <a href="http://finicity.com/pay">Finicity Pay</a>&nbsp;to verify essential account details, owners, and balances that are needed to charge, get paid, or set up an account with confidence. <a href="http://finicity.com/pay">Finicity Pay</a> enables payments and validates funding sources. You can also seamlessly verify loan account details, including student loans, to detect eligibility for refinancing, loan consolidation, or to support employer student loan repayment and other benefit programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that <a href="http://finicity.com/pay">Finicity Pay</a> both satisfies <a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits">Nacha’s WEB Debit Rule</a> but also speeds up the ACH payment validation process and enhances fraud protection. Finicity is a <a href="http://www.nacha.org/Preferred-Partner">Nacha Preferred Partner</a>, recognized for offering products and services that align with Nacha’s core strategies to advance the ACH Network.</p>
<p>Finicity’s instant verification solution takes advantage of Finicity’s open banking platform to use API connections to the many financial institutions in the US and Canada. Consumers permission the use of their account details which are then used for approved ACH payments, account creation or other permissible uses. The consumer can complete the verification process in minutes rather than waiting hours or days as in other solutions. Meaning their ACH transfer can process more quickly or they can get funds right into their new account.</p>
<p>Other ACH validation solutions either don’t provide the option for as much key data, only factor in account and routing number, or take much longer, up to a week in some cases. You may remember the days when you needed to provide a voided check to set up direct deposit transactions. Or to set up online accounts that are connected to your existing checking account you had to respond with how much was deposited into that checking account. There’s also pre-validating by providing information that is verified before the ACH transfer happens, which can take up to a week. Those days are over, thanks to <a href="http://finicity.com/pay">Finicity Pay</a>.</p>
<p>Some digital solutions are available but are limited either by what they provide, a score or likely probability that the account is good or has funds enough to cover the transaction, or only cover certain segments of the industry, as in providing details for accounts from certain FIs but not the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Finicity’s instant verification can not only validate account details but can also provide account owner and account balance details to further mitigate risk and make ACH transfers easier.</p>

<p>Reality has just caught up with us. The new COVID-19 variants (there seems to be a new one every week since the beginning of the year) is spreading around the world at a worrisome pace. Most western countries are back to strict restrictions with potential new confinements looming before Spring. The vaccination campaign is extremely slow. The Biden Administration just revealed on day two that it inherited a nonexistent coronavirus vaccine distribution plan and that it must now start from scratch. Concretely, what it means is that employees will continue to work from home and there is no end in sight for the near future. Also, the FBI recently reported that the number of complaints about cyberattacks to their Cyber Division is up to as many as 4,000 a day. That represents a 400% increase from what they were seeing pre-coronavirus. The targets: corporations of all sizes, governments, and critical infrastructures.</p>

 Verus is a UTXO-based cryptocurrency with DeFi in its consensus protocol. In this first vBasics-series, we explain what liquidity pools, automated market makers and fractional currencies are, and how they function in the Verus ecosystem. <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/building-the-foundations-for-a-paradigm-shift-3146a3adb56e">Verus is a foundational blockchain that builds key primitives at the consensus level of the protocol</a>. DeFi is one of those key primitives, and quite difficult to wrap our heads around. Especially as the words we use can be confusing. This is new technology so we make it up as we go. DeFi systems we know use words like ‘automated market makers’ and ‘liquidity pools’. Verus adds ‘fractional currency’ to the terminology.</p><p>In a DeFi system there are no people you buy or sell your currency to. You only interact with a pool of liquidity. Inside this pool of liquidity can be many different currencies, small or large amounts. The liquidity pool is attached to a currency. The currency that is attached to the liquidity pool has a value that is determined by what is in the liquidity pool (image&nbsp;1).</p><p>Important note: in the Verus ecosystem, all currencies with liquidity pools have adaptive supplies.</p>Image 1: In Verus DeFi a currency can have a pool of liquidity attached to&nbsp;it<p>Let’s start by explaining currencies that are backed by 100% (see image 2). In our example we have NewCurrency. This currency is backed by 100% and has VRSC and ETH in its liquidity pool&nbsp;(A).</p><p>In a currency that is 100% backed, the value is always equally divided by the number of currencies in the liquidity pool. NewCurrency has 1000 VRSC and 2 ETH in its liquidity pool. And even though they are different values, and they have different values outside the Verus ecosystem, they still represent 50/50% of the value&nbsp;(B).</p><p>Let’s say the currencies in the liquidity pool of NewCurrency have a value of both $500. Consequently, the value of 1 NewCurrency is $1000&nbsp;(C).</p>Image 2: How the value of a Verus DeFi currency is&nbsp;composed<p>So, depending on what is in the liquidity pool of NewCurrency, the price of the currency fluctuates. Here comes the term ‘automated market maker’ in play. No person sets the price of the currency, it is fully automated. Anyone at any time can interact with this currency because there is always a value, and always liquidity. Which means it is an always ‘on’ market maker. A fully automated market&nbsp;maker.</p><p>You might ask yourself: why is there always liquidity? This is because a liquidity pool can never be really empty. One can always add or take out VRSC and ETH. When a balance tips too much to one side, there is opportunity to arbitrage and make money. There is always something to trade&nbsp;against.</p><p>Now why would someone want to convert their VRSC or ETH to NewCurrency? This is a portfolio management choice. NewCurrency acts as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/constant-mix-buy-hold.asp">constant-mix strategy</a>. You are exposed to two different currencies, while holding only one. By holding NewCurrency you also earn fees from people converting, more on this&nbsp;later.</p><p>A Verus DeFi currency that is backed by 100% can have many more currencies than just two in its liquidity pool. All kinds of combinations are possible (image&nbsp;3).</p>Image 3: A currency backed by 100% can have many different currencies in its liquidity pool<p>In the Verus ecosystem we call a currency that has a pool of liquidity attached to it a ‘fractional currency’. The currencies that are in the pool of liquidity we call ‘reserve currencies’, see image&nbsp;4.</p>Image 4: Verus DeFi terminology<p>To make it a bit more complicated, let us explain why we call these currencies ‘fractional currencies’. In our example before (image 2) we showed a fractional currency that derives its value 100% from the reserve currencies: it is backed 100%. In the Verus ecosystem, we can have fractional currencies that are partially, fractionally, backed by a number between 5 and 95%, see image&nbsp;5.</p>Image 5: Two examples of fractional currencies that are partially backed by its&nbsp;reserves<p>How one creates 100% backed or partially backed fractional currencies differs. A user can create a currency and define that the currency is 100% backed. A user can not define the fraction between 5 and 95%. The number of backing by a fractional currency is dependent upon market forces before the currency is launched.</p><p>One can ask, what is the consequence that a currency is backed by 10, 50, 80 or 100%? The difference is the curve of price vs supply. And remember, the fractional currencies have adaptive supplies. See image 6 for a simplified illustration.</p>Image 6: Different backing percentage means different price vs supply&nbsp;curve Converting From Reserve to&nbsp;Reserve <p>We have explained how one can always convert to a fractional currency with its reserve currencies. Or back to a reserve currency with the fractional currency. In the Verus ecosystem there is another way to convert currencies.</p><p>We call this converting through the fractional currency. One doesn’t acquire the fractional currency, but converts through the fractional currency to a reserve currency. To simplify: one converts one reserve currency to another reserve currency. See image 7 for the different conversion possibilities within our NewCurrency example. Remember that all the currencies (fractional &amp; reserves) have a value relative to each&nbsp;other.</p>Image 7: Possibility to convert in every direction<p>For example, if one owns VRSC, they can convert it to ETH through NewCurrency. In the Verus DeFi ecosystem, if one wants to convert VRSC to ETH, the protocol searches through all the fractional currencies with both VRSC and ETH in its reserves, presenting you the best price for conversion (image&nbsp;8).</p>Image 8: The protocol searches through all fractional currencies to present the best conversion price<p>There is always a value, and always liquidity attached to the fractional and reserve currencies. It will always be possible to obtain a fractional currency, or convert to a reserve currency with any of the many fractional AND reserve currencies that will be available in the Verus ecosystem.</p><p>Important note: all fractional currencies on the Verus blockchain must have VRSC as one of its reserves.</p> Earning Fees <p>Like we discussed earlier, holding a fractional currency is besides a portfolio/investment strategy, an opportunity to earn&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Let's say one holds NewCurrency from image 2. Every time a user converts VRSC to ETH, or ETH to VRSC, 0.025% of the transaction in VRSC stays in the NewCurrency reserve. This means that the total value of NewCurrency goes up which is beneficial for the&nbsp;holder.</p> Join the Revolution <p>What makes Verus unique compared to its competitor Ethereum, is that in Verus all blocks are solved simultaneously. Front-running will not be possible. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-superior-defi-for-community-driven-liquidity-e2592b251146">Read more in-depth information on the differences between Verus and Ethereum&nbsp;DeFi.</a></p><p>A giant system of liquidity will emerge, with value flowing in every other direction. Many times the value of the currencies in the Verus ecosystem will not be aligned with the same currencies outside of the ecosystem. Many arbitrage opportunities will arise which means more value flowing into the&nbsp;system.</p> Essentials   <a href="http://www.verus.io">Verus Website</a>  <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop-wallet">Get Verus&nbsp;Desktop</a>  <a href="https://verus.io/mining-and-staking">Mining Software &amp;&nbsp;Pools</a>  <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin">GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://explorer.verus.io">Block Explorer</a>  <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/veruscoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/verus-coin">CoinGecko</a>, <a href="https://coinpaprika.com/coin/vrsc-verus-coin/">CoinPaprika</a>   Join the Verus Community   <a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Official Twitter</a>  <a href="https://discord.gg/VRKMP2S">Discord</a>  <a href="https://t.me/VerusCommunity">Community Telegram</a>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VerusCoin">Facebook</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Medium</a>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VerusCoin/">Reddit</a>  <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4070404.0">BitcoinTalk</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/vbasics-verus-defi-118da0b13f35">vBasics: Verus DeFi</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that top apparel companies have been accused of unethical practices over the years. From poor working conditions, to forced labour, child labour, and minuscule pay, apparel companies have set the bar for ethical practices extremely low. You may remember in 2013 when the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-april-26-2019-1.5111980/6-years-after-rana-plaza-collapse-many-fashion-giants-still-unwilling-to-make-changes-says-industry-expert-1.5111984">Rana Plaza garment factory collapsed</a>, killing over 1,000 workers and injuring 2,500 more. Consumers and organizations around the world were appalled by the news, but many apparel companies continue these poor practices today. In addition to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccasuhrawardi/2019/01/16/the-big-issues-facing-fashion-in-2019/?sh=2ff8a21123a9">the human toll</a>, we need to examine the negative environmental impact of the apparel industry. Toxic chemicals, massive water usage and material waste are byproducts of the rise of “fast fashion”.</p><p>Thankfully, things are changing! As consumers demand accountability from the brands they love, apparel companies are working to clean up their practices. A <a href="https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/73-percent-of-millennials-are-willing-to-spend-more-money-on-this-1-type-of-product.html">Nielsen poll </a>found that 73% of millennial consumers are “willing to pay more for sustainable goods.” And a <a href="https://www.reutersevents.com/sustainability/not-so-fast-millennials-press-fashion-brands-greater-transparency">Reuters article</a> found that consumers are demanding greater transparency, which we believe is a step in the right direction. Nonprofits are also advocating for more ethical practices across the industry. The <a href="https://textileexchange.org">Textile Exchange</a> “focuses on minimizing the harmful impacts of the global textile industry and maximizing its positive effects.” They have created a community that is taking collective action to change the way the textile industry works, for the&nbsp;better.</p><p>As consumer pressure mounts, brands are looking for ways to show how they practice responsible sourcing and mitigate their negative environmental impact. These companies can, and should, be using responsible sourcing to differentiate their products.

 Safiya Noble, author of Algorithms of Oppression, on Big Tech and Government misuse of data and how it affects&nbsp;users <p>In the tenth episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we had a conversation with Dr. Safiya Umoja Noble, Author of Algorithms of Oppression and Associate Professor at the <a href="https://is.gseis.ucla.edu/">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the Department of Information Studies</a>. During this discussion, she spoke about how search engines like Google reinforce discrimination, the role of government regulations in protecting data, and why big corporates are now talking about data protection rights. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p><p>“Here we are, in 2021, and the concerns that I wrote about and I’ve documented in the book are still just as timely as they were, seven to eight years ago. It is an interesting experience to write something that remains timely because the problems have become more acute each year, ” says Noble as she talks about her book Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism published in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>Noble says that Web 1.0, the early web knowledge, was mostly managed by subject matter experts, librarians, and deeply knowledgeable people. If anyone remembers the days of being on the internet before a search engine, it was clunkier. It required time and energy to look through and discern what was legitimate and what wasn’t. “I think with the legacy of that early history of knowledge organization on the web — search engines inherited the trust from those early experts who were doing that kind of work. The assumption for a lot of people is that somebody is curating the expert knowledge here. They will that experts have decided what should be ranked first and what should be ranked at a millionth place,” says Noble. However, this is not the&nbsp;case.</p> How Search Engines manipulate Users <p>Noble mentions that plenty of research shows that exposure to racial stereotypes will affect how people see marginalized groups. So if you live in a society where there is a lot of blatant, racist stereotyping, people will become desensitized to the groups that are being stereotyped. And those groups will be subject to not only dehumanizing images and ideas, but they will also be subject to more harm because the public is desensitized to their humanity.</p><p>“Google is an advertising platform; people think that it’s a fact-checker. People turn to Google to fact-check things that they find in social media that might be off. And then use Google as an authoritative yes or no. Google is also rife with racist disinformation and propaganda, sexist propaganda. That is incredibly unhelpful and I think increasingly has consequences in the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>The public’s awareness of stereotypes is a reason why, particularly in film and television, we have seen a widespread reduction of racist and sexist tropes in media. This has been coupled with the positive representation of women, minorities, and LGBTQ&nbsp;people.</p> How Big Tech responds to Criticism <p>Noble feels that authors and journalists who write about large internet companies are opening a ticket. In a way, you get a signal that someone needs to attend to this problem and solve it and close the&nbsp;ticket.</p><p>“I think of my book like a giant book of tickets that Google was able to take. I certainly noticed that they attended to many of the concerns that I both document in that book — but also that many of my colleagues, journalists, and scholars have put out there. One thing we know is that even though the leadership and founders of Google will say that they don’t do anything to affect the search results, we know that they absolutely do. And the deeper the public relations fiasco or, the hotter the temperature is for them, the more likely they are to change the results. One of the things that I encourage people to do is to look at what the criticisms have been over the last ten years and whether those problems remain. That will tell you a lot about the dynamic way in which the company is constantly shifting search results, based on a political environment or based on criticism — or based on who’s paying the&nbsp;most.”</p> Government Regulation to Protect Data: the ultimate solution? <p>Noble notes that many of the US companies have been funded and heavily supported by the US government. This includes companies that are household names such as Google and Facebook. Then there are other lesser understood companies by the public, like Palantir or other surveillance technology companies.</p><p>“When you talk about a regulatory environment, one of the challenges is that legislative governments, especially the United States, have a unique relationship to many companies in the tech sector as they can access hundreds of millions of Americans’ data and information. They have an open backdoor and can come in with law enforcement and other kinds of agencies and find out all kinds of information about&nbsp;people.”</p><p>There’s a tremendous amount of effort by governments to think about regulating the use of AI. Regulation is complicated because those governments are also deeply invested in using AI. Noble feels that civil and human rights framings and laws are very important. One of the places we will have an incredible amount of power in various publics is through civil and human rights and sovereign rights, laws, and legal protections. In some cases, the damages that have to be paid by companies to the public and to individuals, repair, and restoration that must be made for. For example, the tech sector’s role in collapsing many important social institutions, public institutions, just by virtue of not paying taxes or offshoring profits.</p><p>“You can have an infinite number of data profiles that might exist about us in any given system at any given moment with 1000s of companies. This becomes a really difficult thing to regulate. How do you call back all that data? Is it even possible? I feel like it’s a bit of smoke and mirrors here to satisfy public outrage about the way these systems are tracking and profiling us and over-determining our futures in many cases? They’re creating predictions about us, whether we should go to jail, stay in jail; whether we should get health care or not; whether we should get into college or university; whether we should get a job. This is where predictive analytics are being used on information about&nbsp;us.”</p> The Future of Decentralization <p>According to Safiya, the majority of the world is not in a position to have the luxury of thinking about a technical redesign. But these technologies will continue to get beta tested and practiced out on&nbsp;us.</p><p>“I think what we are seeing is more technology, more data than ever in human history. And we have more global inequality, economic and social inequality to go with it. The question is, to what degree are these [decentralized] technologies going to be used in undoing inequality? To what degree will these technologies be able to redistribute wealth and the largest of the kind of collective productivity of humankind?”</p><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>0:58 — 7:15: Safiya Noble’s journey from the world of advertising tech to now research on Search Engines, Big Tech and Algorithms</p><p>7:15 — 13:11: How do algorithms become Algorithms of Oppression</p><p>12:26 — 18:20: How do Search Engines manipulate our&nbsp;minds</p><p>18:20 — 25:39: How are Google and Big Tech responding to all the criticism for their Algorithms?</p><p>25: 40 — 34:00: Is Government regulation the solution to protect data&nbsp;rights?</p><p>34:00 — 40:00: Is decentralization of data the solution to fight algorithms of oppression?</p><p>41:00 — 49:39: What is corporate America’s answer to the social dilemma and using consumer data to increase&nbsp;profits?</p><p>50:00 to end: How millennials can bring a change in the&nbsp;future</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

At present, the native version of ABT Wallet requires frequent QR code scanning and the web version of ABT Wallet will make the user experience better without reducing security or reducing functions. The ABT Wallet follows exactly the same protocol as the native version of ABT Wallet and will eventually have the same functionality.</p> Who are the major users of ABT Web Wallet, developers or digital currency&nbsp;users? <p>ABT Web Wallet serves developers at this stage. We hope developers can debug Blocklet without leaving their computers or even their browsers. But finally, ABT Web Wallet will serve all users in the entire ArcBlock ecosystem, including ABT Node operators, Blocklet operators, resource miners, developers, and end-users to help them manage tokens, NFT, digital identities, and verifiable certificates just like the native ABT&nbsp;Wallet.</p> What are the differences between ABT Wallet and MetaMask&nbsp;Wallet? <p>ArcBlock’s ABT Wallet and Ethereum’s MetaMask wallet are two different entrances of ecosystems, both of which are completely offline wallets. In our Rollup solution, ABT Wallet may have Ethereum support similar to MetaMask.</p> How to use ABT Web Wallet and mobile wallet together? <p>The ABT Web Wallet is fully compatible with the native wallet, which means users and developers can import and export data back and forth between the two&nbsp;wallets.</p> What are the major features of the ABT Web Wallet public beta version released&nbsp;today? <p>This public beta version implements the same features as the native wallet listed as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Profile management  Basic wallet management  Basic apps management  Combination with ABT Node, Wallet Playground, and other&nbsp;products  Compatibility with native ABT&nbsp;Wallet   What issues do we hope users to help the R&amp;D team to detect from their experiencing the public beta version of ABT Web&nbsp;Wallet? <p>Welcome our users visit <a href="https://web.abtwallet.io/">https://web.abtwallet.io</a> to get started and to raise any compatible, interaction issues and improvement suggestions to <a href="https://github.com/blocklet/abt-wallet-issues">https://github.com/blocklet/abt-wallet-issues</a></p> What are the development milestones and ultimate goals of the ABT Web Wallet released&nbsp;today? <p>We will iterate ABT Web Wallet at the pace of one version per week and our priority will be given to support on-chain transfer, NFT management, on-chain data sync optimization, etc.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/arcblock/abt-web-wallet-public-beta-is-released-c7d91c976acd">ABT Web Wallet Public Beta is Released</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/arcblock">ArcBlock</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>If you use Puppet to automate configuration management across dynamic server fleets, there’s a question about identity &amp; access management – how do you get accounts and credentials on the machines?</p>

<p>A common practice is to push SSH Keys for every admin user to every server. This has major security implications, however. What happens when an administrator leaves the company? It is usually up to someone to clear out those keys on each machine, oftentimes a manual process.</p>

<p>Another common practice is to front your servers with an LDAP interface, configuring a local PAM module on each machine to sync local server accounts with an upstream Identity Provider. This leaves a significant operational burden, however. Do you want to run an HA middleware service blocking your ability to scale in the cloud? I doubt you do.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will overcome both issues by seamlessly injecting Okta into your Puppet Infrastructure as Code to effectively <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/07/shift-identity-left-secure-devops-automation-with-okta/">Shift Identity Left</a>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: To follow this tutorial, you need to have an Advanced Server Access (ASA) team provisioned from your Okta Org. If you don’t have an existing ASA team, you can sign up for free <a href="https://app.scaleft.com/p/signupV2">here</a>, which requires an Okta Administrator to <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/setup/getting-started.htm">configure</a>.</p>

 Create your Puppet project and get an enrollment token in ASA 

<p>In Okta ASA, projects work as a collection of servers that share the same access and authorization controls. In a project, you define which users and groups from Okta can access your servers, when they can do so, and what they are allowed to do in the server (i.e. run only certain commands). Any changes in your project (users, group assignments, authorization) are periodically updated in your servers (providing idempotency for identity and access management).</p>

<p>Servers enroll in your project to apply the same security configuration using an ASA agent with a project enrollment token. The ASA agent periodically checks for updates in Okta to update the server configuration.</p>

<p>To get your servers running with Okta, let’s create a project and get an enrollment token:</p>

 
   Access Okta ASA as Administrator. 
   Click Projects and then select or create a new project. 
   Click Enrollment &gt; Create Enrollment Token. 
   Enter a name (i.e. <code>puppet_token</code>) and click Submit. 
   Copy the enrollment token: 
 

<p></p>

 Download and configure the sample puppet code 

<p>Clone our sample code <code>git clone https://github.com/okta-server-asa/asa-puppet-example.git</code></p>

<p>Optionally, review the <code>okta-asa-sample.pp</code> contents</p>

<p>This code first installs the Okta ASA server agent binaires. It supports multiple Linux distros using the server distro family to identify the ideal installation tasks:</p>

   <code>#Class for installing ASA
class asa_setup {
    if $facts['os']['family'] == 'Debian' {
        notice("This is: ${::osfamily} - ${::fqdn}")
        include install_deb
    }
    elsif $facts['os']['family'] == 'RedHat' {
        notice("This is: ${::osfamily} - ${::fqdn}")
        include install_rpm
    }
    elsif $facts['os']['family'] == 'Suse' {
        notice("This is: ${::osfamily} - ${::fqdn}")
        include install_rpm
    }
    else {
        notice("This sample doesn't work yet on: ${::osfamily} - ${::fqdn}")
    }
}
</code>   

<p>After installing the agent binaries, the <code>okta-asa-sample.pp</code> code:</p>

 
   Defines the name of your server in ASA (canonical name), 
   Enrolls your server into the ASA project using the enrollment token you got in the previous section 
   Starts the ASA server agent 
 

<p>Edit the <code>okta-asa-sample.pp</code> file and update line 2, with the asa enrollment token.</p>

   <code># ASA Enrollment token
$asa_enrollment_token = "ENROLLMENT_TOKEN_HERE"
</code>   

<p>Validate the example syntax: <code>puppet parser validate okta-asa-sample.pp</code></p>

<p>Validate the example in the primary server (without executing the change): <code>puppet apply okta-asa-sample.pp --noop</code></p>

 Test the sample code of your Puppet Project 

<p>It’s time to test the code. To do this, apply the sample on your Puppet primary server to enroll this server in Okta ASA.</p>

<p>Tip: For this tutorial, I’m using a test environment. For use in production, we recommend tests isolated in a new puppet client before running on production clients and primary servers.</p>

<p>To test the sample code Puppet primary server in ASA, enter <code>puppet apply okta-asa-sample.pp</code></p>

<p>To confirm the primary server is enrolled, check the list of servers in ASA:</p>

<p></p>

<p>With the primary server enrolled, let’s move to the clients.</p>

<p>Copy the sample manifest to the environment folder. For example: <code>cp okta-asa-sample.pp /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production</code></p>

<p>Access your puppet clients and execute the command <code>puppet agent -tv</code> (or wait until the clients fetch the new configuration from the primary server).</p>

<p>The Puppet client will fetch the manifest, install and configure ASA, and return the following:</p>

   <code>root@cicd-puppet-3-ubuntu:~# puppet agent -tv
Info: Using configured environment 'production'
Info: Retrieving pluginfacts
Info: Retrieving plugin

Notice: /Stage[main]/Enroll_server/Service[sftd]: Triggered 'refresh' from 1 event
</code>   

<p>In ASA, you will see the servers enrolled in your project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this moment, your servers are enrolled in ASA. That means you can access your servers with users and groups from Okta associated with your project.</p>

 Test access to servers with Okta 

<p>Now that all servers are enrolled in Okta, let’s access the servers as a user:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/sft.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1610060131465000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1omaR8RXzvDBwm3OddiJVk">Install the ASA agent in your workstation</a> (required to access servers as a user): <code>brew install okta-advanced-server-access --cask</code></p>

<p>To set up the ASA agent, enter <code>sft enroll</code> and follow the instructions</p>

<p>To see your servers, enter <code>sft list-servers</code></p>

   <code># sft list-servers
Waiting on browser...
Browser step completed successfully.
HOSTNAME                    OS_TYPE  PROJECT_NAME         ACCESS_ADDRESS

asa-puppet-4-suse           linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.104
</code>   

<p>To ssh into your server, enter <code>sft ssh &lt;name-of-your-server&gt;</code>:</p>

   <code># sft ssh asa-puppet-3-ubuntu
/home/frederico_hakamine #  
</code>   

<p>Note: Wait… What Okta ASA does for the login?</p>

 
   Okta ASA secures access to Linux and Windows servers in SSH and RDP connections using the server agent (the same one that enrolled the server in your project earlier). - The ASA server agent, in addition to subscribing your server to a project, also works alongside native OS features such as sudo, users, and openssh to control access during runtime and to capture any login events for audit inspection. 
   Because the agent is light and does not require firewalls and monolith LDAP or privileged access servers, it can be easily distributed across any infrastructure (IaaS, VM, or physical) and embedded in your DevOps tools. 
   To grant users access to servers, ASA operates a programmable Certificate Authority service as part of its SaaS, that issues ephemeral SSH Client Certificates for each authenticated and authorized request. The keys are issued only after ensuring both user and his/her device complies with the organization’s security policies. 
   The use of ephemeral keys provides many benefits. It eliminates the use of static keys and credentials for server access, ensures that both users and machines are audited before any new ssh connection, simplifies access revocation, eliminates the risk of “super account overuse”, and simplifies access audit. 
 

 What’s next? 

<p>After testing the sample on some clients, you may expand to the rest of your infrastructure and tweak the sample to take full advantage of your Puppet environment – i.e. Bolt, Hiera, secret management tools, and best practices.</p>

<p>You can also turn on additional features in Okta ASA, such as setup sudo grants, time-based access, use of bastion hosts, and SSH session capture just to name a few. All these features reduce the load on your catalogs and allow consistent account configuration across multiple servers.</p>

<p>GlobaliD, the trust platform that allows anyone to verify identities, create and join groups, communicate, and make payments, today announced that it will be using the <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio Network</a> as part of their mission to give users full control and ownership of their portable identity and&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Indicio Network will enable the issuance and verification of credentials on the GlobaliD platform and in the app, allowing individuals to port their credentials for authentication and authorization into any participating use case scenario — including vaccine passports.</p><p>In addition to developers building capabilities for signup, verification, messaging, wallet, and cards; the GlobaliD consumer app and web experience allows anyone to create and manage groups that support these same functions natively without the need to code a third-party offering.</p><p>These verifiable credentials are core to GlobaliD’s Trust Platform — in contrast to less trusted social media, messaging, conferencing, and other legacy apps and offerings in the marketplace.</p><p>“To address the widespread trust deficit in our society, we need private, secure, and transparent forms of identity in a portable and persistent manner,” says Greg Kidd, co-founder and CEO of GlobaliD. “GlobaliD is the portable and preferred solution for situations where trust is encouraged or required.”</p> Addressing the world’s trust deficit — one identity at a&nbsp;time <p>Decentralized identity, sometimes referred to as ‘self-sovereign identity’ (SSI), is an alternative to the current centralized and federated systems that collect and control user identity information. Thought of as a way to return the internet back to its open roots, this democratizing framework puts individuals back in control of their digital lives, allowing them to manage their own identity and data without reliance on a third-party.</p><p>This peer-to-peer interaction is not only safe and secure, avoiding the creation of honeypots of large amounts of data collected by multiple entities, it’s also the most privacy-preserving approach to online interactions and compliant with global data regulations.</p><p>“Unlike other proprietary solutions that claim privacy and security within a single siloed use case, GlobaliD’s portability framework, powered by Indicio, ensures that trusted credentials are both re-usable and user controlled,” says Kidd. “With GlobaliD, individuals no longer need to rely on corporations or governments for garnering levels of trust needed to act in everyday life situations.”</p> Trust as a&nbsp;service <p>Indicio’s mission is to not only create and maintain the Indicio Network for companies like GlobaliD, but also to <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/three-things-that-will-launch-decentralized-identity-into-commercial-reality/">provide the essential professional services</a> for enterprises around the world to build decentralized identity solutions.</p><p>“GlobaliD’s app, platform, and SDKs are a fast-track to a more secure digital world because they make verifiable credentials simple and easy to use across a range of vital services,” says Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “The real upshot is that people can protect their privacy and share their information at a distance — two things that are increasingly important to the efficiency of the global economy in the grip of a worldwide pandemic.”</p><p>Learn more about the Indicio Network and Indicio.tech’s range of services for global enterprises to build decentralized identity solutions at <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio.tech</a>.</p><p>Go to <a href="https://global.id/">Global.iD</a> to claim your GlobaliD, get verified, create and join groups, communicate, pay and get paid&nbsp;online.</p><p>About <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a></p><p>Indicio.tech is a professional services firm specializing in decentralized identity architecture, engineering, and consultancy.

<p>Coincodex: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are one of the most exciting crypto verticals, even if they have yet to take off in the way many commentators predicted. Back in 2017, the CryptoKitties craze caused gridlock on Ethereum, and one crazy cat wanted a digital kitty so bad, he blew $170k worth of ETH to obtain it (over $780k at today’s prices). Based on the performance of what was, at the time, an extremely young digital resource economy, we might reasonably have expected the NFT market to be further forward in 2021. Alas, progress has been slow. However, there is ample evidence to suggest that things are finally starting to change in the NFT ecosystem.</p>

<p>A new product called DeFiMAGIC represents a fresh use case for NFTs. Conceived by the team behind multi-chain platform Ardor, DeFiMAGIC is a Twitter bot that brings NFT capabilities to one of the world’s most popular social networking sites. While the exchange of ideas (and insults) is incredibly easy on a hectic platform like Twitter, what about the exchange of value? That’s a concept that struck Ardor’s developers as worth exploring.</p>

<p>In December 2020, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201210005340/en/GLEIF-Advances-Digital-Trust-and-Identity-for-Legal-Entities-Globally" title="announced">announced</a> the development of its verifiable LEI development programme. The vision of the programme is for collaboration on the development of a verifiable LEI (vLEI) – a cryptographically verifiable credential containing the LEI.</p>
<p>Against this background, I sat down with RapidLEI partner Vorna ID’s board member and experienced financial markets leader, Matias Johansson, to discuss his take on the vLEI programme, and how Vorna ID plan to take part.</p>
<p>Vorna ID is an LEI-based B2B customer authentication and authorisation service, leveraging RapidLEI’s automation technology. Read more about the partnership in our press release <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/vorna-id-rapidlei/" title="here">here</a> (March 2020).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 F: First, how’s it all going at Vorna ID? Tell us a little bit about your journey in 2020. 
<p>M: It’s going well, thank you. We were fortunate to secure initial funding for the identification of market opportunities by Business Finland’s Digital Trust programme. The programme helps Finnish companies build global business on digital trust and security.</p>
<p>In June, shortly after the press release you mentioned, we launched Vorna ID in the Finnish market with multiple partners at our own Digital Live event. &nbsp;Chris Hudson from RapidLEI also gave a great presentation introducing the LEI to the many digital identity professionals.</p>
<p>And since then we’ve been working on national-level B2G (business-to-government) and B2B (business-to-business) customer opportunities in several sectors, such as manufacturing and financial services. So all round, an exciting year despite the obvious challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 F: How exciting is the vLEI programme? 
<p>M: It’s very exciting for us especially given all the activity now in B2C Self Sovereign Identity and what it could mean for future B2B use cases. For example, the vLEI could provide reliable information about the organisation’s decision makers, which could be used in defining the organisation’s main users for a given digital resource.</p>
<p>Vorna ID already has experience in trust services requirements and with remote identification, made possible by the new eIDAS regulation, this opens up opportunities for further advances in the automation of onboarding processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 F: What do you see as the opportunities from the vLEI? 
<p>M: We all know that B2B relationships can be fairly complex when it comes to sharing and using confidential data. There’s an obvious market opportunity in leveraging verifiable credentials, such as the vLEI, in identity management to streamline online transactions. This kind of digital identity information could be used online, for example, over an OpenID Connect claim or in off-line transactions in decentralised identity networks, for example in blockchain transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 F: What about Vorna ID specifically – how are you responding to this news? 
<p>M: We’re working alongside RapidLEI, as our LOU (Local Operating Unit), in a strategic partnership to enable new digital identity use cases. Our target for this year is to execute pilot projects for governmental and financial services use cases. For us, the vLEI could also enable automated business partner onboarding and identity governance, which were also looking into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 F: What else does 2021 hold for Vorna ID? 
<p>M: Naturally, a big part will be working with current customer cases with our reseller and consulting partners here in Finland. In addition, we’re planning to participate in development projects within a Finnish manufacturing co-creation ecosystem, DIMECC.</p>

  The ambition of a democratic A.I. through the implementation of a decentralized protocol using the data of each individual without ever disclosing it to a third party.

 <p>This article is also <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/fr/choix-machine-learning-decentralise-pour-repondre-a-la-crise-sanitaire/">available in French</a>.</p>
<p>The current health crisis has shown how essential it is to have data in order to make political decisions. But also how sensitive some data is, and should only be handled with care. This is evidenced by the current debates in France around the relevance of the 6 p.m. curfew, the tracing of Covid contact cases and the creation of a medical database. In all three cases, for the <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/tousanticovid">TousAntiCovid application</a> as for the Health Data Hub, the choice of solutions that centralize data raises questions and concerns. This centralizing model, where all data are brought together in a single database, is fortunately not the only one possible. There are alternatives that make it possible to analyze the data and extract indicators to guide research and public policies, while guaranteeing the security and confidentiality of the data. Solutions that ensure that citizens retain control over their personal information, that it cannot be used without their consent.</p>
<p>We present here one of these solutions that allows training an AI with the data of many individuals without ever disclosing it to third parties, thanks to a decentralized protocol.</p>
 Against COVID: how long to keep sport halls and other public places closed? 
<p>Today, at a time when the whole of France is adopting new restrictive measures (general curfew at 6 p.m.), is it still legitimate to ask this question? The answer is yes and it will also arise as the government will lift these restrictions:</p>
 
 Will we have to open restaurants, bars, sport halls, swimming pools, theaters and other cultural places? In which order ? In what conditions ? 
 Will our children still have to wear a mask from 6 years old? 
 Should we let the most fragile personnel be confined? 
 Will we have to close the school canteens? nurseries? to reopen universities? 
 
<p>One thing is certain: an epidemic covers very large scales, and behaves differently according to many criteria, in particular temporal and spatial, which complicates the isolation of relevant variables.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a>, we bring an innovative approach and will try to answer this first question as an application case: does closing the sport halls contribute to hinder the virus?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, answering such a question as with other questions put forward previously requires centralizing the data of an entire population.<br>
Indeed, this would amount to studying correlations between a large number of personal and shared data of a population:</p>
 
 frequency of attendance of the room 
 medical background 
 age 
 other sports activities practiced 
 etc 
 
<p>To analyze this data, the state of the art - that is, current knowledge - has traditionally focused on methods requiring calculations to be made on a server that centralizes all the necessary and relevant data from a population.</p>
<p>Two major obstacles emerge:</p>
 
 how to recover all this scattered and diverse data? 
 
<p>The data of a population is scattered and the current centralized approaches cannot merge all the silos of existing services, which would require us to launch partnerships with <a href="https://www.google.fr/maps">Google Maps</a> , <a href="https://www.withings.com/fr/fr/">Withings</a>, the Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (APHP) and all the other regional hospitals, the Health Data Hub (HDH). As many French and American players would make the legal framework nebulous given the different laws.</p>
 
 how can we not allow misuse of this data? 
 
<p>Today, anonymizing such diverse data is mathematically impossible without degrading the useful value of the data.</p>
 Decentralized approach to personal cloud 
<p>This complexity in the pooling of data to respond to such a study had been anticipated at <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a> even before the health context that we are currently experiencing. One step ahead, in 2018 we launched Cozy, a French personal cloud and open source - a personal data platform in which the individual brings together all their data to have both more control and more uses. An astonishing paradigm then emerged where the individual can thus benefit from services mobilizing all their data, all their digital privacy, without any data leaving their home.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is this ambition to allow decentralization at the individual level by providing them with a personal cloud which constitutes a different and innovative approach that can answer the question asked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Who is legitimate to collect and control all your personal data? What conditions must be met for digital technology to be structurally at the service of democracy?”</p>
</blockquote>
 Personal Cloud: an innovative and different approach from the centralized approach of GAFA which involves the user 
<p>The idea of Cozy Cloud is to empower individuals with a personal cloud, a digital home that brings together all their personal data because the individual is the only legitimate person to access all of his/her data.</p>
<p>Applied to the example of the closure of sport halls, with his/her personal Cozy cloud, the individual can:</p>
 
 automatically retrieve geolocation data from his smartphone in his personal cloud which indicates the precise attendance of his gym, his history and health constants from his Digital Health Space, his blood pressure monitor connected to Withings, its diabetes telesurveillance service offered by the APHP, etc. 
 contribute to a decentralized learning program ensuring that his data does not leave his personal cloud. 
 
<p>Cozy is thus paving the way for decentralized artificial intelligence where AI can learn everyone's data without anyone sharing their data.</p>
<p></p>
 DISPERS: Decentralized protocol can be activated 
<p>DISPERS: a decentralized protocol</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the privacy-friendly personal cloud provides its users with a dedicated digital space under their sole control. However, this platform remains single-user and, without an adequate framework, does not allow the creation of multi-user applications offering the same guarantees. The objective of the DISPERS protocol published with INRIA, was therefore to define this framework to allow, more specifically, the execution of distributed requests respecting privacy on a set of personal clouds. In our context, we consider that each individual of the studied population has his own personal cloud.</p>
<p></p>Protocole DISPERS<p></p>
<p>This protocol is the result of a CIFRE thesis between Cozy Cloud and <a href="https://team.inria.fr/petrus/">the PETRUS team at INRIA Saclay</a>. More than an anonymization method, this protocol provides strong guarantees that a calculation relating to personal data will not reveal any useful information throughout its execution, even in the presence of malicious actors. This work has given rise to articles published in major international academic conferences:</p>
 
 Julien Loudet, Luc Bouganim, Iulian Sandu Popa <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01949583">Privacy-Preserving Queries on Highly Distributed Personal Data Management Systems</a> 
 Julien Loudet, Iulian Sandu Popa, Luc Bouganim SEP2P: <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01949641">Secure and Efficient P2P Personal Data Processing</a> 
 
<p>The DISPERS protocol is also integrated into <a href="https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-16-CE39-0014">the ANR PerSoCloud project</a>, a cooperation between Cozy Cloud, Orange, INRIA Saclay and University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, which aims to facilitate the connection of each person's personal digital home.</p>
<p>DISPERS thus offers a way to distribute tasks and information between several Cozy personal clouds. The protocol incorporates processes to hide the holders of the information or make the data incomprehensible to the actor who will be responsible for a sub-task. Thus, no single actor is able to compromise the entire calculation, nor to access useful information!</p>
<p>A technological enabler developed with INRIA</p>
<p>As the data is already present in users 'personal clouds, the DISPERS protocol can be done without having to convince Withings, APHP and Google Maps to share their users' data or find the legal framework in which to contract such a device. Legal constraints are, moreover, an unknown factor that deserves special attention in the context of a decentralized protocol: the legal constraints of each actor participating in the protocol should be listed.</p>
<p>Our protocol allows an epidemiological study to mobilize the data, gathered without difficulty by the individual - in our case user of the Cozy personal cloud, which would constitute a nightmare for a laboratory to recover all the personal information and consents. This thus makes it possible to establish a correlation calculation and assess the prevalence of the virus within the population according to its behavior, while guaranteeing the user that it is technically impossible that the data used does not go out of its way. personal cloud. Data shared in this way is impossible to bring together today to grow a common good.</p>
<p>A new thesis on the basics of DISPERS with a focus on AI</p>
<p>In addition to the previous thesis carried by Julien Loudet, we are opening a new path with a new <a href="http://www.theses.fr/s252717">thesis with INRIA carried by Julien Mirval and Cozy Cloud which aims to be able to do distributed learning in an AI context</a>.</p>
 Use case: relevance of closing sport halls during the COVID-19 epidemic? 
 Conditions of application 
<p>Assuming that the population of our sample has a personal cloud in which each individual has connected their Withings account and retrieved their GPS data (including those of their gym attendance ) thus his health data recovered by his Shared Medical File (DMP) (tested positive or not for COVID).</p>
 Course of the study 
<p>From these data, and by applying the DISPERS protocol,</p>
 
 we can then look at the percentage of contamination of these individuals before and after the closing of the sports halls 
 we can compare it with the percentage of contamination of so-called equivalent people who do not go to the gym (equivalent on certain relevant variables such as location, age, etc.) 
 
 Results of the study 
<p>If we see a drop in the percentage of contamination before and after closure in individuals who went there AND that the percentage of contamination of individuals who did not go there does not follow the same trend, then we can assume that there is an impact.</p>
<p>Note that the experiment does not prove causality, but makes it possible to establish indices, which, added with other studies and / or protocols, would make it possible to better define the behavior of the epidemic.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Decentralized machine learning as a new way to pool data paves the way for democratic AI. Such AI needs to learn from a large, cross-cutting dataset from multiple sources, while respecting user privacy, something that current centralized approaches that operate in silos cannot allow. In a democratic society, individuals themselves control their data.</p>
<p>By adopting a personal cloud to reclaim your personal data, your Personal AI allows access to your “complete digital privacy” without ever disclosing it. A necessary paradigm shift, as the risks of privacy breaches have never seemed greater than in these uncertain times.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Privacy-sensitive users are drawn to solutions with certain features: end-to-end encryption, granular consent, data ownership, and secure storage. But what is it that privacy can really do for users, and is there a non-exploitative business model in it for companies?</p>
<p>KuppingerCole envisioned Life Management Platforms back in 2012 as the pathway to individual data sovereignty. Data sovereignty is incrementally being introduced as a right of individuals, with principles being introduced in the European GDPR, the Canadian PIPEDA, the CCPA, and others. While these regulations manage the commercial data interactions between the individual and the business, there is still a huge gap between the data protections offered and meaningful data sovereignty for the individual; the user does not yet have a cohesive means to manage their personal data and share it with third parties and still maintain ownership and control. In other words, privacy seekers are still waiting for a Life Management Platform.</p>
 Life Management Platforms for User-Centric Control 
<p>Imagine a secure digital data store for your identity documents, financial records, credit score, health records, ownership deeds, and credentials. Imagine that you could share that data securely in a digital format, without sending a scan or filling out a registration form. But beyond simply sharing, you have the control over which entities can view or store that data. You can restrict the length of time they have your data, and you have an auditable list of which third parties you have shared information with. Your data remains centered around you, not the entities you have created an account with.</p>
<p>Imagine submitting a mortgage application to multiple banks, scouting out the best opportunity. You can put permissions on your data so that it only resides with the bank that you sign the contract with; otherwise it is returned to your personal data storage. This way you can shop around without leaving a stream of personal data behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Imagine visiting the doctor with an aging relative, where medical results should be shared with not only the patient, but a designated guardian as well. The aging relative can delegate you to receive information on their behalf and grant data access privileges to you; to share medical information but not financial, for example. In the case of a child these permissions can be granted until they gain full data ownership at 18 or the appropriate legal age.</p>
<p>Imagine posting a photograph on social media with your copyright. Your intellectual property resides in your data storage, but you’ve displayed it on your channel for the world to see. Someone else wants to use that photo, and you grant conditional access, for a fee. One download, with no further reproductions.</p>
 Elements of a Life Management Platform 
<p>We have to recognize that we are describing a product that does not yet exist...not fully anyway. You can find elements of a Life Management Platform here and there, tucked in decentralized identity projects, enterprise digital rights management, or privacy solutions for consent management. A Life Management Platform should contain a user-centric data storage, the means to share data with strong rights management, and standard protocols to establish the veracity and digital provenance of shared data.</p>
<p>Data storage: There is a huge need for a secure data storage for individuals to hold personal data, critical documents, health records, proof of ownership, education credentials, etc. This is missing entirely from most privacy solutions, and only a few niche organizations are developing such a digital safe. The most promising technology solutions seem to be based on decentralized architectures like blockchain. These give the benefit of verifying data against authoritative sources – like a government-issued ID document against the public records – and storing the digital proof in the blockchain while the data itself resides in the user’s own device. Decentralized identity wallets and exchange of data are facilitated through the Verifiable Credentials emerging standard.</p>
<p>Permissioned Exchange: Verifiable Credentials lay the groundwork for data exchange, and some solutions are rolling out revocation rights, but granular permissions and rights management for shared data is still to come. This should include delegated access, guardian access for incapacitated individuals or minors, protection for IP, and protection for data posted in public, like social media channel. Data that is meant to be private must have permissions control to address the individuals it is shared with and the actions they can take.</p>
<p>Verified data, verified identity: Underpinning the ability to store and share one’s own private data securely are standards: Verifiable Credentials as mentioned earlier, and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs establish a universal protocol for describing unique identifiers in decentralized systems and Verifiable Credentials make it possible to attach an interoperable cryptographic proof of provenance to data that is shared. Widespread adoption of such standards make it possible to establish that data is verified with transparent publication of which entities have issued it and which have validated it. Similarly, identities that are interacting online can be verified and correlated to a real-world identity. This identity can still be masked during low value transactions to preserve the user's desire to be anonymous, but some transactions, like in banking scenarios, the user can interact and share their private data that is correlated to their real-world identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an71606/the-blockchain-and-life-management-platforms/" title="Life Management Platforms">Life Management Platforms</a> are a futuristic concept, but one that becomes more relevant every day. Trends towards digital, user-centricity, privacy, and reusability all influence the need to hold, control, and share information privately. It will have a huge impact on how we interact as customers, employees, and business partners, be marked with automation and self-service, and attain even higher granularity on permission. Much of the details depend on the structure of the Life Management Platforms that will emerge in the next few years. This is new territory, and we will continue to struggle to balance the pressing need for privacy and the business cases that will inevitably rise out of innovation.</p>

 2020 
<p>In spite of the many challenges presented over the last year, it was a resoundingly good one for Urbit.</p>
<p>It seems like a long time ago now that the folks at Tlon rolled out OS1 (now called Landscape), just as the pandemic forced everyone into their homes throughout the world. At the time, <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-is-for-communities/">Urbit is for Communities"</a> was just a vision, but now it’s been transformed into reality—there are more thriving communities in Landscape than any of us can keep track of, with new faces popping onto the network on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Landscape brought many new ships onto the network which helped identify those areas in which Urbit’s infrastructure could be most improved. <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/ford-fusion/">Ford Fusion</a> eliminated the possibility of a partially-applied over-the-air (OTA) update through a drastic reduction in the size and complexity of the codebase. The efficiency of the OTA process was improved by several orders of magnitude, and many long-standing memory issues were resolved. Now we deploy code on our infrastructure nodes and see users receive an update, over a decentralized network, often in less than a minute.</p>
<p>After improving the stability of the system Tlon turned its attention to bringing more ships onto the network. A long-standing barrier to Urbit’s adoption has been the technical knowledge required to host one’s own ship—this prompted Tlon to build and launch an Urbit <a href="https://tlon.io">hosting service</a>, the waitlist for which is now thousands deep.</p>
<p>With Tlon becoming more singularly focused on building products on Urbit, concrete steps have been taken towards making urbit.org a separate organization that’s focused on long-term development of Urbit’s platform. I joined to <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-steps-towards-urbit-org/">lead that effort</a> back in August and have since spent the majority of my time working with dozens of contributors on projects spanning documentation, education, external integrations, and much more.</p>
<p>We rounded out the year with a full network reset (called a “continuity breach”), which has in the past has been synonymous with loss of all data on the network. This time things went differently: tooling was made available to the community that allowed ships to preserve their data, which enabled most to seamlessly rejoin post-reset. This is a significant milestone for the project as it signifies not only a commitment to technical excellence, but to supporting our budding community.</p>
 2021 
<p>In the last three weeks we’ve seen a huge amount of inbound interest as people are waking up to the inherent problems with using centralized services run by MEGACORPs—we’re just happy we started working on Urbit all those years ago. While we tend to not plan more than about six months in advance, I can still talk at a high level about what urbit.org will be focusing on in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Growth in Urbit’s developer community has been growing organically in lockstep with the overall network growth. This means, happily, that there’s a pretty large pool of people eager to contribute to Urbit. The priority for urbit.org, therefore, is to improve its capacity to effectively assist contributors. In broad strokes, this means:</p>
 
 Rework urbit.org to better help developers learn how to contribute to Urbit 
 Since Urbit is ready to build on top of, provide practical guides that demonstrate how to do so 
 Guide developers to make high-value contributions to Urbit and its ecosystem 
 Build community amongst contributors 
 
<p>My strategy to date has been heavily focused on working directly with contributors to provide technical guidance and direction, and it’s been working really well. To that end I’ll also be scaling our ability to provide such support by bringing more individuals into urbit.org that can mentor, review work, and provide guidance on where to best direct contributors' energy.</p>
<p>2021 is shaping up to be a big year for Urbit, and we'd <a href="https://grants.urbit.org">love your help</a> in building it. If you want to see what we're working on in real time, join us in Landscape at ~wolref-podlex/foundation.</p>
<p>See you on the network!</p>

<p>Companies spend a combined $19 billion annually acquiring and analyzing consumer data. This data allows companies to make more informed decisions, increasing customer engagement, unlocking additional revenues. </p><p>However, the long-held belief was that this information was proprietary and therefore should be a closely guarded secret. Companies have treated their collected data as a trade secret, afraid that if competitors discovered insights about their products, strategies, and operations, that maybe they could easily copy them–an argument that is increasingly being proven wrong in many industries.</p><p>According to retail marketing platform, Perch, the more “granular and intimate” the data, the more specific it is to a particular retailer environment and therefore it is even less useful in replication for competitors.</p><p>But just how can sharing data across businesses and companies within the same vertical actually drive more engagement and revenue? In 2014, Apple launched its Healthkit API which allows app developers the ability to share customer health data with other applications through Apple. Healthkit is part of Apple’s broader ‘Health’ product, which serves as a single source of truth for health-related information such as body measurements, nutrition, heart rate, running distance, reproductive health, sleep time and other health related information. To date, thousands of apps integrate with Healthkit, allowing synergies between apps that would otherwise only have access to their own user collected data. A brisk morning jog tracked on one app, can show up as daily health stats in a cycling app, providing a more complete picture to the end user. Google launched a similar app called Google Fit in the same year, with support and integration for nearly all of the most popular fitness apps from Nike to Strava and displays over 50 million downloads on the Google Play store page. Clearly, seamless data sharing and app integration has been a huge win in the health sector.</p> Simplified Access and Synergy <p>Data sharing has implications outside of health apps. Take for instance the popularity of super apps in Asia. WeChat is a prime example allowing users the ability to perform a wide variety of lifestyle tasks in a single ecosystem such as ordering a taxi, applying for a bank loan, paying for goods or items, and even transacting with government service providers, all without leaving the app ecosystem. This synergy allows simplified access and convenience to its users and translates to incredible user engagement –WeChat accounts for around 90% of all messaging app users in China. Compare that with Facebook Messenger, the largest messaging app in the U.S. which accounts for less than 30% of the total U.S. market for chat. Grab, another popular super app, services 144 million users in 8 Southeast Asian countries, enabling users access to ride-hailing, grocery, package and restaurant delivery, rewards and digital payments all in one single platform. Clearly app users are signaling their appreciation for the convenience and power of the synergies generated from information sharing</p> The Case for Verifiable Credentials <p>In a nearly identical manner, Verifiable Credential Issuers stand to make significant strides in user adoption by offering newfound convenience in a traditionally painfully inconvenient industry. Companies that support a Verifiable Credential Issuance standard can provide audited and truthful information to any third party on behalf of and with specific permission from their customers. For example, a bank could provide proof-of-funds in the form of a digitally verified credential document, that can then be used as a source of truth to instantly initiate a mortgage application, or a real estate purchase offer. </p><p>The use of Verified Credentials is far-reaching. Credentials issuers can market their services to customers, who might select them over a competitor due to the added convenience of being able to access other affiliate applications and marketplaces. For example, a financial services provider that offers Verifiable Credentials can allow its customer rapid and simplified access to investment services, credit cards, auto loans, or peer-to-peer payment platforms, negating the need for a redundant, costly and time-consuming verification process with each separate service provider. In the same manner, companies and platforms that accept Verifiable Credentials in their onboarding process might attract users who are already in a shared Verifiable Credential ecosystem, driving additional synergies and growth. Meanwhile, companies that do not support any shared information initiative do not stand to benefit from these synergies and would be relegated to a quickly aging and time-consuming manual credential verification process.</p> Bloom <p>Bloom believes in modernizing access to credit by leveraging an ecosystem of secure identity and financial data sharing. We seek to accomplish this through the use of a Verifiable Credential Issuance standard based on blockchain technology. Our platform provides a single source of truth recorded on an immutable and distributed ledger ultimately decentralizing the way that financial information is shared between parties. Through this, Bloom offers decentralized and centralized applications alike, the ability to integrate within a shared, synergistic ecosystem that provides efficiency and convenience for a customer, while increasing engagement and revenue opportunities for businesses. All data sharing events are specifically permissioned by each consumer, giving them added control and comfort of their private information</p><p>For more information on our technology and mission, please visit bloom.co/about</p>

 Issues with DeFi Lending <p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending applications have taken the cryptocurrency space by storm. &nbsp; They represent over 49% of the total locked value of all DeFi applications. &nbsp;Despite their record growth and success through 2020, they all share a common issue.</p><p>Because they are decentralized, autonomous, and permissionless they are unable to collect any information about their users such as their creditworthiness and ability to repay back borrowed capital. &nbsp;As such, borrowers must post substantial collateral in order to borrow funds from these lending platform – sometimes as high as a 2:1 ratio of collateral to borrowed funds. &nbsp;This collateral is locked into a smart contract which can also liquidate it to cover any losses that result from market declines and unreturned capital. &nbsp;However, this makes DeFi borrowing a function of entities that already have substantial capital to start with, greatly limiting its adoption and narrowing the types of entities that benefit from its use. </p><p>Currently, only centralized financial institutions like banks are able to provide credit or loan capital to individuals and entities without any up-front collateral. &nbsp;Banks can do this because they collect certain attributes of an individual or entity such as their name, home address, income, history of loan repayments, and outstanding loan balances among other things.</p> Innovations in Decentralized Identity Management <p>Today, progress is being made in the decentralized identity space. Some platforms allow individuals to create and maintain digital identity records of themselves on a decentralized protocol. &nbsp;Such platforms can integrate directly with credential issuers to attest to the validity of any identity records issued and maintained, while allowing holders to control the dissemination of this information to specifically permissioned parties. &nbsp;The entire process is cryptographically secured to prevent bad actors from gaining access to this private information, assuring only the intended recipient is in control. &nbsp;Furthermore, individuals can select the specific information they wish to provide, providing as little or as much information as necessary for each use case.</p><p>A single self-sovereign identity platform can store a variety of information on an individual, allowing a single source of truth that is infinitely re-usable and scalable. &nbsp;Furthermore, users can update the information in such a decentralized registry by requesting updated identity information from issuing bodies as needed. &nbsp;The entire process can be performed digitally without the need to create, distribute and maintain physical identification assets such as ID cards, or documents.</p><p>eRecipients can trust the data because they can verify that it originated by a trusted issuer such as a government body, an industry certification authority, or similar issuing body through the immutable chain-of-custody that blockchains can provide. &nbsp;They can also be assured that although there is no physical interaction with the identity holder, that the information provided was made by that specific individual since only the holder of the private keys would have access to release their identify information.</p> Solving the Issue of the Unknown Borrower <p>By leveraging decentralized identity solutions, it is possible for DeFi lenders to obtain the necessary information on their platform users and borrowers to determine creditworthiness and provide a means of collections in the event of default. &nbsp;The implications of this are significant, as it allows a fast-growing industry to provide loans without any collateral posted, matching the lending capabilities of centralized institutions, while providing the benefits and convenience of a fully decentralized and autonomous process.</p>

 The GiD Report#143 — ”How blocking Trump puts the future of the internet at&nbsp;risk” <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-142-your-whatsapp-data-belongs-to-fb-now-ba007f1ecd5c">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-01-jp-thieriot-on-why-uphold-isnt-delisting-xrp-723a33470916">Episode 02 of our podcast with special guest JP Thieriot, CEO of&nbsp;Uphold</a>.</p>  The fallout from deplatforming Trump and&nbsp;Parler  The Signal/Telegram party  What this means for the future of the&nbsp;internet  Everything you need to know about Bitcoin and Blockchain  Stuff happens   1. The big news recently has been the deplatforming of Donald Trump and Parler — and what all of that means for the future of the internet. <p>These tensions have been bubbling for some time now. But with horrendous violence at the Capitol finally sparking firm action, what happens next will define where we go&nbsp;next.</p><p>Jack Dorsey, for instance, Twitter’s need to shutdown Donald Trump’s account was in itself a platform&nbsp;failure:</p><p>Indeed, those divisions will only grow and calcify as factions draw battle lines and take legal action. Here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-a2ac731f-a04b-4fac-8e86-d2dae0e851b8.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The Capitol riot and tech firms’ sweeping attempt in its wake to dislodge the online far right are kicking up efforts to have the courts settle knotty questions about online speech and power, Axios’ Margaret Harding McGill and Ashley Gold&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Legal battles could force the people angry at Big Tech to bring more rigor to arguments that have often devolved into messy sideshows.</blockquote><blockquote>Parler vs. Amazon: Parler sued Amazon after its AWS unit kicked the right-wing-friendly social network off its hosting due to violent threats made on the platform before the Capitol siege. Parler contends Amazon breached its contract and is breaking antitrust laws, hurting Parler to benefit Twitter, another AWS&nbsp;client.</blockquote><blockquote>Rumble vs. Google: Toronto-based Rumble, an increasingly popular streaming-video platform on the right, sued Google, accusing it of steering users of its search engine to YouTube over competing video services.</blockquote><blockquote>ADL v. Gab: No civil suits have been filed or threatened, but the ADL is calling on right-wing-friendly social network Gab to potentially be held criminally liable for Capitol riot mobilization on its platform. Section 230, which shields online platforms from civil liability over user-posted content, doesn’t apply to federal&nbsp;crimes.</blockquote><p>Also:</p><blockquote>Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai says online platforms should be forced to explain their practices in the much the same way he required of broadband providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T, Margaret&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: Pai paired those transparency requirements with his 2017 repeal of net neutrality rules. Open-internet proponents feared the repeal would lead to ISPs blocking websites or deliberately slowing traffic, but bipartisan concern has largely shifted to the power of platforms like Google and Facebook to shape what people see&nbsp;online.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the NYTimes wonders — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/technology/twitter-facebook-parler-rules.html">who should make the online&nbsp;rules</a>?</p><p>Other countries are naturally worried about this latest power flex by Big Tech. If they can so easily silence their own president, what’s to stop them silencing anyone&nbsp;else’s?</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/merkel-sees-closing-trump-s-social-media-accounts-problematic">Germany and France Oppose Trump’s Twitter&nbsp;Exile</a>  <p>Because this was certainly a power&nbsp;move.</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a>—<a href="https://greenwald.substack.com/p/how-silicon-valley-in-a-show-of-monopolistic">How Silicon Valley, in a Show of Monopolistic Force, Destroyed Parler</a>  <p>This is quite the dichotomy, no?</p><blockquote>In China, President Xi Jinping has silenced Alibaba founder Jack Ma and launched an antitrust investigation into his company after the e-commerce tycoon publicly criticized state regulators. In the U.S., Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has suspended President Donald Trump’s accounts after the president used the platform to incite violence.</blockquote> 2. It’s that question of Big Tech’s power that’s also driving tens or hundreds of millions of users away from WhatsApp to Telegram and&nbsp;Signal. Telegram Founder Pavel Durov, Photo: TechCrunch  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/telegram-signal-apps-big-tech.html">Millions Flock to Telegram and Signal as Fears Grow Over Big&nbsp;Tech</a>  <p>Check out this&nbsp;chart:</p><p>Also, the meme of the week, via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/vs">/vs</a>:</p> 3. In a sense, that’s a good thing. People have choice through innovation. But in a lot of ways, people fleeing WhatsApp for Telegram is really a parallel narrative to people leaving Twitter and Facebook for&nbsp;Parler. <p>The Information worries about the ramifications of trying to shutdown the&nbsp;latter:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-blocking-trump-puts-the-future-of-the-internet-at-risk">How Blocking Trump Puts the Future of the Internet at&nbsp;Risk</a>  <blockquote>In this respect, it doesn’t matter if the social networks were justified in their response to Trump, which I believe they very much were. It just comes down to the fact that broad swaths of the internet have finally taken a clearly political step that is impossible to apply consistently or fairly across the&nbsp;globe.</blockquote><blockquote>A month ago, any political party would have been reviled for calling to extinguish the voice of a rival on the internet. But in the blink of an eye, exactly that has become a legitimate debate, one that internet companies will lose, no matter what they&nbsp;do.</blockquote><blockquote>Until recently, the global internet seemed a given. Today, it seems possible that Trump’s final act as a president will be to set off the dominoes that lead to the end of digital globalism and the erection of closed digital borders, as well as to regionalization and censorship.</blockquote><p>The rest of the article is worth a&nbsp;read!</p><p>Here’s Ben Thompson’s take:</p>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/">Internet 3.0 and the Beginning of (Tech)&nbsp;History</a>  <p>Ben had personally called for Trump to be de-platformed:</p><blockquote>After years of defending Facebook and Twitter’s decisions to keep Trump on their services, I called for him to be kicked off last Thursday, and I explained yesterday why tech’s collective action in response to last Wednesday’s events was a uniquely American solution to a genuine&nbsp;crisis</blockquote><p>Notably, there was international backlash to the move. From&nbsp;Europe:</p><blockquote>Germany and France attacked Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. after U.S. President Donald Trump was shut off from the social media platforms, in an extension of Europe’s battle with big tech. German Chancellor Angela Merkel objected to the decisions, saying on Monday that lawmakers should set the rules governing free speech and not private technology companies.</blockquote><p>From India:</p><blockquote>BJP leaders expressed concern on Saturday over the permanent suspension of US President Donald Trump’s Twitter account by the social media giant, saying it sets a dangerous precedent and is a wake-up call for democracies about the threat from unregulated big tech companies…”If they can do this to the President of the US, they can do this to anyone. Sooner India reviews intermediaries’ regulations, better for our democracy,” BJP’s youth wing president Tejaswi Surya said in a&nbsp;tweet.</blockquote><p>Ben’s take:</p><blockquote>Tech companies would surely argue that the context of Trump’s removal was exceptional, but when it comes to sovereignty it is not clear why U.S. domestic political considerations are India’s concern, or any other country’s. The fact that the capability exists for their own leaders to be silenced by an unreachable and unaccountable executive in San Francisco is all that matters, and it is completely understandable to think that countries will find this status quo unacceptable.</blockquote><p>For Ben, all this means is that the current status quo doesn’t represent the end-state of the internet’s evolution, and in fact, so little is settled that we’re in the midst of a complete rejiggering. I’ll let you read up on all of his philosophical context on your&nbsp;own.</p><p>But here’s a preview of where he believes we’re&nbsp;going:</p><blockquote>Here technology itself will return to the forefront: if the priority for an increasing number of citizens, companies, and countries is to escape centralization, then the answer will not be competing centralized entities, but rather a return to open protocols. This is the only way to match and perhaps surpass the R&amp;D advantages enjoyed by centralized tech companies; open technologies can be worked on collectively, and forked individually, gaining both the benefits of scale and inevitability of sovereignty and self-determination.</blockquote><blockquote>This process will take years; I would expect governments in Europe in particular to initially try and build their own centralized alternatives. Those efforts, though, will founder for a lack of R&amp;D capabilities, and be outstripped by open alternatives that are perhaps not as full-featured and easy-to-use as big tech offerings, at least in the short to medium-term, but possess the killer feature of not having a San Francisco kill-switch.</blockquote><p>Sound familiar?</p> 4.

<p>Expat arrivals and oldschool Berliners are immediately united on one issue: the Berlin housing crisis. Whether you’ve lived in Berlin your whole life and are suddenly struggling to find the next flat or you’ve been drawn by the city’s promises of culture and work, the increasing lack of flats, rise of rental prices and bureaucratic hurdles to finding a long term flat create a pain point that everyone in the city can relate to. From the <a href="https://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/wohnen/mietspiegel/">Mietspiegel</a> to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGW9S2ZHXS5/">memes</a>, the city is united in trying (more or less constructively) to deal with the renting crisis.</p>



<p>A collective problem requires a collective solution. 85% of Berlin’s population rents, and the factors that have led to Berlin’s housing crisis are manifold: foreign investment, lack of rent control, housing shortages, distrust between landlords and tenants, legal barriers, slow bureaucratic processes, an oldschool reliance on traditional markers of financial stability (i.e. a stable job vs the very common—and often lucrative—freelancing positions many people choose to take up today). That means the issue sometimes feels overwhelming. It also means that it’s easy to be cynical about measures that have been made, like the <a href="https://www.thesocialreview.co.uk/2019/11/18/rent-controls-nostalgia-and-localism-berlins-housing-crisis/">Mietendeckel</a>, which is treated with skepticism and concern in many circles both in terms of its sustainability and its enforceability.</p>



<p>In fact, most of us are unable to summon the resources, legislative power and capacity to solve Berlin’s housing crisis in one fell swoop. It’s an enormous problem best tackled in smaller pieces. There are problems—such as the bureaucratic hurdles to renting, or a breakdown of trust between landlords and tenants—where existing housing policies will have only a minimal effect. It’s at that point that other solutions need to step forward.</p>



<p>With this in mind, we launched Domi.</p>



<p>Smart data for a smart city</p>



<p>Domi’s product is simple: a digital passport that allows you to access the rental market anywhere. And we’re built on sophisticated and cutting-edge technology. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) follows the belief that a user’s data should be fully owned and controlled by the user themselves, and offers a verifiable and transparent way to exchange credentials between users, companies and governments.</p>



<blockquote><p>In the same way that you can use your driver’s license or passport as physical proof of your identity, SSI creates verifiable digital credentials.</p> </blockquote>



<p>SSI is a new form of decentralised tech that puts the power of data back in users’ hands. In the same way that you can use your driver’s license or passport as physical proof of your identity, SSI creates verifiable digital credentials that could be used for anything from signing online contracts to logging into online services to claiming government benefits.</p>



<p>Domi is built using SSI to create a digital passport that property managers can trust and tenants can control. For tenants, the Domi wallet avoids the data privacy concerns and paperwork hassle of having to hand over piles of significant and private documents. For landlords and property managers, Domi helps manage your data privacy concerns, keeps you GDPR secure, and offers a paperless and fully digitised way to manage contracts and tenant relationships for the entire length of that relationship.</p>



<p>Domi addresses two of the major pain points in the Berlin housing market:</p>



  Digitalisation: The rental market in Germany is screaming for digitalisation. Using Domi either as a tenant or as a property manager means that you’ll have the entire history of your relationship—from application to Abmeldung and everything in between, along with all the documents you’ve exchanged—in a secure, instantly accessible place. With one click in your browser or a tap on your phone, you pull up all the documents you need.<br>  Trust: We’ve found that relationships generally improve as soon as people are given the means to trust one another. Domi can’t repair all the years of history, real issues and complicated emotions that lie between landlords and tenants, but we can give you a platform to deal with one another fairly and equitably. By giving both tenants and landlords a means for clear, transparent communications, we promote mutual respect and responsibility on both sides. With Domi, you’re building a record of trust on both sides that you can carry throughout a lifetime of renting.  



<blockquote><p>If you’re a freelancer, you have the chance to show measurable income in the same verified way employees’ payslips work. If you don’t have the big bucks to back you up in your housing applications but do have a track record as a responsible and reliable tenant, your Domi will reflect that, too.</p> </blockquote>



<p>But along with this, Domi is all about clarity, offering transparent and reliable pictures of its users on both sides of the rental market. If you’re a freelancer, you have the chance to show measurable income in the same verified way employees’ payslips work. If you don’t have the big bucks to back you up in your housing applications but do have a track record as a responsible and reliable tenant, your Domi will reflect that, too.</p>



<p>SSI is the backbone of Europe’s new generation of digital identity technology, which will be rolled out in the next five years. Domi offers you—and Berlin, and Germany—a chance to get onboard early.</p>



<p>The road to launch</p>



<p>2020’s been a big year for Domi, and 2021 is already promising to be bigger and better still.</p>



<p>We’ve been backed by exciting projects, securing funding and support under two EU-grants: <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/">eSSIF-LAB</a> and <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">DAPSI</a>, which have contributed hugely to our product and company development. A very significant step has been conducting industry, user and market research as we refine our product development, in preparation for a 2021 Q3 launch in Germany. We’ve also begun exploring applications of Domi in adjacent sectors, from utilities to insurance to banking, making it much more likely that your Domi will be an all-important and everyday part of future city life.</p>



<p>But it’s not all research. Alongside our product scope and development, the Domi team has been securing pilot opportunities with property management companies based in key cities across Europe, as well as integration opportunities with project management software companies. Most of our energy and focus is trained at bringing Domi to you, our users — because we know you need it. As early as September 2021, you could be using the Domi app to manage applications for properties you manage, or using it to apply for your own new accommodation.</p>

<p>In summer 2018, the beginnings of the Domi team assembled, drawn together by a shared love of using tech—particularly blockchain-adjacent technologies—for social and economic good. Fascinated by the idea of sustainable cities and what life will look like in the future, housing was an obvious place for the Domi team to start. And it quickly became clear that the potential for overlap between sophisticated new technology and the rental market—which has been crying out for digitalisation—was huge.</p>



<p>As anyone who’s spent any time in the city knows, Berlin has a strong renting culture: 85% of Berlin residents are renters. And as anyone who’s spent a little bit longer in the city knows, housing is a deeply entrenched issue in Berlin <a href="https://domilabs.io/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-berlin-housing/">with no easy solutions</a>. A lack of suitable housing means that competition for flats is high, and the bureaucracy hurdles required to land a flat are multiple. It gets even harder if you’re a member of the hidden renting population: newcomers without a German paper trail, freelancers, people on social welfare, subletters, WG-ers and more.</p>



<p>The systematic problems of Berlin’s housing market extend beyond tenants. Property managers, too, are struggling with communication issues, an overloaded system, mountains of paperwork and an increasing concern about data privacy in the wake of GDPR.</p>



<p>The power of data</p>



<p>Handled responsibly, data is one of the key tools with which we can improve the rental market. Whether for an individual, where control of data privacy is so important, or in larger spheres like legislature and building strategy, data guides the ways our cities are built. One of Domi’s early breakthroughs came in the possibility of working on both the micro and macro levels when it comes to putting the power of data to work.</p>



<blockquote><p>Between landlords and tenants, between private and public organisations, between government and business, trust is an element that is lacking across the housing market. We believe that data can go a long way towards building trust between all of these stakeholders.</p> </blockquote>



<p>Improving the quality of data around housing, creating a shared and anonymised pool of knowledge around turnover, vacancy rates, rental rates and more could help developers, policy makers and government all make better decisions about the housing market, schemes for development, design for policy and regulation and an understanding of where to invest.</p>



<p>Along with this, a significant and overarching theme that came up in Domi’s early research was the issue of trust. Between landlords and tenants, between private and public organisations, between government and business, trust is an element that is lacking across the housing market. We believe that data can go a long way towards building trust between all of these stakeholders. Our hypothesis moving forward meant that transparent yet secure access to data would work to address this deeply felt and immense issue.</p>



<p>A lot of renting feels deeply private — and in fact, is currently already more public than it should be. Think of applying for a flat: in Berlin, you’re likely to apply for many apartments before you’re successful. With many if not most of those flats, you’ll share a lot of information that is both private and significant: financial records, credit checks, rental history, recommendations and references, private numbers and email addresses, even criminal history or other social checks. Whether or not you are successful in your application, it’s unlikely you’ll get any of that information back, or ever know what the property managers do with your paperwork.</p>



<p>Now imagine you’re a property manager: it’s quite common in Berlin to receive dozens of applications for flats, even hundreds in the most popular neighbourhoods. Not only do you have to sort through, rank, consider and verify a huge amount of paperwork, you also have to find a safe and legal way of dealing with that paperwork once you have it. For everyone involved, it’s a complicated and stressful process.</p>



<blockquote><p>We needed a solution not just for the exchange of information, but for the culture of management of that information.</p> </blockquote>



<p>What we needed was something that offered more finely granulated control over data. We needed a solution not just for the exchange of information, but for the culture of management of that information. The paradigm of self sovereign identity (SSI) technology was our answer. Using SSI, we could build a rental market tool that carried tenants and property managers through not just the application process but the entire rental relationship.</p>



<p>SSI is a privacy-preserving technology that we’re using to protect data and streamline the entire rental process. For tenants, it means control over your private data that you can easily share with the stakeholders who need to see it, when they need to see it. For property managers, it means verified documents presented in an accessible and manageable fashion that doesn’t leave your company open to GDPR violations.</p>



<p>With SSI, we have the technology we need to build a digital passport to access the rental market everywhere and an end-to-end digital solution for contracts and communication between landlords and tenants.</p>



<p>Beginning with a bang</p>



<p>In September 2019, we took our research, developing thoughts and ambition and founded Domi Labs. We were invited to join the <a href="https://ssiincubator.com/">SSI Incubator</a> in San Francisco, which offered an invaluable—and intense!—three months of working on our product and developing our company. We built our first prototype, delved deep into user research and refined our scope.</p>



<blockquote><p>Over the last year, we’ve gone from strength to strength, building our team, refining our understanding of the real estate market and SSI, and securing our next branch of pre-seed funding via two EU-grants.</p> </blockquote>



<p>San Francisco was a pivotal moment that has helped shape the future of Domi. The program specialised in SSI technology and helped us come even closer to grips with this new technology and the people building it. The SSI community is close-knit with a charmingly collective sense of progress: if one of us succeeds, we all succeed!</p>



<p>With our new connections and progress, we returned to Berlin, the home of Domi. San Francisco had given us a sense of the worldwide potential for our product, but Berlin has the creativity, innovations and connections to rival even Silicon Valley, and it’s a strategic stronghold and home for our company. Over the last year, we’ve gone from strength to strength, building our team, refining our understanding of the real estate market and SSI, and securing our next branch of pre-seed funding via two EU-grants from <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/">eSSIF-Lab</a> and <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">DAPSI</a>.</p>



<p>The future</p>



<p>Though our roots are firmly set in Berlin, problems with housing and the rental market are, of course, universal. Nor is the rental market going anywhere: it’s established as one of the oldest markers of human civilisation. It can go very well — or very badly. With Domi, we want to help steer it back onto the right track, reinstall trust between property managers and tenants, and make meaningful and positive change in the future of our cities.</p>



<p>In the short term, this means the German launch of Domi, our digital passport for the rental market, in 2021. Using Domi, tenants will easily and digitally provide proof of their identity and rental history without sharing sensitive documents in hard copy. Meanwhile, property managers cut their paperwork in half (or more!) and handle only the relevant information, reducing their data liability.</p>



<p>But we’re planning on expanding Domi to other European and international markets soon, and swiftly. Europe has a concept of free movement, but open immigration standards aren’t always matched by accessible accommodation options. Domi creates a universal standard of documentation that can work from Germany to Greece, from France to Finland, which is both practical and fully digital — something you can “grab and go” as you move.</p>



<p>Beyond Europe, populations and marketplaces are hungry for an option to help us communicate and trust one another in the rental sphere: no matter where you’re going, no matter where you’re from.</p>



<p>That’s why Domi went from asking a local question—why is renting in Berlin so hard?—to providing a universal answer with ramifications across the spheres of identity, technology, privacy and equality.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>On July 16th, 2020 the European Court of Justice issued its decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-US Data Protection Shield for the transfer of personal data for commercial purposes by an economic operator established in an EU Member State to another economic operator established in a third country.&nbsp; The use of cloud services is now commonplace and has been increased due to the need for working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp; In addition, unstructured files like documents, spreadsheets and slide decks that are stored in these services often contain personal data. Most of these services are owned and run by service providers located in a Third Country.</p>
<p>What does this judgement mean in detail for organizations using these services and how does Double Key Encryption for Microsoft 365 help?</p>
 Risk 
<p>There are three points at which the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the personal data can be compromised by public authorities in Third Countries:</p>
 
 During its transfer across networks, it may be accessed by third parties including governments. This access may be passive where the contents of the communication are simply copied. However, public authorities may also interpose themselves into the communication process and not only read the content, but also manipulate or suppress parts of it. 
 During its storage, by either accessing the processing facilities themselves, or by requiring the recipient of the data to locate, and extract data of interest and turn it over. 
 During processing, the data could be accessed while it is being used or analyzed. For example, when a service is being provided remotely. 
 
 EDPB Recommendations 
<p>In November 2020, the EDPB (European Data Protection Board) <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf" title="European Data Protection Board">recommendations 01/2020</a> on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data were approved.&nbsp; These recommendations provide exporters with a series of steps to follow, potential sources of information, and some examples of supplementary measures that could be put in place.&nbsp; These recommendations cover contractual tools such as:</p>
 
 standard data protection clauses (SCCs). 
 binding corporate rules (BCRs). 
 codes of conduct. 
 certification mechanisms. 
 ad hoc contractual clauses. 
 
<p>Note that - while the contractual tools are important – this blog does not provide legal advice will focus on the technical supplementary measures recommended.</p>
 Supplementary Technical Steps 
<p>The recommendations go further and indicate that contractual tools may not be sufficient and that organizations need to take supplementary technical steps to ensure the adequacy of the protection of personal data transferred. In summary the recommendations identify three major technical approaches for which example use cases are provided.&nbsp; These technical steps include:</p>
 
 Encryption – strong state of the art encryption provides adequate protection providing the keys are managed correctly. 
 Pseudonymization – as opposed to anonymization - is explicitly allowed by GDPR providing the addition data needed to reconstitute the personal data is adequately protected. 
 Multi party computing – protocols that split the data into parts that can be processed independently without any of the processors being able to reconstitute any personal data. 
 
 Encryption 
<p>Strong encryption can provide adequate protection for data being transferred against its interception and manipulation by a third-party including government actors.&nbsp; It also provides protection for stored data in the event that the recipient of the data is forced to locate, and extract data of interest and turn it over to the authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the EDPB encryption offers adequate protection providing:</p>
 
 The encryption algorithm and its, key length, and operation conform to the state-of-the-art. 
 The strength of the encryption considers the length of time the data must remain confidential. 
 The encryption algorithm is flawlessly implemented, and algorithm has been verified, e.g., by certification. 
 The keys are reliably managed and are retained solely under the control of the data exporter. 
 
<p>Public key encryption techniques can also limit access as well as detect where data has been changed. However, public key encryption depends upon the trustworthiness of the certificate authority as well as control over private keys.</p>
<p>However, in general, encrypted data needs to be decrypted for it to be processed and so further measures are needed to protect personal data during processing.&nbsp; Homomorphic encryption is often proposed as a technique that also provides protection during processing.&nbsp; However, there are still concerns about the processing overhead that limits the practicality of this approach.</p>
 Microsoft Double Key Encryption 
<p>Most cloud service providers encrypt data that is held in their service – however, by default they usually control the encryption keys.&nbsp; While this protects against certain threats such as media loss it clearly does not meet the above requirements.&nbsp; Some services provide a way for the customer to securely control the encryption keys – for example, the keys are held in an HSM (Hardware Security Module) which has been certified to be tamper proof <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final">FIPS 140-2</a>.&nbsp; In addition, they may support a secure key management protocol <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/kmip/kmip-spec/v2.0/os/kmip-spec-v2.0-os.html">KMIP</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;These are fine for certain use cases but for unstructured data more is needed.</p>
<p>In July 2020 Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/announcing-public-preview-of-double-key-encryption-for-microsoft/ba-p/1534451">announced</a> their Double Key Encryption for Microsoft 365 to help organizations to protect their mission-critical data.&nbsp; This is in addition to the data protection capabilities based on content offered by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/m365-compliance-information-protect-information/">Microsoft Information Protection’s</a>&nbsp;classification and labeling.</p>
<p>Double Key Encryption for Microsoft 365 uses two keys to protect data; one key in the customer’s control and a second key stored securely in Microsoft Azure. Viewing data protected with Double Key Encryption requires access to both keys. Since Microsoft can access only one of these keys, protected data remains inaccessible to Microsoft, ensuring that the customer has full control over their data privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The protected data can only be viewed and processed by the desktop apps.&nbsp; That is to say that it cannot be viewed using the Microsoft 365 Web apps since this would mean that the data would have to be decrypted within the Microsoft server i.e., it would potentially beat risk during processing.&nbsp; The data can be shared but only if those users:</p>
 
 Have the required permission to access the customer’s key in your Double Key Encryption service. 
 Have the required permission to access the customer’s key in Microsoft Azure. 
 
<p>However, it is not possible to access that data in a non-Microsoft air gapped environment because the service requires access to Microsoft Azure.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>The risk of personal data being held in unstructured office productivity tools is often forgotten.&nbsp; While it is easy for end users to inadvertently include personal data there are existing tools that can protect against it being exported (DLP for example).&nbsp; However, there may be a legitimate need to use office productivity tools with this kind of data and to use cloud services to store and share this data.&nbsp; Microsoft Double Key Encryption adds an extra layer of protection on top of what is already offered through the Microsoft Information Protection tools.&nbsp; If properly managed this would appear to satisfy the EDPB criteria for supplementary technical controls needed for compliance. As always security comes at a price.&nbsp; Even with standard Microsoft Azure Information Protection, some capabilities such as joint editing of documents are not available.&nbsp; In addition, when implementing DKE, the cost and complexity of managing the keys should not be underestimated.</p>

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with René Seifert, Co-Founder &amp; Co-Head at TrueProfile.io. 
<p>In episode 37, René Seifert talks about the current status of identity in the UK; the government’s recent call for evidence and DIU (digital identity unit); the resultant six guiding principles – including privacy and inclusivity; the potential of self-sovereign identity to solve some of these issues; TrueProfile.io and the importance of verified credentials in an HR context; plus the ethical, political and technical challenges of ‘immunity passports’.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think it’s interesting if we overlay this utopia of a self-sovereign identity that sounds maybe like science fiction today, and where these UK digital initiatives are geared, and my best guess is we can and will land somewhere in the middle.”</p></blockquote>
<p>René Seifert is a serial entrepreneur and co-head of <a href="https://www.trueprofile.io/" title="TrueProfile.io">TrueProfile.io</a>, a credential verification solution provider. Powered by the DataFlow Group, TrueProfile.io provides these services in a modern environment via the adoption of Ethereum blockchain. Prior to this, René was the co-founder and co-CEO of Venturate AG, a crowdfunding platform allowing regular people to invest side-by- side with experienced business angels.</p>
<p>In addition, he has been involved in founding several internet, tech and media companies, among the Holtzbrinck eLab. René, half German and half Croatian, began his career hosting radio shows and running an advertising agency parallel to his studies. He was head of marketing and presenter at the radio station Bayern 3. During the “new economy” he headed the entertainment department at Lycos Europe.</p>

<p>Java has been at the forefront of microservice architectures since they came to prominence a few years ago. It’s a popular language with well-known, high-quality frameworks, like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Data, and Spring Security.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot 2.0 introduced a new web framework called Spring WebFlux. Previous versions of Spring Boot only shipped with Spring MVC as an option. WebFlux offers a way for developers to do reactive programming. This means you can write your code with familiar syntax and, as a result, your app will use fewer resources and scale better.</p>

 Why Reactive Java? 
 
 
<p>Reactive programming isn’t for every app. The general rule of thumb is it won’t help you if you have &lt; 500 requests/second. Chances are Spring MVC will perform as well as Spring WebFlux up to that point. When your traffic takes off, or if you need to process things faster than 500 requests/second, you should take a look at Spring WebFlux.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring WebFlux’s API has a similar syntax to Spring MVC. For example, here’s the Spring MVC code for creating a new <code>Points</code> entity.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>/**
 * {@code POST  /points} : Create a new points.
 *
 * @param points the points to create.
 * @return the {@link ResponseEntity} with status {@code 201 (Created)} and with body the new points, or with status {@code 400 (Bad Request)} if the points has already an ID.
 * @throws URISyntaxException if the Location URI syntax is incorrect.
 */
@PostMapping("/points")
public ResponseEntity&lt;Points&gt; createPoints(@Valid @RequestBody Points points) throws URISyntaxException {
    log.debug("REST request to save Points : {}", points);
    if (points.getId() != null) {
        throw new BadRequestAlertException("A new points cannot already have an ID", ENTITY_NAME, "idexists");
    }
    Points result = pointsRepository.save(points);
    pointsSearchRepository.save(result);
    return ResponseEntity
        .created(new URI("/api/points/" + result.getId()))
        .headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityCreationAlert(applicationName, true, ENTITY_NAME, result.getId().toString()))
        .body(result);
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The same functionality when implemented with Spring WebFlux returns a <code>Mono</code> and uses a more functional, streaming style to avoid blocking.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>/**
 * {@code POST  /points} : Create a new points.
 *
 * @param points the points to create.
 * @return the {@link ResponseEntity} with status {@code 201 (Created)} and with body the new points, or with status {@code 400 (Bad Request)} if the points has already an ID.
 * @throws URISyntaxException if the Location URI syntax is incorrect.
 */
@PostMapping("/points")
public Mono&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;Points&gt;&gt; createPoints(@Valid @RequestBody Points points) throws URISyntaxException {
    log.debug("REST request to save Points : {}", points);
    if (points.getId() != null) {
        throw new BadRequestAlertException("A new points cannot already have an ID", ENTITY_NAME, "idexists");
    }
    return pointsRepository
        .save(points)
        .flatMap(pointsSearchRepository::save)
        .map(
            result -&gt; {
                try {
                    return ResponseEntity
                        .created(new URI("/api/points/" + result.getId()))
                        .headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityCreationAlert(applicationName, true, ENTITY_NAME, result.getId().toString()))
                        .body(result);
                } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            }
        );
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In this guide, I’ll show you how to create a reactive microservices architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Cloud Config, Spring WebFlux, Java, and JHipster.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Prerequisites</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11</a>+</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>You can find the completed source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples/tree/main/reactive-jhipster">oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples repository</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/reactive-jhipster</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a Reactive Java Microservices Architecture 
 
 
<p><a href="https://jhipster.tech">JHipster</a> is an open-source project that started as an application generator, based on <a href="https://yeoman.io">Yeoman</a>. It’s also the <a href="https://yeoman.io/generators/">most popular Yeoman generator</a>. JHipster initially allowed you to generate AngularJS and Spring apps. In the last five years, it’s become a platform with extensibility, grown a thriving community, and has saved developers many hours of pain and frustration.</p>
 
 
<p>You see, JHipster integrates everything for you. Do you want to use Angular with Spring Boot? It’s got that. React? Yep. Microservices with Spring Cloud? Check!</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster 7 beta 1 was recently released, and it packs a punch! A couple of slick features that I like are Vue support and reactive microservices with Spring WebFlux. To be fair, WebFlux and Spring Cloud Gateway have been an option since JHipster <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/2020/03/08/jhipster-release-6.8.0.html">6.8.0 in March 2020</a>, but now we have R2DBC support too!</p>
 
 
<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to generate a microservice architecture that uses OAuth 2.0, an API gateway, and two microservices (a blog and a store). The gateway will use PostgreSQL with R2DBC, the blog will use Neo4j, and the store will use MongoDB. All persistence options are powered by Spring Data.</p>
 
 
<p>Start by installing JHipster using npm:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@beta</code> 
 
 
 
<p>After installing JHipster, you can run the following command to answer a whole slew of questions and create an app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>However, there’s an easier way. JHipster has its own domain language!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Define Your Reactive Java Architecture with JDL 
 
 
<p>JHipster Domain Language (<a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/">JDL</a>) offers a way to define apps, so you don’t have to worry about fat-fingering your answer to the <code>jhipster</code> command’s questions.</p>
 
 






You can also generate your JHipster apps using <a href="https://start.jhipster.tech">JHipster Online</a>. However, it’s a bit tedious when creating a microservice architecture.



 
 
<p>Create a new directory on your machine and navigate into it in your terminal.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>take reactive-stack # mkdir reactive-stack &amp;&amp; cd reactive-stack
git init # initialize git, so apps aren't created with their own .git</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy the JDL below and put it into a <code>reactive-ms.jdl</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 application {
  config {
    baseName gateway (1)
    reactive true (2)
    packageName com.okta.developer.gateway
    applicationType gateway
    authenticationType oauth2 (3)
    buildTool gradle (4)

    applicationType microservice (6)
    authenticationType oauth2

}

application {
  config {

    applicationType microservice
    authenticationType oauth2
    buildTool gradle
    databaseType mongodb
    devDatabaseType mongodb
    prodDatabaseType mongodb
    enableHibernateCache false
    serverPort 8082
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
  }
  entities Product
}

entity Blog {
  name String required minlength(3)
  handle String required minlength(2)
}

entity Post {
  title String required
  content TextBlob required
  date Instant required
}

entity Tag {
  name String required minlength(2)
}

entity Product {
  title String required
  price BigDecimal required min(0)
  image ImageBlob
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  Blog{user(login)} to User
  Post{blog(name)} to Blog
}

relationship ManyToMany {
  Post{tag(name)} to Tag{post}
}

paginate Post, Tag with infinite-scroll
paginate Product with pagination

microservice Product with store
microservice Blog, Post, Tag with blog

deployment { (7)
  deploymentType docker-compose
  appsFolders [gateway, blog, store]
  dockerRepositoryName "mraible"
} 
 
 
 


1
The first app is an API gateway.


2
Because the gateway is reactive, it’ll use Spring Cloud Gateway.


3
The gateway and microservice apps must use the same authentication type.


4
Use Gradle, because a lot of y’all love it.


5
Vue support is new in JHipster 7, let’s use it!


6
Make sure and specify <code>microservice</code> as the application type for the blog and store apps.


7
JDL allows you to create Docker Compose and Kubernetes deployments too!


 
 
 
 






See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/applications#available-application-configuration-options">application configuration options</a> to see the possible values for the above configuration options.



 
 
<p>Import this architecture definition and generate <code>gateway</code>, <code>blog</code>, and <code>store</code> apps.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster jdl reactive-ms.jdl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>As part of this process, several Docker Compose files are generated for you. These allow you to run databases, the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a> (for service discovery), <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloak</a> (for identity), all with Docker.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Run Your Reactive Java Microservices 
 
 
<p>After JHipster finishes generating your apps, you can run them with Gradle. Assuming you’re in the same top-level directories you ran <code>jhipster jdl</code> from, you can run the following commands to start all the backend services for each microservice.</p>
 
 






JHipster has a <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/oh-my-zsh/">Oh My ZSH! plugin</a> that I highly recommend. It provides aliases for starting Docker containers and is a real time-saver. I’ve included these commands as comments below.



 
 
 
 <code>cd gateway
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d #jhkeycloakup
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d #jhpostgresqlup
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d #jhregistryup
./gradlew</code> 
 
 
 






You can run <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml logs --follow</code> to watch the logs of the JHipster Registry (or <code>jhregistrylogs</code> if you’re using Oh My Zsh and have the JHipster plugin installed).



 
 
<p>The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a> is a Netflix Eureka server that handles service discovery. When the gateway and microservices start up, they register with Eureka. This allows communication between services using logical names, rather than IP address or host names. JHipster Registry also contains a Spring Cloud Config server that can distribute configuration between apps. You can learn more about Spring Cloud Config in <a>Spring Cloud Config for Shared Microservice Configuration</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Open a new terminal window, start the blog app’s Neo4j database, and then the app itself.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd ../blog
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/neo4j.yml up -d #jhneo4jup
./gradlew</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, open another terminal window, start the store app’s MongoDB database, and the microservice.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd ../store
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d #jhmongoup
./gradlew</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>To make Keycloak work, you need to add the following line to your hosts file (<code>/etc/hosts</code> on Mac/Linux, <code>c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code> on Windows).</p>
 
 
 
 127.0.0.1	keycloak 
 
 
 
<p>This is because you will access your application with a browser on your machine (which is named localhost, or <code>127.0.0.1</code>), but inside Docker, it will run in its own container, which is named <code>keycloak</code>.</p>
 



 
 
 
 
 Test Your Reactive Java Microservices 
 
 
<p>Open <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code> in your favorite browser. You should be able to login with <code>admin/admin</code> as credentials.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Make sure you can add a new blog, edit existing posts, and add new products.</p>
 
 
<p>To prove everything works in an automated fashion, you can run <code>npm run e2e</code> in the gateway project’s directory. This will run a number of end-to-end tests with <a href="https://www.protractortest.org/">Protractor</a>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 






JHipster has support for <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a>, but it <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/12686">doesn’t work with Okta</a> yet.



 
 
 
 
 Prepare Your Reactive Java Stack for Production 
 
 
<p>Keycloak is a superb open source identity provider. It has excellent support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) and easily runs in a Docker container. I greatly appreciate Keycloak’s ease-of-use. I also appreciate Spring Security’s OAuth and OIDC support.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Security makes it so you only need to override three properties to switch from Keycloak to Okta!</p>
 
 
<p>In production, you might not want to manage your own identity provider instance. That’s where Okta comes in. We’re a developer-friendly SaaS company that provides OAuth and OIDC support as a service. You can create a developer account and use it for free. Our <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> makes it super easy.</p>
 
 
<p>Install the Okta CLI using the aforementioned website and come back here when you’re done. If you don’t have an Okta developer account, run <code>okta register</code>.</p>
 
 






You can also use your browser and Okta’s developer console to register an app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">JHipster’s security documentation</a> for those instructions.



 
 
<p>Then, from the gateway project’s directory, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Accept the default redirect URIs.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>This process does several things:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Registers an OIDC app in Okta with JHipster’s configured redirect URIs.</p>
 
 
<p>Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups and adds your user to both.</p>
 
 
<p>Creates a <code>groups</code> claim and adds it to ID tokens.</p>
 
 
<p>Creates a <code>.okta.env</code> file with the values you’ll need to talk to Okta.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Update the JHipster Registry to Distribute OIDC Configuration 
 
<p>I mentioned earlier that Spring Cloud Config allows you to distribute Spring’s configuration between apps. In this section, you’ll configure JHipster’s Spring Security settings to use Okta across all your services.</p>
 
 
<p>Add the following YAML to <code>gateway/src/main/docker/central-server-config/localhost-config/application.yml</code>. You can find the values for each property in the <code>.okta.env</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
            client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Save your changes. These values will be distributed to the JHipster Registry, gateway, blog, and store apps. Restart the JHipster Registry by running the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml down #jhregistrydown
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d #jhregistryup</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Use Ctrl+C to kill all your <code>./gradlew</code> processes and start them again.</p>
 
 
<p>Now, open a new incognito browser window, go to <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code>, and sign in. Rejoice that using Okta for authentication works!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you’re feeling lucky, you can set your Okta credentials as environment variables and run end-to-end tests (from the <code>gateway</code> directory).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>export E2E_USERNAME=&lt;your-username&gt;
export E2E_PASSWORD=&lt;your-password&gt;
npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 






Your JHipster Registry is now configured to use Okta for authentication. You’ll need to add redirect URIs in your Okta app for <code><a href="http://localhost:8761">http://localhost:8761</a></code>. After making these changes, you should be able to sign in to it.



 
 
 
 
 
 Create Docker Images for Your Microservice Apps 
 
 
<p>The JDL you used to create this reactive stack contains Docker configuration, so you can run everything with Docker Compose.</p>
 
 
<p>Stop all your apps with Ctrl+C. Stop all your Docker instances too.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)</code> 
 
 
 






Bump up the memory and CPU that Docker uses in Docker &gt; Preferences &gt; Resources. I have my Docker preferences set to 6 CPUs and 12GB of RAM.



 
 
<p>To run your reactive stack with Docker Compose, you need to create Docker images for each app. In your three different app directories, run the following Gradle command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew -Pprod bootJar jibDockerBuild</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run Your Microservices Stack with Docker Compose 
 
 
<p>Once your Docker containers are finished building, you’ll want to add your Okta settings to Spring Cloud Config in JHipster Registry.</p>
 
 
 Switch Identity Providers with Spring Cloud Config 
 
<p>Open <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> in your favorite IDE (I like <a>IntelliJ IDEA</a>) and remove the Keycloak image at the bottom. You can leave it if you like, but it won’t be used in this example.</p>
 
 
<p>Update <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code> to contain your OIDC settings that you want to share with all your microservices.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
            client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Prove Your Reactive Java Stack Works 
 
<p>In the <code>docker-compose</code> directory, run the following command to start all your containers.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose up</code> 
 
 
 






You can add a <code>-d</code> to the above command to run it as a daemon. I like watching all the log messages dance with each other.



 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You should be able to open <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code>, sign in, and access all of your microservices. Pretty slick, eh?! 🤓</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 What About Kotlin Microservices? 
 
 
<p>JHipster supports Kotlin-based microservices thanks to its <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin">Kotlin blueprint</a>, supported by <a href="https://github.com/sendilkumarn">Sendil Kumar N</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>You can install it using npm:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-kotlin</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, use <code>khipster jdl reactive-ms</code> to create the same stack you did above with Kotlin.</p>
 
 






At the time of this writing, JHipster’s Kotlin blueprint doesn’t support JHipster 7. Watch the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin/releases">project’s releases page</a> for updates.



 
 
 
 
 How Do I Deploy to the Cloud? 
 
 
<p>JHipster creates a cloud-native microservices architecture that can be deployed to many cloud providers. There’s specific support for AWS, Microsoft Azure, Heroku, and Google Cloud Platform.</p>
 
 
<p>However, if you’re doing microservices, you’ll probably want to leverage Docker as you did in this tutorial. When your apps are containerized, they can be orchestrated with Kubernetes.</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster has a <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> sub-generator that you can use to deploy it to the cloud. I’ll cover this in a future tutorial.</p>
 
 
<p>In the meantime, you can watch a presentation that <a href="https://twitter.com/saturnism">Ray Tsang</a> and I did recently that shows how to deploy JHipster microservices with Kubernetes. If you start watching from <a href="https://youtu.be/AG4z18qePEw?t=2778">46:18</a>, you’ll see Ray show how to deploy to Google Cloud using Kubernetes.</p>
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Should You Go Reactive? 
 
 
<p>As with most software architecture decisions, it depends. Are you building CRUD apps? Then no, Spring MVC is good enough.</p>
 
 
<p>Are you dealing with massive amounts of steaming data and millions of customers? Then yes, reactive frameworks like Spring WebFlux might just save you $$$ on your monthly cloud bill.</p>
 
 
<p>What about <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main">Project Loom</a>? Will it allow you to write regular non-reactive code that performs as good as reactive frameworks? I’m not sure. I’m betting on reactive for now. I think it’s a good skill to have for Java developers.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to learn more about Project Loom, I recommend listening to <a href="https://inside.java/2020/11/24/podcast-008/">Episode 8 "Project Loom" with Ron Pressler</a> from the <a href="https://inside.java/podcast/">Inside Java Podcast</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn More About Reactive Java and Microservices 
 
 
<p>This tutorial isn’t an in-depth guide to programming reactive Java microservices. That’s because it doesn’t have to be! With JHipster, you can generate high-quality reactive Java code (~70% test coverage) that’s based on fantastic frameworks like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Security.</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster also implements most of the patterns in my <a>Security Patterns for Microservice Architectures</a>. You can add dependency scanning with Snyk (based on <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/jhipster-security-scanning/">Brian Vermeer’s blog post</a>), use HTTPS locally, adopt OAuth, add CI/CD, and generate secure Docker containers, just to name a few.</p>
 
 
<p>The Spring Cloud Gateway implementation in JHipster is largely based on what I learned when researching and writing <a>Secure Reactive Microservices with Spring Cloud Gateway</a>. Spring Cloud Gateway makes it trivial to relay an access token between a gateway and microservices. It’s just five lines of YAML:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      default-filters:
        - TokenRelay</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can find the completed source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples/tree/main/reactive-jhipster">oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples repository</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/reactive-jhipster</code>
