<p></p> 
<p>The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council recently updated their Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for protecting payment card data. The latest version, <a href="https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0.pdf">PCI DSS 4.0</a>, introduces more than 60 new or updated requirements, with new directives around passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) among the most consequential.</p> 
 What is PCI DSS 4.0?  
<p>First introduced in 2004, the PCI DSS guidelines apply to any organization that stores, processes or transmits cardholder data. To demonstrate PCI DSS compliance, organizations undergo assessment on all systems that interact with the cardholder environment.</p> 
<p>In March 2022, the Council announced PCI DSS version 4.0, providing guidelines that aim to better secure account holder and payment card data within today’s evolving cyberthreat landscape. The current reigning version, PCI DSS 3.2.1, will be officially deprecated in March 2024, and organizations will be required to implement the PCI DSS 4.0 guidelines in a phased manner over twelve months.</p> 
<p>While version 4.0 contains updates across the board, some of the most significant relate to strong authentication requirements, specifically password usage and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Weak forms of authentication leave organizations and data vulnerable to brute force attacks, credential phishing and multiple other <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/overview-different-types-of-password-attacks">password-related attacks</a>. Understanding these new requirements is key for PCI DSS compliance. We look at five critical areas as well as their potential impact for your business.</p> 
 1. PCI DSS 4.0 Password Requirements  
<p>One of the biggest changes in PCI DSS version 4 is the very strict specifications regarding passwords. PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements (sections 8.3.4-8.3.9) include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Passwords must be long and complex: Under PCI DSS 4.0 requirements, passwords must be a minimum of 12 characters&nbsp;  
  Passwords must be reset every 90 days and cannot be reused: An exception is made if continuous, risk-based authentication is used, where the security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access automatically determined accordingly.  
  Login attempts should be limited: According to PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements, after a maximum of 10 unsuccessful login attempts, users should be locked out for at least 30 minutes or until they verify their identity through the help desk or other means.  
  
 Potential impact of the PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements  
<p>Longer passwords are more onerous for users and are more likely to be written down or insecurely saved in files on a device. Forced updates also tend to trigger unsafe user behaviors as people often make only minor changes that hackers are likely to guess. Moreover, all these requirements are likely to result in higher help desk calls. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-forrester-tei-of-hypr">Recent research from Forrester and HYPR</a> shows that the average help desk call costs organizations $42.50/call.</p> 
 2. MFA Required for All Access to the CDE  
<p>Under PCI DSS 3.2.1 guidelines, MFA was required only for administrators accessing the cardholder data environment (CDE). Under the new PCI DSS MFA rules (8.4.2), all access to the CDE must be gated by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>. The MFA requirements apply for all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications, network security devices, workstations, servers and endpoints.</p> 
<p>Multi-factor authentication is defined as using two independent factors from the categories:</p> 
  
  Something you know, such as a password or passphrase.&nbsp;  
  Something you have, such as a token device or smart card.&nbsp;  
  &nbsp;Something you are, such as a biometric element&nbsp;  
  
<p>In its guidance on authentication factors, Version 4.0 specifically says to look at <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/benefits-of-fido-authentication">FIDO (Fast IDentity Online)</a> for the use of&nbsp; tokens, smart cards, or biometrics as authentication factors. While it stops short of requiring FIDO-based factors, some of its other guidance, as you will see below, points to a clear preference.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>The new regulations make clear that multi-factor authentication must be used every time the CDE is accessed, even if a user already used MFA to authenticate into the network under the remote access requirements (see below). This will add significant friction for workers, with potential consequences for both productivity and employee satisfaction. Moreover, most organizations, even if they already use some form of MFA, do not have the correct technology or systems to address the requirement for <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-passwordless-desktop-mfa-is-critical">MFA for desktops</a>, workstations and servers.</p> 
 3. PCI DSS Now Requires MFA for All Remote Access  
<p>Previously, MFA was required for remote access to the cardholder data environment. With this updated PCI DSS MFA guidance, anyone logging in from outside your secured network perimeter, even if they are not actually accessing the CDE, must use multi-factor authentication. This includes all employees, both users and administrators, and all third parties and vendors. This also means that any web-based access must use MFA, even if used by employees on site.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>Effectively this means that all of your workforce that are remote, hybrid or have supporting roles outside the organization must use MFA at all times. It also means that any employee using a web-based application to access your networks and systems must use MFA, even if they are on site. In addition to the cost and IT burden of implementing MFA, cumbersome MFA procedures can negatively impact both employee productivity and satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 4. PCI DSS MFA Configuration Requirements  
<p>The new standard doesn’t just cover who must use MFA and when, it also introduces guidelines on how MFA systems must be configured to prevent misuse. Many traditional MFA solutions are susceptible to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a>, push bombing and other attacks that bypass MFA controls. Requirement 8.5 specifies weaknesses and misconfigurations to assess for PCI compliance. These include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Your MFA system must not be susceptible to replay (aka man-in-the-middle) attacks.  
  MFA must not be able to be bypassed unless a specific exception is documented and authorized by management  
  Your MFA solution must use two different and independent factors for authentication  
  Access cannot be granted until all authentication factors are successful  
  
<p>As discussed earlier, the PCI DSS guidance on types of authentication factors makes reference to FIDO-based authentication. FIDO authentication is phishing-resistant, eliminates replay attacks and, depending on the FIDO solution, is inherently multi-factor.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>If your MFA solution uses SMS, OTPs or other insecure methods, it may not meet PCI compliance requirements.</p> 
 5. Strong Cryptographic Protocols  
<p>While earlier versions of PCI DSS required the use of strong cryptographic protocols to protect transactions and cardholder data, PCI DSS 4.0 extends the cryptographic requirement. With the new rules, any stored sensitive authentication data (SAD) must be encrypted using strong cryptography.&nbsp;</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>If your authentication system doesn’t properly encrypt and securely store authentication data, then it may not meet PCI compliance requirements.</p> 
 Meet PCI DSS 4.0 Compliance With HYPR  
<p>The new PCI DSS framework now aligns much more closely with the NIST SP 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines, guidance from CISA and the OMB, and other regulatory agencies that urge the adoption of FIDO-based phishing-resistant MFA and a <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a> approach.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-pci-dss-compliance">HYPR helps organizations comply with PCI DSS</a> MFA requirements as well as multiple other provisions included in the standard. HYPR replaces the traditional password-based approach with secure passwordless authentication that is certified by FIDO and based on passkeys. Core elements of the solution, such as the incorporation of biometric authentication, possession of a trusted device, and cryptographic tokens securely stored on the device TPM or secure enclave, ensure strong, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication that meets PCI DSS requirements.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;At the same time, HYPR greatly improves the user experience, eliminating the need for long, complex passwords and streamlining multi-factor authentication to a single user gesture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While there’s never been doubt about the importance of digital security, over the last few years it seems to have garnered a lot more attention – specifically by governments across the globe. That’s no surprise given some of the issues being looked at such as the growth of connected devices and services in the IoT space, for example. But one area that is seeing an increase in calls to action these days is mitigating the threat quantum computers will pose to traditional public key cryptography in use today.</p>
<p>Late last year, we saw an abundance of specific direction coming out of the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/how-government-action-is-providing-a-blueprint-for-post-quantum-preparedness/">United States</a>. This direction came in the form of the NSA releasing the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/the-nsa-releases-a-post-quantum-preparedness-timeline-that-begins-immediately/">CNSA 2.0 Timeline</a>, which outlined the timeline for the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The timeline spans several years and acknowledges the need to plan and budget for the transition, but it also states that – at least for software and firmware signing – the transition needs to begin immediately. Further, the White House issued not one, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf">but two</a> clear calls to action for government agencies to begin preparing for the quantum threat by designating a lead for collecting cryptographic information systems by December 2022, and then they must have also performed a cryptographic inventory by May 4, 2023.</p>
<p>But attention around the quantum threat and the need to migrate to post-quantum cryptography isn’t limited to the United States. This is a global issue, and as such, has garnered global attention. Here are a few examples:</p>
 
 The General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) of the Netherlands very recently <a href="https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2023/04/04/the-pqc-migration-handbook">released a handbook</a> that advises all organization to start preparing for the quantum threat now, and it also provides some clear steps to begin on that journey. 
 The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) produced a <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/post-quantum-cryptography-current-state-and-quantum-mitigation">report</a> that outlines what organizations can implement now to ensure their data remains secure, including the strategy of choosing a hybrid implementation, which would mix traditional cryptography with quantum-safe cryptography. 
 The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany published its own <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Brochure/quantum-safe-cryptography.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4">guide</a> with the intent of outlining the threat, demystifying PQC, and making recommendations on how to prepare. 
 The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) in France has a <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2022/01/anssi-technical_position_papers-post_quantum_cryptography_transition.pdf">position paper</a>. The paper expresses France’s views on the quantum threat – including that the threat should be considered today to address the current threat of “harvest now, decrypt later,” where sensitive data is being collected by bad actors today, with the intent of decrypting it once a quantum computer is capable. 
 
<p>One thing all the above countries and more (such as Canada, the UK, and Australia) have in common is everyone is awaiting the results of the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) competition and the subsequent standards. NIST kicked off a post-quantum cryptography competition, announced the first set of winners in the summer of 2022, and is expected to release draft standards any day now. Although a few European countries have been looking at other algorithms, that’s merely to have options on top of what NIST recommends. A recent <a href="https://www.epc.eu/content/PDF/2023/Cybersecurity_DP.pdf">discussion paper</a> out of the European Policy Centre drives home the importance of a coordinated European action plan, but really this needs to be a global coordination to avoid fractured standards. NIST is seen as the gold standard for independent, open, and transparent competitions, so ideally once NIST comes out with its final recommendations, that will result in international standards and adoption.</p>

<p>Creating a strong and trusted organisational identity is fundamental to secure and efficient business. A highly assured organisational identity can help to differentiate an organisation from its competitors by presenting a verified, recognisable touchpoint that builds trust in your interactions. This blog explores the value of a highly assured organisational identity, as discussed by Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, when he joined Michael Becker of Identity Praxis and Randy Warshaw of Provenant at the recent Mobile Ecosystem Forum (MEF) event in London:</p>
<p></p>
 Organisation Identity builds trust and opens up efficiencies 
<p>In a previous blog, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/corporate-identities-trustworthy/" title="Corporate identities are public, we help to make them trustworthy">Corporate identities are public, we help to make them trustworthy</a>, we considered how a lack of trust can impact an organisation, and also the true cost of organisational misrepresentation. There are many examples of the negative impact caused by bad actors faking an organisation identity. For example, the infamous case involving a fake Eli Lilly Twitter account declaring free insulin, which caused a $15b fall in the company’s market cap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Utilising strong organisation identity helps avoid these kinds of misrepresentations.</p>
<p>Embracing organisation identity also has a positive impact on an organisation’s bottom line. This is highlighted in the case of the Finnish Government where Ubisecure provided the Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) solution that connected the Finnish business registry (containing the organisation identities) with verified individual identities. The solution allowed individuals to assert their legitimate representation of their organisation, or delegate digital representation onwards to other organisations or individuals, such as external accountants or payroll providers. Tax filing transactions could then be automated, resulting in 99% cost reductions over the traditional in-person approach. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="See the case study">See the case study</a>.</p>
 <p>Delegation Tree Example</p> 
 The Legal Entity Identifier is the most compelling Organisation Identity 
<p>There are a number of Organisation Identifiers available today (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/comparing-organisation-identifiers/" title="read more about the comparisons">read more about the comparisons</a>). Some are regional, some vertical, some closed to the public… but only one is truly global, standardised and trustworthy to be the one Organisation Identity on which we base all future identity services – and that is the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).</p>
<p>There is considerable value in combining Organisation Identity (via the LEI), verified Individual Identities (via BankID, eIDs and other initiatives), and delegation capabilities (via IAM services). The combination enables businesses to express:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who you are, who you represent and the rights that you have to represent them.</p></blockquote>

<p>The race to innovate has likely left you (and many, many others) with unexpectedly high cloud bills and/or underutilized resources. In fact, according to Flexera’s <a href="https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud">2023 State of the Cloud report</a>, for the first time in a decade,&nbsp;“managing cloud spend” (82%) surpassed “security” (79%)&nbsp;to become the number one challenge facing organizations across the board.</p>



<p>We get it. Overprovisioning is the go-to strategy for avoiding performance risks.</p>



<p>Trying to find the balance between performance and efficiency is anything but a walk in the park. Sure, there are endless <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> cost monitoring tools available that allow you to keep tabs on various aspects of your cluster’s resource usage, like CPU, memory, storage and network. Tracking these metrics can help identify resource-intensive workloads, inefficient resource allocation or unnecessary resource consumption that may lead to increased costs.</p>



<p>All this time-consuming monitoring is closely followed by the labor-intensive work of rightsizing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers">containers</a> and setting auto-scaling policies and thresholds. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Hello, automation 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic</a> optimizes your Kubernetes environment through container rightsizing, pod suspension and provisioning, pod moves and cluster scaling actions. Every layer of the stack is analyzed and resourced based on real-time demand—from pods and services to containers to nodes, as well as the underlying cloud infrastructure. It’s purpose-built to help your teams automate and quickly achieve significant and continuous results.</p>



<p>Turbonomic supports all upstream versions of Kubernetes—Red Hat OpenShift, EKS, AKS, GKE and more—on any cloud, in any <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a> and with any <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid</a> or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">multicloud</a> combination. It understands the resource needs of your applications and continuously determines the actions that ensure the apps get exactly what they need to perform.</p>



<p>Let’s begin by looking at your container clusters.</p>







<p>Here you see your top clusters sorted by health, followed by top node pools sorted by potential savings. This dashboard provides a great overview of what you want to keep an eye on, but let’s take a look at what really matters—the actions.</p>







<p>In this example, we see an action to resize a workload controller (a container). As the action shows, resizing here will improve performance. With Turbonomic, every action includes the data to back it up, as well as details around the action’s impact.</p>







<p>In this next example, we see an action to suspend a node, which will improve efficiency. By how much, you ask?</p>







<p>Look at how much is saved just by suspending this one unused node.</p>



<p>Still, it can be unnerving for application owners and development teams to scale back resources. We get it. Performance is paramount.</p>



 Turbonomic is all about performance 



<p>Turbonomic makes sure your apps get exactly what they need when they need it. The efficiency gains are a byproduct of that.</p>



<p>Have your app owner take it. It’s a low-risk way to get comfortable with automation. In fact, some of these actions are non-disruptive and reversible. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, because every action also comes with metrics and the reasoning behind it, teams have an easier time trusting the decision to act. You need that trust in order to move from human decision-making to operationalizing automation.</p>



 An observability platform’s best friend 



<p>If you have application data from critical tools like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana">IBM Instana Observability</a> or any other application performance monitoring (APM) solution, Turbonomic can understand the response time and transactions of the application, stitching this application data to the Kubernetes platform and the infrastructure on which it runs.</p>







<p>You and everyone else see exactly how dynamic resourcing improves application performance while minimizing cost.</p>







<p>See here—even as demand fluctuates, response times are kept low.</p>



<p>If you have predefined service level objectives (SLOs), Turbonomic can ingest that data to dynamically scale <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservice</a> applications out and back based on demand to ensure those SLOs are always met. SLO policies can also be configured directly on the platform.</p>



<p>You can gradually take more and more actions, then integrate them with your pipelines and processes. Whether it’s Slack, GitOps, TerraForm, Ansible, ServiceNow or others, Turbonomic’s got you covered.</p>



<p>Feel free to start with small steps to get started, but unlocking Kubernetes elasticity for continuous performance at the lowest cost requires automation.</p>



 Let IBM Turbonomic handle it 



<p>With Turbonomic, you can automate these micro-improvements at a rate that exceeds human scale. Remove the labor-intensive work of rightsizing containers and setting auto-scaling policies and thresholds and let the software do it for you based on real-time application demand. The cumulative effect of these micro-improvements is Kubernetes applications that perform exactly like they should at the lowest cost possible.</p>



<p>In other words, put those performance-risk nightmares to bed.</p>

<p>The financial world has been revolutionized by blockchain technology, which has enabled peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. The introduction of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) has added a new dimension to blockchain technology that transforms the future of payments for businesses and individuals.</p>



<p>Some time ago, banks and governments started <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/why-central-banks-dislike-cryptocurrencies/">shifting their attention towards using digital assets in their operations and economies</a>. The executive order from the President of the United States, “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/">Responsible Development of Digital Assets</a>,” is one example of the public acknowledgment for the need for prudent development of such assets. Banks and governments are actively seeking CBDC because it is a more secure alternative to crypto.</p>



 Digital currency and blockchain lead to greater integrity and efficiency 



<p>CBDC is a digital form of fiat—money that is issued by central banks. It is designed to be a digital representation of the country’s physical currency. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, CBDC is backed by the government and is legal tender. The aim of CBDC is to improve the efficiency of payments and reduce the cost of printing, storing and transporting physical cash.</p>



<p>CBDC operates on a secure, transparent blockchain network, and it uses blockchain technology to create an immutable record of all transactions. This means that all transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger, making it impossible to modify or tamper with the data.</p>



<p>On the other hand, blockchain uses a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that allows for the secure and transparent recording of transactions. It consists of a decentralized network of computers, each of which maintains a copy of the ledger. Whenever a new transaction is added to the ledger, the network of computers uses complex cryptographic algorithms to verify and add it to the existing chain of transactions in a way that ensures the integrity of the ledger.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology is characterized by its transparency, security and immutability. Transactions recorded on the blockchain are visible to all participants in the network, making it a highly transparent system. This technology has numerous potential applications in the financial services industry, supply chain management, voting systems and more. It is seen as a promising technology for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/za-en/topics/what-is-blockchain%20/%20https:/www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-blockchain">increasing transparency, reducing fraud and enabling secure peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries</a>.</p>



 CBDC and the secure, inclusive future of payments 



<p>CBDC has the potential to transform the future of payments. It can be used to create programmable money that can be spent only on specific things. For example, a government could issue a stimulus package that can only be spent on certain goods and services. This would ensure that the money is spent in the intended manner and would reduce the risk of fraud.</p>



<p>Also, CBDC can improve financial inclusion. According to the World Bank, around <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview#:~:text=However%2C%20close%20to%20one%2Dthird,or%20out%20of%20the%20workforce">1.7 billion people do not have access to basic financial services</a>. CBDC can solve this problem by providing a digital currency that anyone with a smartphone can use, without the need for a bank account.</p>



<p>When a CBDC holder uses their phone as a medium for transactions, it becomes crucial to establish a strong link between their digital identity and the device they are using. This link is essential to ensure that the right party is involved in the transaction, mitigating the risk of fraud and promoting trust in the digital financial ecosystem. That said, CBDC and the digital identity can work together to improve financial inclusion. Here are some points to consider:</p>



 
 Reliable identification: Digital identity provides a means to reliably identify individuals participating in financial transactions. By linking a person’s unique digital identity to their CBDC wallet, the central bank can authenticate their identity and establish trust in the digital payment system. 



 Access to financial services: Many individuals, particularly those in underserved or remote areas, lack access to traditional banking services. By enabling CBDC transactions on mobile phones, individuals can participate in the formal financial system without the need for a physical bank account. This extends financial services to unbanked or underbanked populations, fostering financial inclusion. 



 Secure transactions: By securing digital identity and authenticating the device, CBDC transactions become more secure. It ensures that only authorized individuals can access and use the CBDC wallet on their phones, reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud. This security builds trust in the system, encouraging individuals to adopt CBDC and engage in digital financial transactions. 



 Inclusive digital ecosystem: When CBDC is coupled with digital identity, it can enable interoperability across various digital financial services. It allows individuals to connect their CBDC wallet with other digital platforms, such as e-commerce, digital lending or insurance services. This integration creates an inclusive digital ecosystem, empowering individuals to access a range of financial services conveniently and securely. 
 



<p>Moreover, CBDC can reduce the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. Blockchain technology can be used to create an immutable record of all transactions, making it easier to track the movement of money and identify suspicious activity.</p>



 CBDC represents a significant opportunity for the financial industry 



<p>CBDC is a relatively new development in the world of finance, and its emergence has created several opportunities in the market:</p>



 
 Improved payment systems: CBDC can improve payment systems by providing a secure, fast and low-cost payment method. It can potentially replace cash (which is more expensive to produce and manage) with a digital currency that can be easily transferred between parties. 



 Increased efficiency: CBDC reduces the need for intermediaries in the payment process, which lowers transaction costs and increases speed. 



 Enhanced monetary policy: CBDC can provide central banks with better control over monetary policy by allowing for more direct control over money supply and velocity, and by granting them visibility over payment flows. Central banks can evaluate performance with real-time economic behavior instead of relying on lagging indicators to assess the health of the economy. 



 New business models: The introduction of CBDC can create new business models (such as digital wallets and omnichannel payment solutions) that can provide value to consumers and businesses. 
 



<p>CBDC could be the future of payments, and it will be interesting to see how the market evolves as more central banks begin to explore and adopt this technology. It has the potential to revolutionize the financial world by providing a digital currency that is more efficient, secure and transparent.</p>

<p>IBM is the official digital innovation partner of the US Open Tennis Championships. It’s a relationship that goes much deeper than courtside logo placement. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/ibmix">IBM iX</a>, the experience design arm of&nbsp;IBM Consulting, and IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/artificial-intelligence">AI consultants</a> work with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) to integrate technology from dozens of partners, automate key business processes and develop new features.</p>



<p>Most importantly though, the teams focus on delivering world-class digital experiences to fans. “We need to constantly innovate to anticipate fans’ needs and delight them with new experiences,” says Kirsten Corio, Chief Commercial Officer at the USTA.</p>



<p>This year, innovation at the US Open was facilitated and accelerated by <a href="http://ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a>, IBM’s new AI and data platform for the enterprise. The use of watsonx represents a step change for the organization, in that it combines machine learning and generative AI capabilities and empowers non-technical users to discover new insights that can inform new features.</p>

 Leveraging watsonx to drive deeper engagement 



<p>For several years, the US Open had drawn on IBM’s expertise to automate the creation of AI-generated highlight reels—a solution that earned the IBM sports and entertainment team <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-ibm-sports-and-entertainment-partnerships-transform-an-industry-and-win-an-emmy/">an Emmy® Award</a>. But the clips had been silent and uncaptioned. This year, the IBM Consulting team helped the USTA draw on the generative AI capabilities of <a href="http://ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a> to create audio and text commentary in near real-time. The platform enables the USTA to fine-tune its unique data and domain knowledge—drawing on match statistics, rankings and predictions—and combine it with natural language processing tools to generate accurate and compelling commentary. It’s an example of how enterprise-ready, scalable AI can help organizations serve their customers better—in this case, providing coverage for every singles match, not just the ones on the show courts.</p>



<p>Building on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/us-open-2022-ai/">previous innovations</a> that provide up-to-the-minute predictions of performance based on player momentum from the first round to the finals, this year also sees the introduction of AI Draw Analysis at the US Open. Derived from a combination of structured and unstructured data (with large language models facilitated by <a href="http://ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a>), AI Draw Analysis ranks every player’s draw on a favorability scale, shows a measure of advantage or disadvantage and lets fans explore these measures across all possible matchups as players progress through the tournament.</p>



 A collaborative process that drives innovation 



<p>Creating digital experiences that drive enthusiasm requires a human lens. To achieve that, the US Open digital strategy team partners closely with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/ibmix">IBM iX</a>. IBM iX uses collaborative design thinking brought to life by the <a href="http://ibm.com/garage">IBM Garage</a> methodology—an end-to-end model for accelerating digital transformation—to address challenges within a variety of management frameworks including lean startups, human-centered design, agile and DevOps.</p>



<p>Beyond solving the problems at hand, co-creating with IBM Garage can be a transformative experience for organizations, helping them prioritize their development queue, iterate solutions and evaluate them in a cycle of ongoing improvement. Using this method, IBM and the GRAMMYs <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sports/grammys/">delivered artist insights</a> for live coverage based on automated AI analysis of millions of articles.&nbsp;In another major sporting event partnership, IBM and the Masters® <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/masters/">built a digital platform</a> to scale the capabilities of the Masters Digital team.</p>



 Supporting organizations as they transform with watsonx 



<p>Watsonx makes traditional and generative AI more accessible to enterprises than ever before—and IBM Consulting is there to support organizations as they take advantage of the platform. Our practice brings expertise in generative AI technology stacks, access to a growing family of foundation models from IBM, plus domain and industry experience to help clients accelerate adoption and AI-driven digital transformation. This expertise will also extend to the robust governance component of watsonx, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">watsonx.governance</a>, to be released later this year.</p>



<p>Over 30 years in, IBM and the US Open continue to overcome new challenges and engage fans with new experiences. For a tournament, fan expectations and technology that are always evolving, this partnership keeps the USTA ahead of the ball.</p>

<p>As the tournament’s official digital innovation partner, IBM has helped the US Open attract and engage viewers for more than three decades. Year after year, <a href="http://ibm.com/consulting">IBM Consulting</a> works with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) to transform massive amounts of data into meaningful insight for tennis fans.</p>



<p>This year, the USTA is using <a href="http://ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a>, IBM’s new AI and data platform for business. Bringing together traditional machine learning and generative AI with a family of enterprise-grade, IBM-trained foundation models, watsonx allows the USTA to deliver fan-pleasing, AI-driven features much more quickly. With watsonx, users can collaborate to specialize and deploy models for a wide variety of use cases, or build their own—making massive AI scalability possible.</p>



 Watsonx powers AI-generated tennis commentary 



<p>This year the US Open is using the generative AI capabilities of watsonx to deliver audio commentary and text captions on video highlight reels of every men’s and women’s singles match. Fans can hear play-by-play narration at the start and end of each reel, and for key points within. The AI commentary feature will be available through the US Open app and the <a href="https://www.usopen.org/">US Open website</a>.</p>



<p>The process to create the commentary began by populating a data store on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">watsonx.data</a>, which connects and governs trusted data from disparate sources (such as player rankings going into the match, head-to-head records, match details and statistics).</p>



<p>Next, the teams trained a foundation model using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a>, a powerful studio for training, validating, tuning and deploying generative AI models for business. The US Open’s model was trained on the unique language of tennis, incorporating a wide variety of contextual description (such as adjectives like brilliant, dominant or impressive) based on lengths of rallies, number of aces, first-serve percentages, relative rankings and other key stats.</p>



<p>Beyond helping enterprise clients embed AI in their daily workflows, watsonx helps them manage the entire AI lifecycle. That’s why the US Open will also use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">watsonx.governance</a> to direct, manage and monitor its AI activities. It will help them operationalize and automate governance of their models to ensure responsible, transparent and explainable AI workflows, identify and mitigate bias and drift, capture and document model metadata and foster a collaborative environment.</p>



 Using watsonx to provide wide-ranging Match Insights 



<p>The US Open also relies on watsonx to provide Match Insights, an engaging variety of tennis statistics and predictions delivered through the US Open app and website.</p>



<p>For example, the IBM Power Index is a measure of momentum that melds performance and punditry. Structured historical data about every player is combined with an analysis of unstructured data (language and sentiment derived from millions of news articles about athletes in the tournament), using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">watsonx.data</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a>. As play progresses, a further 2.7 million data points are captured, drawn from every shot of every match. This creates a rich, up-to-the-minute data set on which to run predictive AI, project winners and identify keys to match success. The Power Index provides nuanced and timely predictions that spark lively engagement and debate.</p>



<p>When a tournament draw is released, pundits and fans often assess each player’s luck and path through the field: do they have a “good draw” or a “bad draw”? This year, IBM AI Draw Analysis helps them make more data-informed predictions by providing a statistical factor (a draw ranking) for each player in the men’s and women’s singles events. The analysis, derived from structured and unstructured data using watsonx, determines the level of advantage or disadvantage for each player and is updated throughout the day as the tournament progresses and players are eliminated. Every player has their draw ranked from 1 (most favorable) to 128 (most difficult). Fans can also click on individual matches to see a projected difficulty for that round.</p>



<p>Based on the AI Draw Analysis, users of the US Open app can explore a player’s road to the final and the difficulty of a player’s draw. The AI Draw Analysis feature shows potential matchups, informed by player data derived from the Power Index. For matches in progress, fans can also follow the live scores and stats provided by IBM SlamTracker.</p>



 A new era of scalable enterprise AI 



<p>Through their longstanding partnership, the IBM and the USTA collaborate to explore new ways to use automation and AI to deliver compelling fan experiences at the US Open. This year’s innovations demonstrate how <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a> can help organizations quickly and effectively implement both predictive and generative AI technologies. Through a collaborative, centrally governed environment that empowers non-technical users to make the most of their organization’s high-quality data and leverage foundation models trained on IBM-curated datasets, watsonx opens the door to true AI scalability for the enterprise.</p>

<p>More than <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">62 per cent</a> of US companies plan to incorporate a <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">decentralized identity</a> (DI) solution into their operations, with <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">74 per cent</a> likely to do so within a year, according to a recent <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">survey</a>.</p>



<p>The DI (or self-sovereign identity) industry is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2023/02/07/forbes-blockchain-50-2023/?sh=60880ea6319d">predicted</a> to explode in value from USD 0.65 billion in 2022 to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decentralized-identity-market-worth-102-130000466.html">USD 102.0 billion</a> by 2030, and Forbes recently listed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2023/02/07/forbes-blockchain-50-2023/?sh=60880ea6319d">50 smart companies</a> investing in blockchain (beyond crypto) to make their businesses operate better, faster or cheaper. Blockchain is the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">“anchor of trust”</a> for DI.</p>



<p>The leading DI solution anchored in blockchain is a fully user-controlled <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">digital identity wallet</a>, in which the user accepts, securely stores, and shares <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">digital identity and other verified documents</a> to prove their identity or credentials with services.</p>



<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_14zTBLJ_Y">short video</a> about the new European digital identity wallet as an example.</p>



<p>Digital wallets and other DI applications can deliver immediate business value from:</p>



 
 new revenue opportunities (e.g. a customer wallet offering) 



 cost saving opportunities (e.g. replacing inefficient processes) 



 solving common business problems (e.g. easing the regulatory compliance burden). 
 



<p>Read our whitepaper, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">Realizing the Business Value of Decentralized Identity</a>.</p>



 DI has the potential to benefit all industries and sectors. Here are 17 industries that can leverage Decentralized identity technology right now: 



<p></p>



  
 1. Banking and finance:  



<p>DI has massive application in this industry, including for customer-controlled onboarding, consent and data management; streamlined AML and KYC processes; secure and tamper-proof authentication, including for cross-border transactions; and fraud prevention. The <a href="https://www.itsme-id.com/en-BE">itsme</a> app in Europe, built by Belgium Mobile ID, a large consortium of Belgium’s leading banks and mobile network operators, is a great example.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 2. Healthcare:  



<p>COVID-19 accelerated the already real need for secure and private interoperable e-health. Scope for DI applications includes in secure patient identity management; secure and standardized health information exchange, data privacy and consent management; better clinical trial recruitment and data integrity and transparency; simpler medical credentialing and licensing; and more efficient health insurance processes, including claims processing. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9907408/">US</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-standard-reports/nhs-digital-staff-passport">UK</a>, and other jurisdictions are well ahead this work.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 3. Farming and mining:  



<p>Regulated industries, such as farming and mining, require members to comply with established regulations and to perform compliance reporting to government agencies. These two industries generate significant greenhouse gas, and must therefore regularly submit greenhouse gas emission reports to government agencies. Cost of compliance to regulation can be significant, especially when dealing with multiple government agencies. DI-based <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a> are a very promising solution for compliance regulation, and are already used in a number of regulatory environments including <a href="https://trustalliance.co.nz/">Trust Alliance New Zealand</a> and the <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">Energy Mines and Digital Trust project</a> in British Columbia.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 4. Government and public administration:  



<p>Governments are one of the pioneers of secure and portable digital identities for identity verification and KYC processes for functions such as issuing official documents, accessing public services, or conducting financial transactions. DI is also applicable for border control and travel processes using digital passports and travel credentials; managing public health initiatives and crises including vaccinations; more efficient financial inclusion and aid distribution; and secure and interoperable data sharing. This <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/digital-identity-services/trends">article</a> lists many examples of government digital ID at various stages of implementation, including the United Nations (UN) and World Bank&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/">ID4D</a>&nbsp;initiative which aims to provide everyone on the planet with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/inspired/legal-identity">legal identity</a>&nbsp;by 2030.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 5. Education:  



<p>Another of the most common early use cases for DI is education. DI offers a secure and tamper-proof way to issue and manage digital credentials and certificates and to authenticate identities for online learning in the education sector. Institutions can issue diplomas, degrees, or certificates as <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a>, which students and alumni can easily share with employers, other educational institutions, or credential verification services. DI also simplifies the hiring process, promotes trust, boosts cross-institutional research, reduces administrative burdens, simplifies consent management, and limits fraud risk. Read this <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2022/4/self-sovereign-identity-user-scenarios-in-the-educational-domain">deep dive</a> on developments and benefits to date.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 6. Travel and hospitality:  



<p>This is a booming use case thanks partly to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we’re already seeing applications of DI to streamline traveller verification processes, such as airport security checks and immigration procedures as well as hotel check-ins, to bolster security, free up resources and ease congestion. Travelers store data and biometrics as a digital travel credential on a device or in the cloud. The idea is to create a single sign-on experience for travellers for a seamless journey across all different aspects of travel. There are already around <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/digital-identity-services/trends">1.2 billion ePassports</a> in use worldwide and smart borders are progressing rapidly. And check out the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">Aruba Happy One Pass (Aruba HOP) app</a> which allows an air traveler to create a digital travel credential (DTC) from their passport, and is a collab between Indicio, SITA and Aruba.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 7. Identity and access management (IAM):  



<p>This is a foundational area for DI and you can read our whitepaper, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2022/10/innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">Innovating Identity and Access Management with Decentralized Identity</a>. DI transforms IAM systems by providing people with their digital IDs and credentials, to improve authentication processes, and simplify user access across different platforms and services.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 8. Supply chain and logistics:  



<p>DI can deliver reliable product authentication, verification, transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain; streamline the process of verifying supplier identities and credentials; enable secure data sharing and collaboration; limit counterfeiting; streamline customs and border control processes to reduce paperwork and fraud and speed up customs clearance procedures; aid compliance; and support financing, insurance, and recall processes.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 9. Non-profit and humanitarian organizations:  



<p>DI can help securely identify beneficiaries, streamline aid distribution processes, and enhance transparency and accountability in humanitarian initiatives. The <a href="https://www.evernym.com/identityforgood/">Identity for Good</a> initiative is a great example.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 10. IoT and connected devices:  



<p>In a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HL_LFEdge_WhitePaper_021121_3.pdf">whitepaper</a> from Hyperledger Indy, as leader in the DI space, it says that “… by 2025, connected devices will generate more than 73.1 zettabytes of data every year—where each zettabyte is a billion terabytes. How can telecom service providers secure all these devices, manage the integrity of each device, and provide the transparency that consumers and enterprises want about how their data is used?” It proposes using DI to create a trusted platform for a telecom ecosystem that can support IoT devices throughout their entire lifecycle and guarantee a flawless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 11. Notary and legal services:  



<p>DI allows a more secure and efficient method for verifying identities, reducing the risk of identity fraud; streamlines document verification and timestamping based on digital fingerprinting or document hashes; enables use of digital signatures; and facilitates secure data sharing and cross-border services.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 12. Social media and online platforms:  



<p>The greatest use case for DI here is significantly better user control and privacy over personal information. With <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a>, users can authenticate their identity and gain trust in the network, which leads to greater authenticity of user profiles, less misinformation, and better user interactions.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 13. E-commerce and retail:  



<p>This sector can drastically improve customer trust and experience, by allowing seamless account creation across e-commerce platforms. It can also secure payments, reduce fraud, increase transparency of supply chains, and build secure peer-to-peer marketplaces.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 14. Insurance:  



<p>DI can streamline KYC processes; improve accuracy of risk assessment and underwriting; increase the efficiency and transparency of claims processing; give customers greater control over their personal data and consent management; enable use of parametric insurance and smart contracts; and facilitate risk pooling and reinsurance processes.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 15. Energy and utilities:  



<p>DI can enable secure and verifiable identities for energy consumers, facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading, and enhance energy grid management.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 16. Real estate:  



<p>In real estate and property, DI can improve property ownership verification and title management; expedite the tenancy agreement process; and enable smart contracts and escrow services to automate the execution of agreements, improve compliance with predefined conditions before funds or property are released, and limit reliance on intermediaries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 17. Gaming and virtual worlds:  



<p>Blockchain is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-gaming-how-revolutionizing-industry#:~:text=With%20blockchain%2C%20players'%20identities%20are,fair%20system%20for%20all%20players.">revolutionizing gaming</a>, with more secure transactions, identity verification, and in-game economies some of the benefits.</p>
  



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>The bottom line for any industry is that DI gives greater privacy, security, transparency, efficiency, and user experience. The game changer is that customers control their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>, which drastically improves their privacy and security, reduces fraud and other risks, and builds brand loyalty and trust.</p>



<p>DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity/">standards</a>&nbsp;are rapidly evolving to drive the interoperability of DI solutions across the internet, and Anonyome Labs is proud to contribute to the standards.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-operational-resilience-act">Digital Operational Resilience Act</a>, or DORA, is a European Union (EU) regulation that created a binding, comprehensive information and communication technology (ICT)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/risk-management">risk-management</a>&nbsp;framework for the EU financial sector.&nbsp;DORA establishes technical standards that financial entities and their critical third-party technology service providers must implement in their ICT systems by January 17, 2025.</p>



<p>DORA applies to all financial institutions in the EU. That includes traditional financial entities (like banks, investment firms and credit institutions) and non-traditional entities (like crypto-asset service providers and crowdfunding platforms). Notably, DORA also applies to some entities typically excluded from financial regulations.</p>



<p>DORA and other regulations focus on operational resilience, which is the ability to provide reliable and secure services to customers to address regulatory compliance and cybersecurity challenges. They require&nbsp;financial institutions to&nbsp;define the business recovery process, service levels and recovery times&nbsp;that are acceptable for their business. Regulators also require organizations to test business recovery processes periodically and provide documented test results&nbsp;showing that SLAs have been met.</p>



<p>As part of the risk-assessment process, entities must conduct business impact analyses to assess how specific scenarios and severe disruptions might affect the business. Entities will also be expected to put appropriate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a>&nbsp;protection measures in place. This is where new solutions with cyber resilience become part of the picture.</p>



 What is cyber resilience? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-resilience">Cyber resilience</a> is a component of operational resilience. It focuses on providing a proven strategy around data protection and business continuity in case of advanced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ransomware">ransomware</a> or cyberattacks, including scenarios where data is encrypted by ransomware.</p>



 The need for a strong cyber-resilience strategy 



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM Cost of Data Breach Report 2023</a>, the global average cost of data breach was $4.45M. In the U.S., the average cost of a data breach was at its highest, reaching $9.48M. It also reported organizations taking an average of 277 days (about 9 months) to identify and contain a breach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A strong&nbsp;cyber-resilience&nbsp;strategy that provides a unified approach—combining cybersecurity with data protection and disaster recovery methods—can help organizations protect against and rapidly recover from disruptive cyber incidents.</p>



<p>With attacks becoming more malicious and techniques more advanced, the strategies and plans to mitigate the impacts of such cyberattacks must also change. Traditional recovery plans like standard disaster recovery solutions are not adequate and must change to support these new scenarios, and it will require new thinking and teaming between disaster recovery and security teams.</p>



<p>Cyber resilience also tackles additional areas beyond the common resilience techniques of backup, high availability and disaster recovery. While these techniques are important and must be part of the overall resilience program, they will typically replicate a ransomware attack to multiple environments since they are focused on keeping the data replicated with the smallest RPO (recovery point objective).</p>



<p>A cyber-resilient solution must be considered as a separate leg of this stool, typically on a third environment, which can quickly take over while not replicating the ransomware. Cyber-resilient solutions can solve issues for compliance and close the security gaps by protecting against attacks with a host of tools.</p>



 Benefits of an isolated recovery environment 



<p>Coupled with disaster recovery, an isolated recovery environment in the cloud works in concert with standard disaster recovery in several ways:</p>



 
 It helps customize and configure the recovery process according to the unique needs of your applications. You can implement complex recovery workflows that may not be feasible with a standard disaster-recovery solution. 



 It offers more control and flexibility for comprehensive testing and validation. This enables you to verify the effectiveness of your recovery procedures. 



 It enhances security based on your specific requirements and helps meet compliance requirements. 
 



 IBM cyber-resiliency best practices 



<p>IBM infrastructure solutions enable clients to develop and manage cyber resilience across a wide landscape, including a hybrid cloud environment, while supporting compliance with key requirements from regulations like DORA. With both on-premises infrastructure and cloud-based resources, IBM can seamlessly integrate with your existing setup. You can replicate and recover on-premises systems to a cloud-based recovery environment, providing a unified and consistent recovery solution. This integration ensures that your entire infrastructure is protected and recoverable.</p>



<p>IBM cyber-resiliency best practices include the following:</p>



 
 Air-gapped protection as a fail-safe copy against propagated malware 



 Immutable storage to prevent back-up corruption and deletion 



 Clean rooms, data scanning and cleansing tools for test and validation 



 Automation and orchestration technologies as a part of response and recovery 



 Separation of duties 
 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud">IBM Cloud</a> provides the base infrastructure with the flexibility to provide trusted solutions that match compliance needs when faced with DORA requirements. Whether dedicated or used in a managed-as-a-service consumption model, IBM can easily provide the expertise for a fully compliant cyber-resilient solution independent of the production environment with <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-cr_overview">IBM Cloud Cyber Recovery</a>.</p>



<p>Learn more</p>



<p>Organizations can achieve a highly customized, flexible and resilient recovery solution by combining standard disaster recovery, backup solutions and an isolated recovery environment in IBM Cloud. The isolated recovery environment offers additional options for recovery, customization, security, integration and compliance. This enhances the overall effectiveness and control of the resiliency strategy and, at the same time, provides compliance and support for regulations like DORA—all working in concert to keep your organization’s business in business.</p>

   Learn about three AM initiatives topping IT project lists 
	<p>Access management is the front door to your organization, network, and applications and services. "Must have" initiatives that rely on access management (AM) are now on nearly every organization's IT priority list. But to get the most from these initiatives, it is essential to have the right AM solution and components in place. (Read how <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-overall-leader-access-management">KuppingerCole</a> rated ForgeRock Access Management in its 2023 Leadership Compass report.)</p>
	
	<p>In this post, we'll cover the three areas where access management is set to transform and grow in influence for users both inside and outside your organization.</p>
	
	
	 1. Passwordless Authentication is Making the Password History 
	
	<p>For years — for generations! — the user-selected password has held sway over the login experience. Alternative solutions have come along, like multi-factor authentication (MFA) hardware tokens and biometrics, but they often proved clunky, expensive, and less-than user-friendly. Market acceptance of these purpose-built devices never reached more than 30% of internal users, and consumers were often left with only weak two-factor authentication using passcodes sent via SMS (text messages).</p>
	
	<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> — the act of logging in without a password — is based on industry standards, including FIDO2, WebAuthn, and SAML, so you're not staking your career on an unproven protocol. From a high-level perspective, passwordless moves us away from a world where it's necessary to store and protect a huge centralized password database, a magnet for malicious actors. In the passwordless world, an individual generates asymmetric cryptography key pairs and stores the private keys on a mobile device or browser. The attack surface is reduced and user satisfaction skyrockets as people can use familiar devices and the convenience of biometrics to log in to their applications.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>Here's where it is essential to get access management right. There are two audiences for passwordless authentication: your consumers and your internal users. For consumers, replicating the experience they have with their mobile devices or browsers is a no-brainer — you can just use FIDO2. Where things get challenging is doing the same thing for your internal users on desktops, workstations, VPNs, mainframes, VDIs…and so on. Your access management solution needs to be able to handle all of it. Approaching your passwordless project with consumer and workforce users in mind will help ensure that you've got it right.</p>
	
	
	 2. Orchestration, Maestro! 
	
	<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-identity-orchestration">Identity orchestration</a> is the creation of dynamic login journeys for users — those that minimize friction while maintaining high security. In other words, journeys get people where they need to go, quickly and securely. In the past, all users had essentially the same login experience. These login pathways were hard-coded by developers over weeks and months and were rarely changed.</p>
	
	<p>But times have changed and now a single login pathway no longer works for everyone. Users need different enrollment options, anti-fraud checks, identity-proofing for new users, MFA enrollment, and more. Scenarios vary by whether it is an end-user customer logging in or an internal employee. Some large enterprises have hundreds of journeys designed to support their various applications and use cases they run.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>A strong AM solution includes a graphical orchestration engine that has a drag-and-drop interface so the components listed above — the identity-proofing, anti-fraud, MFA, etc. — can be dropped in, moved around, and adjusted as needed.</p>
	
	<p>One user journey can be copied, tweaked, and set up as another journey to support a different set of users. Risk assessment can be made dynamically and in real time as signals from a user's device or location are shared with the orchestration engine, enabling access decisions that allow/block the request or require supplemental authentication. When the threat environment changes, even non-technical, non-IT people, like application owners, can be authorized to make changes to their user journeys, taking the burden off IT.</p>
	
	 3. Decentralized Identity and the Digital Wallet 
	
	<p>While they are two technically separate concepts, decentralized identity and the digital wallet (DI/DW) are inextricably joined in both usage and technology (the mobile phone), where they reside.</p>
	
	<p>The concept of decentralized identity is this: since the beginning of time, if you wanted to gain access to a website or application, you had to provide information about who you are, usually in a cumbersome form-fill, to the identity provider (IdP). The IdP represents the organization (bank, corporation, healthcare entity, government entity) that owns the digital asset you want to access. This identity information usually includes your email, mobile phone number, name, address, password, but can also include myriad other items such as preferences and personalizations. The IdP acts as the central repository for this information, abiding by applicable regional privacy laws — some do this better than others.</p>
	
	<p>With decentralized identity, individual users take back control and can decide how much or how little identity-related information to share from the safety of their mobile phone's secure vault. The digital wallet concept follows the same contours with the user being able to authorize payment directly from their mobile device.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>Organizations are looking for ways to accommodate digital users with DI/DW to help them facilitate lightning-fast transactions and reduce abandoned shopping carts that result from burdensome account signups. At first glance, it would appear that DI/DW solutions would have less need for access management than traditional "centralized" identity approaches, but that's not so.</p>
	
	<p>The traditional functions of access (who gets in) and authorization (what they get to do) are every bit in play with DI/DW, and may be more important than ever. They help ensure that enough identity information is received to be able to enact a transaction, that enough know-you-customer (KYC) data is shared, that the user is still logging in with appropriate passwordless MFA, and that authentication is still logged for audit purposes. AM even plays a role in ensuring that user access and authorizations are revoked in a timely manner.</p>
	
	<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">ForgeRock Access Management</a> solution — part of the ForgeRock Identity Platform — helps organizations achieve passwordless authentication, create and drive seamless user journeys through orchestration, and supports organizations accommodating decentralized identity and digital wallet users.</p>

<p>It's been just over either months since OpenAI released ChatGPT, and already the new platform has become a household name. With artificial intelligence (AI) being one of the hottest topics in the world today, everyone from techies to the layperson is taking notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/ai-statistics/">Forbes</a>, “Over 75% of consumers are concerned about misinformation from AI.” While this new technology doubtlessly has exciting potential, it also poses new cybersecurity risks. For reasons such as this, the US Senate is getting started on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/07/tech/senate-ai-plan/index.html">new legislation</a> that specifically regulates the use of AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adapting to the challenges posed by AI in identity and access management is crucial. As security professionals, we know that we can’t protect against everything. Long ago, Ping Identity learned that as soon as we detect what bad actors are doing, they find a novel way to circumvent detection methods. Today, we are just beginning to see how advanced machine learning is being used to penetrate established authentication methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there will be challenges ahead, it’s evident that Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response (ITDR) and Decentralized Identity (DCI) can be used in conjunction with one another to combat security threats in the age of AI.</p>

 What is Fund Ring? <p>Fund Ring is a Web3 funding primitive that seeks to help Filecoin and IPFS-connected open source projects get long-term support for maintenance, security, and feature updates with monthly or annual funding. </p><blockquote>When you join Fund Ring as a supporter or a maintainer, you join a broad community of FLOSS projects. It’s like a good ol’ fashioned web ring for funding projects you rely on.</blockquote><p>Supporters can contribute to Fund Ring projects by selecting <a href="https://fundring.fission.app/">"Fund the Ring" in the app</a> and connecting any EVM-compatible wallet that allows users to add the custom FEVM network, such as MetaMask. Whenever a supporter decides to "Fund the Ring," the contributed FIL (less the gas fees) is deposited into the verified project wallet. </p><p>Open source maintainers join the ring by visiting the Fund Ring app, verifying the ownership of their Git repo with a funding proof, and deploying their own contract. We created a Fund Ring widget that the user can embed on their app's page to solicit contributions for their specific project. Only the contract owner, who has also verified that they have commit access to the Git repo, can withdraw the funds.</p><p>As a maintainer, let the ecosystem know what you need on a monthly or annual basis so you can dedicate the time to keep code maintained and secure. Run one-off campaigns to support new features.</p><p>Watch Fund Ring creator and Fission engineer Andy take us through the Fund Ring demo:</p> Why Build Fund Ring? <p>While we love <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission">Open Collective</a> and are an active fiscal sponsor and contributor on their platform, we wanted to create a solution designed with Web3 audiences in mind. One where a contributor can switch between FIL, ETH, Matic, and more to fund their favorite projects and get their own projects funded as well.</p><p>We wanted to create a self-sustaining and distributed option that empowers developers to get recurring funding on a monthly or annual basis that helps with long-term maintenance.</p><p>As well, much like Open Collective enables projects to send funds to other projects, we see a ring of projects promoting and funding each other. </p> Test the Ring <p><a href="https://fundring.fission.app/">Fund Ring</a> is available on Filecoin Calibration Testnet. As we gather more feedback and onboard various projects, we will transition to Filecoin Mainnet.</p>  As a project owner, register your project, sign and commit your funding proof to Git, and ask supporters to fund with sweet sweet testnet tFIL.  As an ecosystem supporter, get some <a href="https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/get-test-tokens/">testnet tokens from the faucet</a>, and fund some projects. You can try this by <a href="https://fundring.fission.app/fund/">funding the Fund Ring itself</a>.   Future Plans <p>Some of the upcoming features and ideas include:</p>  Support for native FIL accounts: Use <a href="https://filsnap.fission.app/">Filsnap</a>, Brave, or other native Filecoin wallets to fund (🗓 planned)  Filecoin vesting support: Use the built-in vesting features to send FIL over a month or year (💡 idea)  Filecoin multisig: Use the built-in Filecoin multisig (💡 idea)  Split support for dependencies: Show other projects in your funding widget, and allocate sending a percentage of funds to a ring of projects (💡 idea)  <p>There are many other ideas to layer on top of these basic contracts and on-chain events. For example, you could aggregate projects and allocate funds across them, present a UI for stack ranking or voting, or as an individual, create a project where you curate projects in a ring and help gather funds that go to all of them directly! </p><p>Explore the <a href="https://github.com/FundRing/fundring">GitHub repo</a> to get involved with Fund Ring, or drop by the <a href="https://filecoin.io/slack">#shared-fission channel in the Filecoin Slack</a>. We'd love to hear your questions or comments! </p>

<p>You are making a smoothie for your friends to enjoy. Already mixed with assorted fruit and yogurt, your friend Ruchir arrives with a ripe apple and gives it to you to complete your refreshing masterpiece. Now complete, you can almost still smell the hint of apple as the drink is being poured. Before your first sip, Ruchir says, “I’ve changed my mind, I need to leave and would like my apple back.” You reply, “Ah, excuse me but that’s just not possible.” We’ll come back to this story in a minute and explain how it relates to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> and trustworthy AI.</p>



<p>As the world of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) evolves, new tools like <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI’s</a> ChatGPT have gained attention for their conversational capabilities. Nevertheless, I also understand the criticality of evaluating the inherent risks before embarking on its direct adoption within our organizations. In this discussion, I explore the risks and challenges associated with ChatGPT in an enterprise context, necessitating a careful approach to its implementation. Additionally, I will emphasize the significance of adopting IBM <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a> for ensuring <a href="https://research.ibm.com/topics/trustworthy-ai">trustworthy AI</a> solutions. And when in doubt, I recommend you use the same common sense that you’ve always used when employing new Internet services.</p>



 Evolution of AI tools 



<p>ChatGPT harnesses the immense power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4">GPT-4</a>, belonging to a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/14/1069823/gpt-4-is-bigger-and-better-chatgpt-openai/">new class</a> of “gargantuan” and widely popular large language models used in various AI applications. With ChatGPT, users can ask questions, generate text, draft emails, discuss code in different programming languages, translate natural language to code and more. It stands out as a high-quality conversational chatbot that aims to provide coherent and context-aware responses.</p>



<p>ChatGPT is an excellent tool for exploring creative writing, generating ideas and interacting with AI. It is free for everyone to use, with a more advanced version available to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus">ChatGPT Plus</a> subscribers. The chatbot’s ability to remember previous conversations adds to its interactive and engaging experience. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While ChatGPT has gained significant attention and popularity, it faces competition from other AI-powered chatbots and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a> (NLP) systems. Google, for example, has developed <a href="https://bard.google.com/">Bard</a>, its AI chatbot, which is powered by its own language engine called <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html">PaLM 2</a>. Similarly, Meta recently released its impressive <a href="https://ibm.webex.com/meet/gcuomo">LLaMA2 model</a>.&nbsp;As the field of AI chatbots continues to evolve, there will certainly be increased competition and the emergence of new players. It is essential to stay updated on the advancements in this space to explore the best solutions for enterprise needs.</p>



 Why not use ChatGPT directly in the enterprise? 



<p>Direct usage of <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/chatgpt-business-security/647331/">ChatGPT in an enterprise presents risks and challenges</a>. These include security and data leakage, confidentiality and liability concerns, intellectual property complexities, compliance with open-source licenses, limitations on AI development, and uncertain privacy and compliance with international laws. Here, I explore these risks and share examples that illustrate how these risks could manifest in your everyday enterprise activities.</p>



<p>I’ll start by examining alternative solutions that aim to mitigate the risks linked to using ChatGPT directly, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx?lnk=flatitem">IBM watsonx,</a> which I do recommend for enterprise usage, because it addresses data ownership and privacy concerns through rigorous curation and governance. I will conclude this conversation by bringing you back to the smoothie story, I promise, but when I mention “your data” below, feel free to substitute the phrase with “your apple.”</p>



<p>Before exploring alternative solutions, it is crucial for companies to be mindful of the potential risks and challenges that come with directly using ChatGPT. As a commonsense reminder, the history of the internet has shown the emergence and evolution of new services (e.g., Google search, social media platforms, etc.), which underscores the importance of data privacy and ownership in the enterprise. Bearing this in mind, here are key factors that should be taken into consideration:</p>



 Security and data leakage 



<p>If sensitive third-party or internal company information is entered into ChatGPT, it becomes part of the chatbot’s data model and may be shared with others who ask relevant questions. This could lead to data leakage and violate an organization’s security policies.</p>



<p>Example: Plans for a new product that your team is helping a customer launch, including confidential specifications and marketing strategies, should not be shared with ChatGPT to avoid the risk of data leakage and potential security breaches.</p>



 Confidentiality and privacy 



<p>Similar to the point above, sharing confidential customer or partner information may violate contractual agreements and legal requirements to protect such information. If ChatGPT’s security is compromised, confidential content may be leaked, potentially impacting the organization’s reputation and exposing it to liability.</p>



<p>Example: Suppose a healthcare organization uses ChatGPT to assist in responding to patient inquiries. If confidential patient information, such as medical records or personal health details, is shared with ChatGPT, it could potentially violate legal obligations and patient privacy rights protected by laws like <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html">HIPAA</a> (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the United States.</p>



 Intellectual Property concerns 



<p>Ownership of the code or text generated by ChatGPT can be complex. Terms of service state that the output belongs to the provider of the input, but issues may arise when the output includes legally protected data sourced from other inputs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446821/microsoft-openai-github-copilot-class-action-lawsuit-ai-copyright-violation-training-data">Copyright concerns</a> may also arise if ChatGPT is used to generate written material based on copyrighted property.</p>



<p>Example: Generating written material for marketing purposes and the output includes copyrighted content from external sources without proper attribution or permission, it could potentially infringe upon the intellectual property rights of the original content creators. This can result in legal consequences and reputational damage for the company.</p>



 Compliance with open source licenses 



<p>If ChatGPT utilizes open-source libraries and incorporates that code into products, it could potentially violate Open Source Software (OSS) licenses (e.g., <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL</a>), leading to legal complications for the organization.</p>



<p>Example: If a company utilizes ChatGPT to generate code for a software product and the origin of the training data used to train GPT is unclear, there is a risk of potentially violating the terms of open-source licenses associated with that code. This can lead to legal complications, including claims of license infringement and potential legal action from the open-source community.</p>



 Limitations on AI development 



<p>The terms of service for ChatGPT specify that it cannot be used in the development of other AI systems. Using ChatGPT in this way may hinder future AI development plans if the company operates in that space.</p>



<p>Example: A company specializing in voice recognition technology plans to enhance their existing system by integrating ChatGPT’s natural language processing capabilities. However, the terms of service for ChatGPT explicitly state that it cannot be used in the development of other AI systems.</p>



 Enhanced trustworthiness with IBM watsonx 



<p>Relating back to our smoothie story, public ChatGPT utilizes your prompt data to enhance its neural network, like how the apple adds flavor to the smoothie. Once your data enters ChatGPT, like the blended apple, you have no control or knowledge of how it is being used. Hence, one must be certain they have the full rights to include their apple, and that it doesn’t contain sensitive data, so to speak.</p>



<p>To address these concerns, IBM watsonx offers curated and transparent data and models, providing greater control and confidence in the creation and usage of your smoothie. Simply put, if Ruchir asked for his apple back, watsonx could honor his request. There you go…. analogy and story complete.</p>



<p>IBM watsonx introduces three key features — <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">watsonx.data</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">watsonx.governance</a> — that collaborate to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3696275/ibms-watsonx-could-be-a-generative-ai-game-changer.html">establish trustworthy AI in a way that is not yet present in OpenAI models</a>. These features curate and label data and AI models, ensuring transparency in origin and ownership details. They also govern the models and data, addressing ongoing drift and bias concerns. This rigorous approach effectively mitigates data ownership and privacy concerns discussed in this article.</p>



<p>IBM has partnered with <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/huggingface-and-ibm">Hugging Face</a>, an open-source company, to create an ecosystem of models. Both companies are leveraging the watsonx features to curate and endorse models based on their functionality and trustworthiness.</p>



 Going forward with AI 



<p>The direct usage of AI chatbots like ChatGPT within an enterprise presents risks related to security, data leakage, confidentiality, liability, intellectual property, compliance, limitations on AI development and privacy. These risks can have detrimental consequences for organizations, including reputational damage and costly legal complications.</p>



<p>To mitigate these risks and establish trustworthy AI, IBM watsonx emerges as a recommended solution. It offers curated and labeled data and AI models, ensuring transparency in ownership and origin. It addresses concerns related to bias and drift, providing an extra layer of trust. IBM watsonx strikes a balance between innovation and responsible AI usage. Moreover, the collaboration between IBM and Hugging Face strengthens the ecosystem of models.</p>



<p>While watsonx offers enhanced trust and rigor, few models can currently match the broad range of general-purpose usage seen with ChatGPT and the GPT family of models. The field of AI models continues to evolve, and ongoing improvements can be expected. To ensure optimal results, it is crucial to understand how models are rated and trained. This knowledge enables informed decisions and allows organizations to select models that best align with their needs and quality standards.</p>



<p>By adopting watsonx, organizations can embrace the power of AI while maintaining control over their data and ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards. They can safeguard their data, protect their intellectual property, and foster trust with stakeholders, all while benefiting from curated models and enhanced transparency. As enterprises navigate the realm of AI, it is crucial to proceed cautiously, exploring solutions and prioritizing trustworthy AI.</p>

<p>It is not a matter of if an organization will be compromised, but when. An adept, well-resourced and experienced attacker could very well be your worst cyberthreat nightmare. Fortunately, if your organization engages a red team, an ethical hacker could also be your best friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conducting&nbsp;red team testing is the most realistic way to validate your defenses,&nbsp;find vulnerabilities and improve your organization’s cybersecurity posture. A red team engagement gives your blue team a chance to more accurately assess your security program’s effectiveness and make improvements. It’s also how more organizations bring a resilience-first mindset into their cybersecurity posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Find out about the benefits of red teaming, the differences between red and blue teams and what a purple team is in my previous blog post, “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/red-teaming-101-what-is-red-teaming/">Red teaming 101: What is red teaming?</a>”&nbsp;</p>



 Why red teams are important in cybersecurity&nbsp; 



<p>As part of security testing, red teams are security professionals who play the “bad guys” to test the organization’s defenses against blue team defenders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every bit as skilled as real threat actors, red teams probe an attack surface for ways to gain access, get a foothold, move laterally and exfiltrate data. This approach contrasts with the methodology behind penetration testing (or pen testing), where the focus is on finding sensitive information or exploitable security vulnerabilities and testing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> defenses to gain access to security controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike cybercriminals, red teamers do not intend to cause actual damage. Instead, their goal is to expose gaps in cybersecurity defenses, helping security teams learn and adjust their program before an actual attack happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How red teaming builds resilience &nbsp; 



<p>A famous quote states: “In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not.” The best way to learn how to prevent and recover from cyberattacks is to practice by conducting red team activities. Otherwise, without proof of which security tactics are working, resources can easily be wasted on ineffective technologies and programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s hard to tell what really works, what doesn’t, where you need to make additional investments and which investments weren’t worth it until you have the opportunity to engage with an adversary who is trying to beat you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During red team exercises, organizations pit their security controls, defenses, practices and internal stakeholders against a dedicated adversary that mounts an attack simulation. This is the real value of red team assessments. They give security leaders a true-to-life appraisal of their organization’s cybersecurity and insight into how hackers might exploit different security vulnerabilities. After all, you don’t get to ask a nation-state attacker what you missed or what they did that worked really well, so it’s hard for you to get the feedback you need to actually assess the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, every red team operation creates an opportunity for measurement and improvement. It’s possible to gain a high-level picture of whether an investment—such as security tools, testers or awareness training—is helping in the mitigation of various security threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red team members also help companies evolve beyond a find-and-fix mentality to a categorical defense mentality. Turning attackers loose on your network security can be scary — but the hackers are already trying every door handle in your security infrastructure. Your best bet is to find the unlocked doors before they do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 When to engage a red team&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It’s said that there are only two types of companies—those that have been hacked and those that will be hacked. Regrettably, it might not be far from the truth. Every company, no matter its size, can benefit from conducting a red teaming assessment. But for a red team engagement to provide the most benefit, an organization must have two things:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Something to practice (a security program in place)&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Someone to practice it with (defenders) &nbsp; 
 



<p>The best time for your organization to engage red team services is when you want to understand program-level questions. For example, how far would an attacker who wants to exfiltrate sensitive data get within my network before they trigger an alert?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red teaming is also a good option when your security team wants to test their incident response plan or train team members. &nbsp;</p>



 When red teaming alone is not enough&nbsp; 



<p>Red teaming is one of the best ways to test your organization’s security and its ability to withstand a potential attack. So, why don’t more companies opt for it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As beneficial as red teaming is, in today’s fast-paced, ever-changing environments, red team engagements can fall short of detecting break changes as they happen. A security program is only as effective as the last time it was validated, leading to gaps in visibility and a weakened risk posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building an internal red team capacity is expensive and few organizations are able to dedicate the necessary resources. To be truly impactful, a red team needs enough personnel to mimic the persistent and well-resourced threat level of modern cybercrime gangs and nation-state threats.&nbsp;A red team should include dedicated security operations members (or ethical hacking sub teams) for targeting, research, and attack exercises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A variety of third-party vendors exist to give organizations the option of contracting red team services. They range from large firms to boutique operators that specialize in particular industries or IT environments. While it is easier to contract red team services than to employ full-time staff, doing so can actually be more expensive, particularly if you do so regularly. As a result, only a small number of organizations use red teaming frequently enough to gain real insight.&nbsp;</p>



 Benefits of continuous automated red teaming (CART) in cybersecurity&nbsp; 



<p>Continuous automated red teaming (CART) utilizes automation to discover assets, prioritize discoveries and (once authorized) conduct real-world attacks utilizing tools and exploits developed and maintained by industry experts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With its focus on automation, CART allows you to focus on interesting and novel testing, freeing your teams from the repetitive and error-prone work that leads to frustration and ultimately burnout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CART provides you with the ability to proactively and continually assess your overall security posture at a fraction of the cost. It makes red teaming more accessible and provides you with up-to-the-minute visibility into your defense performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As digital transformation continues to change the way we do business and interact with various entities and organizations, cyberattacks continue to intensify and compromise user accounts and identities. Identities are the largest attack vector with weak/compromised credentials and phishing attacks being two of the most successful type of attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations are taking notice, and many have implemented various security controls such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on, and training employees to identify a phishing attack. Additionally, many run ad-hoc simulated phishing attacks to evaluate employees and retrain them to identify phishing attacks on an ongoing basis. While these trainings have been found to be effective in educating employees on what a phishing attack is, how phishing emails look, and what to look for when trying to evaluate the authenticity of an email, quite often employees are engrossed in their daily tasks and activities and will at some point get tripped up and click on a phishing link, whether simulated or real.</p>
<p>At the same time, threat actors are getting better at disguising phishing attacks, with entire criminal organizations dedicated to building services like phishing-as-a-service for other cyber criminals to use in their targeted phishing campaigns. In addition, AI technologies are also being adopted by bad actors to aid in the development of cyberattack campaigns, with services like <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/wormgpt-new-ai-tool-allows.html">WormGPT</a> (a generative AI tool for bad actors similar to ChatGPT) that allow adversaries to launch sophisticated phishing and business email compromise attacks with relative ease. These malicious AI tools use the latest marketing and branding from your websites and learn from previously successful phishing campaigns to create highly accurate phishing campaigns that can evade even the most trained eye from identifying the phishing email.</p>
<p>How can organizations protect against phishing attacks?</p>
<p>Organizations need to stop relying on employees to identify phishing emails and move to implement security solutions and controls that can prevent phishing attacks from compromising an individual’s identity. They can start by moving to a completely passwordless solution, eliminating one of the largest attack vectors – namely weak or compromised credentials. In addition, not all MFA is the same and offers varying levels of protection against MFA bypass attacks. Moving to phishing-resistant, passwordless MFA along with single sign-on (SSO) capabilities will help prevent phishing campaigns from successfully compromising a user’s account.</p>
<p>What is phishing-resistant passwordless MFA is and how does it prevent phishing and other MFA bypass attacks?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Phishing-resistant MFA</a> involves high assurance authentication with the use of cryptographic keys and digital certificates, as well as requiring the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/should-physical-proximity-be-a-required-mfa-factor/">physical proximity</a> of the user to the device from which they are requesting access to a resource. There are a few passwordless MFA options that offer phishing-resistance, namely FIDO2 keys, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/02/goodbye-passwords-hello-passkeys/">passkeys</a>, and certificate-based authentication with Bluetooth proximity detection.</p>
<p>Certificate-based authentication (CBA) is considered the highest assurance of these options. It involves the use of verified digital certificates assigned to a user and devices from which a user authenticates themselves, along with a Bluetooth proximity requirement. This ensures the user is in close physical proximity to the device from which they are accessing a resource and that the device itself is also a trusted device with a known valid digital certificate assigned to it by a certificate authority.</p>
<p>How to protect against common <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-good-enough/">MFA bypass attacks</a> with CBA</p>
<p>SIM Swap Attack – This type of attack involves taking over a user’s mobile number by having it transferred to a SIM card owned by the attacker. However, with CBA, the certificates tied to the user and device reside on the original device owned by the user and protected with biometrics, ensuring that attackers will not be successful in compromising the user’s identity.</p>
<p>MFA Prompt Bombing – In this scenario, an attacker will trigger MFA push authentication notification on a victim’s mobile device in the hopes of a user accepting one of the many prompts and granting access. With CBA, an attacker will not have access to the digital certificate on the user’s mobile device and in addition will not satisfy the physical proximity factor requirement as they initiate such attacks remotely.</p>
<p>Adversary in The Middle (AiTM) – In this type of attack, cyber criminals set up a reverse web proxy with a phishing site in between the victim and the legitimate application, or webpage. With CBA, attackers cannot successfully compromise a user’s identity as they will not have access to the certificate assigned to the user, as well as the certificate issued to the user’s device to make it a trusted device, thereby protecting against an AiTM attack.</p>
<p>Holistic and layered defense with Zero Trust</p>
<p>Given identity is one of the largest attack vectors, protecting against most common identity-led attacks with phishing-resistant authentication is a critical part of a Zero Trust framework, which provides organizations with a comprehensive set of controls to implement a strong proactive defense to protect against and reduce the impact of a breach when one occurs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">Cloud computing</a> can add a collective $3 trillion to organizations that harness it correctly, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/cloud/overview">according to McKinsey</a>. It is poised to transform businesses and industries, revolutionize how employees and other stakeholders collaborate, and drive digital transformation initiatives.</p>



<p>Many organizations have spent the past few years investing heavily in the cloud. Gartner predicted that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-31-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-in-2023">cloud spending</a> would reach nearly $600 billion by the end of 2023. There are many reasons why organizations have embraced cloud services, including improved efficiencies, cost savings, scalability, flexibility and quicker time-to-market.</p>



<p>However, organizations have considered slowing cloud spend because of recent economic headwinds. As a result, IT budgets are experiencing decreases along with overall operational budgets. Additionally, many struggle to capitalize on the cloud’s full potential due to initial cloud costs, which are driven up by inefficiencies or cost overruns due to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3678192/lift-and-shift-cloud-migrations-are-dying.html">“lifting and shifting” applications</a> or underestimating data transfer costs. In addition, companies can run up cloud costs because they provision more resources than necessary for their normal business functions. Many companies are reporting <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/more-for-less-five-ways-to-lower-cloud-costs-without-destroying-value">20–30% annual cloud cost increases</a> as a result of these actions.</p>



<p>It isn’t always easy to move from on-premises to the cloud, and it doesn’t always reduce costs initially. With the right guidance and cost management approach, a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration">cloud migration</a> can and should <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/more-for-less-five-ways-to-lower-cloud-costs-without-destroying-value">decrease overall IT costs</a>, while increasing operational efficiency and improving IT services.</p>



<p>Like other IT expenditures, cloud costs can skyrocket and threaten ROI without the right cloud management solutions. Organizations should not abandon their cloud goals because of initial challenges. Executives should remember that there is a reason why so many organizations embrace the cloud. On-premises <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> incur significant costs from labor, licenses, system maintenance and the physical location itself.</p>



<p>A comprehensive, intelligent cloud strategy done correctly often costs less than on-premises data centers and can unlock significant value for both incumbent organizations and startups alike.</p>



<p>Here are six ways organizations can improve their cloud cost management, increase <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-cloud-cost-optimization/">cloud cost optimization</a> and drive as much value from their cloud budgets as possible.</p>



 1. Take a disciplined financial operations (FinOps) approach to managing expenditures 



<p>Organizations that migrate to the cloud must embrace financial management as a core component of cloud optimization. Those who fail to do often run into expensive consequences, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-finops-way-how-to-avoid-the-pitfalls-to-realizing-clouds-value">according to McKinsey</a>, which attributed overruns to immature cloud financial management capabilities (FinOps). Cloud spend, like other IT spend, can proliferate quickly if there is no cloud management platform that provides clear cost visibility or usage visualizations.</p>



<p>Proper financial management requires FinOps—a combination of financial personnel and DevOps. It is imperative for FinOps to participate in cloud management from the beginning—negotiating pricing, setting budgets and tracking overall cloud investments. It is also responsible for rightsizing resources and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workflow">workflows</a> to understand usage patterns and chart the perfect combination of cost efficiency and value creation.</p>



<p>One way that organizations can do this is through cost allocation tagging; this provides deeper visibility into tracking cloud usage and associated costs, providing visibility into excess costs within compute and memory.</p>



 2. Build cloud-native apps when possible 



<p>Many organizations begin their cloud migrations with significant technology debt stemming from legacy apps. Technology debt occurs when organizations fail to upgrade or replace older applications at the end of their lifecycles because they had other priorities or chose to patch an issue than replace the entire application. This legacy debt can often transfer to the cloud, where the shortest path to migrating the application is “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/lift-and-shift">lifting and shifting</a>,” or rehosting. With lift and shift, IT teams migrate an exact copy of an application or workload from on-premises to public or private cloud. This is an expedient method for moving apps or workloads to the cloud, but it can incur greater costs because the “shifted” app is likely not flexible or scalable enough to take advantage of the cloud environment’s ability to scale up and down depending on data needs. Organizations need to investigate each app to determine whether they need to replace it with something <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a>.</p>



 3. Pick the best cloud provider and ecosystem for your business 



<p>Organizations with high cloud bills may not have the right cloud platform. Optimizing cloud spend is not only about cutting costs; it’s about making decisions that produce optimal results for every use case. Organizations today can choose between several services, all of which have benefits and challenges. First, organizations should discover whether the private cloud, public cloud or hybrid cloud or multicloud environments is best for their needs. Organization looking to choose the right solution should understand their specific use cases, their security concerns and the current applications that would run on the cloud.</p>



<p>The organization should also decide which cloud service type to utilize from three different options:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas">IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)</a> provides on-demand access to cloud-hosted physical and virtual servers, storage and networking—the&nbsp;backend&nbsp;IT infrastructure&nbsp;for running applications and workloads in the cloud. It enables the lowest-level control of resources in the cloud. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas">PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)</a> provides on-demand access to a complete, ready-to-use, cloud-hosted platform for developing, running, maintaining and managing applications. A PaaS provider hosts with servers, networks, storage, operating system software, databases and development tools at their data center so customers can build, test, deploy and scale applications at a faster rate and lower cost than if they built and manage their applications on-premises. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saashttps:/www.ibm.com/topics/saas">SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)</a> provides on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application software. SaaS providers will then manage the software and the infrastructure on which it runs. 
 



<p>Companies like IBM provide several <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas-paas-saas">IaaS, PaaS and SaaS solutions</a> to meet every type of organization’s specific needs.</p>



 4. Use automated cloud cost management and usage tools 



<p>The cost of cloud infrastructure can easily increase dramatically if not carefully monitored and addressed through cloud cost management tools, such as anomaly detection dashboards, cost analysis algorithms, automatic scaling, load balancing and spot instance tools, and automation. One common mistake is scaling up to meet high-demand instances, but failing to scale back down when cloud resource requirements return to normal. Intelligent tools based on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> algorithms and other predictive technologies can assist in this regard. They can track API and application usage metrics, manage an organization’s workload and avoid over-provisioning resources.</p>



<p>These tools can also forecast future usage and costs. This way, the organization can work with the cloud provider can scale up or down resources depending on real-time needs. Embracing cloud optimization tools and automation can keep costs down, especially for periods of low resource usage.</p>



 5. Consider using chargebacks 



<p>Cloud budgets can proliferate if they all go into one budget because individual business units are held responsible for their specific spend. Organizations that use chargebacks more directly attribute cloud spend based on which business unit is using the services. Chargebacks identify which business units are using more cloud services than others and attribute specific costs to those business units. Chargebacks often alter perceptions of the cloud as a “free resource,” <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3982411">according to Gartner</a>, and can drive more efficient usage.</p>



 6. Renegotiate with cloud providers 



<p>This is especially important for organizations that migrated to the cloud years ago. They may have agreements based on old expectations, reserved instances or managed services that are no longer needed. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/more-for-less-five-ways-to-lower-cloud-costs-without-destroying-value">A McKinsey article</a> provides a great question every organization should ask itself about its cloud relationship: Would you sign the existing contract that you have today given the opportunity? If the answer is no, you should attempt to renegotiate regardless of how much time is left on the current deal.</p>



 Get started with IBM Turbonomic 



<p>No organization will approach the cloud the same, but every organization should instill dedicated and methodological cost control with their cloud deployment. Failing to do so could create unnecessary costs that put unnecessary pressure on the entire IT operations. The right approach can easily cut up to 25% of the costs of their cloud programs, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/more-for-less-five-ways-to-lower-cloud-costs-without-destroying-value">according to McKinsey</a>.</p>



<p>Increasingly, complex applications run your business, and they can run your teams ragged trying to stay ahead of dynamic demand. The IBM® Turbonomic® hybrid cloud cost optimization platform allows you to run applications seamlessly, continuously and cost-effectively to help assure app performance while lowering costs.</p>

<p>In response to concerns faced by corporations about the impact of technology on our environment, IBM founded the Responsible.Computing() movement, creating a <a href="https://responsiblecomputing.net/">membership consortium</a> with Dell that is managed by the Object Management Group.</p>



<p>Customers and partners expect responsible corporate policies and practices, and they also build loyalty with employees. Responsible computing establishes a cohesive, interconnected framework across six critical domains to provide every organization the ability to&nbsp;educate on their responsibilities, define goals and measure their progress against these aspirations:</p>







 The Responsible.Computing() framework’s six domains of focus 



<p>The framework consists of six domains of focus that demonstrate how IBM reflects responsibility:</p>



 
 Data center: Reducing the environmental impact of building and maintaining data centers. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-data-center-management/">Learn more about data center management.</a> 



 Infrastructure: An end-to-end approach into the lifecycle of computing units, such as sourcing precious and rare metals and reducing their usage, reducing energy and computing units, and ultimately recycling the units 



 Code: Writing efficient, open and secure code. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/green-coding">Learn more about green coding.</a> 



 Data usage: Implementing data privacy and transparency practices and requesting consent for use and authorization for any data acquisition. 



 Systems: Producing ethical and unbiased systems, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/explainable-ai">explainable AI</a>. 



 Impact: Addressing societal issues, such as social mobility. 
 



<p>In an era where technology is pivotal in shaping politics, digital economies and transitional industries (e.g., the automotive industry), the Responsible.Computing() framework expands beyond just sustainability and climate change and adds other domains, such as ethics, security and openness.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s recent introduction of a new system for LinkedIn members marks a significant step towards strengthening workplace verification. By leveraging Microsoft Entra Verified ID, LinkedIn now offers a credential issuance system that provides members and organizations with greater confidence in the authenticity of their work connections and profile information. This expansion of Microsoft’s digital identity technology to LinkedIn introduces a new feature that empowers businesses to enable their employees to validate their employment details publicly. The implications of this feature extend beyond individual profiles, as it fosters trusted interactions and informed hiring decisions. Verifiable work histories on LinkedIn make it easier for employers to verify candidates’ qualifications and experience, leading to more efficient hiring processes. According to LinkedIn, this feature is currently operational with over 4,000 companies on their platform, and they have further plans to expand its availability to additional companies in the future. Through the utilization of verifiable credentials, LinkedIn members can establish their credibility and authenticate their work affiliations, thereby providing additional assurance to their professional connections.</p><blockquote>In this blog, we will explore the concept of verifiable credentials, their numerous benefits and the transformative impact they can have on the overall LinkedIn ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Image Credits:&nbsp;LinkedIn</p><p>Verifiable Credentials: A Game-Changer for Digital Identity:</p><p>Verifiable credentials represent a groundbreaking development in the realm of digital identification. These tamper-evident digital records contain key information about an individual, such as their name, date of birth, and contact details. Unlike traditional digital records, verifiable credentials offer a unique advantage: they can be trusted by third parties without relying on a central authority for verification. This groundbreaking feature ensures greater privacy and security for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Here is a typical process for creating and verifying a verifiable credential:</p><p>Issuer: The issuance of verifiable credentials is a straightforward process. Any entity, such as a government agency or financial institution, can create a digital record containing relevant information about an individual. The issuer then signs and encrypts this record using their private key, creating a tamper-evident credential that can be verified by&nbsp;others.</p><p>Holder: The holder of the credential, whether an individual or an organization, has full control over its management. This includes deciding who can access it and when it can be shared or&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>Verifier: The verifier, on the other hand, can check the digital signature on the credential using the issuer’s publicly available public key. If the digital signature is valid, the verifier can trust the information contained in the credential without relying on a centralized authority, thereby ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering or falsification.</p><p>Revolutionizing Efficiency with Verifiable Credentials:</p><p><a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> represent a remarkable innovation in the realm of digital identification. By granting individuals more control over their personal data while enhancing security and privacy, verifiable credentials have the potential to revolutionize how we manage digital identity. Verifiable credentials not only enhance security and privacy but also redefine operational efficiency. This transformative technology has the potential to reshape resource-intensive processes, resulting in substantial time and cost savings. The implementation of verifiable credentials empowers businesses to accomplish tasks that would typically take several days in a matter of mere minutes. This streamlined process stands to yield substantial time and monetary savings for these organizations.</p><p>Platforms like LinkedIn benefit greatly from the implementation of Verifiable Credentials. In traditional hiring processes, recruiters invest considerable time in verifying candidates’ claims. Verifiable Credentials streamline this process by granting instant access to verified data, reducing administrative burdens, and expediting decision-making.</p><p>For businesses, the onboarding of new hires becomes simplified through Verifiable Credentials. Swift authentication of qualifications, training achievements, and credentials ensures the presence of necessary skills and endorsements.</p><p>Elevating Security and&nbsp;Trust</p><p>Built on a foundation of robust security and privacy principles, Verifiable Credentials uphold data integrity and prevent tampering and unauthorized access. This cryptographic security layer ensures data reliability, minimizing identity fraud risks and misinformation.</p><p>The decentralization of Verifiable Credentials eliminates the need for a single central authority. This empowers individuals to selectively share their credentials, addressing privacy concerns and fostering unwavering trust in digital interactions.</p><p>Conclusion: LinkedIn’s Stride Towards Trust and Transparency</p><p>The introduction of verifiable credentials on LinkedIn marks a significant stride towards enhancing trust and identity verification in the professional realm. By utilizing Microsoft Entra Verified ID, LinkedIn members now have the opportunity to validate their employment details, ensuring greater transparency and credibility. <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> revolutionize the way we manage digital identity, providing individuals with control over their personal data while maintaining security and privacy. This innovative technology has the potential to transform digital wallets and reshape the entire landscape of verifiable data. As we embrace the digital era, <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> stands ready to support organizations and individuals in leveraging the power of verifiable credentials. Embrace the future of trusted and secure interactions with verifiable credentials.</p><p>For further updates and inquiries, reach out to <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/contact-us">AyanWorks</a> and stay tuned for the latest advancements in this exciting field.

  <p>In today's digital landscape, businesses face an increasing threat of fraud that can lead to significant financial losses and damage to their reputation. To effectively combat fraud, businesses need Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms (FRIPs). These advanced technologies leverage multiple data sources, data analytics, and ML detection models to proactively detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real-time. FRIPs empower organizations to stay ahead of fraudsters by uncovering hidden patterns, identifying anomalies, and generating alerts. By implementing FRIPs, businesses can mitigate risks, reduce false positives, and safeguard their financial well-being and brand image. Stay one step ahead of fraud with FRIPs and ensure a secure future for your business.<br><br>John Tolbert, Director of Cybersecurity Research at KuppingerCole, will give an overview of fraud trends and the tools businesses and other organizations can use to detect and prevent fraud. This webinar will highlight our research methodology, evaluation criteria, and some findings from the recently released Leadership Compass on FRIP. We will also show how you can view and drill down into the results of our FRIP research in our new <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/open-select/">KC Open Select tool</a>.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/fraud-reduction-intelligence-platforms"></a>

<p>Imagine embarking on a weight-loss journey without having a scale—it’s like sailing through uncharted waters without a compass. The scale serves as your trusted navigator, providing tangible metrics and keeping you on track.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, comprehending the savings realized in a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-cloud-cost-optimization/">cloud-cost-optimization</a> journey offers valuable insights into the impact of your efforts. It’s like having a financial guide by your side, showing you the tangible benefits of your optimization strategies and motivating you to keep pushing forward. It highlights the areas of potential cost reduction and helps to allocate resources effectively.&nbsp;</p>



 What’s new? 



<p>In version 8.9.3, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic</a> has overhauled the way it collects and calculates the savings achieved, providing a clear and accurate view of your cost optimization efforts:</p>



 
 It leverages the cloud provider bills to accurately determine the impact of cost optimization actions on your cloud expenses. This new approach ensures greater accuracy and transparency, effectively showcasing the tangible benefits achieved.&nbsp; 



 The functionality has been expanded to capture savings and investments across various&nbsp;<br>categories, including accounts, resource groups, regions and action types (among&nbsp;<br>others). This additional granularity empowers you to better understand the factors&nbsp;<br>influencing the cost optimization efforts, enabling informed decision-making&nbsp;<br>and targeted improvements 
 



Cumulative Investment and Cumulative Savings grouped by account 



 Engine behind the savings/investment model 



<p>Understanding the realization of savings starts with defining that an action continues to generate savings from its execution until one of the following conditions is met:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The current resource cost exceeds the cost at the time of execution.&nbsp; 



 The resource is terminated.&nbsp; 



 The resource is scaled to a tier that is not recommended by the product.&nbsp; 
 



Representation of action liveness



<p>Then this definition is applied in the savings workflow:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Once an action is executed on a cloud resource, it is actively tracked and we await confirmation of its successful implementation.&nbsp; 



 On a daily basis, the product parses and internally stores the itemized bills from the cloud provider. This continuous process ensures that we have up-to-date and accurate billing information.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Within this workflow, a constant search is conducted for matches between the executed actions and the detailed billing information. This enables us to establish a clear correlation between the actions taken and the corresponding charges incurred.&nbsp; 



 When a match is found between the executed actions and the itemized bill information, we proceed to calculate the value of realized savings and/or investments.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>To provide a clearer illustration, let’s delve into an example that demonstrates the application of this concept.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machine (VM)</a> with an initial cost of $2 per day. Assume that three scale actions are executed on consecutive days, beginning from Day 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Daily vs. Cumulative values 



 
 Day 0: The VM’s initial cost is $2/day&nbsp; 



 Day 1: A scale-up action is executed, increasing the cost to $5/day&nbsp;
 
 Investments: $5 – $2 = $3&nbsp; 



 Savings: $0&nbsp; 
 
 



 Day 2: A scale-down action is executed, reducing the cost to $4/day.&nbsp;
 
 Investments: $4 – $2 = $2&nbsp; 



 Savings: $5 – $4 = $1&nbsp; 
 
 



 Day 3: Another scale-down action is executed, further reducing the cost to $2/day.&nbsp;
 
 Investments: $2 – $2 = $0&nbsp; 



 Savings: $5 – $2 = $3&nbsp; 
 
 



 Day 4: No actions are executed.&nbsp;
 
 Investments: $0&nbsp; 



 Savings: Still $3&nbsp; 
 
 
 



<p>By analyzing this example, we can see how the defined concept of value realization is applied, calculating the investments made and the resulting savings at each step. This process captures the accurate financial impact of the executed scale actions on the VM’s costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The widgets are conveniently accessible within the cloud executive dashboard, available by default in various views such as Billing Family, Account and Resource Group. In addition to the default views, users have the flexibility to manually add these widgets to any supported entity type or create a custom dashboard. This customization allows for tailored insights using different ‘group by’ categories, enabling you to efficiently monitor and analyze data specific to your unique requirements.&nbsp;</p>



 Next steps 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic</a> captures savings and investments resulting from various optimization actions, including virtual-machine scaling, database scaling, deletion of wasted storage and volume scaling. It also captures the impact from optimizing popular PaaS services like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic/integrations/azure-app-service">Azure App Service</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an ongoing journey, and we continuously expand our support, validating the efforts invested in optimizing cloud costs. We encourage the continuation of cost-conscious practices and aim to demonstrate the value of optimization to stakeholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

   New capabilities fix security issues with MFA push notifications 

<p>Zero Trust security models call for the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized users may access protected IT resources. Many organizations are adopting MFA to add a layer of security for remote workers. Customer-facing organizations are also implementing MFA to mitigate identity-based attacks, such as phishing, and to help quash the rise in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover</a> fraud.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been compromised credentials — in other words, the use of stolen passwords. MFA renders the use of stolen credentials futile, as attackers are highly unlikely to have access to a user's other authentication factors, such as a mobile phone.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks">Microsoft</a> has stated that using MFA may stop 99% of password-related attacks within an enterprise, so an increasing number of enterprises have begun to require MFA before granting account access. That's the good news. The bad news is that attackers are now trying to undermine the effectiveness of MFA with some success.</p>

 MFA is under attack 

<p>While MFA is a vast improvement over a simple username and password combination, there are ways that MFA can be compromised, including:</p>

<p>Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: Fraudsters position themselves between organizations (such as financial institutions) and users to intercept, edit, send, and receive communications without being noticed.</p>

<p>SIM-card swapping attacks: A cybercriminal uses social engineering tactics to transfer a user's mobile phone number to a new SIM card owned by the criminal. If such an attack is successful, the victim's apps, including banking apps, can be activated on the impersonator's phone.</p>

<p>Pass-the-cookie attacks: A session or authentication cookie can be stolen and injected into a new web session to trick the browser into thinking the authenticated user is present and does not need to prove their identity.</p>

<p>MFA fatigue attacks (aka MFA spamming or MFA prompt bombing): The MFA fatigue attack relies on people to be distracted, careless, or frustrated by frequent requests to authenticate. As a new form of social engineering, MFA fatigue raises considerable security concerns.</p>

 What is MFA fatigue? 

<p>Sometimes, as a means to an end, people will engage in behavior that they know is borderline unsafe. Who amongst us hasn't disabled a smoke alarm to make the low-battery alert stop its intermittent screeching? MFA fatigue attacks rely on similar human impulses, which ultimately make users vulnerable to schemes such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a>.</p>

<p>With MFA prompt bombing, attackers attempt to get access to an account or device by flooding a user's authentication app with push notifications. Some attackers send a few push notifications a day thinking they will fly under the radar, while others bombard the user with continuous messages, but the intended outcome in either approach is the same: to get users to authorize access in order to make the notifications stop, thereby granting access to the attacker.</p>

 Preventing MFA attacks 

<p>Push authentication is one of the most secure, simple, and convenient user authentication methods and a popular MFA choice. To avoid attacks on push notifications, ForgeRock has developed two features: MFA push authentication with context and push authentication with number matching.</p>

 Push notification with additional context 

<p>The push notification with context feature lets you keep your users safe from MFA attacks by sending them additional context. When users are presented with a push notification request, they are provided contextual information about the request, such as where the request came from, information about the device, the user agent, or other signals.</p>

<p>When the push notification is received, the user can review the contextual authentication information, decide whether it is legitimate, and accept it or reject it.</p>

    
MFA push notification with additional context Push notification with number matching 

<p>With number matching in a push request, the user is presented with a number on the login screen and must select that same number in the authenticator app.</p>

<p>For more secure logins in the near term, we advise enabling push notifications with number matching. This method prevents an attacker from gaining access to an account if the user accidentally hits "Approve" on an MFA notice.</p>

<p>This technique also minimizes friction for users. When compared to other MFA techniques, such as entering a six-digit number from a software token or SMS message, matching a two-digit code doesn't significantly add to the login process.</p>

    
MFA push notification with number matching Why enterprises should use these MFA approaches 

<p>If you've implemented MFA using an authenticator app for your workforce users or your customers, you want to be sure it isn't vulnerable to MFA fatigue. With the ForgeRock Authenticator's additional context or number matching, you will no longer have to worry about users who unintentionally approve MFA requests.</p>

<p>For over 45 million Americans, the weight of unyielding student loan debt is a major cause of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-cope-with-stress-of-student-loans/">stress and anxiety</a>, a barrier to homeownership and can be a lifelong impediment to building wealth. Nationwide, the total student debt level stands at a staggering&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/student-debt-is-a-main-obstacle-for-millennials-wanting-to-buy-a-house.html">$1.7 trillion</a>. Managing that debt has proven to be complicated and inefficient for borrowers and lenders alike.</p>



<p>Bottom line: Access to consumer-permissioned student loan data presents a unique opportunity. Innovators can step in and create apps and build better services that leverage student loan data through Finicity’s open banking platform, to help consumers with student loan debt.</p>



 Introducing Normalized Student Loan Data 



<p>For fintech innovators, lenders, refinancers, employers and institutions of higher education, working with student loan data has been challenging. Until now, the data hasn’t been normalized. Higher learning institutions have used different naming conventions for data fields, making documentation harder to read, compare or translate. Lenders and servicers have to navigate a forest of screenshots, phone calls with lengthy hold times and unsecure paper documents in their efforts to verify loan information.</p>



<p>These time-consuming manual processes incur labor costs to lenders and servicers. This can cause stress, revenue loss, time loss and negatively impact the lender’s operational efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finicity has normalized the data across data fields, vocabulary, naming conventions and applications of rules, resulting in a modernized ecosystem for all stakeholders through its open banking platform. This significantly reduces the time to market for your student loan solutions.</p>



 Innovation Platform Using Student Loan Data 



<p>Student loan data doesn’t have to be confusing or complicated. With Mastercard Open Banking (some services provided by Finicity, a Mastercard company), an optimized API call can help reduce costs, and is delivered in a formation that doesn’t require additional coding. Our API endpoints can yield the complete loan details, and the full payment details of a student loan account, including up to 24 months of transaction history.</p>







 99% Data Coverage&nbsp; 



 
 Normalized, comprehensive data covering most student loan accounts. It’s delivered through our open banking platform, with connections to student loan accounts that include federal Direct Loans, FFEL &amp; Perkins, and some of the largest private lenders and servicers (e.g. Aidvantage, Navient, Nelnet, Sallie Mae, Discover, Firstmark, Commonbond, LendKey, etc). 
 



 Quality of Data 



 
 Extensive Loan Account Details:&nbsp;&nbsp;API calls to the Finicity open banking platform can yield a primary account, transactions by account, loan payment details, statements, account owner and much more.&nbsp;Data is aggregated at the three largest levels of the student loan hierarchy; student loan, student loan group and student loan account, while also being able to provide customer &amp; institution-level details. 



 Transaction lookback period&nbsp;has been extended to one year in order to accurately capture transaction additions or changes. Up to twenty-four months of transactions can be offered for an extended view of account history. 



 Complementary data insight solutions&nbsp;with analytics of a borrower’s credits, debits and balances to deliver smarter credit decisioning. 



 Reliable Uptime Data Monitoring: Multi-tier data integrity and student loan-specific data monitoring. 
 



 Create Winning Borrower Experiences 



<p>Innovators can quickly develop and scale new and improved financial services with Finicity’s open banking platform. Student loans are the second-largest debt sector in the United States. There is a massive opportunity to develop new apps and services to help individuals with student loan debt. Through partnering with our clients, Finicity’s open banking platform is powering solutions to help over 45 million Americans who carry student loan balances.&nbsp;</p>



 Some of the ways innovators can upgrade the borrower experience, using permissioned student loan data: 



 
 Create&nbsp;frictionless onboarding&nbsp;and account setup for borrowers to apply for loans, set up accounts, manage repayment and distribute funding to students. 



 Better data for better credit decisioning. It’s pretty simple. Student loan borrowers want a better experience. Lenders want the most accurate and real-time data for better credit decisioning. So we’ve combined the best data with smart insights to transform the lending experience. 



 Finicity data powers leading&nbsp;personal finance management&nbsp;(PFM) apps. These tools allow borrowers to view, monitor and manage their debt in near real time by pulling smart, categorized and permissioned loan data into the app. If borrowers can easily understand their financial position and repayment options, they may reduce stress and more effectively manage their debt.&nbsp; 



 Attracting and retaining the best talent in today’s job market is a challenge for any company. Leveraging permissioned student loan data, some employers are taking advantage of the SECURE 2.0 Act, creating benefits like&nbsp;401k accounts that match student loan payments&nbsp;and direct matching of student loan payments back to the student loan. 



 By using the account details endpoint, it’s possible to verify that a student is enrolled in at least half-time coursework by the National Student Loan Data System. Using this data, a rich field of possibility opens up for student-specific benefits.&nbsp;Discounts, rewards and loyalty programs&nbsp;can be built specifically for current students. 



 Even the more administrative aspects of student loans can be modernized by open banking technology. Student borrowers can be offered the ability to easily and securely&nbsp;apply for federal programs&nbsp;like Public Service Loan Forgiveness or an Income-Driven Repayment plan. No&nbsp;wading through W2s, paystubs and long, frustrating calls to student loan servicers.&nbsp;Quick and secure. 
 



 Step Into the Future 



<p>Break out of the spider web of paper documents, screenshots, phone calls and mismatched data. Replace countless lost hours of productivity with optimized API calls that offer the comprehensive, relevant, normalized data to build solutions on.</p>



<p>Innovate with us to create knowledge-based services that empower students, so they can manage, consolidate, refinance and repay their obligations with the level of transparency that they deserve.&nbsp;</p>

  Crypto regulations vary globally: Japan embraces it, China resists, the EU introduces MiCA for uniformity, and the US grapples with overlapping jurisdictions.  Countries like Switzerland, Singapore, and Bermuda are pioneering progressive crypto approaches, blending innovation with robust oversight.  Despite the global patchwork of regulations, a cohesive international framework remains elusive, though it’s a prominent G20 discussion topic.  <p>Crypto is changing how the world thinks about money. But when we look at the rules for crypto, every country is different.</p><p>While Japan likes crypto and has initiated several initiatives to position itself as a crypto-friendly destination, China has not been so accommodating. And just south of China, India has decided to adopt a wait-and-watch approach, although the country’s Central Bank is strongly against giving any legal recognition to virtual currencies.</p><p>Europe, on the other hand, has already started implementing provisions from its comprehensive regulatory framework called Markets in Crypto Assets, known as MiCA. In comparison, the world’s largest economy, the United States, is yet to reach a clear consensus over who will control what, as there are frequent overlaps and clashes of jurisdictional capacity between agencies like the CFTC and&nbsp;SEC.</p><p>(<a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Image Source</a>)</p><p>Here, we delve deeper to understand where the world currently stands regarding regulating crypto. This is crucial because the industry can only thrive if regulatory differences are at their minimum. And only then could we see the seamless exchange of resources and capital — mandatory for a global crypto economy to stand on its own&nbsp;feet.</p> Europe  The EU <p>When it comes to crypto rules in the EU, MICA or Markets in Crypto Assets often take center stage. The public first got a glimpse of this proposal on 24th September 2020. Fast forward to 16th May 2023, and the EU has officially given the go-ahead to these&nbsp;rules.</p><p>The core objective of MiCA is to safeguard investor interests and enhance transparency by setting out a comprehensive framework for issuers and service providers. Specifically, utility token issuers, stablecoins (also termed asset-referenced tokens), trading platforms, and wallet service providers will all fall under MiCA’s oversight.</p><p>Recognizing this, the EU views the adoption of MiCA not merely as an isolated regulation but as a strategic move. It’s their way of progressing toward a cohesive global crypto regulatory standard, a significant improvement over the varied national laws previously in place across member&nbsp;states.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">For more details on the MiCA: MiCA Paving the Way — From Liability to Transparency</a></p> Switzerland <p>The Alpine nation treats cryptocurrencies as assets, fostering tax clarity and pioneering early adoption.</p><p>Zurich introduced Bitcoin ATMs in 2014, and by 2016, Zug was accepting Bitcoin for services. Their forward-thinking approach is further evidenced by Lugano’s ambitious plan to use cryptocurrencies as legal tender and Zug’s facilitation of tax payments in crypto. Switzerland’s stance exemplifies the diverse approaches to crypto regulation in&nbsp;Europe.</p> Asia <p>Unlike Europe’s MiCA, Asia does not have a single continent-wise regulatory structure. However, there are several crypto-friendly countries in Asia, such as Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, with their own set of rules and regulations.</p> Hong Kong <p>The vertical city-state took a more conservative approach, aligning with China’s 2021 ban on crypto services earlier. But that changed recently, as Hong Kong decided to open its doors to crypto exchanges, paving the way for organized crypto retail trading, albeit with a few conditions.</p> Japan <p>The country, often called the “Land of the Rising Sun,” has crafted a detailed crypto framework, with its Financial Services Agency (FSA) collaborating with the JVCEA and JSTOA, ensuring robust oversight for crypto exchanges and token offerings. With the Payment Services Act and stringent anti-money laundering measures in place, Japan’s intent is clear: to foster a transparent and safeguarded crypto environment.</p> South Korea <p>On the Korean peninsula, South Korea’s crypto regulations are defined by the Electronic Financial Transactions Act and the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Information. These laws categorize cryptocurrencies as “electronic assets” and set the rules for their utilization. As South Korea seeks to refine its stance on digital currencies, the National Assembly is actively deliberating on a range of crypto-related regulatory proposals.</p> Singapore <p>Shifting our lens southeast, Singapore stands as a beacon of balanced crypto regulation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) championed the Payment Services Act (PSA) in January 2020, which enveloped both traditional and crypto exchanges under a unified framework.</p><p>Within the PSA, digital currencies earn the designation of “digital payment tokens,” elevating approved cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether to legal asset status. Coupled with rigorous Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures and the imposition of licensing requirements for crypto activities, the city-state’s approach underscores a commitment to both innovation and security in the digital asset&nbsp;sphere.</p><p>Overall, Asia’s approach to crypto regulation demonstrates a trend toward a more structured and promising future.</p> The United Arab&nbsp;Emirates <p>Navigating to the Middle East, the UAE offers a mosaic of crypto regulations that reflects its unique federal structure. With seven distinct emirates, each potentially wielding its own rules, the central narrative began in 2017 when the UAE emphasized authorized exchanges and anti-money laundering protocols.</p><p>Fast forward to 2022, and Dubai, a pivotal emirate, spotlighted its commitment by introducing the Virtual Assets Law. This legislation not only defines the scope of virtual assets but also ensures traders operate transparently, aiming to prevent financial malpractices.</p><p>To anchor this initiative, the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) was established, marking Dubai’s ambition to be a global hub for digital assets. Through these measures, the UAE seamlessly interweaves tradition with innovation, creating a balanced crypto landscape.</p> North America  The United&nbsp;States <p>As the most representative economy of the region, the United States boasts a multifaceted and evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>While the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) holds jurisdiction over crypto exchanges trading Bitcoin and Ethereum, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is responsible for overseeing Initial Coin Offerings or&nbsp;ICOs.</p><p>Supplementing these agencies, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has a primary role in monitoring digital assets, especially concerning Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p>Given the multifarious classifications of digital assets, determining the correct regulatory agency can be intricate, sometimes involving multiple bodies. Each state, further adding to the complexity, possesses the autonomy to design its individual regulations on digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In line with this dynamic regulatory backdrop, it’s notable that the US Congress is actively considering legislation to further define and shape the crypto landscape.</p> Crypto-focused Bills in the&nbsp;US <p>Two crypto-focused bills have recently been reintroduced. The first, known as the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill, is spearheaded by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand. This revised legislation aims to demystify decentralized finance regulations, bolster the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) authority over crypto entities, and specify the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>Within its provisions, the bill underscores definitions for “crypto asset” and “crypto asset exchange,” ensuring these terms are categorized under commodities law, thereby strengthening the CFTC’s jurisdiction. A significant highlight of the bill is the introduction of a de minimus tax exemption, which seeks to alleviate the tax burdens from minute transactions, challenging the current tax mandate that treats all crypto transactions equally, irrespective of their&nbsp;value.</p><p>The second bill reintroduced in the US Congress comes from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall, titled the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023. Should it pass, all crypto stakeholders would be mandated to report transactions that eclipse the USD 10,000 threshold. Initially put forth in December 2022, the bill’s objective is to have US cryptocurrency operations adhere to the same know-your-customer standards as traditional banks, a move aimed at curtailing money laundering.</p><p>With these factors in play, entities in the US must be vigilant and continuously update their operational strategies to stay compliant. It’s also crucial for crypto exchanges to align with AML/CFT regulations, and users should be cognizant of potential tax implications. As federal directives lay out the broader guidelines, understanding the nuances of state-specific regulations becomes paramount.</p> Canada <p>Shifting attention northwards to Canada, the country’s approach to cryptocurrencies differs significantly. Digital assets, primarily treated as securities, are regulated provincially and territorially under the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). This classification is due to the unique “Crypto Contract” concept, wherein a user’s contractual right to a crypto asset can be placed under securities regulations, even if it isn’t a traditional security.</p><p>Hence, platforms such as cryptocurrency exchanges facilitating the purchase and sale of these assets need to be registered with the corresponding securities regulator. These businesses must continuously disclose vital information, from third-party dependencies and associated risks to measures against theft or&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Every cryptocurrency offering undergoes an “Investment Contract Test” to determine its classification as a security. Non-compliance can result in punitive actions, from financial penalties to bans on operations.</p><p>However, some gray areas persist in Canada’s crypto regulations. Notably, assets like stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) don’t have a clear regulatory framework, leading authorities to evaluate them on a case-by-case basis. Despite these nuances, Canada’s mature approach has garnered praise from crypto entities worldwide, marking it as a notably crypto-friendly nation.</p> Bermuda <p>Bermuda is a leader in the cryptocurrency landscape and is a likely beneficiary of the much-reported US crackdown against crypto firms, with firms like Coinbase <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/20/crypto-exchange-coinbase-receives-license-to-operate-in-bermuda/">obtaining a license</a> to operate in the country recently.</p><p>With laws like the Digital Asset Business Act (DABA) and the Digital Asset Issuance Act (DAIA), they’ve built a comprehensive regulatory framework treating all forms of digital assets uniformly. But their commitment doesn’t stop there. They’ve also paved the way for banks serving the digital asset sector and have launched innovative projects, like a blockchain-based stimulus&nbsp;token.</p><p>Guided by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, the island balances innovation with globally recognized regulatory standards, creating an environment ripe for growth and security.</p> A Regulatory Comparison <p>As far as the comparison of the US with other parts of the globe is concerned, the lack of regulatory clarity in the US is leading crypto traders to take their bets on Asia. This is despite China and India — two of the most populous nations globally — maintaining a cautious stance on&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>In Europe’s case, it is evidently far ahead of the US when it comes to providing regulatory clarity to the crypto landscape. However, as per Albert Isola, the minister for Digital and Financial Services at HM Government of Gibraltar, the effects of MiCA “will not come into play overnight. To create effective frameworks, transitional testing will be required.” What MiCA, introduced to the EU, aims to achieve is enhanced transparency and better protection for retail investors in the short term and significantly improved security and stability in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>According to Isola, many global crypto players are also expressing interest in the EU because it has made sure that regulatory frameworks do not overregulate the space and thwart innovation.</p> What to&nbsp;Expect <p>Crypto regulations will definitely go through a lot of ups and downs, proposals and rejections, and trials and errors in the days to come. Countries that are not particularly encouraging the private crypto industry to thrive might change their opinion after introducing Central Bank Digital Currencies or&nbsp;CBDCs.</p><p>However, the emergence of a global regulatory framework from all these churnings still seems a distant possibility, for now, despite crypto regulations becoming a key point of discussion in the G20 under India’s presidency.</p><p>___________________________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				 <p>Indicio recently had a breakthrough in work to scale the mediator we have been using for issuing and verifying credentials. This new mediator greatly reduces a huge problem decentralized identity faces — accommodating all the people that want to use the technology.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Alexandra N. Walker</p>
<p>A mediator is a critical part of any decentralized interaction between the holders of decentralized identifiers. This technology is the “middle man” that facilitates messages between decentralized entities using mobile devices (which don’t have fixed IP addresses for easy connection). You can almost think of a mediator as a mailbox; it provides an endpoint for parties that cannot otherwise connect with each other to send and receive messages. Importantly, these “messages” can include issuing and verifying credentials.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the amount of messages your mediator can process in a given period of time has a significant impact on performance, limiting how many people can use your services concurrently which, in turn, will limit adoption. People today expect technology to “just work;” if they perceive the interaction to be slow, the likelihood of them trying again is very low. To put this into perspective, <a href="https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/#:~:text=following%20key%20findings%3A-,47%20percent%20of%20consumers%20expect%20a%20web%20page%20to%20load,render%20before%20abandoning%20the%20site.">47 percent of consumers</a> expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and 40 percent will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site.</p>
<p>This obviously puts some pressure on your development team to make sure everything works quickly, and the mediator represents a key part of the process where people can get stuck. The option to pay for more, or bigger, mediations is always a viable solution, but it can be costly. This is the context for Indicio’s breakthrough.</p>
<p>The first thing we had to know were baseline numbers: using mediation, how many credentials could ACA-Py sustainably issue to new users in a minute? What about existing users? How about verification?</p>
<p>(Non-Clustered)</p>
<p>Current Traditional ACA-Py Mediator (2 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM):</p>
<p>issue 258 credentials per minute to new connections<br>issue 540 credentials per minute to existing connections<br>verify 282 credentials per minute to existing connection</p>
<p>These numbers represent our baseline numbers in a non-clustered environment; however, taking this architecture into a clustered environment—where we have the same architecture as before, but now everything (user agents and ACA-Py agents) is abstracted away behind load balancers and managed instance groups—we get much better numbers.</p>
<p>(Clustered)</p>
<p>Current Traditional ACA-Py Mediator (2 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM):</p>
<p>The traditional mediator from before can sustainably</p>
<p>issue 300 credentials per minute to new connections,<br>issue 900 credentials per minute to existing connections, mediator, and<br>verify 600 credentials per minute to existing connections,</p>
<p>using the same mediator (with 2 vCPUs and 8GB of RAM) as before but now with 10 ACA-Py agents (1 vCPU and 4GB of RAM, each).</p>
<p>Using some new techniques and new technologies, such as the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock">SocketDock</a>, our team was able to greatly improve these numbers.</p>
<p>Indicio’s Mediator:</p>
<p>Indicio’s Mediator can</p>
<p>sustainably issue 1,200 credentials per minute to new connections,<br>sustainably issue 1,680 credentials per minute to existing connections, sustainably verify 3,000 credentials per minute to existing connections.</p>
<p>Our team is hugely excited about this progress, given that high-volume verification will drive many seamless processes. For example, with Indicio’s Mediator, airport security will be able to verify 3,000 passengers per minute per mediator, shortening lines while saving airports expense.</p>
<p>While the Indicio Mediator is not quite ready for public use yet, our team wanted to share the news that ACA-Py (Aries Cloud Agent-Python) is able to scale to meet the growing interest in the technology. Once the Indicio team has fine tuned the codebase, we expect to open source and contribute it to the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger Foundation</a> so organizations can build their own solutions.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the new mediator or building your own verifiable credential solutions our team is always happy to help. You can <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us here.</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>In recent years, the question of a state's territorial sovereignty in cyberspace has been a major topic of discussion. The emergence of cyberspace has introduced new spatial dimensions and challenged our understanding of international law. When it comes to cyberspace, the solid and defined notion of territory does not necessarily apply there. Sovereignty has been unbundled in cyberspace, both in practice and in legality.</p>
<p>At its core, the notion of sovereignty in cyberspace encompasses a state's authority and control over the digital activities that take place within its borders. While all states would claim some degree of sovereignty over the internet, countries such as Russia and China have embraced a broader interpretation of cyber sovereignty. Both states define cyber sovereignty in ways that are consistent with their respective political and security objectives.</p>
<p>Technology, geopolitics, and cyber sovereignty </p>
<p>According to the Chinese cyber sovereignty principle, cyber sovereignty is the idea that each country has the right to exercise control over the Internet within its territory and the right to choose its own digital development path. The Chinese Cybersecurity Law enacted in 2016 has further promoted this idea and defined the security obligations that Internet providers and services must follow. As a result, the concept of cyber sovereignty has become China's guiding principle in its domestic digital policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Russia's interpretation of cyber sovereignty, mirroring that of China, is characterized by the regulation of information and information flows and the ability to regulate, surveil, and influence digital activities occurring within its borders. For example, in 2018, Russia proposed a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly, which some argue legitimizes state surveillance and censorship through its emphasis on sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of countries.</p>
<p>Although liberal democracies have also intervened in the digital realm to counter the threats of disinformation, terrorism, and cybercriminal activity, their approach tends to balance the protection of citizens' rights and privacy with the need to maintain a secure online environment. Consequently, their interventions in the digital sphere often come with checks and balances and public discourse to ensure that security measures do not impede upon the democratic values they seek to protect.</p>
<p>Semiconductors and national security </p>
<p>In addition to the principle of cyber sovereignty, the concept of supply chain sovereignty has recently gained traction in economic and political circles. Since the spring of 2018, the trade conflict between the United States and China has been in full swing. Dependence on imports and foreign producers is now considered a national security risk in many states. Global supply chains can be more efficient in delivering goods and services at lower costs while fostering international competition at the same time. However, states are wary of gaining economic advantage at the expense of national security.</p>
<p>Some countries have identified and subsidized key technologies such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors; while the former is important in the long term, the latter has more immediate implications in the global supply chain. The semiconductor industry is a vital part of today's information age and a key component of today's global economy. As a result, new restrictions limiting China's access to chipmaking software and equipment continue to be imposed by the United States as part of its national security agenda.</p>
<p>There is more to this story than trade tensions between China and the United States. Many countries are claiming sovereignty over the shared digital technology space. For example, the European Union has been trying to reduce its dependence on the United States for years. Through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union has achieved some measure of internet sovereignty via regulation. Nevertheless, the EU is likely to continue to seek greater convergence with the United States and to build digital alliances with like-minded countries.</p>
<p>Addressing challenges through cooperation </p>
<p>While technology continues to develop integrating forces, geopolitics is moving toward greater fragmentation, posing a serious dilemma for business leaders and policymakers. Despite different interpretations of cyber sovereignty or supply chain sovereignty, countries will need to cooperate at the international level and work together to address global challenges.</p>
<p>Data breaches, espionage, sabotage, misinformation, supply chain disruptions, and cyberattacks are just a few examples of the global challenges we face. Governance of cyberspace requires both shared values and trust to work, but this will ultimately depend more on consistent and enforceable legal understandings than on technology. It is therefore clear that cyberspace will continue to play a critical role in international law and geopolitics in the years to come.</p>

 Interested in entering one of the largest and most lucrative gambling markets in the world? You’ll first need a UK gambling license. Here’s everything you need to know about the application process, compliance requirements, UK gambling regulations, and much more. 



 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a> (UKGC) operates as the UK’s gambling regulator, and is an independent regulatory body established under the UK Gambling Act of 2005. To operate legally in the UK, all gambling platforms are required to hold a license issued by the UKGC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC is also responsible for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">implementing changes t</a>o national gambling regulations, such as the recent proposals contained in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK’s gambling white paper</a>. Proposals target various aspects of the gambling industry, such as VIP customers, slot limits, and financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks).</p>



 Understanding UK gambling regulations. 



<p>The UKGC takes failure to comply with licensing requirements and social responsibility codes very seriously. Operators, therefore, must have robust systems and controls in place to prevent money laundering as well as a whole host of other nefarious crimes. They must also safeguard customers, take measures to prevent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>, ensure fair play, and encourage responsible gambling to guarantee <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/">gambling compliance.</a></p>



<p>There are essentially three main types of operating licenses:&nbsp;</p>



  Remote: This license allows licensees to provide casino games and gambling products to customers through an online site, TV, mobile phone, or any other type of online service.<br>  Non-remote: A non-remote gambling license allows the licensee to facilitate betting activities at betting shops, tracks, and/or courses.<br>  Ancillary: Ancillary licenses are for operators offering email and telephone betting.&nbsp;  



<p>Operators may need one or a combination of these licenses.</p>



<p>Licensing is mandatory, even if an operator’s online gambling platform is located in another region of the world. Essentially, if the services are being offered in the UK, operators must hold a license. (If you are interested in learning about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/do-i-need-an-online-gaming-license/">the need for an online gaming license</a> in general, click on the underlined copy).</p>



 Eligibility criteria for a UK gambling license. 



<p>The Commission <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/operating-licences">evaluates</a> applicants based on the following criteria:&nbsp;</p>



  The identity of the applicant and people associated with them. For example, if the applicant’s gambling platform is part of a bigger corporation, then the owner of that corporation also needs to be evaluated.<br>  The applicant’s honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness<br>  Financial statements that display the business is financially capable of operating successfully after obtaining a license<br>  The applicant’s expertise, experience, qualifications, history, and those of the people relevant to the application<br>  The applicant’s criminal record and those relevant to the application.&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission also looks at the applicants’ policies to ensure that:&nbsp;</p>



  They incorporate and understand the legislation<br>  They follow the established licensing objectives<br>  They hold evidence that their arrangements will adhere to social responsibility requirements  



 Application process for a UK gambling license. 



<p>Applicants apply for an operating license from the UKGC via the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/service/apply-for-an-operating-licence">“Apply for an operating license” service</a>. It takes around 16 weeks for the Commission to process a license application, considering all the required information is submitted at the point of application. Applying for a UKGC license <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/how-much-it-costs#:~:text=It%20costs%20%C2%A3370%20to,withdraw%20from%20the%20application%20process.">costs</a> £370, which must be paid via credit or debit card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators are required to provide an extensive array of documents, some of which depend on the type of business applying for the license. For instance, a sole trader may only be required to submit identity documents, whereas a limited company would be required to submit the following:</p>



  Ownership structure diagram<br>  Articles of association<br>  Management structures<br>  Certificate of incorporation<br>  Memorandum of association&nbsp;  



<p>Overseas entities must submit a credit report and, if they have licenses elsewhere, copies of licenses issued by the other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a remote license, an operator must provide the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Documents regarding remote policies and procedures<br>  Operational model map<br>  Gambling software supply method and details<br>  System diagram displaying the end-to-end process&nbsp;  



<p>Some requirements are considered core documentation and are mandatory in all cases. Such requirements include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  General policies and procedures–these must adhere to the standards outlined in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/license-conditions-codes-of-practice-lccp/">LCCP (Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice)</a><br>  Rules of play<br>  Customer terms and conditions<br>  Bank statements for the past six months for all accounts<br>  Business plan<br>  Proof of funding<br>  Profit and loss projections for the next three years&nbsp;  



<p>Those responsible for managing the business must also submit a PML (Personal Management Licence) or an Annex A personal declaration form based on the circumstances.</p>



 Key considerations for license applicants. 



<p>Those applying for a license from the UKGC must have a comprehensive business plan for their application to be approved. A sound business plan shows that the operator understands their objectives and the steps required to achieve them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must also focus on responsible gambling and protection practices. This includes offering tools like deposit limits, self-exclusion, and helpful resources for customers who may struggle with or be on the verge of developing a gambling addiction. Moreover, the operator’s platform must also be secure, employing technologies such as SSL encryption to secure their customers’ personal and financial information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implementing robust anti-money laundering and fraud protection strategies, such as KYC and AML solutions, is also essential. Operators can help identify and mitigate gambling fraud and crime by conducting due diligence and transaction monitoring. Keeping updated with industry regulations and best practices is also among the key considerations for license applicants.</p>

 Compliance and reporting obligations. 



<p>All UKGC license holders must adhere to regulatory obligations that must be observed at all times. Such obligations include upholding integrity in all aspects of their operations, maintaining accurate records, reporting crucial information promptly, and ensuring they offer fair, safe, and transparent services to customers while taking active measures to prevent problem gambling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Failure to comply with such obligations can lead to dire consequences, including heavy fines, license revocation, and strict legal action.</p>



 Licensing fees and taxation. 



<p>For licensing purposes, operators are divided into a total of nine categories according to their GGY (Gross Gambling Yield). For example, a gambling operator with a GGY under £550k will be required to pay an application fee of £4,224 and an annual fee of £4,199. On the other hand, operators with a GGY worth £1 billion must pay an application fee of £91,686 and a yearly fee worth £793,729.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/point-of-consumption-tax-rate-of-15-proposed-for-remote-gambling">Point of Consumption Tax</a> (POCT) introduced in 2014, the Commission requires all licensees to adhere to tax requirements to operate legally. This includes taxes on all profits from gambling activities, regardless of where the operator is based, and abiding by regulations regarding the collection and reporting of taxes. The POCT has profoundly impacted the UK’s gambling industry, urging operators to adapt and comply with the evolving tax requirements to remain compliant.</p>



 License renewal and revocation. 



<p>The procedure for license <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-to-licensing-authorities/part-24-renewal">renewal</a> is like applying for an initial application. You need to submit a renewal application within six months before the license expires but no later than two months prior to its expiration. The Commission may refuse to renew a permit on the following grounds:</p>



  If the renewal is inconsistent with the licensing requirements. In this instance, the authority may consult the chief officer of the police. The authority will, therefore, be wary of any concerns regarding the use of the premises during the life of the license.<br>  If an authorized local government officer has been denied access to the premises without a reasonable excuse.&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission may also <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/revocation-of-operating-licence-bet-butler-limited">revoke</a> a license holder’s permit under the following circumstances:&nbsp;</p>



  The license holder is unable to carry out licensed activities consistent with the licensing requirements.<br>  The Commission is dissatisfied with the licensee’s financial standing.<br>  The Commission is dissatisfied with the licensee’s competence.<br>  The Commission believes that one or more license terms have been breached&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission usually informs the license holder if it reaches a decision about their permit. The licensee is allowed to appeal against a decision if:&nbsp;</p>



  They receive a fine or warning.<br>  Their license application has been turned down.<br>  Their license has been revoked or suspended.<br>  There are changes in their license terms  



 Marketing and advertising guidelines. 



<p>Licensed operators must be wary of the advertising standards and restrictions established by the Commission. Such standards exist to protect minors and the vulnerable from being unfairly targeted by gambling ads and ensure that all advertising is fair and transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding responsible marketing practices, operators must be mindful of the guidelines and undertake advertising in a socially responsible manner, including the stipulations on the use of certain messaging and imagery. This is to say that all licensees’ marketing communications must not <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/open-and-transparent-marketing">mislead</a> customers. Operators must adhere to the UK Advertising <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/advertising-marketing-rules-and-regulations">codes</a> published by CAP (the Committees of Advertising Practice) and governed by the ASA (Advertising Standards Authority).&nbsp;</p>



 International expansion and cross-border licensing. 



<p>Many operators explore other markets to increase their customer base and diversify their revenue streams. However, various legal stipulations are linked with cross-border licensing, including ones based on licensing, taxation, and regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As previously noted, operators based abroad must provide a credit report. If they carry a license from other jurisdictions, they must provide a copy of the licenses issued by other jurisdictions.</p>



 UK gambling license FAQs. 


 
 
 
 What is a UK gambling license? 
 

<p>Operators must acquire a UK gambling license to provide gambling services in the UK. The license includes facilitating remote gambling, online or through different means, and advertising (responsible) gambling to UK-based consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 Who needs a UK gambling license? 
 

<p>Operators looking to offer gambling services and advertise gambling to consumers in the UK are required to hold a UK gambling license.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 How long does it take to obtain a license? 
 

<p>It can take up to 16 weeks to obtain a UK gambling license. The timescale can depend on several factors, with the most important being the strength of the application.</p>

 
 
 
 What are the costs involved in obtaining a license? 
 

<p>The costs for obtaining a license depend on the operator’s GGY. For instance, an operator with a GGY below £550k must pay an application fee of £4,224. This increases significantly for the highest earners in the industry.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 How can I ensure compliance with UK gambling regulations?&nbsp; 
 

<p>To ensure compliance with UK gambling regulations, the operator must ensure that their business is fully licensed by the UKGC. They must also have robust policies and procedures in place to address problem gambling and crime. It is also crucial to stay updated with any UK gambling laws and regulations changes.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 Can a license be transferred to another operator? 
 

<p>No, operating licenses are essentially non-transferable. Meaning that every gambling platform is required to go through the same process in the UK.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 


 Game on. 



<p>Like other industries, gambling has seen significant digital transformation in recent years. Adhering to recently updated and upcoming gambling laws and regulations is essential to launching a gambling platform in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Āhau: Decolonising Financial Compliance 
 Objective: Empowering Indigenous Tribes with Nation-building Technologies 
<p>The financial world often erects barriers that hinder indigenous tribes, such as the Māori, from accessing vital economic development tools. With <a href="https://ahau.io/">Āhau</a>, we’re striving to change this narrative.</p>
<p>Our solution involves creating ecosystem governance frameworks and technologies tailored explicitly for Āhau. Using the TribalDIDs methodologies, we aim to interconnect with existing financial and compliance systems. This seamless integration is our ticket to dismantling the systemic obstacles that indigenous tribes face in places like Aotearoa/New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>

				  Blockchain Advocacy Coalition (BAC): Setting the Stage for DeFi’s Success in California 
 Objective: Paving the Way for Compliant Decentralized Financial Tools 
<p>The rapid rise of DeFi tools has been staggering, yet they face a significant hurdle: the need for KYC compliance. This gap poses a potential limitation to the growth and broader adoption of DeFi.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">BAC</a>, our focus is threefold. Firstly, we will formulate a bill tailor-made for the California legislature to integrate dApps into the traditional compliance framework. Secondly, we’re working on crafting a governance framework for developers, enabling them to build with clarity and confidence. Lastly, we’re committed to open-sourcing our entire framework. This ensures that states beyond California can harness our insights and replicate our success.&nbsp;</p>

				  ZenGate: Crafting a Blueprint for Expanding Cardano’s Horizons 
 Objective: A Robust Guide for Deploying National-Level Solutions on Cardano 
<p>Cardano’s potential is enormous, but one challenge persists the absence of a systematic approach to tapping into new jurisdictions and executing national-level solutions. <a href="https://www.zengate.global/">ZenGate</a> aims to address this.</p>
<p>Our focal point is the Global Specialty Tea Sector, serving as a practical and scalable case study. Through ZenGate, we’re developing a detailed Ecosystem Building Blueprint. This playbook will provide a step-by-step guide to navigating and mastering the complex landscape of deploying national-level solutions on Cardano.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After more than 10 years, short-lived TLS certificates are finally permitted by the browsers based on <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/07/14/ballot-sc-063-v4make-ocsp-optional-require-crls-and-incentivize-automation/">CA/Browser Forum ballot SC-063</a>. Gerv Markham started a <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/mozilla.dev.security.policy/c/T11up58JkFc/m/Nph-8cFiuEMJ">short-lived certs discussion in 2014</a>, where he advised he was reviewing the 2012 CA/Browser Forum discussion on the topic. He advised that short-lived certificates was a plank of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Revocation_Checking_in_Firefox#Short-Lived_Certificates">Mozilla revocation strategy</a>. There was also a paper prepared in 2012 called <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/W2SP/2012/papers/w2sp12-final9.pdf">Towards Short-Lived Certificates</a>. The paper stated OCSP is as good as dead, so the CAs should issue certificates with a very short lifetime. I suppose no one thought it would take so much time.</p>
<p>Short-lived certificates are designed to help address a certificate revocation issue. Back in 2012, <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/02/05/crlsets.html">Adam Langley discussed the seat-belt issue</a>, where it works fine, but snaps when you crash. This was based on the fact the browser implements soft-fail revocation checks where the CRL or OCSP response is ignored.</p>
<p>Even when the CA certificate status is trusted, there may be other issues. A CRL may be valid for up to 10 days, so even if a certificate is revoked, an attacker may be able to provide a valid CRL for many days after the revocation.</p>
<p>There are also privacy concerns where <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/180T6cDSWPy54Rb5d6R4zN7MuLEMShaZ4IRLQgdPqE98/edit">OCSP requests reveal details of individuals’ browsing history to the operator of the OCSP responder</a>. As such, many browsers do not perform online OCSP checks by default.</p>
<p>Effective after ballot SC-063 completes intellectual property review, the CAs can issue short-lived TLS certificates, where the validity is less than or equal to 10 days. Effective March 15, 2026, the short-lived certificate validity period will drop to a maximum of 7 days. Since the validity period would be less than the effective period of a CRL or an OCSP response, the CA does not have to provide status of short-lived certificates. This means you may not find any CRL or OCSP information in a short-lived TLS certificate. In addition, the CA does not have to revoke a short-lived certificate.</p>
<p>To address the OCSP privacy issue, effective March 15, 2024, the CA does not have to provide an OCSP response. Note that most CAs will continue to support OCSP for all TLS certificates based on the <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31633.microsoft-trusted-root-program-requirements.aspx">Microsoft Trusted Root Program Requirements</a>. We do expect Microsoft will address this policy issue in the future.</p>
<p>To ensure status continues to be provided to non-short-lived certificates, effective March 15, 2024, the CAs must provide a CRL for all non-short-lived TLS certificates. The ballot also addresses partitioned CRLs or sharded CRLs, which allows a CRL download to be smaller, so there is less delay for the browser user.</p>
<p>The ballot should not provide any impact to the services from your CA. If you do not get CRL support, it will be available in 2024. OCSP responses will stay available from all CAs that are trusted by Windows.</p>
<p>Entrust continues to support both CRL and OCSP for TLS certificates.</p>

<p>Symmetric <a>encryption</a> (or “private key” encryption) is the process of using a single key to both encrypt and decrypt data. It’s called “private key” because the use of a single encryption key necessitates that the key is always kept private.</p>
<p>Symmetric encryption is a widely-used form of cryptography that provides organizations and users with a faster, more readily deployable form of security for large data sets.</p>
<p>Symmetric encryption is often used for high-volume data processing where speed, efficiency, and complexity are important. However, due to its nature as a single-key solution, it presents several security challenges when it comes to actually sharing encrypted data. For this reason, symmetric encryption is often combined with asymmetric encryption (which uses different keys for encryption and decryption) in many modern secure communication protocols.</p>
 
How Does Symmetric Encryption Work? 
<p>Generally, encryption works by translating plain text into encoded (cipher) text using an algorithm and a secret key that is, theoretically, computationally infeasible to crack.</p>
<p>The general process of encryption works as follows:</p>
 
 Key Generation: A secret key is generated using advanced mathematical equations that is used to encode data. This key is shared between sender and receiver to maintain the obfuscation of the data. 
 Encryption: The encoding process uses complex algorithms and random environmental data (called “entropy”) to transform the original data is usually complex and involves multiple rounds of transformation to ensure the ciphertext is not easily decipherable without the key. 
 Decryption: Upon receiving the data, the recipient uses the same key to decode the data–essentially, reversing the process with the key serving as the information needed to “unlock” that data. 
 
<p>Additionally, symmetric encryption algorithms will usually come in one of two forms:</p>
 
 Stream Ciphers: Stream ciphers encrypt plaintext messages one bit at a time. They create an arbitrarily long keystream of bits, which is then combined with the plaintext bits one by one to produce the ciphertext. 
 Block Ciphers: Block ciphers take a chunk, or block, of data and transform it. It then works through the data set block by block. Some block ciphers will repeatedly encrypt blocks for added security. 
 
 How Does Symmetric Encryption Compare to Asymmetric Encryption? 
<p>As the name implies, symmetric encryption works through a sense of symmetry between both ends (encryption and decryption) of the process. <a>Asymmetric encryption</a> is the opposite–it uses a different key for each process..</p>
<p>Accordingly, the biggest challenge in symmetric encryption is the secure distribution of the key. Since the same key is used by all parties involved, it must be shared… which presents its own problems in terms of securing keys.</p>
<p>Conversely, asymmetric encryption doesn’t require this kind of sharing. Only one key (the public key) is shared, and it is only used for encoding data and cannot be used to compromise encrypted data.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Symmetric Key Encryption? 
<p>This article has touched on the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods, differences that provide context for how symmetric methods benefit users and enterprises.</p>
<p>Some of the key bonuses of symmetric encryption include:</p>
 
 Speed: Symmetric algorithms are generally less computationally intensive as compared to their asymmetric counterparts. That makes them faster and less computationally intensive than asymmetric ones–perfect for encrypting large amounts of data. 
 Simplicity: Symmetric encryption involves only one key for both encryption and decryption, which can simplify key management, especially for contexts where key sharing isn’t a major concern. 
 Bandwidth: Data encoded with symmetric algorithms are generally smaller in size, which can help with bandwidth concerns if that is an issue. 
 
<p>It isn’t an “all-or-nothing” approach, however. Many systems or algorithms will combine both symmetric and asymmetric methods in a single process to leverage the strengths of both. combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption.</p>
 What Are Use Cases for Symmetric Key Encryption? 
<p>Generally speaking, there are a few cases where symmetric encryption is suitable. Namely, when a system needs to perform fast encryption, where there are large amounts of data to encrypt, and/or where key sharing isn’t a concern.</p>
<p>Within those criteria are several different use cases where symmetric encryption shines:</p>
 
 File and Disk Encryption: For encrypting files, databases, or entire drives, symmetric methods are the gold standard. 
 Bulk Data Encryption: In situations where large amounts of data need to be encrypted, symmetric encryption is typically the most practical method due to its speed and efficiency compared to asymmetric encryption. 
 Hybrid Algorithms: While asymmetric solutions solve some critical security issues, they are grossly inefficient when it comes to encrypting data efficiently. Thus hybrid systems will use asymmetric approaches to secure keys and verify user identities while using symmetric algorithms to actually encrypt data. 
 
<p>The most well-known application of a hybrid approach is Secure Socket Layers (SSL), currently renamed and refined as Transport Layer Security (TLS). These technologies are used as a “tunneling” method to create secure and persistent connection between machines. To accomplish this, SSL and TLS protocols actually use combinations of symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to strengthen security.</p>
 What Are Different Types of Symmetric Encryption? 
<p>There isn’t a limit on how many encryption algorithms exist. Some of the more popular, or at least well-known, symmetric algorithms around include:</p>
 
 <a>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</a>: This is currently one of the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithms, supported for national security (by NIST) and industrial applications. There are several different complexities of AES (with 128-bit and 256-bit being the most common) that represent increasing levels of security. 
 Data Encryption Standard (DES): Primarily used decades ago, this symmetric algorithm has effectively been cracked and is no longer considered secure. It has been deprecated in favor of Triple DES or, in cases of federal or industrial encryption standards, AES. 
 Triple DES (3DES): This is an extension of the now-defunct DES algorithm that processes plaintext blocks three times for additional security, with a significant tradeoff with performance. 
 Blowfish and Twofish: These are block ciphers designed as alternatives to DES. Blowfish has a block size of 64 bits, while Twofish has a block size of 128 bits. Twofish was one of the finalists in the competition that selected AES. 
 
<p>Remember, no matter which algorithm or cipher type you use, the security of symmetric encryption relies heavily on keeping the encryption key secret and using a secure method to distribute the key when necessary.</p>
 1Kosmos BlockID and Encrypted Identity Management 
<p>Encryption is a critical part of identity management and authentication. With our private and permissioned blockchain, we leverage symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods to ensure that identity and authentication credentials (including <a>biometrics</a>) remain secure, that users are properly verified, and that decentralized devices can safely access the system.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you get the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure that there are no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out of the box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>When you hear business and crypto, chances are you might think of two totally different subjects.</p><p>The history of crypto has been a rocky one: much trial, error, and bad actors beating to the pulse to grab a share of a digital future. This paper outlines the future of business being crypto. Further, how cash flow, seamless transactions, and protocols as a service are catalysts for a global economy without borders, bank fees, or&nbsp;silos.</p><p>There persists a widespread misunderstanding that crypto assets hold 0 intrinsic value due to their absence of cash flows. This fallacy arises from a public tendency to equate crypto solely with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with digital gold — “Since gold does not produce cash flow, crypto can’t either” type of&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Below we look at the top 25 ‘crypto’ projects by revenue in the past year. In this graph, you can see layer 1 Blockchains &amp; DeFi Protocols. The latter includes Layer 2 solutions, NFT marketplaces, Liquid staking derivatives, and more. By this chart you will see traditional business “cash flow” is now replaced by&nbsp;fees.</p>Link to <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal">Token&nbsp;Terminal</a><p>Fees</p><p>The name of the game is now access to services and products, and contributing to sustainable practice by micro fees. No, this is not the bank sneaking surcharges into your account so they can make a quick $. This is clear as day, operating, and action-oriented production fees allow a certain mechanism to stay standing. You’ll see fees can be paid to end users and protocols alike. Below will grid different examples of fees, revenue, and cash flow mechanisms in Decentralized Finance&nbsp;today:</p><p>Interested in seeing where all these different cash flows go and exist in crypto? Websites like <a href="https://cryptofees.info/">https://cryptofees.info/</a> offer leaderboards on who has the most action going&nbsp;on.</p><a href="https://cryptofees.info/">https://cryptofees.info/</a><p>Revenue Models</p><p>Now that it is confirmed and shown that revenue does, can, and will exist on a blockchain — let’s jump into different revenue models shown from the examples&nbsp;above.</p>  Ethereum (ETH)  <p>Think of Ethereum as the world’s first mega, decentralized supercomputer. Applications can run on top of the network and facilitate a value exchange between two or more parties. This requires two key&nbsp;steps:</p>  Adding up who owes what to whom (i.e. compute) then&nbsp;⬇️  Validating / Verifying that a transaction has occurred -&gt; updating the new account balance of both interactors (i.e. consensus)  <p>Ethereum is the protocol of selling computation and consensus as two functions to settle transactions between&nbsp;parties.</p> How does this make money? It’s time to get&nbsp;gas. <p>Ethereum earns revenue through transaction fees, known as “gas fees”. Gas fees are paid by users of DApps to have their transactions computed and stored on the Ethereum&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>In the current state of the web, businesses bear the costs of computing and storage provided by cloud computing services like Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the blockchain world, users themselves shoulder these expenses, which are essentially Ethereum’s revenues.</p><p>Just as revenues are determined by Quantity sold * Unit price, Ethereum’s transaction fees are calculated by Gas used * Price per unit of gas,&nbsp;where:</p><p>- Gas is the measure of how much computational resource is required to process a transaction. Simple operations, like a user sending some ETH to another, have low gas intensity. Complex operations, like pricing derivatives with the Black-Scholes formula for an options protocol, are more computationally intensive and require higher&nbsp;gas.</p><p>- Price per unit of gas is denominated in Ethereum’s native currency ETH, specifically in gwei (a subunit of ETH). 1 billion gwei is equal to 1 ETH. The price per unit of gas consists of two components: the base fee, dynamically set by the network based on demand (higher during network congestion), and the priority fee, set by the user as a tip to the validator. Validators have the authority to prioritize transactions based on the gas prices offered (see diagram below). This means gas prices are determined through a competitive bidding mechanism where users compete to have their transactions included in&nbsp;blocks.</p>GIF <a href="https://tenor.com/view/ethereum-ether-favor-exchange-favorex-bitcoin-meme-gif-21793117">link&nbsp;source</a><p>Wrapping the above text together, Ethereum’s transaction fee paid by users is Gas * (base fee + priority&nbsp;fee).</p><p>For example, let’s say Alice wants to send Bob 1 ETH. The transaction’s computational work is 21,000 gas, the base fee is 10 gwei and Alice includes a tip of 2 gwei. Then Alice’s total gas fee would be 21,000 x (10 + 2) = 252,000 gwei or 0.000252&nbsp;ETH.</p><p>Transaction fees and analytics on gas prices are a leading indicator to understand demand and network congestion on Ethereum. The primary driver of this demand and congestion comes from Decentralized Finance. For this, we will next look at the Unicorn of DeFi,&nbsp;<a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>.</p> 2. Uniswap&nbsp;(UNI) <p>Uni who swap? An Explanation:</p><p>Uniswap solved one simple problem in decentralized finance and has pioneered: Swapping ERC 20 tokens. Uniswap by profile is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and in 2023, has rolled out expansion products such as a <a href="https://wallet.uniswap.org/">mobile wallet</a> and <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswapx-protocol">UniswapX</a>.</p>Dex Metrics <a href="https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics">Image&nbsp;source</a><p>As you can see, Uniswap dominates trading on chain (DEX). Uniswap enables trading in a new-age fashion, as opposed to traditional centralized exchanges, with Coinbase as an example. Traditional exchanges utilize an order book, which lists the buy and sell orders of traders, then matches them based on compatible prices.</p><p>Uniswap, in opposition, relies on liquidity pools Liquidity pools are reserves of token pairs (e.g. ETH &amp; USDC) that are contributed by Liquidity Providers (LPs). Anyone can become an LP by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token. Traders then trade against these liquidity pools, rather than directly against each other. This design called an Automated Market Maker (AMM), has gained popularity in the DeFi ecosystem as an alternative to order book-based trading systems. Advantages of AMMs include no counterparty risk and lower barriers to becoming a market maker. A disadvantage however is that there could be a lack of price efficiency. AMMs operate based on a predefined<a href="https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf"> mathematical formula</a> to determine prices. As a result, prices offered may not always reflect the true asset value (although in reality, much of the price differences get arbitraged away by traders). This can lead to slippage and potentially unfavorable trading prices, particularly for larger&nbsp;trades.</p><p>So, what about cash&nbsp;flow?</p><p>Uniswap fees are a function of trading volume and take&nbsp;rate.</p>  Trading Volume: Uniswap, since launching in 2018, has facilitated ~$1.5 trillion in trading volumes. Trading volumes, which are positively correlated with crypto prices, have been negatively affected by the crypto market downturn.  Take Rate: Uniswap’s take rate has changed with version upgrades. V1 and V2 had a model of fixed 30 basis point (bps) fees, while V3, released in May 2021, introduced a tiered system consisting of 5 bps, 30 bps and 100 bps for different pools. This mix shift has compressed the average take rate from 30 bps to approximately 15 bps. UNI token holders can propose and vote on additional fee&nbsp;levels.  <p>Currently, Uniswap directs all trading fees to LPs without allocating any portion to the Uniswap DAO/token holders. This strategy aims to strengthen its network effect and maintain a competitive edge over rivals, perhaps similar to traditional tech platforms’ reinvestment model of sacrificing short-term profitability to build a moat. The optimal allocation of protocol fees between providers of work (in this case LPs) and providers of capital (i.e. token holders) is a recurring debate in crypto communities.</p><p>The Uniswap DAO has also previously discussed implementing a “fee switch” to redirect some fees to UNI token holders, but the proposal was not passed due to concerns about timing and the resultant liquidity levels. An added concern, particularly in the US, is whether sharing fees with the UNI holders would classify Uniswap as an unregistered security. As Uniswap solidifies its network effect and regulatory clarity improves, the fee allocation strategy may&nbsp;evolve.</p> Conclusion, Ocean Protocol, and the&nbsp;Future <p>Ocean Protocol is an open-source toolkit to enable the next generation of value flow on a blockchain and surcharge a New Data Economy. Leveraging web3 and AI: new business models and sustainable practices are now available to experiment with.</p><p>Tokens, like stocks and bonds, can have cash flows supporting their intrinsic value. Crypto, previously the domain of speculators and retail gamblers, is arguably entering a phase of maturation that enables analysts, entrepreneurs, and data scientists to evaluate the fundamental value of new businesses.</p><p>Blockchains are a foundational infrastructure facilitating frictionless value transfer over the internet. DApps built on blockchains (ie Ethereum using Ocean Protocol) are akin to internet-native businesses with unique revenue models, cost structures, competitive advantages, capital allocation strategies, and valuations.</p><p>As blockchain-based economies progress, we anticipate the value to align with project fundamentals in a valuation-conscious manner.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Radicle Civics — Building Proofs of Possibilities for a Civic Economy and&nbsp;Society <blockquote>“Like an operating system, the medium of infrastructure space makes certain things possible and other things impossible. It is not the declared content but rather the content manager dictating the rules of the game.” — Keller Easterling, Extrastatecraft (2014).</blockquote><p>Our infrastructures are vital to enabling the complexity of modern life. Yet the role they have in creating technological, institutional, and behavioural path dependencies is often underestimated. Once they’re built, they continue to drive how we organise society for decades or even centuries through habituation, vested interests, and economies of scale and scope. This happens in often intangible, counterintuitive, and destructive ways. In other words, we shape our infrastructures and thereafter they shape us, and so&nbsp;on…</p><p>André Gorz describes this cyclical logic in his essay ‘<a href="https://unevenearth.org/2018/08/the-social-ideology-of-the-motorcar/">The Social Ideology of the Motorcar</a>’: “The car has made the big city uninhabitable. It has made it stinking, noisy, suffocating, dusty, so congested that nobody wants to go out in the evening anymore. Thus, since cars have killed the city, we need faster cars to escape on superhighways to suburbs that are even farther away…Give us more cars so that we can escape the destruction caused by&nbsp;cars.”</p><p>Economic infrastructures are no different from our roads and concrete jungles. They too have locked us into extractive and harmful pathways. Capital, markets, (intellectual) property regimes, land registries, GDP and other performance metrics, make up seemingly axiomatic cornerstones of our societies, yet they’re based on deliberately narrow, centralised definitions of value that encourage myopic, extractive behaviour. Looking through Eric Beinhocker’s lens of the “<a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/gp/article-abstract/1/1/17578/112212/Toward-a-New-Ontological-Framework-for-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext">ontology stack</a>”, GDP unfolds itself as not just a metric, but the tip of the iceberg of a layered economic infrastructure with an embedded worldview: one that perceives and positions humans as rational, profit-maximising, disembedded beings.</p> Infrastructural and imaginative lock-ins <p>These structural constraints in our economies and societies are now locking us in. We are facing multiple, interconnected crises of the climate, ecosystem, economic inequality, and democracy. These crises are not a crisis of the world, but of our relationship with the world, and how we understand ourselves. We are facing a deep code&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Our current code was written by Enlightenment thinkers, who developed the narrative of autonomous beings, endowed with individual rights and liberty, abstracted from the world around us. To be human, is to think. Nature is a mere backdrop against which humans live out history (<a href="https://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/article/the-lifeworlds-of-law-on-revitalizing-indigenous-legal-orders-today/">Mills, 2016</a>), or even worse, an infinite resource to be mined and consumed. Industrialisation, capitalism, and consumerism have further abstracted humans from being human and remade us into “bad robots” through our alienated labour and that of others. As Edmund Burke cautioned the Enlightenment-inspired revolutionaries, “liberty, too, must be limited in order to be possessed.” And the erosion of these limits, whether these limits are our responsibility to our social or ecological bonds, are in turn, eroding our ability to enjoy liberty&nbsp;itself.</p><p>This centuries-long ontological division between human-nature and production-reproduction has been hardwired into our regulatory, financial, and built infrastructures. It has not only allowed us to dominate, exploit, discard, and waste, but structurally locked us into this reality. We are reaping the consequences in the form of a self-terminating crisis where the things we dismissed as externalities are now threatening our very existence. Whilst many propose patches and quick fixes to the symptoms, we hypothesise that the only way out is to recode ourselves and our being-in-the-world. To build on Easterling, when the “rules of the game” are broken, it’s time to change&nbsp;them.</p><p>What we need is to reconceptualise ourselves as inalienably interconnected and relational beings, as a knot of flows. We need a relational worldview that sees our lives, our cities, our societies, as complex organisms comprising socio-ecological systems and webs of relationships (<a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/oa-edit/10.4324/9781003199816/sacred-civics-jayne-engle-julian-agyeman-tanya-chung-tiam-fook">Engle 2022</a>). We need to redesign our infrastructures so that they centre this complex entanglement and enable all beings — be they humans, future humans, and more-than-humans — to individually and collectively thrive.</p><p>What does it mean to see the world through the lens of ‘knots of flows’? Let’s explore this through a seemingly simple dining table. This table starts from soil to trees, from trees to lumber, from lumber through multiple stages of processing and transportation, to becoming a table, which then will be used for eating, playing, drawing, and working, providing numerous flows of social, economic, cultural, and emotional value. Over time, the table will be resold and recycled, enter into different homes with different flows of value, or be turned into materials for new tables, chairs, or paper, which will in turn be composted, returned to the soil, and transformed into new flows of&nbsp;value.</p> Germinating new civic futures with proofs of possibilities <p>Bruno Latour said, “Change the instruments, and you will change the entire social theory that goes with them.” Over the last six months, Dark Matter Labs has been trying to do precisely this with our Radicle Civics portfolio: changing instruments and civic infrastructures to enable a new social theory that recognises our entanglement and centres interdependence, care, and deep democracy.</p><p>The focus on civics is a fundamental one, because to address this deep code problem we must even preempt assumptions of a social contract with a state or a government. Civics for us extends far beyond conventional representative democracies, bordered places, and central jurisdictions. Civics starts instead with the most elemental of our social relationships: our mutual interdependencies from which forms of social organisation emerge. In this sense, reimagining civics is about both process and outcome. It requires us to expand our understanding of citizens who partake in these interdependencies to include humans and more-than-humans, and to reconfigure the ways in which we collectively relate and interact with one another, towards non-coercive, empathic, caring, and peer-to-peer systems. It is through this reimagining of civics that we can cultivate renewed civic capital and resilience that can serve to act as bulwark against any over-concentration of power, intentional or otherwise, while enabling collective thriving.</p><p>With the financial and strategic support of <a href="https://p4ne.org/">Partners for A New Economy,</a> <a href="https://www.landcommission.gov.scot/">Scottish Land Commission</a>, and <a href="https://weareopus.org/">Opus Independents</a>, Radicle Civics has been building a vibrant ecosystem of diverse partners including the River Dôn Project, Law and Political Economy Europe, and the Design Museum London (and more to be announced). Together, we have sowed the seeds for new civic infrastructures through a number of ‘proofs of possibilities’: visceral experiences and situated experiments that embody a new logic for how we can relate to each other and our environment, how we can recognize value beyond markets and money, and how we can nurture a deeper democratic agency. They are akin to what Erik Olin Wright has called “<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/2143-envisioning-real-utopias">real utopias</a>” or what Giorgos Kallis refers to as “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24537850">incubators of counter-hegemony</a>”: not distant fantasies but concrete and contextual manifestations of alternative futures that help render new paradigms part of our ‘everyday’. They do this not just by updating our shared civic protocols, but also through ‘common sense’ in Isabelle Stenger’s meaning of “making sense in common”, with communities in their contexts.</p><p>Our vision for a new ‘everyday’ focuses on our relationships with our homes, land, and rivers. These natural and built infrastructures are so foundational to our everyday lives that they provide the ideal leverage points in which we can explore, reshape, and practise different ways of being and relating in the world together. In particular, they aim to demonstrate how reshaping the dark matter of our systems reshape possible futures. It is in our everyday experiences that we can uncover, in the words of David Graeber, “the ultimate, hidden truth of the world, […] that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.”</p><p>So what would it look like to liberate our homes, land, and rivers from the logic of objectification, dominion, and extraction coded into our current economy? What would it mean to transcend alienation from our planetary entanglement and acknowledge that no-body and no-thing can be owned or dominated by another? How could our shared infrastructures be free, and in their freedom, generate freedom for us and the world around us? These provocations for emancipated civic infrastructures are embodied in four proofs of possibilities:</p>  FreeHouse (in collaboration with <a href="https://moos.space/about/">Moos Space</a> in&nbsp;Berlin)  FreeLand (in collaboration with <a href="https://www.landcommission.gov.scot/">the Scottish Land Commission</a> and <a href="https://halifax.citynews.ca/2023/06/27/funding-for-new-mikmaw-friendship-centre-in-halifax-close-to-50-million/">the new Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Centre</a>)  FreeRiver (<a href="https://www.theriverdon.org/">The River Dôn&nbsp;Project</a>)  FreeSpace (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/re-permissioning-the-city-unlocking-cities-growing-underutilised-spatial-assets-for-an-emergent-1550997714a4?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------">Re:permissioning the&nbsp;city</a>)  <p>We will highlight our work on FreeHouse, FreeRiver, and FreeSpace in more detail below, while we will publish a separate piece on FreeLand in the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>We’ve attempted to distil our collective exploration and experimentation into three critical shifts in worldview. We believe these form the embryonic shoots for a new social theory and its corresponding civic infrastructures: a shift from objects to agents, from externalities to entanglements, and from public-private to commoning. Each of our proofs of possibilities sits at the intersection of these foundational shifts as manifestations of this worldview.</p> Worldview shift 1: From objects to&nbsp;agents <p>Western law allows us to become property owners and through that gain exclusive control to exploit and extract economic value from things framed as ‘property’ such as homes and land. In <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Contract+and+Domination-p-9780745636214">Contract and Domination,</a> Carole Pateman shows how property rights were used to justify the colonisation of land, the monopolisation of scarce resources, and the privatisation of value extraction while commoning its consequences. Rather than simply tinkering at the edges of property ownership and circumscribing its social and ecological impacts, Radicle Civics is exploring a shift in the very roots of this system. Instead of seeing humans as subjects and the Earth as objects and commodities, can we recognise ‘selfhood’ and agency of everything, from flora and fauna, to rivers, the land, and the homes we build there? Instead of ownership, can we reimagine ties with the land and the Earth as part of a network of relationships built on care, mutuality, and reciprocity in a community of humans and more-than-humans?</p><p>Ownership is one theory of control and can only ever optimise for one output: the exclusive interests of the owners. It is structurally not designed to optimise for multiple entangled stakeholders, interests, and benefits. Instead, these are only considered when different owners’ rights are in conflict, or through regulations that limit the exercise of these rights in narrow contexts. These are blunt mechanisms for the complexity of our systemic crises. When we see the world from an entangled value proposition, we recognise a fundamental need to move beyond ownership to a relational model. The self-ownership of land, rivers, and houses allows us to subvert the existing system of ownership by ruling out the possibility of an owner. Without the owner’s dominating control, these beings can exercise agency for their own needs, in relation to one another. Rather than property contracts that would transfer exclusive rights, we would enter into care and stewardship relationships that would balance rights and responsibilities between the needs of equal&nbsp;beings.</p><p>So what could this self-ownership of land or rivers look like? How might we imagine their enfranchisement? For this, we are building on the wisdom of different Indigenous peoples that have traditionally granted great stature to nature and future generations and found ways to speak on their behalf, as well as the growing Rights of Nature movement. Radicle Civics is exploring how we can harness assistive technologies and alternative governance design to effectively realise the agency of more-than-human actors and usher in a cultural shift beyond Anthropocentrism.</p><p>Our current technologies of bureaucracy are still extensions of analogue models — ‘paperwork’ still has a literal meaning, even if the pages are digital. And the way we currently use these bureaucratic technologies to manage the world as objects has reductionist tendencies. With the availability of abundant data and our capability to process it orders of magnitude greater, this is no longer a constraint, but in fact an enabler of an agent-based worldview. With tools like digital twins, we now can dynamically and non-exclusively identify, organise, and interact with this information while ensuring it is constantly verified with reality. When applied to governance, computational bureaucracy can support plurality and coherence, as demonstrated by machine learning tools like <a href="https://pol.is/home">Polis</a>, and at planetary and hyperlocal scales simultaneously. Distributed protocols, such as blockchain, of verifying, transacting, making sense and decisions can be done with integrity without relying on central authorities. By treating these as assistive technologies that allow us to interact with an agent-based worldview, it serves an ennobling function, allowing humans, more-than-humans and machines to interact in a peer-to-peer way, and operationalise this new vision of&nbsp;civics.</p><p>Our Proof of Possibility: FreeRiver — River Dôn Project and Interface for&nbsp;Care</p><p>Together with <a href="https://weareopus.org/">Opus Independents</a> and a group of partners, including Lawyers for Nature, Sheffield Hallam University, Urban Flows Observatory: The University of Sheffield, Sheffield Data for Good, Urban Flows Observatory, South Yorkshire Sustainability Centre, and Don Catchment Rivers Trust, we are working on the <a href="https://www.theriverdon.org/">River Dôn Project</a>. The project aims to create an alternative model for relating to the River Don through recognising its personhood and hopes to unlock new ways of seeing, understanding, valuing, empathising with and caring for the River as an&nbsp;agent.</p><p>Building on our <a href="https://civic-ai.org/connectedurbanforest/">CivicAI work</a>, Dark Matter Labs is working on designing an Interface for Care to engender new caring relationships and stewardship action for the river. Our Interface for Care will use a mix of interfaces, from chatbots to augmented reality, to feedback ecosystem data tangibly and meaningfully. This will grow our collective intelligence and cultivate deep empathy and a sense of belonging with the river ecosystem. Through different expressive media, we will explore how the river can best communicate its needs and values. Can a river write a poem to express its hurt over being polluted? Would a heart-to-heart conversation empower communities to take proactive action to care for the river? We will explore how an evolving empathic relationship built through the Interface can be leveraged for citizens entering into new types of stewardship agreements with the river around specific individual and collective actions of care. The Interface will capture input from citizens on their care actions, and complete the feedback loop by expressing the positive impact of their agency as part of an iterative process of learning to deepen and evolve care. The Interface also explores how a care economy around the river can be built, such as by guiding human behaviour towards better stewardship via social (rather than financial) incentives, such as thank you letters and&nbsp;art.</p> Worldview shift 2: From externalities to entanglements <p>The <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~jfarley/EEseminar/readings/energy%20myths.pdf">original sin of modern economics</a> according to Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen is the illusion that our economies do not depend on resources, energy, and waste sinks, and can thus continue to expand exponentially. Companies have been allowed to maximise profits by commandeering ‘nature’s gifts’ as cheaply as possible, while absolving them of any obligation to repair, restore, or replenish what they take. A <a href="https://grist.org/business-technology/none-of-the-worlds-top-industries-would-be-profitable-if-they-paid-for-the-natural-capital-they-use/">study by Trucost</a> found that none of the world’s top industries would be profitable if they paid for the natural capital they use. The total unpriced natural capital consumed cost our planet $7.3 trillion a year — 13 percent of global GDP in 2009. This damage is simply treated by our economic system as ‘externalities’, external to the interests and liabilities ascribed to the owner, with these true costs falling on everyone and everything else. In other words, externalities are convenient fiction enabled by property, the arbitrary premise that property and its value can be enclosed from the world around&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>“Categories such as ‘away’ have evaporated: one doesn’t throw a candy wrapper away, one drops it on Mount Everest” — Timothy Morton, Humankind.</blockquote><p>Externalities are not just an accounting glitch: they are a denial of our complex entanglement (as Barry Commoner stated in one of his laws of ecology, “Everything Is Connected To Everything Else” ) and a structural flaw in our economic theory of value. In realising we live in a resource-scarce world, we should also recognise that value should not be enclosable and alienated from the world around it, but that value is relational and entangled with the world. In a worldview that sees agents, not objects, value comes from relationships between agents (for example, the value of a tree as a habitat to an insect). But value can also be an emergent property of this complex system of relationships (for example, from individual relationships of habitation between flora, fauna, and geography emerges the biodiversity value of the ecosystem). Once we accept the complexity of entanglement, our theory of value also becomes necessarily complex. We are starting to sketch out loose taxonomies to help us transition our worldview and economy from an extractive to entangled understanding of value, starting with the&nbsp;house:</p><p>This entangled theory of value will in turn shape our decision-making: what should our civic infrastructures be designed to value, prioritise, and encourage? In turn, how might our <a href="https://www.civic.capital/">civic financial models </a>(across regulation, investment, accounting, taxation, insurance and procurement) evolve to account for this multi-dimensional, entangled and longitudinal forms of value, and leverage the institutional and private capital needed to solve the complex social and environmental challenges created by the legacy of externalities? For example, compare an uncomfortable, energy-inefficient, rent-seeking house built unsustainably to a house that is designed in harmony with the environment, its inhabitants, and society: does our current economic system truly account for the full difference in value between the two? If not, what would a new economy and housing model for the latter look like? We hope to explore these questions through our proof of possibility.</p><p>Our Proof of Possibility: FreeHouse</p><p>The house is a widely familiar and relatable space; it also sits at the intersection of economic, social and environmental systems, making it an ideal site for experimentation for this entangled theory of value. What if the house is no longer a property to be bought and sold like any other commodity? Instead, the house is self-owning entity that embodies a knot of value flows: the value of materials into and out of the house when it is constructed and deconstructed; the value of flood risk reduction from sustainable urban drainage approach; the value of the energy the house generates, uses, and contributes back to the grid; the value of its role in the ecosystem of organisms that live in and around it; the value of its sustainable construction as a carbon store; the value of ‘home’ for belonging and mental well-being; and the value of being a constituent part of a wider community.</p><p>When the house is recognised as a knot of value flows, and that these flows have multiple beneficiaries and multiple liability holders, how can we reimagine and invest in the house, not as a vehicle for speculation and extraction but as a generator of common benefits? To realise this theory of value, we are testing these critical components:</p><p>1. Generative financing and decision-making driven by entangled common&nbsp;value</p><p>The house embodies the creation of multiple value through energy generation, food production, social interactions, ecosystem services, etc. Instead of extracting rent, this entangled theory of value is an opportunity to design a generative business model that maximises the house’s creation of this common value, while allowing the house to sustain itself in the long term, such as maintenance and servicing its own loans. We will be designing the frameworks needed to make these value flows and relationships legible, such as entangled value mapping. We will also be scoping the infrastructure needed to make this value operationalisable, both tradeable systems (such as outcome buying and multi-valent currencies) to non-tradeable systems (such as that of care and gratitude).</p><p>The theory of entangled value will influence our decision-making process. Short of the house being fully autonomous in exercising its agency, we will be designing the kind of governance and decision-making structures needed to help it achieve its generative mission, rather than serving the private interests of owners. These structures will also accommodate the participation of the house’s both human and more-than-human neighbours and interdependent stakeholders.</p><p>2. Commons governance for cohabitation</p><p>From an agent-to-agent perspective, use value is generated through the relationship between houses and their inhabitants. Currently, we are exploring the design of stewardship agreements, drawing inspiration from Michel Serres’ concept of <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/9725/natural_contract">The Natural Contract</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/traditional-ecological-knowledge">Traditional Ecological Knowledge</a> in order to actualise our entangled relationships with the systems that sustain us. These agreements would balance the right to live in the FreeHouse with the responsibility to care for it and the relationships it has with the world around it. In other words, this stewardship relationship is multilateral: in return for an affordable comfortable home, inhabitants may undertake responsibilities that involve maintaining the house, promoting the flourishing of wildlife, and also being a responsible member of the local community.</p><p>Housing inequality emerges from systemic misallocation: wealth accumulation enabled by property often leads to excluding others from fulfilling their fundamental housing needs and addressing broader societal and environmental concerns, including climate transition and mental wellbeing. In other words, property has a social function and the right of exclusion also comes at a societal opportunity cost. A self-owning house already exempts it from a market-based approach to resource allocation. But we are exploring alternative approaches to decide who gets to live in a FreeHouse, by moving beyond a mere reallocation of use rights to fostering a culture of cohabitation. We are starting a new civic conversation with potential residents over what is a fair balance between needs for ‘homeliness’ and opportunity costs for the wider community of agents, including those who may not reside in the house or immediate neighbourhood.</p><p>3. Materials on loan from the&nbsp;commons</p><p>Material value encompasses both the advantages of agents possessing materials for their function, the responsibility to avoid wastefulness, and the opportunity cost of those materials serving other functions. The choice of materials used in constructing a house can profoundly influence the environment and the well-being of its occupants.</p><p>What if the materials used in the construction of the house are leased instead of owned? A fully circular economy that avoids resource depletion has indisputably greater value than our current model of unsustainably extracting new resources without considering their subsequent reuse. How this full circularity emerges will require a system-level infrastructure for enforcing the long-term responsibilities of possessing materials. Currently, we are exploring the idea of a Carbon Storage Lease, which involves testing whether a long-term or perpetual instrument like a lease agreement can be utilised to ensure that carbon remains stored throughout the lifecycle of materials such as&nbsp;timber.</p> Worldview shift 3: From public-private to commoning <p>We’re continuing to use approaches designed for another era to tackle challenges of today, opting for one-size-fits-all or centralised responses that were limited by the quality and quantity of information and technology available. In the age of increased uncertainty with complex, interconnected challenges, these approaches are increasingly showing their age. These challenges transcend our constructs of boundaries, departments, and disciplines: global problems such as pandemics, climate change, or growing inequality can not simply be solved by one government, or even a coalition of governments. Simultaneously, the growing abundance of mass sensing and data has the potential to provide public benefits, but also bring with them the risks of power and information asymmetries, vulnerabilities, and abuse of privacy from the centralisation of such data. We have reached the edge of our theory of control: we need to reconsider the ways in which we make decisions over shared resources, beyond carving out domains of exclusive control.</p><p>Radicle Civics explores how commoning (or <a href="https://thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.927">“becoming in common</a>” as Andrea Nightingale describes it) can usher in a new age of planetary collaboration and unbounded fluidity in the way we use our resources, materials, and spaces and solution for our shared risks. This shift will simultaneously require and cultivate a major reorientation around new collective intelligence models and social and civic capital. We are already seeing the potential of these multi-capital systems manifested: <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/12/31/trees-planted-councils-die-rush-job-show-green-credentials/">a tree planted by some local authorities has a chance for survival as low as 10%, while a tree cared for properly by a community should have over a 90% chance of survival</a>, an illustration of the difference between centralised management and distributed care. We are exploring how we can leverage technology to activate pre-existing economies of care and build new ones. Technologies such as distributed computing, ledgers, and smart contracts, can be used to both build new sense-making and learning capabilities, helping align actions among multiple stakeholders, reducing associated costs, and advancing the generative, plus-sum value of collaboration.</p><p>Our Proof of Possibility: FreeSpace and Permissioning the&nbsp;City</p><p>Most of us are familiar with seeing rivers or land as commons: but how about commoning applied to vacant buildings? Our cities are full of under-utilised spaces as a result of the pandemic, the evolution of work, and demographic and economic restructuring. However, we currently do not have any fiscal incentives or regulatory frameworks in place to leverage these assets for our collective benefit, even though the ongoing underutilisation of these assets incurs a societal cost. With FreeSpace, we are exploring how we can unlock a city’s public and private spatial assets for civic use through new types of commoning, such as using micro-stewardship smart contracts and peer-to-peer deliberation with other agents. It asks how we can encourage a practice of commoning and culture of stewardship towards shared urban assets that goes beyond traditional rental or ownership models. For instance, can we transform a vacant office space into a partial commons by overlaying common ways of governing of a specific space — for instance a shared kitchen — or for a specific duration — such as monthly Tuesday evenings, and do so while measuring and ensuring the impact is net-positive on its interdependent stakeholders? Our Korea team recently published how they are building this experiment of new civic allocation in the context of Daegu city with <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/re-permissioning-the-city-unlocking-cities-growing-underutilised-spatial-assets-for-an-emergent-1550997714a4">Re:permissioning the&nbsp;City.</a></p> Three shifts towards a new&nbsp;economy <p>As Denise Hearn describes, “how we construct monetary, financial, and economic systems is not an exercise of cold calculation. Our systems, more accurately, are an expression of our cultural, philosophical, and even religious views about who we are as a species and how to best organise society.” We have identified three shifts in our worldviews that we believe to be critical in how we should relate to each other and the world as a reimagining of civics from its very roots. By recognising the world as interdependent agents, from which distributed and dynamic ways of organising and commoning can emerge, we hope this redefinition of civics can not only have implications for how we coexist, but also brings with it a new thesis of economics.</p><p>When we move beyond treating beings as economic objects for extraction (assets) to recognise the the subjecthood inherent in every being, when we unlock these beings’ capability to partake in decentralised monetary production to structure their own value flows, when we account for plus-sum behaviours such as care, trust, gifting, and collective knowing, these shifts in the axioms of our economic system open up new pathways of progress, and allow us escape out of the deepening rut caused by our previous system. And we believe the proofs of possibility we have chosen to work on, the self-owning economic agent (FreeHouse), interfaces for caring for agents (FreeRiver), and methods for agent-to-agent deliberation (FreeSpace), will be components critical for this agent-based economic system to become a&nbsp;reality.</p> What’s Next? <p>We hope that the framing of the ontological shifts and proof of possibilities provide a tangible sense of possible futures. In the upcoming months and years, we are continuing to collaborate with diverse partners in various locations, contexts, and lead markets to develop further proofs of possibilities. Through these initiatives, we seek to identify and demonstrate other strategic interventions that open up pathways towards recognising in our cultures and infrastructures the world as a complex relational system.</p><p>There are a few more projects we are cooking at the&nbsp;moment:</p>  FreeHouse Berlin: Creating opportunities for embodied experiences and meaningful civic conversations that foster societal-level imagination and drive profound structural and systemic transformations. This journey begins with the exploration of stewardship agreements, allocation systems, and innovative financial mechanisms, all of which lay the groundwork for the necessary and impactful shifts&nbsp;ahead.  FreeSense: Self-owning surveillance cameras to explore the public value created by sensors, and how they can be governed without centralised control, addressing security and privacy dilemmas.  Civic News City Sheffield: Nurturing deep listening capabilities in Sheffield using the interplay of media and events for deliberation, and creating a new hybrid civic space for ongoing citizen assemblies and collective sensemaking.  Neighbourhood as Commons/ Shared Street Sheffield: Centring neighbourhoods as the foundational unit of change to unlock system-level outcomes (i.e. trust, resilience, well-being, flows of information) and build new capabilities for collective sensemaking and&nbsp;action.  Our ongoing learning circles with diverse experts in citizen science, art and cultural organising, constitutional and contract law, token economics, blockchain and distributed organising and deep dives into our strategic design questions (with deep gratitude to Law and Political Economy Europe, Holochain, da0 civic tech community).

But if your registration process is time-consuming and complex, your potential customer may get frustrated and abandon your site – even if they love your product or service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So where will they go when they leave? They’ll most likely head to a competitor who offers a shorter and easier registration method, and they may never return to your brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article will focus on how to build a first-rate registration process so current and new customers can create an account quickly and easily and continue their customer journey with your brand.</p>

  <p>The global <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1048705/worldwide-biometrics-market-revenue/">biometrics market</a> is expected to grow to a staggering $82.9 billion by 2027 and organizations have taken notice of its many capabilities. In particular, as cyberattackers and their tools become more sophisticated, it's become increasingly challenging to protect digital assets. Biometrics are known to have been a boon to digital security and data protection, but there are a variety of other use cases across industries.</p>
	
 What are biometrics? 
	
<p>Biometrics are automated methods used to identify an individual or verify/authenticate an individual's identity based on physiological characteristics and behavioral traits. Government and law enforcement agencies often use biometrics to "identify" people (capturing a fingerprint, for example, and comparing it to a database of fingerprints to see if there's a match). Enterprises typically use the "verify/authenticate" type of biometrics, which automates recognition using biological identifiers, such as a facial scan or even one's keystrokes or gait.</p>
	
<p>Some of the most <a href="https://optimalidm.com/resources/blog/types-of-biometrics-sensors">commonly used biometrics</a> include measurable features of:</p>

  Faces 
   Fingerprints 
   Irises 
   Voices 
   Gait 
   Gestures 
   Keystrokes 
   Palm or finger veins 
  How are biometrics used today? 

<p>Some of the practical <a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/market-leadership/publications-media/the-top-9-common-uses-of-biometrics-in-everyday-life/">applications of biometrics</a> in the enterprise and everyday life, include:</p>

  Access to mobile devices 
   <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> for apps 
   Banking, such as ATMs 
   Blood donation tracking 
   Physical access to secure buildings, campuses, and secure areas in hospitals 
   Medication dispensers 
   Healthcare applications, such as medical alerts 
   Public transportation access and tracking 
   Virtual assistants, such as Alexa 
   Employee <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">access management</a> 
  How do biometrics work? 
<p><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-biometrics-how-do-they-work/">Biometrics systems work</a> by comparing data. Systems capture biometric data, convert that data into a digital template, store the template, and analyze the presented biometric — comparing it against the stored template to determine if there is a match.</p>

<p>Because identifiable features, like fingerprint patterns, rarely change, they are ideal for verification purposes. A sensor – such as a fingerprint scanner or camera – can detect and recognize a user's unique characteristics. On some devices, such as an iPhone, the fingerprint is stored on the device itself and is never shared. In other cases, biometrics systems have a database of stored metrics that are used to analyze the recorded metrics against others.</p>
	
 How biometrics applications benefit enterprises 
	
<p>The use of biometrics is clearly revolutionizing the way organizations handle security – and though security is the most common application, there are many others. In the healthcare industry, smart wearable devices use biometrics for health monitoring. Some applications add artificial intelligence (AI) to speed decisioning and detect attempts at unauthorized activities. And others use biometrics to improve operational efficiencies. Here are seven ways biometrics is supporting digital organizations.</p>
	
	 1. Increased accuracy for automated systems 
	
<p>An automated biometric identification system (<a href="https://www.aware.com/automated-biometric-identification-system">ABIS</a>) is a large-scale system that compares recorded biometrics to a massive database of other biometrics. ABIS can be used by enterprises to perform identity checks for new hires or customers, comparing their IDs to those in an existing applicant or criminal database.</p>

<p>In healthcare, providers are starting to use ABIS to identify patients before delivering care to ensure that the right patients are receiving the right treatments. These <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identities</a> can also help reduce identity fraud in any sector. It's harder, for example, to replicate or fake biometrics than it is to steal a password, forge a signature, or use credit card or Social Security numbers. However, generative AI is making it easier to impersonate others, so identity systems that use voice recognition and video will have to evolve to stay ahead of the attackers using AI to create new methods of attack.</p>
	
	 2. Faster and more secure transactions 
	
<p>The use of biometric authentication makes digital transactions more secure by removing the leading cause of breaches: compromised credentials. It also reduces "friction" for legitimate users by eliminating the need to remember a password or enter a code sent to a mobile device. And it reduces the chance that employees and customers will experience security fatigue.</p>

<p>Security fatigue occurs when users become frustrated with repeated, arduous security tasks. It can lead to risky online behavior, such as accepting a push notification to authenticate a login that the user didn't initiate. Attackers are taking advantage of this fatigue by launching <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a> attacks.</p>

<p>To reduce friction, avoid security fatigue, and eliminate the threat of identity-based attacks that rely on the use of stolen credentials (including passwords), organizations are adopting <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>. Passwordless authentication offers a variety of ways to verify a user's identity without passwords and include biometric methods, such as facial recognition or a fingerprint scan.</p>
	
	 3. Integration with other technologies 
	
<p>The internet of things (IoT) relates to any internet-connected device that communicates information, often across platforms. Many industries, including manufacturing and healthcare, use IoT devices to share information securely and quickly to employees and customers. In a healthcare setting, this may include a glucose monitor or pacemaker that shares a patient's readings with the patient's doctor. In manufacturing, it may include sensors that relay information from the factory floor to inventory systems or suppliers. All these systems can improve efficiency and information-sharing, but they need to be secure, too, and that's where biometrics comes in.</p>

<p>Biometrics is beginning to integrate into the IoT ecosystem to improve security and the user experience. Not only are biometrics a quicker way to gain access to platforms and apps to receive pertinent information, but they're also a safer way to do so.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance</a> is crucial to managing authorized access to sensitive information, and biometrics are being used to improve the accuracy of this authorized access. For example, the biometric templates of former business partners could be entered into a list that prevents them from accessing sensitive company information and digital assets after the partnership's dissolution.</p>
	
	 4. Sustained authentication processes 
	
<p>Authentication processes that use biometrics are more sustainable long-term because biometrics is known as an "inherence" factor — in other words, something we are – which rarely changes and is difficult for malicious actors to steal or mimic. Passwords are a knowledge factor – something we know – which means they can be compromised (stolen), shared, intercepted, or cracked, which is getting easier thanks to AI.</p>

<p>Instead of passwords, also known as static shared secrets, organizations are turning to biometrics for verification. It not only streamlines the authentication process but makes it more secure and less subject to compromise for a longer period.</p>
	
	 5. Automated time and attendance tracking 
	
<p>Since organizations are using biometrics to allow access into buildings and digital platforms, they have the ability to automatically track employee and customer attendance. This data can be useful for leadership to analyze the cause of dips in engagement and attendance.</p>

<p>Biometric technology also eliminates the risk of employees logging in on behalf of other employees or sharing passwords. Time tracking is another part of employee behavior that can be prone to user error. To avoid errors in time tracking or time theft, organizations are using biometrics to more accurately manage time logs. This can include camera-based sensors that detect a user, or keystroke recognition software that tells employers how long employees are actually working. This is also easier and less tedious for employees than tracking their time manually.</p>
	
	 6. Streamlined payments and transactions 
	
<p>Payment processing is a crucial function of many digital businesses. Now, all retailers that conduct payment transactions can use biometrics. Shoppers can register for a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/biometric-payment">biometric payment</a> program if they sign up with proper identification and input their biometrics to a secure database provided by the company.</p>

<p>Then, whenever customers want to check out, they can scan their fingerprint instead of reaching for a credit card. This is quicker and safer in many ways, largely because it no longer requires the customer to use a plastic card or account number that someone could potentially steal and use.</p>
	
	 7. Increased employee productivity 
	
<p>The absence of security fatigue can enhance employee productivity. Companies that allow their employees access to resources quickly – without lengthy authentication processes – will likely see a rise in productivity and employee satisfaction. Employees can spend more time on important work tasks and less time remembering complex passwords or submitting help desk tickets when they are locked out of their accounts.</p>

<p>From faster, more secure transactions to automated attendance and time tracking, the growing biometrics market is poised to affect organizations across sectors – and this is only the beginning. Biometrics will continue to advance, streamlining and securing the digital identity experience for employees, partners, and customers – whether they're patients, constituents, students, members, or others. Stay abreast of current technological advancements – the right solutions will propel your organization onward and upward; it's up to you to find and implement them.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The global digital ecosystem finds itself facing a new breed of cyber threat actors: loosely organized groups with a penchant for extortion, chaos, and the desire to gain notoriety. The US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) recently released a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/CSRB_Lapsus%24_508c.pdf">comprehensive report</a> detailing a series of cyberattacks carried out by a threat group known as Lapsus$. These attacks, which hit a zenith in 2022, targeted a range of high-profile companies and government agencies. They offer a textbook, real-world scenario highlighting systemic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in our interconnected digital infrastructure. Let’s delve into the key findings of the CSRB report and the implications they hold for organizations and individuals alike.</p>  
 The Lapsus$ Watershed Moment  
<p>Lapsus$ was arguably a watershed moment because the group orchestrated a series of attacks that shook the cybersecurity community. These attacks were remarkable not because of their sophistication, but rather their effectiveness against even the most well-resourced and well-defended entities. The CSRB's investigation revealed that Lapsus$ thrived on exploiting systemic weaknesses in the digital ecosystem, targeting vulnerabilities in downstream vendors, telecommunications providers, and even employees through social engineering tactics.</p> 
 Lessons in Vulnerability  
<p>One of the most alarming findings from the report is the inadequate nature of current multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementations. Lapsus$ and similar groups were able to penetrate organizations by exploiting <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">weaknesses in SMS and voice-based MFA methods</a>. The attackers utilized <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/sim-swapping">SIM swapping</a> attacks to intercept one-time passcodes and push notifications sent via SMS, rendering traditional MFA measures ineffective. The CSRB strongly advocates for a transition to more robust and secure <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/how-passwordless-authentication-works">passwordless authentication methods</a>, specifically Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)2-compliant solutions, to mitigate these risks effectively. Robust FIDO2 solutions include synced passkeys for consumers and device-bound passkeys for workforce authentication.</p> 
 Example of a Fraudulent SIM Swap  
<p></p> 
<p>Source: Review of the Attacks Associated With Lapsus$ and Related Threat Groups, Cyber Safety Review Board, July 24, 2023</p> 
 Access Controls &amp; Third Party Connections  
<p>The report underlines the efficacy of initial access brokers (IABs) and information stealing malware, which allow cybercriminals to purchase valid login credentials for targeted organizations through the dark web. Lapsus$ leveraged these underground markets to gain entry not only to organizations themselves but also to their third-party servicers and business process outsourcers (BPOs). This highlights the importance of considering <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-passwordless-mfa-for-the-supply-chain">third-party risks</a> in an organization's risk management program, because attackers often exploit these relationships to infiltrate their ultimate targets.</p> 
 Securing the Future  
<p>The CSRB report serves as a wake up call to organizations to bolster their cybersecurity defenses and prepare for the continued evolution of new and dynamic attacks which target authentication and identity-related attack vectors. Resilience against threat actor groups like Lapsus$ requires a multifaceted approach. This includes identity verification, continuous <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a>, authentication that eliminates passwords and shared secrets, and well-established incident response procedures that can leverage and share insights from the extended security ecosystem.</p> 
 Rounding Out The Response  
<p>The report acknowledges the crucial role of law enforcement in combating cyber threats but underscores chronic underreporting issues that hinder effective cybersecurity efforts. Furthermore, local law enforcement must have the funding, training and escalation procedures in place to investigate and react in a timely and appropriate manner in order to thwart attack attempts and minimize damage when attacks occur.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>The lessons learned from Lapsus$ are invaluable: the need for stronger authentication methods, comprehensive access controls, a <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-power-of-risk-based-authentication-with-hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a> approach and collaborative efforts involving both the public and private sectors. As we move forward, the report's recommendations should serve as a roadmap to a safer and more resilient digital future.</p> 
<p>The CSRB report on the Lapsus$ cyber threat actor group serves as a timely reminder of the vulnerabilities that persist within our interconnected digital infrastructure. While the attacks were not carried out by nation-state actors, their impact reverberated globally, highlighting the fragility of our cybersecurity defenses and the need for us all to “do better.”&nbsp;</p>

 Release of official counter fraud guidelines signals another step in the right direction toward fraud prevention in the UK. 



 



<p>Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">May’s fraud strategy paper,</a> the UK government has released official counter fraud guidelines to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK, which currently amounts to around £3 billion in losses per year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘Government Counter Fraud Profession – Fraud Prevention Standard for Counter Fraud Professionals’ <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1170631/3270_GCFP_Prevention_Standard_V.5.pdf">paper i</a>s billed as a resource for counter fraud specialists to refresh their knowledge and plug any gaps in their capability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Writing on LinkedIn, Mark Cheeseman, Chief Executive of the Public Sector Fraud Authority said:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is the latest milestone in over a year’s work with experts from across sectors and countries to codify the knowledge, skills and experience for fraud prevention professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those who commit fraud are continually evolving and developing their capability to be successful. If we want to have a bigger impact, we need to systematically build our own capability – building from the hard-won experiences of those who have, and are, taking action on fraud.”</p>



 What is in the ‘Government Counter Fraud Profession – Fraud Prevention Standard for Counter Fraud Professionals’ paper? 



<p>The 80-page document features comprehensive information on the Competency Framework (outlining the knowledge, skills and experience required by those undertaking fraud prevention), and guidance for professionals. Whether in the public or private sector, having a counter fraud culture is imperative to protect the business and its customers.</p>



<blockquote><p>The impact of fraud cannot be overstated. Although many may think of the monetary or organizational disruption of fraud, financial crime like money laundering can also lead to or facilitate numerous societal ills, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/">human trafficking or the financing of terrorism</a>. It can also have a significant impact to the victim’s mental health.</p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



 What are the benefits of an anti-fraud strategy? 



<p>The benefits of having fully trained counter fraud professionals in the private and public sector are numerous:</p>



<p>Reassures the public: Having a strategy and adequate tools and controls in place, alongside trained counter fraud professionals reassures the public that the services they use are safe and secure, and that the government or specific company is serious about protecting users.</p>



<p>Protects vulnerable members of the public: As fraud often has a disproportionate effect on the vulnerable (the old, the sick, the poor), it is this section of society that are either most dependent on government services like welfare or would feel the most acute impact from a loss of money. </p>



<p>Improves effectiveness of services: With a well thought out approach to safeguard against fraud, and a rigorous and robust identity verification service, you can ensure your users access the services or payments that only they are entitled to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Optimize operations, increase speed of transactions: Taking a proactive, preventative approach to fraud by implementing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML and KYC measures</a> saves money in the long run. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">Automated identity verification</a> can increase the speed and security of transactions, while creating a safer environment.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a counter fraud professional? 



<p>A <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/730050/Annex_B_-_GCFP_Brochure.pdf">Counter Fraud Professional (CFP) </a>is someone who focuses on fraud prevention, and who will work to implement proactive and preventative controls within their organization. A CFP will need a good working understanding of the different types of fraud, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/document-fraud/">document fraud</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/synthetic-identity-fraud/">synthetic identity fraud</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/embezzlement/">embezzlement</a>, as well as the causes and motivators of fraud. A chief part of the CFP role is also to collaborate with other invested stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the 8 key steps for counter fraud professionals to follow? 



<p>The Competency Framework is comprised of eight key components, featuring the requisite knowledge, skills and experience required for CFPs to comply with. There are three different levels to attain: Trainee (developing introductory knowledge); Foundation (having the knowledge), and Practitioner (demonstrating the knowledge).<br></p>


 
 
 
 1. Counter fraud management: 
 

<p>Display understanding of why fraud is committed and the impact of fraud, alongside the correct reporting procedure.</p>

 
 
 
 2. Legislation: 
 

<p>Demonstrate knowledge of relevant legislation, including data protection.</p>

 
 
 
 3. Risk management: 
 

<p>Proficient in a range of risk management techniques, including determining priorities, using business process mapping and controls to mitigate fraud, and influence policy plans.</p>

 
 
 
 4. Business analysis: 
 

<p>Identify and use data in fraud prevention. For example, using analytical techniques and datasets.</p>

 
 
 
 5. Prevention methodologies: 
 

<p>Utilize a process specifically created to calculate prevented fraud figures, thereby encouraging innovation before controls are implemented.</p>

 
 
 
 6. Stakeholder engagement: 
 

<p>Engage with stakeholders to implement fraud prevention controls and foster collaborative processes and relationships.</p>

 
 
 
 7. Communications and deterrence: 
 

<p>Develop communications plan to convey deterrence messages.</p>

 
 
 
 8. Measurement, evaluation and review: 
 

<p>Conduct ongoing reviews of materials and methods to ensure effectiveness.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p></p>



 The value of technology and training in fraud prevention. 



<p>“At IDnow, we recognize the necessity of keeping up to date with the latest developments and techniques in fraud. We run regular training sessions and courses for our clients, and are proud to have helped forensic document examiners and fraud experts from police departments around the world, including the Republic of North Macedonia and Abu Dhabi.”</p>



<blockquote><p>We have valued and trusted relationships with various international police and counter fraud organizations, including INTERPOL, and the French Scientific Police (the forensics arm of the police) with whom we exchange knowledge and share best practices. Our market-leading identity verification services enable our clients from a variety of sectors to benefit from our proprietary fraud prevention technology, and regulatory expertise.</p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Fraudsters have become smart, it’s time to get smarter.&nbsp; 



<p>A successful counter fraud strategy is dependant on close collaboration between industry and government. Alignment between innovation and regulation will ensure a watertight approach to combating fraud, spanning services across the public and private sector.</p>



<p>IDnow’s layered, strategic approach to fraud prevention and KYC combines cutting edge biometrics and liveness detection with comprehensive document and data checks to arm you with all the tools you need to fight fraud.</p>



<p>We put the power of identity back into the hands of businesses; helping to reduce friction for trusted users, preventing fraud, and detecting high-risk or anomalous behavior.</p>

			 Tokenization Standardization Has Arrived With the ERC3643 Association 
<p>The advent of blockchain technology is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative developments of this century. Its unparalleled ability to transfer infinite value instantaneously across borders has started to redefine our financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>It’s no secret to anyone who’s watched this space that tokenization and blockchain integrations into our financial system is the inevitable future, the question is how and when will this reach critical mass?</p>
<p>At Tokeny we believe that&nbsp;bringing compliance on-chain at the smart contract level will permit mass adoption, because it enables mass tokenization.</p>
<p>We made this possible with the ERC3643 token protocol. This open-source suite of smart contracts enables the issuance, management, and transfer of permissioned tokens. This allows token issuers to&nbsp;tokenize any real world asset or financial product, enforce compliance and control their tokens, on any EVM blockchain, even on public blockchains.</p>
 Open Sourcing the Code to Ensure Access 
<p>Although Tokeny was the architect behind the ERC3643 standard, we understood that retaining the ‘keys’ wouldn’t align with our broader mission of making a&nbsp;universally recognized compliant token standard,&nbsp;so we elected to make it open-source.</p>
<p>From a traditional business perspective, making proprietary solutions open-source might seem counterintuitive. However, our vision transcends short-term gains; the more entities that leverage this standard, the sooner we can revolutionize the industry.</p>
<p>This philosophy echoes one of the more profound business decisions of our time by Elon Musk of Tesla. Musk made Tesla’s EV technology patents open-source, recognizing that his real competition was not other electric vehicle producers but gasoline-powered cars. Tesla’s mission was to accelerate sustainable transport, not merely to outcompete other electric vehicle manufacturers.</p>
<p>Similarly, Tokeny’s true competition isn’t other tokenization platforms; it’s the incumbent legacy systems that govern our financial world today.</p>
 Creating an Industry-wide Association to Accelerate Adoption 
<p>A few weeks ago, we formally&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/industry-leaders-form-erc3643-association-to-propel-standardization-of-tokenization?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_nVqJRQbXk1O9GThOVD5HvofciVHANTud7uY2SNc6PvtxD8HEY7kxyWLxD7pCpFbU15O0q">launched</a>&nbsp;the ERC3643 association alongside industry leaders and incumbents including the following:</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The association is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the blockchain token standard ERC3643 and, more globally, fostering the development of best practices and a comprehensive&nbsp;toolbox for financial institutions interested in tokenizing assets on the&nbsp;blockchain in a compliant manner.</p>
<p>Together with the members, we embark on a journey that holds tremendous potential for transforming the world of finance and revolutionizing the way assets are managed and traded.</p>
<p>By establishing a set of&nbsp;concrete technical, legal and operational guidelines and specifications, we will provide financial institutions with the tools they need to navigate this emerging landscape in a responsible and efficient manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the standardization efforts, our association will serve as a&nbsp;hub of knowledge and expertise, cultivating an environment of continuous learning and development.</p>
<p>The tokenized future is here, and the ERC3643 association is working to make that a reality for all to benefit from.</p>

<p></p><p>In today’s age of social media dominance, our online identities have become integral to both our personal lives and professional endeavors. From connecting with friends and family to building brands and businesses, platforms like Twitter and Instagram have given us the power to create digital personas that resonate with others where your user handle serves as a unique identifier in the digital world. </p><p>However, recent incidents have shed light on a fundamental question: Do we truly own our user handles on these platforms? Events, such as Twitter's rebranding and the subsequent takeover of the @X handle from a longtime user, shed light on the intricate web of ownership, accountability that revolves around these usernames, and how account models across the web work today.</p><p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190891082/twitter-x-account-owner-gene-hwang-elon-musk"></a></p> Borrowing vs. Owning<a title="Direct link to Borrowing vs. Owning">​</a> <p>User handles, also known as usernames, are a string of characters that represent your digital presence on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. While users assume that the handles they create are tied to their accounts, the reality is more complex, often dictated by the terms of service set by the platform. These terms outline the rights and limitations users have over their usernames/accounts, establishing a virtual "landlord and tenant" relationship between you and the platform provider. </p><p>This relationship was exemplified when Twitter rebranded as "X," causing collateral damage as the company took repossession of user handles like @X, without notice or monetary compensation. This was echoed in cases like @Music, which was created by a user who curated their digital presence with this handle for more than 16 years. </p><p></p><p>The notice from Twitter to this account holder reads:</p><blockquote><p>The user handle associated with account @Music will be affiliated with X Corp. Accordingly, your user handle will be changed to a new user handle. </p></blockquote><p>While this is certainly alarming, it’s not illegal. Most people don’t read the fine print of the Terms of Service agreements when joining these applications, and therefore don’t realize how much control these centralized organizations have over our data and digital identity.  </p> The Problem &amp; The Solution<a title="Direct link to The Problem &amp; The Solution">​</a> <p>The way the web stands today, each time we engage with online platforms that require accounts, we borrow an identity from them and then proceed to build a reputation and possibly brand associated with this borrowed identity. The recent turmoil experienced by Twitter has thrust the very nature of the web into the spotlight for those who previously might not have contemplated its issues. This is precisely why Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers#what-is-it">DIDs</a>) bear immense significance.</p><p>At the core of Web5's paradigm lie DIDs, which serve as identities that users own and control. DIDs provide individuals with distinctive, universally resolvable identifiers that persist through time and consistently remain under their control. Unlike conventional usernames, DIDs can't be confiscated by platforms, thus empowering users to truly possess their digital identities. This transformative shift adds an identity layer to the web eradicating platform-mediated handles.</p><p>Fortunately, Twitter automatically gave the user who created @X a new (albeit way less cool) handle. However, what if the company simply closed that account instead? The user would have  lost not just their username, but potentially their entire digital existence on that platform if their profile had been wiped out.  </p><p>While Twitter's actions towards these users might not have violated any legal boundaries, is this the way we truly want the web to be? Social media has transcended its original purpose of mere social interaction; it now intertwines with our livelihoods. When signing up for a new platform many of us adopt the same usernames. These usernames serve as both personal and professional branding tools, encapsulating not just our individual identities but also the essence of our businesses.</p><p>Web5 will revolutionize identity management by restoring it to us, the users, while allowing applications to focus solely on enhancing our user experience. </p> Twitter Space with Industry Leaders<a title="Direct link to Twitter Space with Industry Leaders">​</a> <p>Industry leaders Angie Jones, Kelsey Hightower, and Daniel Buchner discussed this very topic on a recent Twitter Space. Tune in to hear their thoughts on how Decentralized Identity solves this problem.</p>

Reworked architecture and released SSX 2.0 (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/146?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#146</a>): This month, we reworked the library architecture of SSX. The previous functions of SSX have been moved into a new module named UserAuthorization that is responsible for end-user signing-related operations. A new storage module was added, which provides functionality to store and retrieve data in Kepler. Check out the <a href="https://www.sprucekit.dev/ssx?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SSX v2.x Docs</a>.  Enabled customizability: @spruceid/ssx-react no longer depends on wagmi. Instead, function hooks must be defined and used as arguments to the component.<br> ✓ onChangeAccount is replaced by watchProvider property, allowing for    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more customizability<br> ✓ web3Provider.providerLoaded property was removed<br> ✓ useSSX now returns the ssx instance and the provider<br> ✓ Now watchProvider is the new interface for listening to provider changes.  You must set up this function to be called whenever an interaction with the  user happens. An example of how to do it can be found <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/blob/main/examples/ssx-test-react/src/index.tsx?ref=blog.spruceid.com#L25">here</a>  Credential modules (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/150?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#150</a>): We’ve added Credential Modules, which allow you to fetch credentials issued on <a href="https://issuer.sprucekit.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceKit Credential Issuer</a>. Our Credential Issuer, Quest, can now be used as a faucet for credentials.  Sprouts Example Apps: Last month we released the Sprouts, SpruceKit example apps. These apps recreate popular consumer experiences with decentralized identity baked into the user experience. Check out SpruceKit open-source libraries in action with our three demo apps:  <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-the-sprouts/">  Introducing the Sprouts: SpruceKit Example Apps  We’re excited to release three new reference apps, the Sprouts, that demonstrate how you can leverage the SpruceKit open source libraries to introduce decentralized identity in the next app you build.

 What Is Identity Orchestration? 
<p>Identity Orchestration is an <a>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> approach that automates managing and securing digital identities across diverse platforms, primarily multi-cloud environments. It involves coordinating various identity-related tasks such as authentication, authorization, provisioning, de-provisioning, password management, and more across multiple systems and applications.</p>
<p>For instance, when new employees join a company, they often need access to many systems. Manually provisioning access for each system is time-consuming and prone to error. If the employee leaves, de-provisioning access is also essential to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p>By automating these processes through identity orchestration, companies can streamline their identity and access management, reduce the risk of security breaches, ensure compliance with regulations, and enhance the user experience by providing seamless access to the required resources.</p>
 Identity Management Problems Solved by Orchestration 
<p>The challenge of <a>identity management</a> across multi-cloud (or simply diverse platforms) is that such diversity introduces a host of problems that aren’t present (or aren’t as present) in centralized identity systems.</p>
<p>Accordingly, identity orchestration addresses several critical problems associated with identity management, including:</p>
 
 Scalability: As organizations grow and add more systems and applications, managing identities can become complex and time-consuming. Identity orchestration automates and streamlines this process, making it easier to scale. 
 Security: Manual management of identities can lead to errors, like forgetting to de-provision a former employee’s access, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. Automated provisioning and de-provisioning help mitigate such risks. 
 Consistency: Ensuring consistent access rights across multiple systems and applications can be challenging. Identity orchestration helps maintain this consistency by centralizing and automating the process. 
 Compliance: Many industries have strict regulations around who can access specific data types. Identity orchestration provides robust auditing capabilities, which can assist in demonstrating compliance with these regulations. 
 User Experience: Users often need to remember multiple credentials for different systems, leading to password fatigue and decreased productivity. With features like single sign-on (SSO), identity orchestration can provide a seamless user experience. 
 Efficiency: Manual identity management tasks can consume significant IT resources. By automating these tasks, identity orchestration can free IT teams to focus on other critical areas. 
 Visibility: With traditional IAM approaches, having a clear overview of who has access to what can be challenging. Identity orchestration platforms usually provide a unified dashboard that gives a comprehensive view of access rights across the organization, aiding in resource optimization and security management. 
 
 How Does Identity Orchestration Work? 
<p>Identity orchestration works through an orchestrating system that coordinates critical tasks related to IAM across various systems and applications. This orchestration is typically accomplished using a dedicated platform.</p>
<p>There are standard technologies and processes of almost any orchestration system. These include:</p>
 
 Integration: First, the identity orchestration platform is integrated with all the systems and applications for which it will manage access. This could be anything from email systems and databases to cloud platforms and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. 
 Policy Setting: Policies are established within the platform to control system access based on user role, behavior, or attributes of the system or authentication session (time, date, location, etc.). 
 Automation: Policies programmed into an orchestration system can be automated quickly, managing the priorities of that system (provisioning, onboarding, security, etc.). This reduces the manual workload for IT teams and decreases the chances of errors or inconsistencies. 
 Authentication and Authorization: As a baseline, an orchestration solution should be able to handle some of the most important functions of an identity management system–specifically, authenticating users, verifying user identities, and controlling access to system resources based on policies. 
 Audit and Compliance: Finally, the platform also keeps detailed logs of all identity and access management activities. This is crucial for audit purposes and to demonstrate compliance with regulations that mandate certain control over systems and data access. 
 
<p>The specifics of how identity orchestration works can vary depending on the specific technologies and solutions used and the unique requirements of the organization implementing it.</p>
 What Should an Organization Look for in an Orchestration Solution? 
<p>When choosing an identity orchestration solution, it’s essential to consider several key features and aspects to ensure it will meet your organization’s needs. Here are some factors to consider:</p>
 
 Integration with Existing Solutions: The solution should integrate seamlessly with your existing systems, applications, and platforms. This includes both on-premises systems and cloud-based applications. 
 Scalability: Your identity management needs will also grow as your organization grows. Choose a solution that can scale to accommodate increasing users and systems. 
 Automation: One of the main benefits of identity orchestration is automating tasks such as provisioning, de-provisioning, and password resets. Ensure the solution offers a high degree of automation to reduce manual efforts. 
 Security: Features like MFA, SSO, and risk-based access controls can help improve security. Look for a system that offers the best security measures for specific, necessary functions like authentication, authorization, or management. 
 Compliance and Auditing: The solution should provide robust auditing capabilities to track and log all identity and access activities. This is crucial for demonstrating compliance with regulations. 
 User Experience: Features like self-service password resets and single sign-on can enhance the user experience, reducing frustration and help-desk calls. 
 Vendor Support: Consider the vendor’s reputation, their track record in providing support, and the availability of resources such as documentation and training. 
 Cost: Finally, consider the cost of the solution, not only in terms of the purchase price or subscription fees but also the costs related to implementation, training, and ongoing maintenance. 
 
 The Fabric of Identity Orchestration 
<p>As identity and authentication technologies evolve, the methods through which providers and other users can orchestrate identity management. Following that, robust infrastructure and security integration into these systems becomes crucial.</p>
<p>Thus, there are a couple of related security and technical systems that touch on identity orchestration–namely, identity fabrics and zero-trust architecture:</p>
 
 Identity Fabrics: This relatively newer concept in IAM represents a holistic approach to identity services across an organization. It’s a design principle that calls for a single, consistent layer of identity services, which can be used by all parts of an organization, regardless of where they are or what underlying technology they use. Identity Orchestration and identity fabrics work together to provide seamless and unified management of identities across an organization. Identity orchestration is the operational aspect, automating and managing identity tasks, while Identity Fabrics provide the architectural framework that allows this orchestration to occur across the entire organization. 
 
 
 Zero-Trust Architecture: This is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access. This can be implemented in part through robust identity verification processes. <a>Zero-trust identity</a> ties into this by adding a layer of security. The automation provided by Identity Orchestration, combined with the architectural structure of identity fabrics, can help implement the zero trust model by ensuring every access request is thoroughly verified, no matter where it comes from or what it’s accessing. This is done by continuously validating the user’s identity and the request context to minimize the risk of a security breach.

<p>When Anonyome Labs’ CTO and co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley spoke to Anonyome Labs’ <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralized-identity-and-data-privacy/id1661635487?i=1000609765426">Privacy Files podcast</a> about the hottest topic in privacy right now, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/inside-the-massive-projected-growth-in-the-decentralized-identity-market/">decentralized identity</a>, he left the audience with 5 aha! moments.</p>



<p>If you haven’t heard, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/inside-the-massive-projected-growth-in-the-decentralized-identity-market/">decentralized identity</a> is a new fully digital, universally accepted way of identifying ourselves online (e.g. to a web site or app) and in real life (e.g. at a bar or border crossing). </p>



<p>Catch up on the decentralized identity story on our <a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity&amp;et_pb_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess&amp;et_pb_include_posts=yes">blog</a> and in our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/whitepaper-blog/">whitepapers</a>.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is the most important privacy innovation of the decade and it’s here now—and that was the first aha moment from Dr Ashley:</p>



<p></p>



 Aha 1: DI technology is ready for your business application. 



<p>On the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralized-identity-and-data-privacy/id1661635487?i=1000609765426">podcast</a>, Dr Ashley told co-hosts Rich and Sarah that hundreds of applications of the groundbreaking DI technology are already springing up around the world and across many industries, particularly travel, health, banking, licensing and certification.</p>



<p>“It’s really been the last 12 months where we’ve seen it take off. We’re at the crest of the wave,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>And it’s easy to get started, Dr Ashley said: “DI is quite simple for organizations to set up. Anonyome Labs has verifier and issuer providers, and we can run [applications] in the cloud because we’re a SaaS provider. We also provide a DI Wallet for users.</p>



<p>“Organizations just do a little application work around what [information] to ask the user for, but it’s not a big load for an organization to become an issuer or a verifier. You’ve just got to be able to control the issuer or verifier software. It’s not a big burden for the user either, they just need to get a wallet.”</p>

<p></p>



 Aha 2: Verifiable credentials will drive DI’s applications across the internet. 



<p>DI’s superpower is it allows a user to selectively disclose their personal information to an organization that is requesting proof of their identity.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley told Rich and Sarah that <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a> are making this selective disclosure of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally</a> identifiable information (PII) possible and will make DI ubiquitous across the internet within the next decade. He pointed out the rise of verifiable credentials has led to the widespread need for an <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallet</a>, a massive growth area in privacy and identity management.</p>



<p><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">Explore the Identity Wallet SDKs on Sudo Platform</a><br></p>



<p>Dr Ashley told Rich and Sarah a verifiable credential is really a digital copy of a paper or plastic identity document (e.g. license). It can’t be faked because it’s cryptographically protected. The issuer, holder and verifier can confirm who created the verifiable credential, and it can’t be changed. The verifier can also tell whether the verifiable credential has been revoked. The user holds the verifiable credential in their digital identity wallet.</p>



<p>It works like this:</p>







<p></p>



<p>“The verifier, such as a bar, knows it’s real data; the user is confident they’ve only shown the information they’re comfortable or need to show.</p>



<p>“Standards define the wallet and also what the issuer will do and what the verifier will do. The verifier should just be able to connect to the standard tech to accept the digital identity (verifiable credential),” Dr Ashley explained.</p>

 Aha 3: The technology is extremely well designed for security and privacy. 



<p>Dr Ashley, who’s spent 25-plus years in the privacy and security space, says: “There’s been a decade of work before the projects the world is looking at now. I have rarely ever seen a technology that has been so thoughtfully designed as this from a security and privacy point of view,” Dr Ashley says.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley points out that data brokers won’t want DI to take off and that includes the Googles and Metas of the world, as well as the smaller data brokers: “That industry will push back [because] DI will swing back the privacy pendulum more towards the user,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley also explained on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralized-identity-and-data-privacy/id1661635487?i=1000609765426">Privacy Files podcast</a> that Anonyome Labs, a leader in DI technology, got into the nascent space from the privacy perspective: “DI is about digital identities that the user can manage and control rather than somebody else,” he says.</p>



<p>He said the technology fits perfectly with the work we’ve done for years around <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/how-sudos-are-making-decentralized-identity-usable-for-most-people/">Sudo digital identities</a>, as seen in our exemplar app, <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">Blockchain</a> is the anchor of trust for decentralized identity, and “DI is the ultimate blockchain technology,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>DI will mean a passwordless future, connecting from a digital wallet to a system to access that system.</p>



<p>“With DI, there’s no one place you can go where all the data is sitting and can be accessed, so there are a lot of security and privacy aspects to the DI approach that you just don’t get with the centralized approach,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>“Centralized databases are the classic honeypot for a hacker. DI makes hacking a much more difficult proposition. DI is much less attractive for hackers and also for data brokers wanting to exploit your data,” Dr Ashley says.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



 Aha 4: DI presents many opportunities for making money. 



<p>Dr Ashley said there are at least three models for monetizing opportunities in DI:</p>



 
 Verifier paying the issuer model (e.g. employment agency pays a university to get proof of a job applicant’s credential.) 



 User paying the issuer model (e.g. The student pays the university to get their credential proving their degree completion.) 



 Verifier paying the user model for access to their data (e.g. a shopping site pays the user for identity verification information such as age verification). 
 



<p>Dr Ashley said projects in DI are about getting better data or getting it in a low-cost way and enterprises could use DI to move trusted data between a network of parties (e.g. banks or farms etc.). “There are a lot of cost savings from this reduced process,” he said.</p>



<p>Read: <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">Realizing the Business Value of Decentralized Identity</a></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



 Aha 5: Use cases for DI technology are virtually endless, across all industries. 



<p>Dr Ashley told <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5fd4MZWoLCKolVYpGrJWY4">Rich and Sarah</a> that the number one decentralized identity scenario is travel: “Digital passports, visas, vaccine certificates, all in a wallet as verifiable credentials the traveller can take from country to country. With decentralized identity, you’re now taking trusted information across borders,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>Some other big use cases we’re already seeing for DI, according to Dr Ashley, are digital driver licenses, event ticketing, certifications in the building or farming industry—”anywhere you need verifiable data to pass between one entity to you to another entity.”</p>



<p>“It’s a very good way of getting high integrity data,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>When podcast co-host Rich raised the question of whether DI still gives off some kind of digital exhaust, Dr Ashley agreed, but gave an example to ease concerns.</p>



<p>“Yes, but take the government example. I think the government’s place in this is as an issuer or verifier of a credential. There’s nothing wrong with a DMV issuing you a digital driver license. Government has a place in it but they don’t own the digital identity. The user owns the credential [digital identity]. Government is just a player like everyone else,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Government is just a player like everyone else.”</p>
Dr. Paul Ashley</blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>As for what a digital wallet will look and feel like? “It will be an app just like MySudo is an app,” Dr Ashley said. As such, it’ll be important to backup a digital wallet app, just like any other app.</p>



<p>And what about when decentralized identity technology will be widely available?</p>



<p>“It’s not in the public domain yet, because it’s mainly networks of systems (e.g. travel or farm or health) that are exploring it and implementing it. It hasn’t got general use yet. Groups of organizations are putting systems in place and if you’re part of that, you’ll get a wallet and get underway,” Dr Ashley said. Noting it’s “not too far away” for the public.</p>



<p>“It will take time to roll out but there’s a great lot of opportunity and benefits for users and organizations as well,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley closed out the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5fd4MZWoLCKolVYpGrJWY4">podcast episode</a> by repeating his earlier assertion: “Decentralized identity is a key technology for privacy for the next decade.”</p>

<p>Big Tech has taken control over your data privacy to help them addict you to their apps. But Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai are building the industry’s next best data tooling to solve data privacy problems while keeping your apps epic&nbsp;too.</p><p>The ‘Ocean’ of&nbsp;Data</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> is an ecosystem of open-source tools for data exchange on the blockchain. The protocol enables software applications to consume user data in a secure and privacy-preserving fashion using Web3 technology. Ocean Protocol’s smart contracts include permissioned datatokens and data NFTs that enable IP rights management in data wallets. Ocean Protocol tools are built to extract value from data by improving its algorithmic accessibility &amp; security.</p><p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> is the primary use case of Ocean Protocol’s smart contracts. Data and algorithms can be bought and sold on Ocean Market with token-gated accessibility to computation. Ocean Protocol’s data market is becoming an industry best practice architecture for sharing private data securely — MoveID consortium and GAIA-X (where Datarella is also a partner) use Ocean Market code to exchange data! Indeed, spinoffs of the Ocean Market are already being used in the wild (see<a href="https://portal.pontus-x.eu/"> Pontus-X</a> for a GDPR compliant example).</p> That’s So&nbsp;Fetch! <p><a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.ai</a> offers powerful open-source software tools that leverage AI and automation algorithms on-chain to carry out complex tasks in the Web3 digital economy. Fetch’s Autonomous Economic Agents (<a href="https://docs.fetch.ai/aea-framework-documentation/">AEAs</a>) and Microagents gather resources and execute smart contracts using their own private keys to transact business logic autonomously. AEAs delegate on-chain tasks and record their completion, providing auditable traces of transaction history. A popular use case of Fetch’s protocol is its <a href="https://botswap.fi/">stop loss agents</a> that allow traders to autonomously provision liquidity on DeFi protocols and avoid manual transactions.</p> Getting Smart Recommendations Without Forking Over Your Data&nbsp;Privacy <p>Nowadays, smart recommendations in software apps are standard practice to improve these applications’ usability and retention. For example, Amazon curates and recommends relevant products to our feeds based on our recent search history. However, to gain such smart recommendations, we sacrifice our data privacy. Such applications leverage data lakes full of our historical user data to provide these smart recommendations. Not only does this strategy compromise individuals’ data privacy, but it increases the security risk for hacking such valuable data aggregated in one place. What if there was an elegant solution to both get excellent smart recommendations in apps and protect user privacy concerns?</p><p>From this idea, the integration of Fetch.ai’s Autonomous Economic Agents with Ocean Protocol’s Compute-to-Data (C2D) workflow was&nbsp;born.</p><p>In this software release, Ocean Protocol smart contracts for Compute-to-Data interface with AEAs to exchange their data on-chain while protecting user data&nbsp;privacy!</p><p>Let’s describe an excellent use case for the Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai integration: In the realm of IoT devices, this tech integration now makes it possible for IoT devices to determine based on their location and other algorithmic conditions when and how to publish their data on-chain for sale. Data consumers on-chain can query and purchase the data that they need from these IoT outputs. Together, this approach provides the basis for autonomous adaptive machine learning without having to scrape data&nbsp;online.</p> Ocean Protocol x Fetch.ai x Datarella <p>TL;DR: By enabling Fetch Agents to post data to Ocean Marketplace Compute-to-Data recommendation engines can be driven without violating privacy.</p><p>Ocean Protocol has joined forces with Fetch.ai and <a href="https://datarella.com/">Datarella</a> over the last few months to build an <a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/details/connection/ocean_protocol/ocean_connection/0.1.5">Ocean Connection Agent</a> to take private data available to itself, store it confidentially, and then spin up a fixed-rate exchange on the Ocean Market or with C2D enabled as shown in the previous figure. You can imagine that in the near future, this might be your current location data or data about your preferences or searches performed locally within an app (the MOBIX app for example). This data never leaves the sovereign control of the user and the user doesn’t have to worry about handling or organizing or authorizing the data because the AEA does that on behalf of the user well, autonomously! The same applies to companies running AEAs on IoT devices too. You might be asking now why this is even beneficial. It’s useful because it solves the problems associated with those vast data lakes that are driving the recommendation engines behind all sorts of “smart” services.</p><p>Protecting User Privacy and Developing Business Intelligence On-Chain</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> offers data and algorithms for sale on-chain, without any centralized control. Ocean’s Compute-to-Data smart contracts enable dApps and AEAs to publish data and algorithms privately while only selling the computational output of these datasets. The computed insights of the data that are sold, rather than the data&nbsp;itself!</p><p>In the primary use case for the Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol integration, smart apps are then able to use this architecture to produce context-aware recommendations, without accessing users’ data directly. This architecture obfuscates user data to only permit the app to see data insights using C2D. Such decentralized tooling enables compliance with strict privacy regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>The world of data-sharing is changing quickly — and we’re setting the industry best standards of keeping your data private from algorithms while still gaining new context-aware smart recommendations to improve in-app user experiences. Coupling the Ocean Market with Fetch.ai AEAs means for the everyday person that it’s increasingly going to be possible that you can have your (data) cake and eat it too. You won’t have to choose between amazing functionality and privacy — you’ll be able to have&nbsp;both.</p> Developer Resources <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/fetch">Dive into the code</a> for Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol on Github — it’s open-source! Similarly, the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/">docs</a> for Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai provide valuable explanations on how to use this integration.

<p>Just imagine an academic/tech conference…</p><p>Participants dress professionally. Some may wear suits or dress shirts with trousers, while others may opt for blouses with skirts or pants, or that kind of professional attire. There is a sense of importance or urgency regarding the topics being discussed or the work they are involved in. It creates an atmosphere where individuals appear deeply invested in their contributions and the outcomes of the meeting. In some of these meetings, some participants may exhibit an overconfidence and present themselves in a sophisticated manner when they are under the spotlights of the stage, forgetting that the true value of a meeting lies in collaboration, the exchange of ideas, and the pursuit of mutual understanding rather than personal grandeur.</p> DWeb Camp <p><a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> 2023 is not one of these self-styled “important” meetings.</p><p>Imagine a stunning forest characterized by majestic redwood trees towering hundreds of meters in height, with a nearby river beautifully meandering through the landscape. Everywhere is a stage: Under the tree, across the field, alongside the river… There is no feeling of urgency, the titles of the participants are not important, and the joy of missing out is encouraged. This is the spirit of DWeb Camp.</p>DWeb Camp Participants take a moment to discuss quietly. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>.c<p>At DWeb Camp, you observe that the participants are dressed in a casual manner, wearing pajamas, shorts, or any attire of their choice during their talks. Some even have their children with them, clinging to their parents during their presentations. However, amidst this diverse crowd, everyone remains engaged in exploring the frontiers of science, technology, and collective human intelligence, with the shared goal of empowering individuals and communities. It shows you that no matter what clothes you wear, no matter the color of your skin, no matter what your anything else is, you are welcomed.</p><p>The only thing needed is to treat others with kindness and respect, and to have a passion about the decentralized web, even if you have no technical knowledge. DWeb Camp serves as a platform for researchers, developers, activists, and all people who wish to come together and discuss the challenges, concerns, and opportunities related to decentralization, privacy, security, and open protocols on the web. There is a true sense of community and it encourages the exchange of perspectives among participants from diverse backgrounds.</p> My Perspective on Holochain <p>I was amazed by Holochain from the very first day I encountered it in the spring of 2018. This feeling grew stronger over time, and at times, I wondered if my enthusiasm for Holochain might be an exaggeration due to my deep involvement. As a non-technical person, I was concerned that I might have missed something important about it. That is why I wanted to see how others, especially technical experts and policy makers, perceived Holochain when they were learning about its “whys, hows, and whats” at the camp.</p><p>It proved to be a bit challenging for them to grasp Holochain because it has a completely different paradigm compared to blockchain. While blockchain is data-centric, Holochain is agent-centric. This means that the users, which include ourselves and our devices, play a central role in a Holochain network. This perspective shift is difficult because it requires adapting to a more distributed and truly peer-to-peer way of managing data and interactions between autonomous agents. Additionally, understanding other aspects of Holo and Holochain such as the mechanism behind HoloFuel, a mutual-credit system backed by hosting power which is a significantly different approach from fiat or Ethereum for example, added another layer of complexity. However, as they started to understand it, I clearly observed the excitement in their eyes.</p><p>They became excited because they could envision how this tool/framework enables us to address and solve problems effectively. Therefore, this excitement among technical persons and policy makers was not merely a result of theoretical fascination, but rather a recognition of the practical possibilities and potential solutions that Holochain brings to the table. It sparked a genuine excitement about the transformative impact it could have on our digital sphere and the abilities it offers to individuals and communities in shaping their own destinies.</p>Arthur Brock, Eric Harris-Braun, and other DWeb participants in a pre-camp warm up exercise. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>. One Last Thing About Holochain... <p>I closely observed the Holochain team members and the Holochain community during the camp. The most notable aspect that stood out to me was their genuine lack of greed. Despite creating or being involved in an exceptional and potentially disruptive technology framework, the team members and the community exhibited true modesty. This humility was not artificial or some sort of facade; it is an inherent part of their nature, and it likely contributed to their ability to develop Holochain. Inspired by nature, they clearly combine their intelligence with the virtue of humility. They are not driven by a desire to save the world; instead, they passionately work towards building a meaningful tool that can assist people in their daily lives. And quite possibly, their dedicated efforts will ultimately lead to world-changing improvements.</p><p>Allow me to conclude with a profound quote from Arthur Brock that encapsulates the essence of Holochain concisely:</p><p>“Holochain is not built to attack national currencies, blockchain currencies, or surveillance corporations. Instead, we are simply focused on building viable, functional alternatives.”</p>DWeb Camp participants roast marshmallows over the nightly fire.

Bazıları takım elbise veya pantolon-gömlek giyerken, diğerleri şık birer bluze ek olarak etek-pantolon veya benzerî profesyonel kıyafetleri tercih eder. Tartışılan konulara veya dâhil oldukları faaliyetlere ilişkin yüksek bir önem ve aciliyet duygusu hissedilir. Bu durum, bireylerin kendi katkılarına ve toplantıdan elde edecekleri şeylere derinden yatırım yapmış oldukları bir atmosfer oluşturur. Bu toplantıların bazılarında, bazı katılımcılar aşırı özgüven sergiler ve bu kişiler sahnede spot ışıkları altındayken kendilerini sofistike bir şekilde sunar. Bir toplantının gerçek değerinin kişinin kendisini öne çıkarmaya çalışmasından ziyade işbirliği yapmakta, fikir alışverişinde bulunmakta ve karşılıklı ortak anlayışa ulaşma çabasında yattığını unutabilirler.</p> DWeb Kampı <p><a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Kamp</a>ı 2023 (Decentralized Web Camp / Merkeziyetsiz İnternet Kampı) kerameti kendinden menkul bir şekilde "mühimlik" iddiasında olan o tür toplantılardan biri değil.</p><p>Yüzlerce metre yüksekliğinde görkemli sekoya ağaçlarıyla kaplı, etkileyici bir orman hayal edin; hemen yakınındaki nehir, manzara boyunca usul usul kıvrılıyor. Her yer, katılımcılar için birer sahne hüviyetinde: Ağaçların altı, çim alan, nehrin kenarı... Aciliyet hissi yok, katılımcıların unvanları önemli değil ve bir şeyleri kaçırabilmenin keyfini yaşamak teşvik ediliyor. DWeb Kampı'nın ruhu işte tam da bu.</p>DWeb Kampı katılımcıları sakince görüş alışverişinde bulunmak için kendilerine zaman ayırıyor. Fotoğraf, <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=27165&amp;Akey=9A789DKQ&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>'nın izniyle.<p>DWeb Kampı'nda katılımcıların yaptıkları konuşmalarda bile pijama ve şort gibi rahat kıyafetler giyebildiklerini, istedikleri herhangi bir kıyafeti seçebildiklerini gözlemliyorsunuz. Hatta bazılarının çocukları da yanlarında, sunumları sırasında sahneye gidip ebeveynlerine sarılıyorlar. Ancak, bu çeşitli kalabalığın arasında her bir fert, bireyleri ve toplulukları güçlendirmeye yönelik ortak bir hedef doğrultusunda bilimin, teknolojinin ve kolektif insan zekâsının sınırlarını keşfetmekle meşgul. Hangi kıyafeti giyerseniz giyin, teninizin rengi ne olursa olsun, başka herhangi bir özelliğiniz ne olursa olsun, hoş karşılanıyorsunuz.</p><p>Gerekli olan tek şey, başkalarına nezaketli ve saygılı davranmak ve teknik/yazılım bilginiz olmasa bile merkeziyetsiz web’e yönelik bir tutkuya sahip olmak. DWeb Kampı, bilimsel araştırmacılar, yazılım geliştiriciler, aktivistler için ve hatta bir araya gelerek merkeziyetsizleşme, gizlilik, güvenlik ve web üzerindeki açık protokollerle ilgili zorlukları, endişeleri ve fırsatları tartışmak isteyen herkes için bir platform görevi görüyor. Gerçek bir topluluk duygusu var ve çok çeşitli alanlardan bilgi birikimine sahip katılımcılar arasında bakış açılarının değiş tokuşu teşvik ediliyor.</p> Holochain Hakkındaki Kişisel Bakış Açım <p>Holochain ile 2018 baharında karşılaştığım ilk günden itibaren ona hayran kaldım. Bu his zamanla daha da güçlendi ve zaman zaman, Holochain'e duyduğum coşkunun derin ilgimden kaynaklanan bir abartı olup olmadığını hep merak ettim. Teknik/Yazılım bilgisi olmayan biri olarak, bu konuda önemli bir ayrıntıyı gözden kaçırmış olabileceğimden endişe ettim. Bu nedenle kampta Holochain'in "nedenlerini, nasıllarını ve ne olduğunu" öğrenirken başkalarının, özellikle de teknik uzmanların ve politika yapıcıların Holochain'i nasıl algıladıklarını görmek istedim.</p><p>Holochain'i kavramak onlar için biraz zor oldu çünkü Holochain blokzinciri teknolojisine kıyasla tamamen farklı bir paradigmaya sahip. Blokzinciri veri merkezliyken, Holochain katılımcı (agent) merkezlidir. Bu, bir Holochain ağında bizlerden ve bizim cihazlarımızdan oluşan kullanıcıların merkezî bir rol oynadığı anlamına gelir. Veri merkezli bakış açısından bu bakış açısına geçmek zordur çünkü kendi iradeleriyle hareket eden katılımcılar arasındaki veri ve etkileşimleri yönetmenin daha dağıtık ve gerçek anlamda eşler arasında (P2P) işleyen bir yöntemine uyum sağlamayı gerektirir. Ayrıca, Holo ve Holochain'in, örneğin fiat paralardan ve Ethereum'dan önemli ölçüde farklı bir yaklaşıma sahip olması, barındırma gücüyle desteklenen bir karşılıklı kredi (mutual-credit) sistemi olan HoloFuel'in arkasındaki mekanizma gibi diğer yönlerini anlamak, başka bir karmaşıklık katmanı ekler. Ancak günün sonunda, anlamaya başladıklarında gözlerinde beliren heyecanı net bir şekilde gözlemledim.</p><p>Heyecan duydular çünkü bu aracın/teknolojinin sorunlarımızı etkili bir şekilde ele almamızı ve çözmemizi nasıl sağlayabildiğini hayal edebiliyorlardı. Dolayısıyla, teknik/yazılım arka planı olan kişilerdeki ve politika yapıcı insanlardaki bu heyecan sadece teorik bir hayranlığın sonucu değildi, daha ziyade Holochain'in bize sunduğu pratik fayda ihtimallerinin ve potansiyel çözümlerin farkına varmalarından kaynaklanıyordu. Holochain’in dijital hayatımızda yaratabileceği dönüştürücü etki ve kendi kaderlerini şekillendirmede bireylere ve topluluklara sunduğu imkânlar konusunda hakikî bir heyecan oluşmuştu.</p>Arthur Brock, Eric Harris-Braun ve diğer DWeb katılımcıları kamp öncesi ısınma egzersizinde. Fotoğraf, <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=27165&amp;Akey=9A789DKQ&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>'nın izniyle. Holochain Hakkında Son Bir Şey Daha... <p>Kamp sırasında Holochain ekip üyelerini ve Holochain topluluğunu yakından gözlemledim. Gözüme çarpan en önemli husus, açgözlülükten gerçek anlamda yoksun olmalarıydı. Olağanüstü ve potansiyel olarak yıkıcı bir teknolojiyi oluşturmalarına ya da bu teknolojinin oluşmasına katkıda bulunmalarına rağmen, ekip üyeleri ve topluluk gerçek bir alçakgönüllülük sergiledi. Bu alçakgönüllülük yapay değildi ve bir sahtelik içermiyordu; kendi doğalarının olağan bir parçasıydı ve muhtemelen Holochain'i geliştirmelerinde de büyük katkısı vardı. Doğadan aldıkları ilham doğrultusunda, zekâlarını alçakgönüllülük erdemiyle harmanlamış görünüyorlardı. Gördüğüm kadarıyla, dünyayı kurtarma arzusuyla hareket etmiyorlar; bunun yerine, insanlara günlük yaşamlarında yardımcı olabilecek anlamlı bir araç oluşturmak için tutkuyla çalışıyorlar. Ve büyük olasılıkla, bu özverili çabaları nihayetinde dünyayı değiştirecek gelişmelere yol açacak.</p><p>Arthur Brock'un, Holochain'in ruhunu kısaca anlatan özlü bir ifadesiyle yazıyı bitirmeme izin verin:</p><p>"Holochain ne ulusal para birimlerine, ne blokzinciri para birimlerine ne de bizleri gözetleyip duran büyük şirketlere saldırmak için inşa edildi. Bunun yerine odaklandığımız şey sadece şu; kendi ayakları üzerinde durabilen, işlevsel alternatifler oluşturmak."</p>DWeb Kampı katılımcıları gece yakılan ateşin üzerinde marshmallow kızartıyor.

<p>Organizations globally face unprecedented challenges in safeguarding their sensitive data, critical assets, and reputation from cyber threats. Legacy authentication methods are not sufficient to thwart sophisticated attacks and evolving risks. This is where adaptive authentication, also referred to as risk-based authentication, shines; offering businesses a proactive and dynamic approach to security.&nbsp;</p> 
 Benefits of Risk-Based, Adaptive Authentication  
<p>Why is <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a> an essential strategy that businesses should adopt as part of a comprehensive security strategy?</p> 
 Adaptive Protection  
<p>“Snapshot” authentication methods, which authenticate at a single point in time, fail to address the dynamic threat landscape. Risk-based authentication utilizes advanced risk analytics and real-time threat intelligence to dynamically adjust security measures based on contextual information and user behavior. This adaptability provides a crucial layer of protection against ever-changing threats.</p> 
 Frictionless User Experience That Is Also Secure  
<p>Customer satisfaction (CSAT) is a critical aspect of any business. Legacy authentication methods often create friction that impacts user satisfaction. Risk-based authentication solves this by tailoring the level of authentication based on individual risk profiles. This personalized approach strikes a balance between security and convenience, fostering a positive user experience while ensuring strong protection against threats.</p> 
 Stop Fraud and Unauthorized Access  
<p>Legacy authentication cannot detect suspicious logins, thereby leaving organizations vulnerable to fraud. Risk-based authentication addresses this challenge by analyzing various risk signals, such as geolocation, device information, and user behavior, to identify anomalies and potential threats. By continuously monitoring these risk factors, RBA can detect and mitigate identity based fraud in real-time.</p> 
 Aligning With Regulatory Requirements  
<p>Compliance regulations and <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-mitre-attack-framework">security frameworks</a> mandate businesses to implement robust security measures to safeguard customer information and sensitive data. Risk-based authentication supports these efforts by providing a dynamic and adaptive security framework. By continuously assessing risk and responding to threats in real-time, businesses can proactively meet <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/intro-to-psd2-sca-requirements">regulatory requirements</a> with confidence.</p>

 A rapidly changing digital landscape 



<p>While speed and convenience are crucial in today’s financial innovations, they have to be paired with security. As financial apps and services become more digital, so do the fraudsters who are hard at work trying to pose as legitimate consumers. The spike in identity fraud has become an expensive problem, costing consumers, merchants and financial institutions billions of dollars. In 2021, nearly 42 million Americans fell victim to identity fraud. In that one year, fraudsters made off with some <a href="https://javelinstrategy.com/2022-Identity-fraud-scams-report">$52 billion</a> through identity scams. &nbsp;</p>







<p>As the exponential growth of digital banking and services has moved more transactions online, fraudsters’ methods have evolved to take advantage. A recent report published by Aite Novarica, Key Trends Driving Fraud Transformation in 2021 and Beyond, showed that 64% of financial institutions were experiencing higher rates of account takeover (ATO) fraud since the onset of the COVID pandemic. According to a 2021 survey of 110 fraud and loss prevention decision makers at fintech firms, 46% of fintechs report that ATO is their most prevalent problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraud risk can increase when consumers are opening accounts and documenting identities digitally. According to research from <a href="https://aite-novarica.com/report/application-fraud-how-do-you-solve-problem-identity">Aite-Novarica</a>, almost a quarter of checking account applications filed online in the first three quarters of 2022 were fraudulent, as were nearly one in five online credit card applications. &nbsp;</p>



 Open banking and identity networks work in unison to cut down on fraud&nbsp; 



<p>In response, financial service innovators are loading up on new tools capable of spotting and preventing fraud in real time, like the integration of identity and open banking solutions. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/">Mastercard Open Banking</a> allows consumers to safely share their financial data to verify account ownership and facilitate transactions, and now we have integrated open banking with our identity network to make sure participants in transactions are who they say they are. &nbsp;</p>







<p>Mastercard can deliver instant identity verification, spotting compromised identities that manual verification may miss. Mastercard’s Identity and Open Banking networks deliver deep insights into the customer’s identity by analyzing relationships between and among the individual pieces of account owner data.

  <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m delighted to announce the general availability of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/protected-actions-overview">Conditional Access for Protected Actions</a>! This powerful feature empowers organizations to safeguard critical administrative operations with Conditional Access policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protected actions refer to high-stakes operations that carry significant risk, such as altering conditional access policies, adding credentials to an application, or changing federation trust settings. These actions, if executed by a malicious actor, can severely compromise your organization's security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've asked Swetha Rai, a Senior Product Manager on the Identity team, to tell you more. Let us know what you think!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My name is Swetha, and I’m a product manager on the Identity team focused on Conditional Access (CA). Today, I’m excited to share more about the Conditional Access for protected actions feature that is now generally available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Conditional Access for protected actions, organizations can now add an extra layer of protection to these sensitive operations by defining granular policies that specify the conditions under which users can perform protected actions. For example, organizations can require administrators to complete phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), use a compliant device, or be in a trusted location before modifying a conditional access policy. This way, even if an attacker gains access to an admin account, they won't be able to perform high-risk actions without meeting the additional security criteria. Here are some examples of policies for protected actions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 ​Admins require a privileged access workstation and a FIDO2 key to delete Conditional Access policies. 
 Admins need phishing-resistant MFA to define or modify custom rules that define network locations.<br> 
 
<p>Figure 1 Protected Actions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’re continuing to add support for more protected actions based on customer feedback. Today, you can protect the following areas:\</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Conditional Access policy management 
 Custom rules that define network locations 
 Protected action management&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protected Actions on the roadmap:</p>

<p>Distributed systems are networks comprised of nodes that interact directly with each other - no central server required. These nodes can store and edit files offline and in geographically diverse locations, and each node accessing the file has a copy. When it's time to bring the changes together and synchronize the file copies, there needs to be a mechanism in place that handles this efficiently and accurately. Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are an excellent solution. </p> Understanding CRDTs  <p>CRDTs were first introduced in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06358.pdf">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</a> by Nuno Preguiça, Carlos Baquero, and Marc Shapiro. The authors define a CRDT as an abstract data type that can modify any replica without coordinating with another replica. When two replicas have received the same set of updates, they reach the same state deterministically by adopting mathematically sound rules to guarantee state convergence. </p><p>There are two types of CRDTs: operation-based and state-based. Operation-based CRDTs, or commutative replicated data types (CmRDTs), change state by transmitting only the update operation. State-based CRDTs, or convergent replicated data types (CvRDTs), send their full local state to the other replicas, and a function merges the state. Operation-based CRDTs are not necessarily idempotent, but state-based CRDTs are.</p><p>CRDTs ensure eventual consistency without centralized coordination by linking back to previous versions of the file. As state changes occur, more branches are created and merged in the data structure. </p><p>But what if two valid writes on the same item must be consolidated? How do we determine which is the "correct one"? This depends on how each application developer chooses to handle merges. Some may employ LWW (Last Writer Wins) and use timestamps to determine which user was the last to submit changes and use that user's edits. Others may use a vector clock to look at causal relationships between the edits and algorithmically choose the accepted edit.</p> Real-World Applications  <p>There are many exciting use cases for CRDTs. Collaborative text editing and collaborative design tools use CRDTs to handle merge conflicts and work offline without tieing themselves to the server-client model, which can increase latency and costs. Fission built <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">Webnative File System</a> (WNFS) as a local-first file system for decentralized apps and uses CRDTs to enable <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-wnfs/">concurrent writes</a> with version control.</p><p>Another example is distributed databases. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB">RhizomeDB</a> is a local-first edge database for querying decentralized data, and it uses CRDTs as its framework. The CRDTs can make the database idempotent, depending on what the user needs to do. For example, if a user updates their address, the system will register that change. If an admin also attempts to update the user's address, no change will occur, and a duplicate entry won't be created. However, if the user wants to submit a form or ticket, ideally, a new one will be created each time because it may be for different reasons. CRDTs enable both options without a central server.</p> Benefits and Limitations  <p>There are several advantages of CRDTs over traditional synchronization methods. As we've already touched on, CRDTs don't require centralized control and can work offline and asynchronously. This helps improve scalability.</p><p>CRDTs are designed to be fault-tolerant. They can continue to function correctly even when nodes are temporarily disconnected from each other, and they can automatically converge to a consistent state once the network is restored.</p><p>CRDTs also provide eventual consistency, ensuring that all replicas will eventually converge to the same state. This allows for flexibility and responsiveness while maintaining data integrity.</p><p>But it's important to note that CRDTs can also have some limitations. CRDTs may require additional metadata or information to track the causality of updates and resolve conflicts. This can lead to increased storage overhead compared to traditional synchronization methods, especially for large datasets. </p><p>There is also a steeper learning curve for developers using more traditional synchronization methods. That, combined with the expectation of implementing strong encryption, can be a big project to undertake.</p> <p>CRDTs are a game-changer for distributed systems and local-first applications and databases. </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about CRDTs, we encourage you to check out the following papers:</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06358.pdf">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</a></p><p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/bft-crdt-papoc22.pdf">Making CRDTs Byzantine Fault Tolerant</a></p><p><a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p856-power.pdf">Keep Calm and CRDT On</a></p><p></p>

<p>e-government (e-gov) solutions are at the forefront of digital transformation, revolutionizing the way governments interact with their citizens. Why do governments need e-gov service delivery solutions, and how do credential issuance and verification systems enhance e-government effectiveness?</p>
<p>Why governments need e-gov service delivery solutions</p>
<p>Governments strive to provide citizens with convenient and accessible services, but not all citizens have equal access, particularly those residing in remote areas or facing socioeconomic challenges. e-gov service delivery solutions bridge this gap, ensuring that all citizens, regardless of location or circumstances, can access government services digitally and/or physically.</p>
<p>How you enable citizens to access government services securely and seamlessly, whether they’re crossing borders, applying for benefits, renewing their driver’s license, or paying taxes, impacts their engagement and trust in government. These solutions enable governments to provide real-time updates and share information, while maintaining the integrity of citizen data and protecting privacy.</p>
<p>A citizen-centric approach focuses on enhancing the overall user experience to boost citizen satisfaction, promoting transparency, and strengthening public trust.</p>
<p>Moving to e-government solutions presents specific challenges: How can you verify citizen identity in a digital interaction? How can governments ensure that the right citizens are getting the right services, and prevent fraud? Governments need to ensure they can issue digital and physical credentials, positively verify identities online and in a service center, and authenticate citizen access to services. Credential issuance, credential verification, digital signing, and identity management systems accelerate the potential of eGov service delivery solutions.</p>
<p>How credential issuance and verification help governments achieve their e-gov goals</p>
<p>Credential issuance and verification systems serve as accelerators in maximizing the potential of e-gov solutions. These systems enable governments to issue and verify digital credentials, such as identification documents, licenses, permits, and certifications by eliminating the need for manual verification each step of the way. This expedites service delivery, reduces the administrative burden, and safeguards against fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>These systems also facilitate interoperability and portability of credentials across sectors and jurisdictions. Governments can collaborate with educational institutions, private sector entities, and other government agencies to establish a trusted network for exchanging and verifying credentials. This interoperability enables smooth processes such as licensing, educational certifications, immigration, and cross-border services.</p>
<p>Governments need to provide citizens with convenient and accessible services. E-government solutions enable citizens to submit applications, make payments, and track progress from anywhere at any time. This citizen-centric approach enhances the overall user experience and boosts citizen satisfaction with government services.</p>
<p>Best-in-class e-government solution services should encompass:</p>
 
<p>a. CITIZEN ENROLLMENT AND ONBOARDING</p>
<p>Improve government-to-citizen (G2C) interactions with easy-to-adopt, convenient, and secure digital channels including a web portal and mobile app. Provide strong, vetted identity and document verification.</p>
<p>b. CITIZEN CREDENTIAL ISSUANCE</p>
<p>Issue standard-compliant citizen identities with support for multiple form factors – digital and physical. Realize one unified organizational workflow, one citizen record, and one citizen journey.</p>
<p>c. E-GOV SERVICE DELIVERY</p>
<p>Deliver a secure seamless omnichannel citizen experience. Collect digital signatures from anyone, anywhere and expedite certification processes while increasing overall productivity. Maintain service delivery integrity and mitigate fraud risk with knowledge, possession, and/or biometric factors.</p>
 
<p>Entrust’s new survey <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/infographics/secure-citizen-interactions-infographic.pdf">infographic</a> reveals citizens are demanding more digital G2C interactions. E-government secures citizen identities, expedites verification processes, and fosters trust and security. Governments embracing e-gov service delivery solutions along with robust credential issuance and verification systems will revolutionize G2C interactions, making them more efficient, inclusive, and responsive to citizen needs.</p>

<p>PayPal, the leading online payment platform, has taken a significant step in the digital currency space by announcing the launch of its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). This U.S. dollar-denominated digital currency is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. It’s a move that not only aligns with PayPal’s ongoing efforts to embrace cryptocurrencies but also has the potential to reshape the financial landscape.</p>



 Bridging the Gap Between Fiat and Digital Currencies 



<p>PYUSD aims to seamlessly connect fiat and digital currencies, offering a 1:1 redemption for U.S. dollars. It’s designed to reduce friction for in-experience payments, facilitate fast transfers, and enable direct flows to developers and creators. By making digital currencies more practical for everyday use, PayPal is positioning itself as a pioneer in the integration of traditional finance and digital assets.</p>

<p>Regulatory Considerations and Transparency</p>



<p>PayPal’s approach to PYUSD includes a commitment to transparency, with monthly Reserve Reports and third-party attestations of the reserve assets. This level of openness may provide a sense of trust and stability, but it also highlights the complex and evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Navigating these challenges will be a key aspect of PYUSD’s success.</p>



<p>Competition and Impact on Traditional Banking</p>



<p>The introduction of PYUSD adds to the competition among well-established stablecoins like USDC and Tether (USDT). It also positions PayPal as an alternative to traditional banking services, particularly in areas like international money transfers.</p>



<p>A Step Towards Further Innovation</p>



<p>The launch of PYUSD is the continuation of expansion for of PayPal in the cryptocurrency space. It opens doors to new products, services, or partnerships that continue to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>PayPal’s launch of PYUSD represents a significant milestone in the digital currency industry. It reflects a commitment to innovation, ease of use, and security. Its potential to reshape how we think about and use money in the digital age makes it a development worth watching closely.</p>

Chakravorti lays out three possible reasons: 1) Data is intangible, and because we're not physically handing it over, it doesn't feel as meaningful to us 2) Users have little leverage to negotiate more data agency because they feel trapped in many services 3) Managing one's own data is complex.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/why-companies-make-it-so-hard-for-users-to-control-their-data">Why It’s So Hard for Users to Control Their Data</a> 2020-01-30 Bhaskar Chakravorti HBR <blockquote><p>What we’re missing is a system that defines and grants users “digital agency” – the ability to own the rights to their personal data, manage access to this data and, potentially, be compensated fairly for such access.

				  Logging into a computer with a password has been around almost as long as there have been computers, which means bad actors have had lots of time to figure out ways around them. It’s time for something new.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Passwords are one of the biggest headaches for IT teams: employees often forget them, even if remembered, they have to be changed frequently, and if they are faked or stolen, entire systems can be compromised. The password is prey to one of the weakest points in any security posture, which is human error.</p>
<p><a href="https://us.norton.com">Norton,</a> a popular security provider, recently released <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/privacy/password-statistics">139 password statistics for 2023</a> and, if you have time, I recommend reading that article. Here are just a few that got our team’s attention:</p>
<p>6 in 10 individuals in the U.S. report that their organization changes its password security practices <a href="https://www.yubico.com/resource/2020-state-of-password-and-authentication-security-behaviors-report/">after experiencing a cyberattack.</a> (It’s already too late…)</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://lp-cdn.lastpass.com/lporcamedia/document-library/lastpass/pdf/en/LastPass-Enterprise-The-Password-Expose-Ebook-v2.pdf">three-fourths of employees</a> report regular usage problems related to passwords. (Not a great use of time for the employees or IT team…)</p>
<p>On average, a 250-person company has nearly <a href="https://lp-cdn.lastpass.com/lporcamedia/document-library/lastpass/pdf/en/LastPass-Enterprise-The-Password-Expose-Ebook-v2.pdf">48,000 passwords</a> in use within the organization. (What are the odds that those are all unique?)</p>
<p>We’ve known for years that passwords are insecure, which is why there has been a surge in additional security layers such as two-factor authentication and password managers. But these extra systems lead to more hoops to jump through for employees and employers alike and aren’t even secure themselves — with hackers finding <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-are-finding-ways-around-multi-factor-authentication-heres-what-to-watch-for/">new ways to dodge around multifactor authentication,</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/15/norton-lifelock-password-manager-data/">Norton,</a> <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/">LastPass,</a> and <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/passwordstate-warns-of-ongoing-phishing.html">Password State</a> all confirming breaches within the last two years.</p>
<p>The issue is that we are working from the same base technology. Think of your organization as a ship. Every new security threat is a new hole in your hull, and you’ve been patching these holes constantly as they come up. The holes you know about cost you money and cause headaches, but the ones you don’t know about could sink you. At what point is it time for a new hull?</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials offer a completely new option to keep your organization safe and make your IT team’s lives easier. A verifiable credential uses cryptography to prove its source and digital signatures to prove it hasn’t been tampered with. In short, if you issue your employees verifiable credentials as proof of their employment, they can log into your systems without having to use passwords (See our <a href="https://indicio.tech/white-papers/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">“Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Identity”</a> for an in-depth introduction to how the technology works).</p>
<p>Other benefits include simplifying enrollment in external payments and benefits providers and easily being able to issue and revoke credentials: No more having to track down everything an employee had access to and changing passwords or manually removing access when they leave.</p>
<p>Implementing open-source verifiable credential technology into your existing IAM systems is relatively easy to do with pre-built solutions such as <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-works/">Proven Works</a> offering a fast way to get started. These systems do not require ripping and replacing existing infrastructure investments, and can help you orchestrate access to your entire suite of SaaS applications.</p>
<p>To see first hand what verifiable credentials could look like at your organization we recommend this short demonstration of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-BzikdwNSI">Proven Works,</a> or you can ask any specific questions you may have to our team <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">here.</a></p>

<p>We are excited to announce the winners of the first-ever invite-only data challenge hosted by Ocean Protocol! We received great feedback when tasked our data science community with the original <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/awarding-winners-of-the-ocean-token-sentiment-analysis-challenge-4011c9354335">sentiment analysis</a> of the OCEAN token challenge, and now are able to share results from the second leg of this frontier.</p><p>To extend the initial excitement, we invited the top 6 submissions to return for an invite-only data challenge to delve deeper into the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN token. This blog will detail findings from the 6-person, invite-only data challenge.</p><p>The goals of this challenge were to dive into data to understand the correlation and causation of the price movement of a particular token based on social media sentiment, engagement, and investor behavior.</p><p>The winners are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>First Place — Mohammad Jamal&nbsp;($2500)</p>  Mohammed pulled statistics from major social media platforms and ran them through correlation calculations and tables to find the best-performing posts, profiles, and users that contribute to media engagement regarding the protocol. One suggestion that stood out through Mohammed’s report was stated that in order to achieve a minimum 10 percent impact on the OCEAN price through social media content, creators should focus on generating content that attracts a larger number of comments.  For the transaction side, Mohammed took 100,000 transactions from 25,000 different token holders and conducted analysis on transaction times, volume, unique wallets, and relation to the length of the given trend at that moment (bearish or bullish). By this, Mohammed was able to conclude there is a lag in the market reaction to users' sentiments and proceeded to build a machine-learning model that reflected the outcomes of each of the mentioned parameters.  <p>Second Place — Matin Nahvi&nbsp;($1500)</p>  Matin broke down public data from Twitter, Github, On chain activity, and Medium blog posts to gather data to be used for this second part analysis. Their data was neatly bundled into daily aggregates, then compared against the daily OCEAN token price shifts. Their choice of navigation tool was The Bayesian Rule List — a model with rule-based predictions for a clear understanding of our path. Matin split the journey, dedicating the initial 80% to training (2019–12–30 to 2022–03–28) and the final 20% to evaluation (2022–03–30 to 2022–10–21).  Matin found more power leveraging Google Trends results to find a correlation between the OCEAN token price and Google trends. This was something that hadn’t been considered in the specifics of this challenge, that we found to be very valuable.  <p>Third Place — Luca Ordronneau ($1000)</p>  Luca took a fundamental approach to sourcing the data by breaking it down into key factors: volume, sentiment, and user influence. The machine learning model made in Luca’s report took these key factors and features into account and ran them through a <a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/tabular-learning-gradient-boosting-vs-deep-learning-critical-review-4871c99ee9a2">Tabular Gradient Boosting Model</a> (XGBoost). This deployed hyperparameters tuning and cross-validation to ensure an effective and generalizable model. Through data regression, analysis, and machine learning execution, Luca was able to formulate an Impact Sentiment Score, touching on recommendations for investment behavior, market trend forecasting, risk evaluation, and strategic planning.  <p>We were very pleased to see how invitees identified relevant factors, sourced the appropriate data, conducted a thorough analysis, and presented their findings in a comprehensive report. Their exceptional skills and expertise were tested and compensated for in this exclusive data challenge.</p> Using Data for&nbsp;Insights <p>In this competition, the task was to analyze the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN token. By exploring additional factors and leveraging machine learning techniques, uncovered valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>A tool to quantify and predict volatility in capital markets based on social media sentiment is a long-term outcome of this initiative. Starting with the OCEAN token, for example, this forefront of sentiment analysis is set to move to a broader spectrum of crypto assets, tokens, and commodities.</p><p>Both live and expired Ocean Data Challenges can be found here: <a href="https://desights.ai/o/0x8264CE39F7532871868053198fCDC2E2C81d074a">https://desights.ai/o/0x8264CE39F7532871868053198fCDC2E2C81d074a</a></p> What was the&nbsp;task? <p>Participants invited to the second leg of the OCEAN token sentiment challenge competed for a $5000 prize pool, and were tasked with the following:</p>  Identifying three key factors that could potentially influence the price of the OCEAN token, considering social media engagement.  Provide a detailed description of the data sources you would consider for each identified factor. Be specific about the datasets, APIs, or platforms you would utilize to obtain the necessary data for your analysis.  Design a methodology to measure and analyze the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN token. Explain how you would collect and preprocess data to conduct sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter or any other relevant social media platform.  In addition to social media sentiment, outline their approach for exploring the impact of the external factors you identified in question 1. Describe necessary data transformations, calculations, or statistical techniques you would employ to analyze the relationships between these factors and the OCEAN token&nbsp;price.  Develop a machine learning model that can provide insights into the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN&nbsp;token.  Describe the ML model you chose and explain why it suited this task. Outline the steps involved in training, evaluating, and interpreting the model’s predictions. Include details such as the choice of algorithms, feature engineering techniques, model training methodology, and any considerations for handling potential challenges, such as data imbalance or overfitting. Explain how the ML model contributed to your analysis and supported your findings in the&nbsp;report.  <p>This was the first token sentiment analysis and invitation-only challenge hosted by Ocean Protocol. Future data-driven social media data challenges can be expected for other prominent Crypto and DeFi Protocols.</p><p>Do you think your project could benefit from social media sentiment analysis?

							<p>Introduction:</p><p>A webinar hosted by Coinfirm provided valuable insights into the European regulations in the cryptocurrency industry. The panelists focused on the Market in Crypto Assets Regulation (MICA), the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR), and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These regulations aim to bring transparency and accountability to the crypto market while protecting investors and personal data. In this article, we will provide a summary of the key points discussed in the webinar and shed light on how these regulations will impact the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>MICA – Protecting Investors and Ensuring Trustworthiness:</p><p>The webinar began by discussing the scope of the MICA regulation, which primarily aims to protect crypto asset investors and ensure the trustworthiness of the crypto assets market framework. MICA lays down specific rules for offers, persons seeking admissions to trading, as well as issuers of crypto assets. These rules apply to both natural and legal persons, including certain undertakings providing crypto asset services. However, fully decentralized services and certain exemptions are considered out of scope for MICA.</p><p>Key Provisions of MICA:</p><p>To achieve its goals, MICA requires issuers of reference tokens to have a registered office in the Union. It also mandates the creation and publication of white papers by issuers, containing mandatory disclosures about the issuer project details, rights, obligations, and underlying technology. Additionally, marketing communications related to these assets should align with the information provided in the white paper to ensure fairness and clarity.</p><p>TFR – Enhancing Transparency and Combating Money Laundering:</p><p>The panelists also delved into the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR), which aims to prevent money laundering in the crypto industry. The TFR extends obligations to virtual asset service providers, requiring them to provide information on the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers to facilitate traceability and comply with anti-money laundering measures. This regulation aligns with global recommendations and enhances transparency in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>GDPR – Safeguarding Personal Data:</p><p>Another significant aspect discussed in the webinar was the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR aims to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data. It covers the processing of personal data by data controllers and processors within the EU, as well as the processing of such data of EU residents by controllers and processors outside the EU. The GDPR sets out rules and obligations for organizations handling personal data to ensure lawful and responsible processing.</p><p>Interconnectivity of MICA, TFR, and GDPR:</p><p>It was highlighted by panelists that MICA and TFR are interconnected and rely on each other to address various issues within the crypto industry. The TFR aligns the European Union with global recommendations and imposes clear obligations on European crypto asset service providers, which will come into effect from January 2025. On the other hand, GDPR complements the regulations by safeguarding personal data and ensuring compliance with data protection standards.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The webinar provided valuable insights into the upcoming regulations in the cryptocurrency industry, specifically MICA, TFR, and GDPR. These regulations are aimed at bringing transparency, trustworthiness, and investor protection to the crypto market while also safeguarding personal data. Understanding and adhering to these regulations will be crucial for individuals and companies operating within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>What a huge topic. The Digital Universe. Is this more than the Metaverse or less? Anyway: We live in the Digital Age. The vast majority of organizations rely on digital services to run at least parts of their business. Every one of us is consuming such digital services. They are ubiquitous. But this bigger ecosystem of connected digital services, of consumers and customers and citizens, of businesses and governments, of business partners and suppliers, of devices and things is at risk. It is under attack, continuously. The golden rule is: Once you are connected, you are under attack.</p>
 No silver bullet for security 
<p>There is no silver bullet, no single solution for securing that complex environment. But there are two good starting points, to my opinion:</p>
 
 Everyone and every organization must care for the security within their realm 
 Zero Trust (and yes, I know, it isn’t the most popular buzzword anymore, but that does not mean it is the wrong approach – in contrary) must be applied: Don’t trust, always verify 
 
<p>Some of the core components of modern security for the Digital Universe, beyond standard cybersecurity, standard IAM (Identity and Access Management) and Zero Trust, include security for Web3 and the Metaverse, Decentralized Identity, Software Supply Chain Security and Secure Development Lifecycles, but also CIAM (Consumer IAM) and IoT (Internet of Things) Security.</p>
 Security for Web3 and the Metaverse(s) – and the role of Decentralized Identity 
<p>We may discuss whether there already are metaverse(s) out there. Web3 is closer, for sure, despite being a somewhat undefined mix of different mostly decentralized technologies. The answer on how security for that brave new world will look like would by far exceed the scope of a single blog post.</p>
<p>But let me mention two important points. One is that there won’t be a single security solution for these environments. Tackling security for Web3 and the metaverses best starts with deconstructing them into the various components such as distributed ledgers or smart contracts and then addressing security per component. Recombining this and implementing policies and other common elements consistently will help us in achieving our goal. The most important of the common elements is Decentralized Identity, which is relevant to every component of metaverses and the Web3. Decentralized Identity thus is essential for securing the digital universe.</p>
 Secure Software and Secure Supply Chains 
<p>Software Security and Secure Software Supply Chains are also essential for the digital universe to work well. With close collaboration, this also impacts Supply Chain Security for partners, suppliers etc. accessing and interoperating with other organizations’ IT. Secure Development Lifecycles (SDL) are a must, where every part of the lifecycle is well-protected. SBOMs (Software Bills of Materials), which are increasingly requested, are mandatory. There is no doubt that we must get much better here, with digital services relying on secure software, but also with the risk of malicious code spreading way faster in a hyperconnected world. Beyond software security, B2B Identity Management is of utmost importance, to understand and being able to manage access of externals.</p>
 The “C” users: Customers, Consumers, Citizens 
<p>At the end, digital services are for customers, consumers, and citizens. Decentralized Identity will play an important role for their access and interaction in the near future. CIAM is equally relevant to connect traditional means of access of these “C” users as well as Decentralized Identity to the backend systems, marketing automation services, and other solutions in the organizations.</p>
 Putting it all together 
<p>Securing the digital universe requires so many different activities. Do you need a blueprint for that? Even while it surely would be fun creating such a blueprint, it appears to be too complex. It requires focus areas, some of these but not all listed above. It requires a common understanding of essential concepts, such as the role of Decentralized Identity and of Zero Trust. It must be based on a good understanding of risks, but also the impact of failure in a hyperconnected world: If security fails in one area, this can impact many other areas. Again, Zero Trust (which also implies layered security) as a foundational principle helps here.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: The digital universe as well as individual digital businesses will suffer or even fail when we fail in security.</p>
<p>The importance of securing the digital universe will take center stage at the upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> conference happening in Frankfurt this November 14-16. Attending this conference will provide valuable insights on how to effectively address this expansive subject and gain a better understanding of the steps involved in securing the digital universe.</p>

<p>Today ones and zeros carry more weight than paper and ink; the ability to sniff out the genuine from the fraudulent has become an art form. Document verification, a seemingly mundane process, operates as our digital doorman, checking credentials and denying access to those whose stories don’t add up.<br>
Yet, how much do we know about this process? Join us as we don the detective’s hat and dive headfirst into the intriguing maze of digital document verification, revealing its fascinating journey from humble collection to the grand reveal of authenticity.<br>
Key Takeaways</p>
 
 The effectiveness of document verification lies in its comprehensive, multi-step process. Advanced tools like BlockID play a crucial role in this process, enabling speed and accuracy. Embrace these technologies to enhance your document verification efforts and foster digital trust. 
 Document verification isn’t just for identity confirmation; it’s an essential tool for enhancing security, ensuring compliance, and optimizing operations across all business sectors. Recognize its broader potential as a shield against various types of fraud. 
 The implementation of document verification processes brings along privacy considerations. Safeguard your operations by prioritizing data security, adhering to data protection regulations, and maintaining transparency. This balance is vital in the digital age, where trust is paramount. 
 
 Document Verification: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding the Process 
<p>In many different businesses, reliable information is crucial, and document verification is required to accomplish this. The methods involved, the many contexts in which it is employed, and how new technology impacts its effectiveness are all covered in this guide.</p>
 
What is Document Verification? 
<p>A comprehensive verification procedure must ensure that papers and official documents are true and correct. This entails verifying the date of birth document’s current validity, cross-referencing it with reliable databases or reference materials, and closely inspecting it for any indications of tampering or changes.<br>
For organizations to safeguard their interests and adhere to legal and regulatory requirements, it is a critical barrier against fraudulent operations.<br>
Document verification is becoming even more crucial due to the development of digital interfaces, which have replaced conventional face-to-face encounters. It becomes a linchpin for establishing trust, ensuring that the person or entity on the other side of the screen is genuinely who they claim to be.</p>
 
The Evolution of Document Verification Technology 
<p>From manual checks to sophisticated AI algorithms, the evolution of document verification technology has been nothing short of revolutionary. In the early days, document verification was a labor-intensive task that required expert knowledge and an eagle eye.<br>
Technological advancement has led to the development of tools like OCR and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID</a>, which expedite the process and improve accuracy. Understanding the technical journey of document verification can help us appreciate the complexity and effectiveness of contemporary solutions.</p>
 
The Intricacies of Online Document Verification 
<p>Online document verification is a multi-step journey, not just a one-off process. Each step of address and document verification works together, has significance, and contributes to creating a robust, efficient, and effective system for validating documents.</p>
 
Document Collection: Initiating the Verification Journey 
<p>The online document verification process starts with document collection. This first stage of vendor verification involves obtaining the document to be validated by the user. Users can upload the necessary scanned or photographed documents through a secure and incorporated online document verification portal.<br>
Quality is paramount here; clear, legible copies ensure the accurate extraction of information in the next stage. This digitalization speeds up the verification process and provides added convenience for users, who can upload and verify documents online anytime.</p>
 
Data Extraction: Leveraging Technology for Intelligent Information Retrieval 
<p>After securely uploading many official documents, advanced algorithms and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools like BlockID, come into play in user verification. These intelligent systems scan the document, pulling out crucial information for verification.<br>
This data extraction process represents a significant technological advancement. It automates a task that would be labor-intensive and prone to human error, ensuring both speed and accuracy. The data extracted at this stage forms the basis for subsequent validation, underscoring the critical nature of this step in machine learning.</p>
 
Document Validation: Ensuring Authenticity 
<p>The retrieved data undergo a stringent validation process upon successfully extracting forged documents. It is checked against predefined standards or databases to establish the document’s authenticity. This step is crucial in detecting and preventing fraudulent attempts, ensuring the paper hasn’t been falsified or tampered with. The validation process is a cornerstone for document verification and a strong deterrent against document types of fraud.</p>
 Manual Verification: The Human Element in Verification 
<p>Even with all the technological advances, there are still situations when human verification of documents is necessary. While robots can handle vast amounts of data quickly and reliably, human input is still required for certain activities due to their complexity and subtlety.<br>
Experts physically handle and examine documents as part of the manual verification process. A person’s experience, judgment, and intuition are crucial in this time-consuming procedure. Automated systems may miss inconsistencies, anomalies, and even minor symptoms of forgery but not by trained humans.<br>
A human reviewer, for instance, may recognize a fresh forging approach that hasn’t been experienced before. Still, an AI-based system is quite adept at spotting fraud tendencies based on historical data. By ‘training’ the system with this new information, it will be able to identify future efforts like this. Document verification systems may benefit greatly from the synergy of human intuition and machine efficiency, as shown here.<br>
Manual verification is also necessary when dealing with complicated circumstances or confusing situations. Decisions in such instances sometimes need the insight of a human reviewer. In cases when the automatic system suspects fraud but can’t explain why, a human reviewer may step in to do more investigation.</p>
 
The Role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Document Verification 
<p>The methods for validating and authenticating documents have significantly changed due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Data extraction may now be automated thanks to AI algorithms that can “read” and “understand” the content of documents. This improves productivity and drastically lessens the possibility of human mistakes.</p>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is an AI subfield that has advanced this concept. ML algorithms ‘learn’ from the data they analyze instead of following a set of predefined rules. These algorithms learn over time what characteristics distinguish a genuine document from a fake one. Therefore, the verification system improves in precision and trustworthiness with each new document processed.</p>
<p>The use of this cutting-edge technology in the fight against fraud is extensive. The large amounts of historical data used by AI and ML algorithms make it possible for them to spot anomalies and patterns of fraud in traditional forging techniques. More remarkably, they can foresee new fraud attempts, giving businesses a head start in protecting themselves.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning have applications beyond fraud detection, enhancing operational efficiency and risk management. They can see trends and patterns that humans may overlook, which is a huge help for making decisions and formulating strategies. Staying ahead of more sophisticated fraud efforts will depend on your organization’s capacity to adapt to the changing digital context.</p>
 
Methods of Identity Verification 
<p>There are many ways to verify user identity and documents, each with strengths, limitations, and best-use scenarios.<br>
For instance, physical security feature check methods are excellent at verifying passports or ID cards, with features like holograms, watermarks, and machine-readable zones (MRZ). However, they may not be as effective with documents that do not have these features.<br>
Biometric verification, which analyzes facial features in photos attached to documents or biometric data, offers an added layer of security. It is more difficult to falsify and can be used for additional checks such as liveness detection. But this method can be challenged by poor image quality or changes in the individual’s appearance.<br>
Lastly, cross-referencing data against secure databases is excellent for many documents and doesn’t rely on physical features. But the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the comprehensiveness and reliability of the databases used.<br>
Therefore, the choice of methods largely depends on the specific requirements and the risk level of the customer identity verification process. However, combined, these techniques provide a comprehensive and robust verification process, significantly reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud.</p>
 
Significance of Document Verification By Sector 
<p>Document verification is crucial across various sectors like financial services, healthcare, education, and government; document verification acts as a vital shield against a spectrum of fraud.</p>
 
 The Finance Sector: In banking, the need for document verification becomes obvious during activities like onboarding new clients or granting loans. Missteps can result in fraudulent documents, hefty financial losses, and severe regulatory penalties. 
 Healthcare and Education Sectors: Similar importance resonates within healthcare and education, where authenticating the validity of medical records or academic qualifications is vital. Errors in this validation process can create far-reaching repercussions for service providers and beneficiaries. 
 Implications for Businesses: From a business viewpoint, inadequate online document verification exposes an organization to fraud risks. The implications stretch beyond financial losses, threatening an organization’s hard-earned reputation. Incidents of fraud that could have been evaded with rigorous online document verification work can rapidly tarnish this reputation. 
 Impact on Individuals: The stakes for individuals are high as well. Serious identity fraud and theft pose a looming threat. Inaccurate identity documents and verification can result in personal financial upheaval, legal complications, and reputational damage for innocent individuals. 
 Legal and Regulatory Necessity: It’s crucial to remember that document verification isn’t merely beneficial; it’s a legal and regulatory obligation. Organizations are bound to meet these standards to avoid penalties and contribute to broader efforts tackling financial crime, corruption, and even terrorism. 
 
 
Real-World Applications of Document Verification 
<p>As we saw, document verification finds applications across many sectors and industries. Its usefulness extends far beyond confirming identities. Document verification provides tangible value across the board by enhancing security, ensuring compliance, and streamlining operations. The following use cases illustrate the diverse potential of document verification in action.</p>
 
Streamlining Account Opening and Customer Onboarding 
<p>Document verification greatly simplifies the onboarding process in industries such as banking and fintech. It allows service providers to establish the credibility of the customer’s identity quickly and efficiently.<br>
With robust document verification solutions, customers can be onboarded fully automated digital processes faster and more confidently, creating a solid foundation for the business-customer relationship. This speeds up operations and ensures a smooth, efficient customer journey.</p>
 
Simplifying Invoice Processing Through Document Verification 
<p>Document verification is vital for financial departments and businesses with substantial invoice processing. By verifying the authenticity of invoices, utility bills, and bank statements, organizations can reduce the risk of manual errors, streamline operations, and maintain accurate financial records.<br>
The integration of document verification software into invoice processing can revolutionize accounting operations, increasing efficiency and reducing the scope of potential errors.</p>
 
How Document Verification Aids in Fraud Detection 
<p>One of the primary functions of such document authentication and verification is to prevent fraud. By validating the authenticity and reliability of documents, businesses can identify and preempt fraudulent activities and counterfeit documents.<br>
This proactive approach enhances security, protecting the companies and their customers from potential threats. With the ever-increasing sophistication of fraudulent techniques, robust document verification is an important defense mechanism.</p>
 Ensuring KYC/AML Compliance with Document Verification 
<p>For financial institutions, document verification is instrumental in meeting Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. These institutions must reliably verify documents and their customers’ identities to prevent illegal activities like money laundering or identity theft.<br>
Document verification provides a reliable and efficient way to meet these compliance requirements, minimizing the risk of regulatory violations and the associated penalties.</p>
 
Document Verification and Privacy Considerations 
<p>While document verification offers many benefits, it also raises valid privacy concerns. With the extensive data collected and processed, businesses must take stringent measures to protect user privacy.<br>
This includes implementing data security protocols, complying with data protection regulations, and being transparent about data usage policies. Balancing the need for adequate document verification with respect for privacy remains a challenge. Still, it is critical to maintaining trust in a world increasingly reliant on digital proof of address and national identity cards.</p>
<p>Document verification underpins the security and data integrity of countless digital interactions that define our world today. By understanding its processes, applications, and implications, we can better appreciate the importance of this unsung hero of the digital age. As technology evolves, document verification will undoubtedly adapt and innovate, strengthening its pivotal role in the digital ecosystem.<br>

 Adoption of digital credentials 



<p>Over 2000 organizations that use #MARK Studio to issue and manage digital credentials started their journey because of the value propositions such as automation of credentialing workflows, better data management, ease of operations, marketing and branding capabilities and social sharing. And while each of these organizations started with a certificate as a digital credential, the variety of use cases for digital credentials across industries and critical sectors have contributed to the rapid adoption of robust credentialing programs.<br></p>



 #MARK Studio for credentialing 



<p>Today, #MARK Studio is the chosen credentialing platform for corporate training organizations, professional bodies and associations, professional certification agencies, higher education institutes, skilling and professional development organizations and learning experience platforms. The organizations use available templates to design and build their credentials and manage them through the entire lifecycle of issuance and management.</p>



 Features and Capabilities 



<p>A verifiable credential on #MARK Studio is a secure, portable and tamper-resistant digital representation of an accomplishment in real life. The credentials are anchored on the CORD blockchain. These credentials can represent participation in a workshop, the completion of a course, the successful completion of a lesson plan or even attendance at an event. Templates like certificates, badges, event pass and skilling credentials allow issuing organisations to look at the journey with a learner from the perspective of recognizing and rewarding the participation. This is a game-changing difference from the current models of credentialing and digital credentialing platforms such as #MARK Studio. By reducing the friction, labour and expense required to recognize an achievement, #MARK Studio opens up new avenues by which the lifelong learning and skill development paths can be documented using verifiable credentials.<br></p>



 Professional Development Use Case for Credentials 



<p>Consider an organization chartered to create skilling and professional development pathways for professionals such as educators. During a calendar year, these pathways will include creating learning modules, workshops, project assignments, in-person and offline training sessions, mentoring opportunities and more. Each activity is designed to build skills and test the application of the knowledge in different situations. As a learner progresses through these activities, there is a need to have a persistent record of acclaim that can be easily shared and verified in real time with a high degree of assurance. And when new acclaim is acquired, those should also be available to provide a comprehensive perspective of the skills and knowledge. Digitally verifiable credentials help meet these requirements through a modular representation of achievements as certificates, badges and micro-credentials. Instant social sharing builds credibility and recognition among peers creating a virtuous feedback cycle that encourages the learner.<br></p>



 Third-party app integration 



<p>#MARK Studio allows easy integration with third-party systems such as learning management systems (LMS) and ERP/CRM systems, allowing organizations to scale out the credentialing processes quickly and efficiently. This design thinking reduces the creation of silos of enrolment and learner data. Instead, it leverages the richly designed APIs to complete the issuance of digitally verifiable credentials at large volumes as required.<br></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Durable digital credentials with verifiable #MARKs empower the holders to discover more opportunities to compose and present their accomplishments. Recently, the concept of a “digital resume” has attracted attention from skilling organizations. The modularity of lifelong credentials on #MARK Studio enables the fluidity in building resumes that align with the specific employment or growth opportunities requirements. This makes the process of engagement with such opportunities easier and less cumbersome.</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>



<p>Welcome to the world of verifiable credentials! If you’re new to this fascinating technology, you’re in the right place. In this beginner’s guide, we’ll walk you through the basics of verifiable credentials, their use cases across various industries, and how they can benefit you. Let’s dive in!<br><br></p>



<p>What are Verifiable Credentials?</p>



<p>verifiable credentials are digital documents that are securely anchored on a blockchain network. Blockchain, in simple terms, is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions or information in a tamper-proof way. These certificates are different from traditional paper-based certificates as they offer enhanced security, immutability, and ease of verification.<br><br></p>



<p>Use Cases in Different Industries:</p>



 
 Education Sector: In the education industry, verifiable credentials are revolutionizing credentialing and verification. By issuing records of academic achievements on the blockchain, educational institutions can prevent certificate fraud, reduce administrative costs, and provide students with a portable and tamper-proof record of their accomplishments.<br><br> 



 Human Resources: Companies are adopting verifiable credentials to record the qualifications and experiences of employees. This streamlines the hiring process, minimizes the risk of fake resumes, and ensures that the candidates’ credentials are authentic and up-to-date.<br><br> 



 Supply Chain Management: verifiable credentials are making their mark in supply chain management, where they help track the origin, quality, and authenticity of products. This improves transparency, reduces counterfeiting, and enhances trust between producers and consumers.<br><br> 



 Healthcare Industry: verifiable credentials are being used to secure medical records, licenses, and certifications. Patients have better control over their data, and healthcare providers can access verified and accurate information, leading to improved patient care.<br><br> 
 



<p>How verifiable credentials Work:</p>



<p>To understand how verifiable credentials function, it’s essential to grasp the underlying technology. Blockchain operates on a distributed network of computers (nodes) that work together to validate and record transactions in blocks. Each block contains a unique code (hash) and a reference to the previous block, creating a chain of blocks—hence the name “blockchain.”</p>



<p>When a certificate is issued, its details are encrypted into a transaction and added to the blockchain. Once recorded, the information becomes immutable and cannot be altered without consensus from the network, ensuring the certificate’s authenticity and integrity.<br><br></p>



<p>Benefits of verifiable credentials:</p>



 
 Security: The decentralized nature of blockchain makes it extremely secure. The certificates are resistant to hacking and tampering, reducing the risk of fraudulent activities.<br><br> 



 Transparency: The blockchain is transparent and publicly accessible, allowing anyone to verify the authenticity of a certificate, promoting trust and credibility.<br><br> 



 Cost-Effectiveness: Adopting blockchain technology for certificate issuance and verification eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing administrative costs.<br><br> 



 Accessibility: verifiable credentials can be accessed and shared digitally, making them convenient and easily portable.<br><br> 
 



<p>Verifiable credentials have the potential to transform various industries by providing a secure, transparent, and efficient way to handle credentials and certifications. Whether you’re a student, professional, or business owner, understanding this technology can give you a competitive edge. Embrace the world of verifiable credentials, and you’ll undoubtedly experience the benefits it brings to your field.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>In addition to the rise in remote and telework, people are conducting more of their personal business online — everything from getting the news to seeing the doctor to paying taxes. This move is a part of what's driving organizations in all sectors to engage in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> initiatives.</p>

<p>In the public sector, agencies are using advancements in technology to modernize websites, replace legacy software, and offer new services that are more convenient and streamlined for constituents and employees alike.</p>

<p>Of course, any significant change comes with challenges, but shying away from digital transformation is becoming impossible in an increasingly digital world. Fortunately, with proper organization and the right tools and solutions, modern organizations and public sector employees can adapt to and thrive in an era of change. Here are six new digital concerns public service sectors will have to address to get there.</p>
	
 1. Onboarding challenges 
	
<p>With new technology, agencies can streamline onboarding processes for their employees as well as new constituents signing up for services. While these technologies can accelerate by creating efficiencies and saving money, they do present challenges. The main one is that many people may not be comfortable with "self-service" IT — and others may not want to provide a lot of personal information upfront.</p>

<p>It's important to provide onboarding processes that are easy for IT teams to implement and for people to navigate, and this is where organizations in private industries and public agencies intersect: they all need to deliver experiences that are simple and secure for consumers, without requiring IT teams to custom-build registration and login journeys. View this <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/experience-center/customer-onboarding">interactive tour</a> to see a simple onboarding experience, including "progressive profiling," which enables you to get to know your consumers and constituents over time.</p>

 2. Implementing security and compliance measures 
<p>As more and more of our data is stored online, there's been a dramatic increase in attacks designed to steal constituent and employee credentials as a way to infiltrate networks and steal data or hold it for ransom. To remain safe and compliant, public sector organizations must revamp their security measures to deal with digital attacks.</p>

<p>Digital security measures — including <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>, firewalls, cloud protections, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">zero trust</a> — have become essential for preventing infiltration by unauthorized and malicious users, including bots, while providing uncomplicated access for legitimate users. This is especially true for government agencies, healthcare providers, financial institutions, and others that deal with very sensitive data.</p>

<p>In addition to using new security measures, companies must be aware of new digital <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/security-compliance">security and compliance</a> regulations meant to protect consumer and employee data.</p>

 3. Employee accessibility concerns 
	
<p>With a nearly endless list of new security updates and digital tools, public sector employers may find it difficult to grant employees access to the tools they need to do their jobs in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>While passwords are the most common method for authenticating users, they are rife with risks. In fact, password- or credential-based attacks have been the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">leading cause of breaches</a>, year after year. The problem is that any time there is a "known" secret, it is at risk of being stolen, guessed, shared, or subject to social engineering attacks like phishing.</p>

<p>Public sector organizations should consider <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> for constituent users and employees alike. Passwordless methods are becoming more readily available to consumers and include the use of passkeys, biometrics (such as fingerprints and facial scans), push authenticator apps, and more. Even where there are legacy applications and infrastructure, such as databases and VPNs that will always require passwords, there are new techniques that allow a passwordless experience, so that passwords are never seen or entered by users. Passwordless authentication provides a streamlined experience for users while delivering vastly superior security.</p>
	
 4. Legacy infrastructure 
	
<p>Many agencies use legacy applications that cannot be moved to the cloud. At the same time, there are plenty of legacy apps that can't support modern security controls. But secure access to these apps, which often drive essential services, is paramount.</p>

<p>Agencies need modern technologies that can support their legacy apps and infrastructure as well as their SaaS apps and cloud-delivered services. Learn about <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">hybrid IAM solutions</a> that provide a consistent experience for users, no matter what type of app or infrastructure they're accessing. A hybrid solution also closes the security gaps created by disparate IAM systems that don't share data.</p>

 5. Adapting to changing technology 
	
<p>Technology is constantly changing in ways that are good and bad. New capabilities offer better services and more pleasant and convenient online experiences. But malicious actors are also getting better at exploiting vulnerabilities that can expose data and erode the public's trust. Therefore, agencies must continually upgrade and adapt to new technologies that are inviting to the public — and that block uninvited attacks.</p>

<p>A great tool for organizations connecting with the public is <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-ciam">customer identity and access management</a>, or CIAM. With CIAM, organizations can better manage citizen identities while providing enhanced security. Agencies can also use identity governance and threat protection, powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, to provide enterprise-grade security and compliance. These tools allow organizations to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">protect digital identities</a> and remain compliant with security and data privacy regulations.</p>
	
 6. Scalability issues 
	
<p>Government institutions may deal with scalability issues as their legacy systems and security controls are unable to match increasing traffic and demands on online services. Upgrading these systems is costly and time-consuming, as upgrades tend to be implemented slowly and judiciously to ensure they meet security requirements.</p>

<p>Scalability is an area that can be addressed by moving certain services to the cloud, which can elastically scale with spikes in traffic and usage. But a cloud migration can create disruption, which is unacceptable for agencies delivering essential citizen services.</p>

<p>A modern IAM platform <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">accelerates cloud migration</a> by enabling you to quickly add IAM experiences and security controls on top of your legacy systems. It co-exists with these existing solutions as you migrate, minimizing disruption, and allowing you to sunset costly and inadequate capabilities.</p>

 Why digital transformation is necessary in the public sector 
	
<p>Digital transformation can streamline the production of new services, decrease wait times, reduce costs, and improve efficiency and accuracy. Although public sector organizations will see immediate benefits from upgraded software and new security systems, the steps they need to take to achieve these benefits may seem daunting — at least initially. Government agencies need to address the pressing issues of onboarding concerns, security issues, employee accessibility problems, and issues with infrastructure to take full advantage of new technology.</p>

<p>Still, legacy systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks, which could disrupt the lives of constituents who must entrust their personal information with their local, state, and national government agencies. As a result, finding a solution to these new digital concerns should be a priority for institutions and organizations within the public sector. With the appropriate tools in hand, organizations will be equipped to overcome challenges that arise on their digital transformation journeys.</p>

 Check out our comprehensive guide to gambling compliance, covering everything from the relevant regulations, cross-border operations, AML compliance, KYC requirements, data protection, responsible advertising, and employee training. 



 



<p>In a bid to reduce the risks associated with gambling activities, each national government and regulatory body establishes rules to govern different aspects of the sector.</p>



<p>Complying with gambling regulation is a never-ending challenge, especially for multi-jurisdictional operators, as they need to keep abreast of developments in the industry, and the launch of new markets and ‘games of chance’.&nbsp;</p>



 What is gambling compliance? 



<p>Gambling compliance refers to the adherence of gambling operators and gambling-related entities to the laws, regulations, and guidelines set forth by relevant authorities and governments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It ensures all aspects of gambling activities, such as financial transactions, advertising practices, and player protection measures, conform to the legal requirements of a particular country to promote fair and responsible gambling practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, gambling compliance requires ongoing due diligence, collaboration with regulatory bodies, and investment in resources to navigate the complexities of the regulatory landscape while upholding the highest standards of legality and player protection. Unsurprisingly, gambling compliance has become a significant risk management area and a necessary challenge for the gambling industry to meet.&nbsp;</p>



 Why is gambling compliance important?&nbsp; 



<p>Gambling compliance is important because it enables gambling operators to:&nbsp;</p>



  Maintain legal standing<br>  Protect players and prevent problem gambling<br>  Build a strong reputation, prevent financial and legal risks, and contribute to the responsible growth and integrity of the gambling industry.&nbsp;  



 Gambling regulations and licensing. 



<p>The goal of gambling regulation is simple: to create a <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/regulation/playing-by-the-rules-why-regulators-regulate/">sustainable</a> industry. In essence, sustainability is at the heart of gambling regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main goal of regulatory bodies is to ensure all gambling operations are conducted fairly and safely. They should prevent consumers from engaging in fraudulent activities like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse</a>, impede problem gambling, and encourage responsible gambling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling operators are required to follow the regulations and rules as laid out by regulatory bodies, such as licensing requirements, age restrictions, and affordability checks. Through such efforts, regulatory bodies maintain integrity in the industry, protecting operators and consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulatory bodies issue (and revoke) licenses to operators that comply (or fail to comply) with the stipulated requirements and rules. Below are some general licensing requirements for gambling operators:&nbsp;</p>



  A copy of the operator’s passport, proof of address, a criminal history check, and a reference from their bank<br>  Ensuring that their software is in line with jurisdiction requirements. Preparing a list including details of software functionality and games, agreements with software developers, and certification of the Random Number Generator (RNG) employed<br>  Determining whether their platform carries the information required by their regulator. Many jurisdictions seek information regarding responsible gambling, terms, and conditions, withdrawal policy, self-exclusion, etc&nbsp;  



<p>Every country has varying rules as far as gambling regulation is concerned. For instance, in regions such as the UK, gambling is heavily regulated by the government and non-governmental organizations, like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">United Kingdom Gambling Commision</a> (UKGC), to ensure safety and fairness.</p>



<p>Gambling regulations are constantly being updated to reflect changes in the industry. For example, in April 2023, after much frustration and numerous delays, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK’s Gambling Act White Paper&nbsp;</a>was finally released. The white paper, which contains proposed changes to the UK’s Gambling Act 2005, aims to more accurately reflect gambling in the digital age, by addressing issues related to VIP customers, slot limits, financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks), and other facets of the UK’s gambling sector. </p>



<p>Read more about the UKGC’s three-year plan to implement changes to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">UK’s gambling regulations</a> here.</p>



<p>Each country has their own approach to gambling compliance. In cases like Canada, even some cities have their own approach. Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">‘How to become compliant in Ontario’s iGaming market.’</a> Meanwhile, in Brazil, regulators are taking gradual steps toward implementing a regulatory regime, making sophisticated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/">KYC checks in South America</a> a necessity moving forward.</p>

 The importance of AML compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>AML compliance is crucial in the iGaming industry as it helps prevent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and ensures that the industry operates fairly. Adhering to AML regulations, operators can safeguard their reputations and avoid legal consequences. AML compliance for operators also helps maintain a safe environment for players, which is essential for users to build loyalty and trust in the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money laundering is often used to conceal illegally sourced funds. Without proper regulations in place, criminals could take advantage of various loopholes and exploit online gambling platforms for their own benefit. AML compliance helps protect operators from money laundering by ensuring they adhere to all necessary laws, regulations, and policies. Below are some of common stipulations seen across different regions:&nbsp;</p>



  Conduct continual risk assessments and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/customer-due-diligence/">customer due diligence measures</a><br>  Train staff and employees on AML regulations and best practices<br>  Carry out regular independent tests to ensure the effectiveness of the operator’s programs<br>  Ensure all the necessary compliance resources are present<br>  Put systems in place to detect unusual activity and track transactions<br>  Implement new technologies for security enhancement, e.g machine learning and artificial intelligence&nbsp;<br>  Keep up to date with the latest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML laws and regulations</a>&nbsp;  



 How KYC requirements ensure gambling compliance.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> procedures are crucial to gambling compliance when acquiring a license as an operator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such requirements usually include verifying a customer’s name, place of residence, and date of birth, generally verified via the submission of an official document (passport or driving license) and proof of address (bank statement or utility bill). Such documents must be authorized during onboarding or before customers can deposit any funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In most jurisdictions, operators must carry out KYC procedures as part of their local AML regulations. The requirements for operators vary depending on the jurisdiction but usually signify the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Authorizing the source of funds<br>  Authorizing customer identities<br>  Understanding customer relationships<br>  Tracking transactions<br>  Developing risk profiles<br>  Identifying and reporting unusual transactions when applicable<br>  Developing solid AML programs  



 Sustainability, player protection, and the vital role of KYC.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">Responsible gambling</a> is crucial to the long-term sustainability of the iGaming industry. Consequently, gambling operators are required to verify the identity and activities of their customers to prevent fraud, problem gambling, underage gambling, and other negative gambling-related consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, procedures like KYC are crucial as far as responsible gambling is concerned, as they protect vulnerable players and minors, as well as the operator, from fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling operators can also offer customers tools to practice responsible gambling, such as self-exclusion programs.&nbsp;</p>

 How data protection compliance shields player data.&nbsp; 



<p>The iGaming industry handles large quantities of private user data, making it a primary target for identity theft and data breaches. Keeping customer safety and privacy at the forefront, operators are required by regulatory bodies to comply with data protection laws. Compliance regulations ensure that customer privacy requests are entertained by operators, who are also responsible for taking measures to <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/compliance/taking-cover-how-to-handle-bettors-sensitive-data/">safeguard</a> private user data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encryption, multi-factor authentication, and robust access controls to protect user data and guarantee its integrity is crucial for operators.&nbsp;</p>



 Responsible advertising and gambling compliance. &nbsp; 



<p>According to regulatory bodies such as the UK Gambling Commission, the advertising of gambling products must be <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/advertising-marketing-rules-and-regulations">undertaken</a> responsibly and comply with the relevant advertising codes. The Codes ensure that gambling advertisements do not encourage gambling behavior deemed socially irresponsible that could result in social, financial, or emotional harm. Advertising gambling to minors is also strictly prohibited and has serious repercussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must comply with relevant laws to promote responsible gambling and safeguard vulnerable individuals. Preventing harmful gambling ads, especially to minors and vulnerable individuals, is essential for operators regarding gambling compliance.&nbsp;</p>



 The importance of regular audits in ethical iGaming operations.&nbsp; 



<p>Frequent compliance audits are crucial for operators to run operations within ethical and legal boundaries. Such audits help determine potential risks and prevent violations, meanwhile avoiding legal disputes and maintaining reputation. Prioritizing compliance and conducting regular audits must be a standard procedure for operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Independent audits must audit operators’ compliance programs to determine their efficiency and avoid regulatory fines. These help operators and businesses determine their AML failures and deal with them before formal regulatory inspections get underway. This way, operators can avoid high regulatory fines as well as other serious consequences.&nbsp;</p>



 Legal challenges in cross-border online gambling.&nbsp; 



<p>Numerous legal challenges are associated with cross-border online gambling, including issues pertaining to regulation, taxation, and licensing. In many instances, operators are required to obtain licenses from multiple jurisdictions, each with varying regulations and requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Different jurisdictions have different taxation laws, making it challenging for operators to comply with all of them. There are also concerns regarding the security of online gambling, most particularly where protecting customer information and fraud are concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Creating a culture of responsible gambling. 



<p>To comply with regulatory requirements and satisfy customers, operators must offer quality customer service and always facilitate a safe environment for customers. In this case, compliance training is crucial as it ensures all employees know how to act when dealing with customers with gambling addiction or other gambling-related issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building a strong culture of compliance is crucial for numerous reasons, including avoiding potential regulatory violations, criminal charges, increasing investor/public confidence, and averting the loss of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/do-i-need-an-online-gaming-license/">gambling license</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To ensure legal gambling practices, operators must monitor employee activities and conduct regular audits. Properly introducing compliance policies via employee training and written materials is vital, and enforcement must be fair and consistent to facilitate a culture of compliance and protect against reputational and legal risks.&nbsp;</p>



 The technological revolution in gambling compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>Technology plays a vital role in gambling <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulatory-compliance/">compliance</a>. It has become crucial for operators to implement technological solutions to guarantee compliance with regulations and mitigate fraudulent activities. Such tools include age ID verification and age verification systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The application of artificial intelligence has revolutionized KYC compliance within the gambling industry, ensuring more effective processes. AI-powered verification ensures accurate yet efficient verification, and advanced facial recognition offers reliable ID verification. AI applications not only enhance compliance with KYC regulations but also enhance user experience, operational efficiency, and the overall integrity of the operator and industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gambling industry’s regulatory landscape presents various challenges for operators, such as complying with regulations in different jurisdictions, staying updated with constantly evolving laws, and ensuring customers a safe and fair gambling experience. Operators must address such challenges head-on by staying informed and embracing new technological advancements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increasing use of artificial intelligence and data analytics and the growing vitality of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">responsible gambling</a> measures are all new trends constantly shaping the future of gambling compliance.&nbsp;</p>



 Betting on gambling compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>Gambling compliance is essential, as it not only ensures the protection of customers, while offering them fair chances of winning, but it also helps maintain the integrity and sustainability of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposals set forth by the newly released UK Gambling White Paper signify that the importance of gambling compliance has only gained more importance, especially concerning new regulatory frameworks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we move into the third quarter of 2023, we take a moment to reflect on our efforts in the ongoing mission of digital identity standardization and enhancement.</p><p> The majority of our daily interactions, both physical and digital, depend on the concept of identity, making it a critical area of focus. Yet, the absence of a native identity layer in the structure of the Internet demands careful coordination and collaboration.</p><p>To address this, SpruceID has been actively involved in various working groups of international standards bodies and foundations. We aim to contribute to open-source, interoperable solutions that will foster a user-centric, privacy-oriented internet applicable across diverse sectors. As part of this effort, we've been involved in developing key identity standards like the Verifiable Credentials 2.0 standard, the SD-JWT VC specification, and more.</p><p>The following are some key highlights of our work in the past quarter:</p><p>ISO Working Groups</p>  SpruceID is hosting the first fully remote ISO/IEC 18013:7 <a href="https://spruceid.com/iso-mdl-interop-event?ref=blog.spruceid.com">mDL interoperability test event</a> for online presentment in cooperation with AAMVA, Austroads, and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 members. The event is open for registrations until August 7th at 11:59 UTC and will take place over two weeks at the end of August. The results will inform the ISO/IEC 18013-7 specification process.  We contributed to the ISO/IEC TS 23220-3 mdoc issuance specification and demonstrated how OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) can be used to securely issuance mdocs, and helped to shape the OID4VP mdoc profile in ISO/IEC TS 203220-4.  <p>W3C Working Groups</p>  We continued our work in W3C as editors and contributors to the upcoming <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Credential Data Model (VCDM) 2.0</a> standard. The VCDM 2.0 will supersede VCDM 1.1 and will be accompanied by a series of other specifications, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Data Integrity</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jwt/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE</a>.  We started the horizontal review process of the VCDM 2.0 standard and created the first self-reviews on architecture, security, privacy, accessibility, and internationalization. In this course, we work with the W3C TAG (Technical Architecture Group), PING (Privacy and Security Interest Group), Internationalization Working Group, and Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group.  We continued to be engaged in the RDF-related working groups in W3C. Finally, we helped transition the proposed W3C Verifiable Credentials Confidence Method vocabulary to W3C CCG.  <p>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</p>  We are spearheading the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-terbu-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SD-JWT VC</a> specification in IETF that describes using Selective Disclosure JWTs (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SD-JWT</a>) to secure JSON-based Verifiable Credentials here. The High-Assurance Profile in the <a href="https://openid.net/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID Foundation (OIDF)</a> selected this SD-JWT VC as their preferred credential format. It is also under consideration by the eIDAS 2.0 <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/architecture-and-reference-framework?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Architecture Reference Framework (ARF)</a>. The specification will also be presented at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/117/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IETF 117</a> before the OAuth2 Working Group.  We are also closely following the development of the SCITT working group in IETF.  <p>OpenID Foundation Working Groups</p>  We continued contributing to the <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC)</a> series as editors of the specifications and as contributors. Amongst others, OID4VC includes <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP)</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI)</a>.  We also helped set up a new working group in the OIDF on Digital Credentials Protocols.  <p>OpenWallet Foundation (OWF)</p>  We continued our engagement in several OWF working or interest groups, such as on Architecture, OID4VC, and credential comparisons.  <p>Web3 Standards</p>  We worked with wallet vendors to address their feedback on EIP-4361 so the specification gives better guidance on how domain binding has to be implemented. The updates are already published in the Ethereum EIP repository.  We contributed to the UCAN working group regarding consistency with timestamps, signature types, and header entry restrictions.  We also contributed to the CACAO (CAIP-196) working group regarding consistent timestamp representations and paths to supporting W3C WebAuthn for signature generation and verification.  Finally, we contributed a definition for did:pkh representations to the MultiDID specification in CASA.  <p>Additional Working Groups</p>  Together with other subject matter experts in the World Economic Forum (WEF) identity working group, we published a whitepaper on <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/reimagining-digital-id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Reimaging Digital Identity</a>.  <p>We fundamentally believe this work to champion global standards is core to the success of further adoption of digital identity, allowing for more secure and privacy-preserving yet seamless interactions that build digital trust across the web.</p><p>If you're interested in discussing or contributing to any of our work outlined above, please contact our team.</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.<br></p>

<p>It’s a rare thing at a tech conference to hear cheers when someone says the internet is down. But then, <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> is a rare sort of tech conference.</p>Photo by <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a><p>To be fair, we knew that our access to the internet was going to get turned off, and we knew it was only for a day. And it was supposed to be a fun experiment, an opportunity to test all the local-friendly technologies that participants had brought with them. But for most people in the world, this is not a game; it’s a hard reality that they face daily. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet?facet=entity&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org#interactive-charts-on-internet">Almost half of us</a> don’t have any access at all, and for many of those of us who do, access to high-speed internet is not easy, cheap, or reliable.</p><p>Some might argue that isn’t such a bad thing. I imagine those cheers came from a bittersweet awareness that the internet’s effect on society hasn’t all been rosy, a sentiment that’s echoed by <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90909279/gen-xers-and-older-millennials-really-just-want-to-go-back-in-time-to-before-the-internet-existed?ref=blog.holochain.org">most generation Xers and millennials</a> in the connected world. But I think it’s also true that networked digital information technologies can be a potent force for empowerment and justice. Economic and political powers are already wielding these tools to their advantage, and those whose security is threatened by those same powers can (and sometimes must) use the same tools if they want to survive.</p>Eric Bear describes the success of the Earth Defenders Toolkit in applying technology judiciously to the contexts of indigenous groups. Photo by <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a> An urgent call to step up <p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">Last year I learned</a> about the success of <a href="https://digital-democracy.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Digital Democracy</a> and <a href="https://ahau.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Āhau</a>, two groups building tools for indigenous people around the world to map the wealth in their ecosystems and cultures and use the collected data to preserve their sovereignty — even to the point of <a href="https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/community/mapping-waorani-ancestral-lands-in-ecuador/?ref=blog.holochain.org">winning cases in federal courts</a>.</p><p>This year, however, I heard fewer new success stories and more passionate calls for working tools. The message from activists and change-makers was clear and very loud: They need what we’re building, they need it to work, and they need it yesterday. We were confronted with stories from people working to support the <a href="https://rohingyaproject.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">survival of their people</a>, stories from people striving to <a href="https://www.shareable.net/uniting-tech-and-activism-how-dweb-camp-is-elevating-decentralized-technology/?ref=blog.holochain.org">preserve bodily autonomy and gender-affirming care</a>, stories from people trying to keep the lights on when infrastructure failed. The traditional web can’t serve these needs — you can’t deliver a cloud-based solution to people who have no internet, or whose access is policed by oppressive states.</p><p>The call was both encouraging and sobering. It showed that those of us building tools for decentralisation are on the right track, but it also revealed how much work we have ahead of us.</p><p>There’s a gap between creators and practitioners. Many of us are building tools that we hope the world needs. We start out ‘scratching our own itch’, reasoning that if we need something, then others must too. And that’s where our genius comes from; our creativity gives birth to new possibilities. But our technology is still young, and we haven’t had a lot of experience testing it to see if it is, in fact, what the rest of the world needs.</p><p>In many sessions, like a <a href="https://dwebcamp2023.sched.com/event/1NuA9/thinking-differently-how-do-distributed-patterns-affect-the-way-we-do-things?ref=blog.holochain.org">workshop</a> that my colleague Collin and I hosted on questioning and testing our design choices, and a discussion circle hosted by <a href="https://dweblabs.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Labs</a>, we bridged the creator/practitioner divide to face one question together: how do we make our tech solve real problems?</p>A discussion group at DWeb Camp. Photo by <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a> Where to go next <p>The main theme I heard was that the specific tools don’t matter. What matters is that they work. The appropriate solution for a given context might be as simple as a web service running on a ten-year-old laptop, or even pen and paper, or it might be complex enough to <a href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/sarafu-network?ref=blog.holochain.org">warrant a blockchain</a>.</p><p>In uncovering what this means, I heard a few other themes:</p><p>It’s time for developers and designers to unseat themselves as authorities, presenting themselves instead as servants who <a href="https://letsstudio.substack.com/p/introducing-lets?ref=blog.holochain.org">honour the wisdom and abilities</a> of the people they’re designing for. Users are the best experts on what they need, yet the ‘culture of the expert’ undermines that and leaves them feeling disempowered.</p><p>One-size-fits-all tools are not necessarily going to work, especially if they embed assumptions that come from a <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/09/joseph-henrich-explores-weird-societies/?ref=blog.holochain.org">western, educated, industrialised, rich, and democratised</a> perspective. The key to transforming our design process is relationship — meeting the real people we intend to serve, not abstract personas, and learning to listen to them. <a href="https://okthanks.com/blog/2020/3/19/orbot-listening-groups?ref=blog.holochain.org">Co-design</a>, especially using an agile approach, is a well-established set of practices for sharing the design process.</p><p>This will result in culturally appropriate software, tailored to the needs of a specific group. But in our effort to make empowering software accessible to more people (that is, making it affordable to create and access these tools), we may also want to create <a href="https://archive.org/details/neighbourhoods-metagov">‘generic tools’ for ‘specific cultures’</a> — tools that, while one-size-fits-all, embed as few assumptions as possible. If we want to do this well, we’ll need to analyze our designs rigorously for cultural blind spots, make our tools as adaptable as possible, and most importantly, partner with real people to test them.</p><p>Solve for needs that are regular rather than rare. Rather than building with an eye toward a once-every-twenty-years type natural disaster, we can focus on creating tools and processes that help address everyday needs. From communication and coordination, to commerce or even play, people have to find a tool useful in their daily lives or they won’t adopt it. By serving everyday needs, we can ensure that these tools are already in use when one of those rare events inevitably comes along.</p><p>Build for surprise and delight. Similarly, if we build something that is all function, but isn't simple, easy, and effective in addressing the issue at hand, then people aren't going to use it. Like much of the open source software space, those of us developing distributed solutions need to get more disciplined about designing for ease of use.</p><p>I think there’s something unique in local-first tech that could actually surpass the user experience of cloud software. It makes apps ‘just work’ in ways that are challenging for the cloud to match — most DWeb stacks already give users offline mode and inbuilt privacy while making automatic scaling easy and low-cost for developers. Our next step is to close gaps that make the experience unfamiliar, complicated, and buggy. Adoption happens when the first experience is rewarding.</p><p>Better solutions are discovered when tool-makers cooperate with each other. We need a humility that’s courageous enough to step back when someone else’s tool is more appropriate for the job — even (or especially) if that tool is not digital. Rather than fix-alls, let’s see our projects (and distributed tech as a whole) as layers in a stack which shifts from use case to use case. By building greater interoperability between our tools, we can occupy ecological niches that are mutually supportive of each other. Protocol-agnostic approaches like those used by <a href="https://ad4m.dev/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ADAM</a> — which allow users to enjoy a unified experience bridging between spaces and tools — can help us leverage the richness of our ecosystem.</p><p>I was encouraged to see creators and practitioners forming coalitions; DWeb Labs was the most prominent of these. It consists of people who have separately been applying DWeb tech to big problems for years, so it’s wonderful to see them combining their experience and demonstrating the mutual respect that allows them to find the best solutions rather than compete for primacy.</p><p>There are new territories to explore. The DWeb community has long been about simply building alternative systems in the shadow of the dominant systems. There’s a subtly anarchic do-it-ourselves streak here; we prefer to “build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete”, in R Buckminster Fuller’s famous <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13119-you-never-change-things-by-fighting-the-existing-reality-to?ref=blog.holochain.org">words</a>, rather than fighting against big, top-heavy structures.</p><p>This DWeb Camp, I heard more people talking about dancing strategically with those structures. On a mere pragmatic level, governments and large corporations are the world’s biggest buyers of software, and sages like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%22ACoAAAAA7k8BO2ZeCuuDpsn9aSipkOg2uYhPqc0%22&amp;facetNetwork=%22F%22&amp;origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&amp;sid=9-l&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Mei Lin Fung</a> encouraged us to consider how we could impact people’s lives if we got these institutions to adopt our tech.</p><p>There’s also room for us to start influencing public policy, educating lawmakers about the fact that the DWeb is not just a place where nasty characters hang out but can actually empower citizens in ways that align with the values these officials claim to uphold. And when the DWeb community cooperates on this, our unified voice will carry more weight.</p><p>We can never fully anticipate the consequences of our design choices, but we can speculate intelligently about them, uncover our assumptions, identify the gaps in our knowledge, and become curious enough to explore and close those gaps. And as we build up a community of practice with its own ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language?ref=blog.holochain.org">pattern languages</a>’ — libraries of interconnected design solutions that are proven through experience to work (or not work) for given contexts — the unknown will give way to a body of best practices, and our design interventions will become progressively more life-giving and less damaging to the people we serve.</p><p>A number of us are <a href="https://decentpatterns.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">creating</a> pattern languages together for various aspects of DWeb design, ranging from online communities to cryptographic protocols. <a href="https://discord.gg/myTUswWQz?ref=blog.holochain.org">Join us on the DWeb Discord server</a> if that sort of thing gets you excited!</p>Our workshop secretly also focused on how you can't fully anticipate the consequences of our design choices. Celebrating how far we’ve come <p>In enumerating the challenges and opportunities ahead of us, I run the risk of making it sound like the decentralised web hasn’t made any progress. That is, thankfully, not true. As I mentioned before, organisations like Digital Democracy are pioneering the use of peer-to-peer tech in support of marginalised peoples around the world, and technologies like <a href="https://www.braid.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Braid</a>, <a href="https://gun.eco/?ref=blog.holochain.org">GUNdb</a>, <a href="https://holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a>, <a href="https://hypercore-protocol.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hypercore</a>, <a href="https://www.ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, <a href="https://solidproject.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Solid</a>, <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Spritely</a>, and even humble HTTP are quietly being incorporated into tools that people are using in their daily lives.</p><p>When the internet was disconnected on the last full day of DWeb Camp, many of these technologies had moments of brilliance. Here are a few:</p>  <a href="https://webofcommunity.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb of Community</a>, a simple web app made available on the local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network?ref=blog.holochain.org">mesh network</a>, did one thing and did it well: it allowed us to quickly exchange contact information with each other using our smartphones. It demonstrated that sometimes a simple off-the-shelf protocol like HTTP is all that’s needed.  Emergence, a scheduling app built by the Holochain team, was able to onboard a number of participants before the whole valley lost electricity, taking down the camp’s mesh network. You can read about our experiences building, testing, debugging, and deploying this app in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/emergence-lessons-in-contextual-complexity/">Eric’s blog post</a>.  Even after the power went out, one team was able to continue using <a href="https://github.com/tschudin/vossbol?ref=blog.holochain.org">vossbol</a>, a voicemail messaging app built with a peer-to-peer protocol that uses smartphones, Bluetooth, LoRa, and a cheap $20 microcontroller as a relay server.  After electricity was restored, people got the chance to play with a few Holochain apps (including <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a>). The camp’s mesh network wasn’t completely restored yet, so we were able to connect computers using someone’s mobile phone as a hotspot simply acting as a router, without connecting to cell service!  One participant was able to prototype and demo a <a href="https://memije.substack.com/p/dweb-camp-2023?ref=blog.holochain.org">local-first collaborative playlist app</a> using GUNdb and Braid.  The <a href="https://guardianproject.info/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Guardian Project</a> demoed their <a href="https://likebutter.app/box/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Butterbox</a> device, a hub that deploys a local network and Android app store full of privacy-preserving, local-first apps.  <a href="https://hyperhyper.space/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hyper Hyper Space</a> demoed Hyper, a web-hosted browser for their peer-to-peer asset-sharing network.  <p>The challenges we face are real, but the need is also real, the opportunities are great, and we’re beginning to show the world what’s possible. As we work to improve the user experience, local-first, peer-to-peer, and agent-centric technologies will become better, more attractive solutions than cloud technologies. At that point, developers and their users may not care that they’re using something that’s more resilient, privacy-friendly, capture-resistant, and respectful of their dignity. But if we remain diligent about meeting real needs, everyone will become empowered by default as these tools are adopted.</p>Sometimes the best tools are paper and a pen.

 Is there any wonder why crypto operators are questioning existing onboarding processes, and experimenting with alternative options like iris scans, when governments and global regulatory bodies are still deliberating correct policing procedures? 



 



<p>If there’s one thing that can’t be levelled against the often maligned and misunderstood industry of crypto, is that it’s boring. In fact, despite cryptocurrency being almost 15 years old, many countries are still wrestling with what it actually is, let alone how to properly police it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, while there are certain regions, like the European Union, that are well on their way to enforcing a crypto regulatory framework (via the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulation</a>), others, like the UK, are moving very slowly with their own proposed crypto regime. In fact, it was only recently that the UK government officially rejected a proposal to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-rejects-call-regulate-crypto-gambling-2023-07-20/">regulate crypto assets as a form of gambling</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more information on how the UK’s crypto regime may look, check out our ‘Regulations – Explained in 90 seconds’ video, with our Global Head of Crypto &amp; Fintech, Jason Tucker-Feltham.</p>



 



 

 



 Riding the crypto roller coaster. 



<p>Having seemingly recovered from the multiple downs of 2022, the crypto industry appears once again to be in its ascendancy. This month, it was revealed that the bitcoin price <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/23/the-skys-the-limit-crypto-now-braced-for-a-multi-trillion-wall-street-earthquake-after-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-litecoin-solana-tron-and-polygon-price-boom/">had doubled since the beginning of the year</a>, and the industry shows no signs of slowing, both in terms of size and scope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when is crypto’s rate of growth too fast, and will regulators ever be able to keep pace?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a sector that has never been shy about pushing the boundaries of technology and questioning the limitations of existing systems, it is understandable that crypto players would experiment with new approaches. The problem, however, is that many of these novel approaches are being conducted on unstable, unregulated ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take the recent furore surrounding Worldcoin, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spearheaded by OpenAI Chief, Sam Altham, the cryptocurrency and digital ID project verifies users’ identity through a simple retina scan. This, it claims, ensures a fair distribution process, with each individual only able to claim their<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/"> sign-up bonus once</a>, and also helps to detect deep fakes, which are increasingly being used to perpetrate fraudulent activity, and to complete customer onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A valid and admirable intention, but is it ethical?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Worldcoin boasts ambitious goals, including a potential path to AI-funded Universal Basic Income. However, many concerns have been voiced by the crypto community, particularly on Worldcoin’s targeting of individuals from developing nations. This deployment strategy calls into question whether all those who have been subject to iris scanning fully understand the implications of participating. Could the irrevocable capturing of iris data at some point work against early adopters? The ultimate usage of World IDs remains unclear,” said Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and Fintech at IDnow.&nbsp;</p>



 In the eye of the verifier.&nbsp; 



<p>Worldcoin has recorded and stored thousands of iris scans so far, which are being used to train its algorithms, but has assured users it will <a href="https://www.context.news/big-tech/what-is-worldcoin-and-what-does-it-mean-for-our-privacy">destroy and hash users’ biometric data after usage,</a> but has not yet announced when that will be or provided a deadline for when they will delete data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not just privacy considerations that are causing concern, however, but where such a bold step may lead to in the future, especially for matters relating to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a>, and to cut corners or offer a much less tried and tested approach to identity verification comes at a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">huge risk</a>.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, as with any new and novel approach, fraud experts are quick off the mark in exploiting loopholes. In China, Worldcoin has gone viral, despite local users being unable to legally downland and register for the platform. The reason for the sudden, mass popularity is that users are bypassing these restrictions by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/worldcoin-black-market-iris-data-identity-orb-1850454037">buying iris data</a> for as little as $30 from countries, such as Cambodia and Kenya. In fact, the business in biometrics is booming, leading to the Kenyan government recently banning <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/kenya-bans-worldcoin-activities-as-citizens-trade-biometrics-for-tokens">‘Worldcoin activities’</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>The incentive offered by Worldcoin – crypto in exchange for iris scans – is clearly a catalyst for user adoption. When it comes to personal data, however, many think twice before parting ways with it.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and Fintech at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>“Crypto rewards are nothing new in an ever-crowded market, and with backing from some of the world’s largest VC firms, the incentive structure has long been planned by Worldcoin to increase the likelihood of its commercial success. However, perhaps what was not initially envisaged was the ease in which World IDs could be exploited by bad actors for financial gain. A black market is emerging in the trade of World IDs and yet a way in which to prevent such trade has yet to emerge,” added Jason.&nbsp;</p>



 More than meets the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Innovation is important, especially in such a forward-looking industry like crypto. Technological innovation can be transformational for businesses and consumers, but it must always be done within the guardrails of a) regulation and b) a safe and secure environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using a layered approach and combining different identification methods, crypto platforms can be assured their customers are who they say they are. The responsible use of biometrics, when combined with video identification, in addition to collecting official documents forms part of a solid and robust KYC process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automated identity verification, powered by artificial intelligence and combined with screening mechanisms and geolocation checks, provide an unparalleled solution to mitigate risks brought by fraudsters trying to circumvent KYC processes. Adhering to KYC and AML requirements should be logical for every crypto platform, wherever they want to operate, especially whilst regulatory frameworks are still being finalized.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a>&nbsp;are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">&nbsp;identity verification solutions</a>&nbsp;work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, its online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.&nbsp;</p>

 The notion of identity – and how to balance online anonymity with accountability – has been a conundrum since the internet was invented. Indeed, the concept of digital identity is one that continually evolves alongside various regulatory and technological developments. But what exactly is digital identity? 



<p>Since 2015, France has had an identity federator called FranceConnect, and more than 40 million users have already used it. However, the digital identity offered remains a low-level identity. In 2021, FranceConnect+ was deployed to remedy this problem and offer the possibility of accessing more secure digital identities (substantial and high levels). France is one of the first countries to have introduced substantial-level identity into its national regulations, acting as a forerunner in this area.</p>



 What is digital identity? 



<p><a href="https://www.yris.eu/en/">Digital identity</a> is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-viky-manaila/">digital counterpart</a> to the evidence we can provide in the physical world. As the digital counterpart of the identity document, it can provide the same level of confidence in online and sensitive use cases as an identity document can in physical use cases.</p>



<p>It is therefore a means of proving identity, but not only that. It is also a means of secure authentication, and can be used to prove certain attributes of identity such as age or nationality. <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/particulier">CNIL</a> (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés or French Data Protection Authority) points out how, “identity is more than just civil status”. </p>



<p>Identification and authentication using a digital identity is a three-way game. The user, having created his digital identity with the help of an identity provider, will use it to authenticate himself with a public or private operator, more commonly known as a service provider.</p>



<p>The best-known use case is when entering into a remote relationship. Here, digital identity makes it possible to retrieve reliable identity data, rather than an identity document. It is also a means of accessing the different accounts we use every day. In this way, it makes our everyday lives easier, while improving the level of security of the services we access.</p>



 What are the different levels of digital identity? 



<p>Digital identity has been regulated at European level, enabling it to be transposed into national law. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS</a> regulation sets three levels for digital identity:</p>



  Low level: Most of the time, this is a username and password. However, this identity is subject to various risks, including phishing. Nevertheless, it is still interesting for uses that do not require a very high level of trust (checking the number of points on your driving license, for example);  Substantial level: This is the level of identity most expected for sensitive transactions in the world of payment and finance, but can also be useful for other uses. Substantial level identity is created face-to-face or equivalent, using a piece of identification and involving strong two-factor authentication (2FA). The first factor is the telephone used to prove ownership. The second factor involves proving what you know, such as a personal code determined when the identity was created;  High-level: Although there are still few cases of this being used, most Member States have adopted a high-level identity. Despite the fact that it is created on the same basis as a substantial-level identity, the identity card used must be fitted with a chip, which acts as a cryptographic element at the time of creation. When used, the cryptographic element must be used for verification as a strong authentication vector.  



 



 

 



 



 How does digital identity work in practice? 



<p>Digital identity can be created in one of two ways: face-to-face or face-to-face equivalent, i.e. remotely. In the second case, which represents the majority of use cases, the process only takes a few minutes to complete. To do this, you need to take a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/capture-solutions/">photo of your identity document</a> and a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">video of yourself</a> to determine whether the person creating the account is really the same person as the one on the document submitted. At this stage, a number of automated checks come into play to verify the veracity of the information submitted. Finally, when a substantial or high-level identity is created, a human operator checks these elements.</p>



<p>Once the identity has been created, it can be reused in a matter of seconds on different services using two-factor authentication. For the user, the digital identity eliminates the need to use multiple IDs/passwords, thanks to a single gateway to a wide range of uses. They will also not have to scan or provide their ID every time they enter into a new relationship.</p>



<p>Finally, it gives them greater control over their personal data. The advantage of digital identity is that it provides only the identity data needed for the service, rather than all of it. This represents a step forward in data control. In terms of privacy protection, the <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/news/france-cnil-publishes-dossier-regarding-use-digital">CNIL recommends</a> “identifying the need for trust in the service and using the lowest level of identification and authentication that meets this need”.</p>



 What are the benefits for service providers? 



<p>Digital identity offers a number of advantages not only for users, but also for service providers. Without competing with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">current identity verification solutions</a>, digital identity logically coexists with existing solutions.</p>



<p>Thanks to digital identity, the level of confidence in authentication procedures is strengthened, particularly for those who do not yet have strong authentication. By eliminating the need for back-office document verification, digital identity reduces costs and eliminates a tedious and time-consuming task. It is also a major commercial advantage, since it reduces friction during the initial contact, thereby improving the conversion rate.</p>



<p>In all areas subject to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/combating-financing-of-terrorism-cft/">Combating the Financing of Terrorism</a> (AML/CFT) regulations, digital identity makes it easier to meet <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> obligations, by correlating numerous identity elements.</p>



<p>Last but not least, digital identity has a direct impact on the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/document-fraud/">fight against fraud</a>. By being verified by identification specialists, the data submitted is more reliable and less likely to have been stolen or falsified. Digital identity thus guarantees the reliability of identity data. In addition, digital identity providers are regularly audited and must comply with strict obligations, ensuring the security of the entire value chain.</p>



 What is the outlook for digital identity? 



<p>Although there are many use cases, digital identity is still in its infancy. It is set to become the standard for authentication and identification in the next few years, and we need to be prepared for this. By offering numerous advantages for both users and service providers, digital identity will revolutionize, simplify and secure our identification habits for the long term.</p>



<p>At European level, the prospects offered by the European Digital Identity Portfolio are also opening up new horizons. In addition to making it easier to identify oneself within services in other countries thanks to the interoperability of identities, it will be able to contain additional attributes, such as driving licenses or diplomas. The arrival of such solutions will have a direct impact on the user experience and on the way we interact with all our day-to-day services.</p>

 We sat down with our Sales Director, Olivier Artus, to discuss the PVID framework, its impact on the financial market, its evolution over time and its implementation at IDnow. 



 What will the PVID certification mean for the financial market in practice? 



<p>The PVID certification offers a clear and precise reference for all remote identity verification players on the French market. It allows financial market players to integrate a certified solution of substantial level into their process, which will make the entry into a relationship consistent with a face-to-face equivalent. This is the first time that the French authorities that regulate the financial services market have proposed a solution, integrating biometrics, that is 100% compliant with the Monetary and Financial Code (CMF), without having to add any additional measures other than ID and biometrics.</p>



 What will the PVID standard add to the remote identity verification process? 



<p>The real difference is the instant compliance of the entry into the relationship. Until now, the use of biometrics in a transaction, although secure, had no substantial value, i.e. was not recognized or certified by an authority. Thanks to PVID, we finally have a solution that offers a face-to-face equivalent, in line with the requirements of the regulators.</p>



<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">PVID standard</a> makes it possible to offer online access to unbanked populations. Thanks to the certification, it is no longer necessary to add additional measures such as the first payment by bank transfer, for example, which is less inclusive and often a source of failure or even cost. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">use of biometrics</a> is now recognized as a full complementary measure.</p>



<p>The rules imposed by traditional financial institutions for opening an account have made the entry into a relationship a real challenge. If we had had a PVID standard at the time of the health crisis, for example, traditional banks would have been able to do even more business securely and therefore more transactions.</p>



 Will all players in the financial sector be affected by this certification? In particular the crypto players, the fintech world… will everyone be on the same page? 



<p>All players subject to <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr/">ACPR</a> and <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/regulation/regulation-homepage">AMF</a> regulations will now be able to include a biometric entry path in their solution: credit institutions, personal and capital insurance, fintech, payment institutions, etc. Some other sectors will not be immediately affected by PVID, such as property and casualty insurance, which does not have a KYC obligation as it is not considered a risk area.</p>



<p>Other sectors of the financial sphere such as issuers of prepaid products and so-called credit FinTechs will obviously be interested in the development of such solutions to enhance trust when entering into a remote relationship.</p>



<p>As far as crypto is concerned, the AMF in France has defined the PSAN status (Service Provider on Digital Assets) in order to better supervise the market players and requires for this the implementation of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">complete KYC path</a>, including identity verification. This is equivalent to the PVID process for banks. More globally and in order to harmonize the European crypto regulatory landscape, it is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets)</a> regulation that will enter soon, still with the objective of protecting investors and preserving financial stability.</p>



<p>The first beneficiaries of the PVID standard will therefore be banks, neo-banks, payment institutions and credit players. What is important to remember is that players who are not directly concerned by PVID will be able to accelerate their insertion into the market and strengthen confidence in the construction of a customer relationship, thanks to this type of standard.</p>



 What will be the benefits of a PVID certification for financial market participants? 



<p>The last two years have seen a significant increase in cases of online identity fraud. In our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">latest Identity Fraud Trend Report</a> we found a 144% increase in the use of fake identity documents between November and December 2021. PVID certification strengthens traditional remote identity verification solutions, and improves the fight against identity theft through the use of biometrics.</p>



<blockquote><p>Beyond the fight against fraud, the challenge of the PVID standard is to fight against financial crime during remote identification, and therefore money laundering. This involves identifying the origin of funds and the destination of funds. The PVID process completes the financial institution’s AML/CFT system.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



 Do you think that the arrival of PVID will increase confidence in the market? 



<p>Of course. The primary objective of PVID is to strengthen the trust between the financial institution and the customer when subscribing to a service or opening an account.</p>



<p>The end customer will go through a process that is based on a public repository published by a recognized government agency, which represents an additional element of trust for him. For its part, the financial institution will rely on an expert company that provides it with a solution certified by the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ANSSI</a> to a substantial level with regard to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">European eIDAS regulation</a>, in order to verify the authenticity of the identity of the customers it deals with.</p>



<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/solution-pvid/">PVID standard</a> adds control points to identity documents. The dynamic capture of the document allows the detection of security features that cannot be verified in static mode. Then, a manual analysis completes the automated verification of the captures. It is carried out by operators trained in fraud who check, correct and give a final verdict on the user data in less than 5 minutes.</p>



 What, in your opinion, are the challenges to encourage the adoption of this new type of standard? 



<p>The first challenge is the user experience, which must be simple, intuitive, fast and perfectly integrated into our customers’ acquisition flow. The use of a mobile phone in the context of a long-distance relationship can be a barrier for less technophile users. For this reason, we offer an omnichannel pathway (on smartphones, tablets and computers). Our PVID certified pathway offers an intuitive, step-by-step guided experience to simplify the identity verification process for the user, for high conversion rates.</p>



<p>Furthermore, citizens are becoming increasingly vigilant about the handling of their personal data. Here again, our solutions are compliant with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Our solutions and all processed data are securely hosted in Europe and we have our own infrastructure. Thus, we guarantee the complete confidentiality and protection of all shared data and analyses performed.</p>



<p>In addition to the user aspect, we also have a duty to support financial institutions in learning how to use the solutions and optimize their processes.</p>



 In terms of geography, who will be affected by PVID? And in your opinion, will this certification evolve? 



<p>From a technical point of view, the solution will initially apply to the entire French market under the aegis of the ACPR. As France is a recognized financial center, it is likely that the PVID process could also be recognized as compliant in other EU countries in the context of remote entry.</p>



<blockquote><p>It can be assumed that this regulation will continue to exist and that it may evolve from a functional point of view. Optional modules may be added to the solution to suit different countries and local regulators.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



<p>In the context of the emergence of digital identity and identity wallets, our near future will be to rely on a PVID certified solution for the creation of a recognized digital identity of substantial level.</p>



 What is the status of certification at IDnow? 



<p>IDnow has obtained the ANSSI Security Visa for PVID certification of its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-provider-criteria/">identity verification services</a>! Symbolizing the culmination of months of collaboration and involvement by all our teams, this certification demonstrates our determination to offer our customers secure solutions that comply with current French regulations.</p>

<p>At Fission, we believe that people and the communities they belong to deserve more agency over their data. In the Harvard Business Review article, <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/why-companies-make-it-so-hard-for-users-to-control-their-data">Why It's So Hard for Users to Control Their Data</a> by Bhaskar Chakravorti, digital agency is defined as the ability of users to own the rights to their personal data, manage access to this data and potentially be compensated fairly for such access.</p> The Case for User-Owned Data <p>Web 2.0 saw a huge rise in app platforms, and users became used to sharing their personal information to gain access. But as data breaches occurred and tracking became more sophisticated, users started pushing back against data collection and its resulting invasions of privacy. </p><p>Legislation like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> was passed to protect users by spelling out their rights over their data, but this isn't enough. How many users tick the checkbox and authorize data collection and tracking on the websites they visit simply so they can carry on with what they were doing?</p><p>Many users care about data privacy, but their actions don't always match their concerns. Chakravorti lays out three possible reasons: 1) Data is intangible, and because we're not physically handing it over, it doesn't feel as meaningful to us 2) Users have little leverage to negotiate more data agency because they feel trapped in many services 3) Managing one's own data is complex. </p><p>How can we mitigate these roadblocks and empower users to take back control of their data and privacy, but do so in a more intuitive and user-friendly way?</p> Promising Solutions <p>Local-First Apps</p><p>Local first apps adopt principles and practices prioritizing data ownership, privacy, and control. Data is stored locally on users' devices, giving them direct control over their information. Even if data is synchronized across devices or stored in the cloud, local-first apps often use end-to-end encryption to ensure it remains inaccessible to unauthorized individuals. Users can even modify their data when there is no Internet connection! &nbsp;</p><p>The way changes are made in local-first file systems also empowers users. For example, CRDTs handle data synchronization and guarantee eventual consistency while allowing users to collaborate with others and retain control over their data. </p><p>Fission's Webnative File System (<a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">WNFS</a>) is a local-first E2EE file system that developers can integrate with their apps to ensure their users are in control while they remain GDPR-compliant. It's a win-win! </p><p>Interoperable Standards</p><p>As mentioned earlier, many users feel trapped on their platforms because there is no easy way to transfer their data from one service to another. There are ways a user can download their data and request its deletion from the server, but porting that data over to another similar service and picking up where they left off has not always been that simple. It wasn't until GDPR mandated the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/">right to data portability</a> that big tech companies came together to work on the <a href="https://dtinit.org/">Data Transfer Project</a> and make downloaded data standardized. As a result, companies like Apple, Meta, and Google now interoperate with each other. </p><p>Another way of using standardization is to create a protocol. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, has been working on a new web infrastructure called Solid. &nbsp;<a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a> lets users store their data securely in "Pods". Pods are decentralized data stores that act as secure personal web servers for data. It is similar to the local-first app approach in that the data remains with the users. Applications that adhere to standard, open, and interoperable data formats and protocols, like Linked Data, can store and access data in Pods with the user's consent using the Solid Protocol.</p><p>Blockchain technologies have also empowered users to store their data with more agency. <a href="https://www.disco.xyz/">Disco.xyz</a> uses a "data backpack" to keep their data portable while transitioning from Web2 to Web3. By combining Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) with Verifiable Credentials (VCs), users can cryptographically verify their identities and share their data with their chosen communities or apps.</p><p>Data Trusts and Data Commons</p><p>A data trust looks after the data and data rights of individuals. Trustees act on behalf of the collective good of the group and can decide whether to grant or revoke access to their members' data. And according to the MIT Technology Review article <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1017801/data-trust-cybersecurity-big-tech-privacy/">How Data Trusts Protect Privacy</a> by Anouk Ruhaak, "because the data trust would represent a collective, it could negotiate terms and conditions on our behalf. Thus, it could allow us to exercise our rights as producers of data in much the same way trade unions allow workers to exercise their rights as purveyors of labor." </p><p>Furthermore, data trusts are a way to make larger data sets more available for AI training, research, and innovation while keeping users in control. This could even be a mechanism for users to get paid for their data - similar to how people are paid when participating in clinical trials. </p> <p>The growth of user-owned data solutions can lead to several benefits, such as increased transparency, privacy-centric and user-friendly applications, and more healthy competition across platforms. User data is less susceptible to breaches or unauthorized access, and users feel empowered and in control.</p><p>Which of these solutions resonates with you?

      <p>A major bill related to the regulation of digital assets has been passed in the US House of Representatives. The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act provides a regulatory framework for asset-backed stablecoins issued by US entities, while prioritizing technological innovation along with consumer protection.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>The regulation includes meaningful provisions related to the disclosure of assets held as reserves for the regulated coins, promoting appropriate audit standards and helping to build consumer confidence in the product issuances. This transparency stands in stark contrast to some coins which have previously been issued and are, in effect, black boxes, without any ability to verify the claims made by the coin issuers.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>In addition to the mandatory disclosure provision, language is also included that mandates significant controls related to liquidity, capital requirements and risk management processes. The implementation of an empowered compliance function creates an environment in which protection of consumers and insulation from financial crime risk are endemic to the ecosystem. This makes clear that establishing a culture of compliance is a benefit to the long term health of stablecoin issuers and will be a key mandate made by regulators when considering new applications under specific regulatory regimes.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>While challenges still remain with regard to passing the bill through the Senate, there is now a clearer path than ever toward creating regulatory clarity related to the issuance of stablecoins. This will allow good actors to create cross-border functional dollar tokens, reducing rent-seeking behavior in remittances and jumpstarting a broader move toward blockchain infrastructure within&nbsp; the traditional finance sector.&nbsp;</p> 
       Bank Policy Institute Supports Digital Asset Anti-money Laundering Act  
      <p>The Bank Policy Institute (BPI) has come out in support of the Digital Asset Anti-money Laundering Act, an act proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren that seeks to establish more stringent financial financial crime compliance requirements for crypto service providers and associated entities.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>The leading financial services advocacy group’s endorsement of the bill represents another important milestone in the evolution of the integration of traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto. Only by creating a system more averse to financial crime, utilizing blockchain analytics tools related to <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/lens-wallet-screening">wallet screening</a> and <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/crypto-transaction-monitoring">transaction monitoring</a>, can institutional trust truly be built in the sector and can the financial opportunity of extant products be fully realized.&nbsp;</p> 
       SEC Charges Richard Heart With Misappropriation and Offering of Unregistered Cryptoasset Securities&nbsp;  
      <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Richard Heart – also known as Richard Schueler – along with the companies Hex, PulseChain and PulseX, with offering unregistered securities which were used to raise more than $1 billion in from investors.</p> 
      <p>Eric Werner, Director of the Fort Worth Regional Office said: “Heart called on investors to buy cryptoasset securities in offerings that he failed to register. He then defrauded those investors by spending some of their cryptoassets on exorbitant luxury goods. This action seeks to protect the investing public and hold Heart accountable for his actions.”</p> 
      <p>This represents the latest SEC action against a cryptoasset service provider for offering unregistered securities. While the facts here are unique, the Commission has made clear that it views many assets to represent securities and will be shy about exercising their regulatory authority.</p>

<p>If you want a telling glimpse at why Singapore ranks among the world’s leaders in digital identity, look no further than this summer’s British invasion. No, this former colony and small southeast Asian city-state-turned-financial-powerhouse isn’t fending off intruding forces. It’s fighting for Coldplay tickets.</p>
<p>With six sold-out shows and online ticket queues topping more than a million for concerts that won’t be performed until January, Singaporeans are calling for more to be done to limit the number of foreigners buying up or scalping tickets for a can’t-miss concert from the chart-topping English band. Among the suggested remedies from online masses jones-ing to experience “A Sky Full of Stars” or “Viva La Vida” live and in person: Calls to use the nation’s Singpass digital identity app to purchase tickets, thereby reducing or eliminating the number of foreign fans that can attend the concerts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/singpass/">Singpass</a> (aka Singapore Personal Access) is a digital identity that Singaporean residents use to access government and private sector services online and via mobile app with the same level of trust as a face-to-face transaction. It’s also the centerpiece of Singapore’s National Digital Identity program, part of this island-state’s ambitious Smart Nation initiative to fuel digital economy inclusion and growth. With 97% penetration among this tiny island nation’s roughly 5.6 million citizens, Singpass facilitates more than <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/digital-development/how-singapores-national-digital-identity-and-government-digital-data-sharing">350 million transactions</a> annually.</p>
<p>The program is considered so successful that countries such as <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/japan-south-korea-to-speed-up-talks-over-pending-military-issues">South Korea and Japan</a> seek guidance and collaboration from Singapore in forging citizen identity architectures for verifying, managing, and securing identity. Like programs in Belgium and elsewhere worldwide, digital identity programs are proving vital as the digital world continues to transform every aspect of daily life while fostering a growing number of costly threats.</p>
 Digital Identity: Proof or Consequences 
<p>Identity verification and proofing have long played an essential role in functioning societies, enabling individuals to prove their identity in person to make purchases, manage finances, receive entitlements and services, and more. But verifying identity in digital channels through authentication based on the usernames and passwords that emerged to protect online accounts have been a goldmine for cybercriminals.</p>
<p>The problem: Organized crime syndicates and state-sponsored threat actors continue to find alarmingly effective ways to crack or pilfer users’ login credentials. A never-ending stream of phishing and spyware attacks harvest credentials en masse, leading to corporate data breaches that have made <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2023/04/buyers-beware-cybercriminals-target-your-online-credentials/">over 24 billion</a> recently-compromised login credentials and personal identity files accessible to cyber-attackers via underworld websites.</p>
<p>Thieves and malign forces leverage automated technologies to exploit these logins in credential-stuffing attacks that can test more than 22 trillion password-and-username combinations in <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/can-singapore-become-a-passwordless-nation/">less than 22 seconds</a>. Once they’ve successfully pirated an account, these cyber-bandits can drain bank funds, steal personal identity information or corporate data to sell online or impersonate account owners to defraud businesses and governments. The price tag: More than <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-to-cost-the-world-8-trillion-annually-in-2023/#:~:text=Our%20report%20provides%20a%20breakdown,%24667%20billion%20a%20Month.">US$8 trillion</a> in global losses expected just this year. That’s more than US$20 billion every single day.</p>
<p>Despite being ahead of the curve, Singapore<a href="https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/can-singapore-become-a-passwordless-nation/"> isn’t completely immune</a> to this scourge. An estimated 47.9 million phishing attacks targeting remote workers struck the country in just the first half of last year. Smishing schemes targeting customers of OCBC Bank resulted in losses of more than US$6.4 million—forcing regulators to ban bank emails and text messages. And this March, news hit that hackers had stolen thousands of logins from major tech and Fortune 500 companies after breaching a data center <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/hackers-compromised-two-large-data-centers-in-asia-and-leaked-major-tech-giants-login-credentials/">in Singapore</a> and another in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It’s no small matter. Fast, seamless transactions are crucial to the digital economy. So is security. And that requires a universally-accepted form of identity that protects privacy and prevents hackers from stealing and exploiting personal information. As Congressional Leaders in the U.S. weigh the <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/digital-identity-a-centerpiece-of-the-digital-economy-problems-challenges-and-solutions">Improving Digital Identity Act</a> passed by the House in April, officials here and elsewhere could benefit from studying Singapore’s progress.</p>
 Singapore: A ‘Smart City’ on Digital’s Cutting Edge 
<p>Made up of 63 islands and known for sleek, modern architecture, clean streets, a multicultural vibe, and bustling financial and business sectors, the Republic of Singapore is one of the “Four Asian Tigers.” It has also been dubbed “the smartest city in the world”—and it’s easy to see why. The city-state’s Smart Nation approach includes a National Digital Identity (NDI) initiative that is uniquely focused on nurturing digital innovation, infrastructure, and inclusion to enhance citizens’ lives and address their ever-changing needs.</p>
<p>Singapore does have some built-in advantages in this effort. As ThalesGroup.com reports, the populace is educated and<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide-digital-identity-and-security/iot/magazine/singapore-worlds-smartest-city"> tech-savvy</a>. Data from public transport fare cards and in-vehicle sensors is analyzed to continuously improve transport systems. Contactless payments are widely adopted.</p>
<p>Healthcare is entirely digitized and leverages AI chatbots and IoT sensors to guide residents in healing, recovery, and healthy living. And the Singpass app provides a one-stop platform that simplifies establishing identity, registering a birth, paying taxes, renewing passports, accessing government and private sector services, and more.</p>
<p>While the NDI program was first launched 20 years ago, Singpass was first introduced as a web app in 2018 and as a cryptography-based smartphone app in 2021. Citizens 15 and up can enroll, and only three percent of eligible people have yet to do so.</p>
<p>Once enrolled, citizens can register for Singpass, which allows them to use single sign-on to log into accounts, share information, conduct transactions, and sign documents. Two-factor authentication, such as a fingerprint biometric or pin code on the user’s device, is offered to provide an added layer of security, reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud.</p>
 Building an Ecosystem of Trust 
<p>In Singapore and elsewhere, digital identity is generally comprised of validated digital attributes and credentials designed for the digital world that are verified by cross-referenced government-issued physical world credentials. Think birth certificate, driver’s license, passport, etc. In this case, Singpass is underpinned by the country’s national registration identity card (<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/digital-driving-licence-singpass-app-2531601">NRIC</a>).</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of Singapore’s Singpass is convenience. Citizens don’t need to manage multiple usernames and passwords for different services or transactions. And they can easily access digital equivalents of their driver’s license and Identification Card (IC) through a feature called MyInfo.</p>
<p>By leveraging application programming interfaces (APIs), the service enables users to permit banks and financial services firms to retrieve their personal information to simplify and streamline account enrollment processes. This is also one the first public digital infrastructures to facilitate this form of verification, decreasing the time needed to complete an application by 80%. It has also resulted in a 15% higher approval rate due to better data quality and significant reductions in customer acquisition costs.</p>
<p>But Singpass isn’t yet invulnerable to all possible threats. Earlier this year, scammers allegedly used fraudulent advertising and social media promotions for services like pet grooming and groceries, and dry cleaning lured victims into downloading mobile malware that was used to make unauthorized purchases. According to news reports, money mules allegedly forked over their <a href="https://www.hackread.com/teen-arrest-android-malware-scheme/">Singpass credentials</a> and other information to receive and transfer funds.</p>
 A Step Toward Decentralized Identities 
<p>Singpass may soon give Singaporeans far more control over how their information is used while making digital identity far easier and safer to apply across all sectors of the economy. According to reports, the Government Technology (GovTech) agency that runs Singpass is working on a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#:~:text=Decentralized%20identifiers%20(DIDs)%20are%20a,the%20controller%20of%20the%20DID.">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a>-based digital wallet.</p>
<p>While Singpass already offers a digital identity wallet (DIW) that acts like a “digital twin” of hard-copy identity documents, it operates within a federated ecosystem of centralized servers belonging to large public or private organizations. In federated models like this, data or things like selfies captured for facial recognition-based authentication and stored, even for a short time, can conceivably be hacked and either ransomed or exploited to commit fraud.</p>
<p>DID-based wallets, however, use globally unique identifiers that give users a cryptographically verifiable, decentralized digital identity. This approach sets the stage for a future where authenticating users no longer requires personal data to be stored centrally. Instead, users can control what personal information they share and how it’s used—and for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/08/30/digital-identities-will-change-the-nature-of-online-reputation/?sh=663dde5a584a">how long</a>.</p>
 What Should Come Next 
<p>I couldn’t agree more with Singapore’s exploration of DID-based digital wallets. In my view, the success of digital identity is predicated on distributed technologies and the architectural advantages they deliver.</p>
<p>With distributed ledger-driven systems, for instance, someone applying for a loan could choose which personal information to share instead of granting a bank access to data about their entire financial lives. They could also share third-party trust scores that allow them to demonstrate creditworthiness without revealing personal information at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps best of all, they would no longer run the risk of having the loan denied due to inaccurate or out-of-date information stored within a federated network. That’s because when users opt to share data, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/04/04/why-zero-trust-is-all-about-identity/?sh=350d5c6e54ee">zero-trust systems</a> can apply risk, quality, or credit scores without contributing private user information or metadata to the process. It’s a perfect match with Singapore’s commitment to digital inclusion.</p>
<p>But fair warning: To be effective, digital identity wallets must also comply with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2-</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics</a>-based standards that leverage <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-multi-factor-authentication/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Digi-mfa-sl-Ext&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8JKbBhBYEiwAs3sxNyMKKDUvP5kit_UP4XbwzmqYa5SZLqdolxffbwblB9hNwZ2hzC6VihoCYMMQAvD_BwE">liveness tests</a> capable of defeating identity spoofing.</p>
<p>Had their calls for restricting purchases of top concert acts to Singpass users been in place, that’s the kind of protection more than a few Singaporean Coldplay fans might appreciate right about now.</p>

<p>Ask any CIO or CISO today what they are doing to protect their organization from the continuing threat of cyberattacks and you are likely to hear that they are implementing a Zero Trust approach. A recent Gartner study indicated that Zero Trust network access (ZTNA) is the fastest-growing segment in network security, forecasted to grow 31% this year. Adoption of Zero Trust frameworks offers a more comprehensive alternative to security that better aligns with today’s needs. As organizations transition from the traditional virtual private network (VPN) approach and increasingly adopt the Zero Trust models to secure the perimeter-less environment, one area that cannot be overlooked is the security of the virtual infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the perimeter-less remote work environment we live in today, implementing Zero Trust requires an improved governance of identity, where access to resources is not only determined based on factors such as users’ characteristics and assigned roles but also on asset status and environmental conditions like time and geolocation of the connection request. In this blog post, we describe why it is important to ensure that only authenticated users have access to the resources that they have been authorized to control. And let’s not forget that users can be individuals as well as applications, devices, and machines.</p>
<p>Zero Trust and the virtual infrastructure</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a security model designed to prevent unauthorized access to a network’s resources. It operates under the premise that no user, application, device, or machine can be trusted by default, and that every request must be authenticated and authorized before access can be granted. The Zero Trust framework for virtual infrastructure extends this model, tailoring it specifically to virtualized and multi-cloud environments. The model relies on several key security principles to deliver enhanced security at a time when the traditional perimeter is quickly disappearing and the use of virtualized applications is rapidly growing across multi-cloud deployments. Security principles addressed by the framework include least privilege, micro-segmentation, and continuous monitoring.</p>
<p>The principle of least privilege ensures that users, applications, devices, and machines are only granted the access they need to perform their specific tasks and nothing more. Tasks that users are authorized to perform can have wide-ranging implications on the operation and security of the business. Therefore, best practices should always dictate that a secondary review and approval be required for any sensitive configuration change. As a component of the least privilege principle, associated changes to the public key infrastructure (PKI), including changes to user and machine identity aspects, should always undergo a secondary review and approval process. This helps to reduce the attack surface and limit the potential damage of any accidental or deliberate misconfiguration that may be perpetrated. Micro-segmentation divides the network into smaller, isolated segments to prevent lateral movement by attackers. This means that even if a single segment is compromised, the attacker cannot easily move across the network and access other resources. Continuous monitoring ensures that any suspicious activity is detected and addressed immediately. This involves the use of advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies and potential threats in real-time.</p>
<p>Foundational security mechanisms</p>
<p>In addition to secondary reviews and approvals and the validation of machine identities through a trusted source, an effective Zero Trust framework for virtual infrastructure also relies on foundational elements, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC), encryption, and cryptographic keys and secrets management. MFA protects the organization from unauthorized access and encryption protects sensitive data, ensuring that even if a user’s credentials are ever compromised, the attacker still cannot gain access to sensitive information. Keys and secrets management provides the underpinning footing, ensuring that the keys used to encrypt data and the secrets and other credentials used to access the applications and data are always secured and in compliance with government and industry security regulations.</p>
<p>The way forward</p>
<p>The Zero Trust framework for virtual infrastructure is a comprehensive security model that protects against modern threats in cloud and virtualized environments. Entrust provides a complete suite of integrated technology solutions as required by the Zero Trust framework. Extending the security of virtual infrastructure in data centers and private clouds, organizations adopting this framework can significantly improve their security posture. This includes helping reduce the likelihood of a data breach, maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their critical assets, and supporting progress in the journey to Zero Trust maturity.

<p>I want to introduce you to a new developer tool called Kangaroo. You can use it to bundle up a hApp into an installable binary, ready for use on macOS, Windows, and Linux. It makes it easy for people to start using a hApp, because the installation experience feels like any other app install rather than having to learn about the Holochain Launcher (which is honestly fairly easy but still a bit of a shift from what people are used to).</p><p>After I introduce Kangaroo, I’ve got some upcoming events to help you in your development journey and some notes on the newest unstable release in the Holochain 0.2.x branch and its supporting tools and libraries. (Yes, you read that correctly — this is an unstable release. There are known issues with performance and possibly DHT resilience, but there have been a lot of bugfixes in that area and we wanted to get those into people’s hands.)</p> Kangaroo: Bundle up your hApp and Holochain together <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kangaroo</a> is a tool that makes it easy for you, dear dev, to make installation easy for the people using your hApp. It scaffolds a project structure that contains just enough Holochain and webview to generate a self-contained binary with your hApp in it. The included GitHub actions will then generate installers for all three major desktop OSes, with code signing on the OSes that need it.</p><p>As mentioned above, this means that the installation experience feels familiar and easy — there’s no need to install ‘some other thing’ (the Launcher) in order to install and start using a hApp. All they have to do is go to your website or GitHub repo, or their OS’ app store if that’s how you choose to distribute your hApp, download the thing, and install it.</p><p>Kangaroo is a bit like Lightningrod Labs’ <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/electron-holochain-template?ref=blog.holochain.org">electron-holochain-template</a>, but builds your hApp on a fully Rusty stack using a webview container called <a href="https://tauri.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tauri</a>. That makes binaries smaller, faster, and less resource-consuming than Electron binaries, although you do have to deal with compatibility issues for webview libraries on older OSes. (You can read more about the differences and similarities between Electron and Tauri <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/tauri-electron-comparison-migration-guide/?ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a>.)</p><p>Tauri also supports <a href="https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/updater/?ref=blog.holochain.org">auto-updating</a>; the compiled binary will automatically check for and download new hApp binaries. Keep note that, if your version bump signals a breaking change per <a href="https://semver.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">SemVer</a> rules (that is, the leftmost non-zero number increases), user data will not be ported to the new version.</p><p>Bundling your hApp with Kangaroo is pretty straightforward:</p>  Install the dev dependencies (Rust and Go).  Clone, snapshot, or fork the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo?ref=blog.holochain.org">repo</a>.  Run <code>npm install</code> in the repo’s working folder.  Add your hApp and its UI to the <code>./pouch</code> folder.  Do a project-wide search/replace to change <code>replace-me</code> to your hApp’s name.  Add an icon.  Add a version number for your hApp.  Build the hApp using <code>npm run tauri build</code>.  <p>After that, you can push the repo to GitHub and configure GitHub actions to build the installers for you.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo/blob/main/README.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">readme for the repo</a> is well-written and friendly, so you should have an easy time getting started. This tool is new, so please try it out and give the developers your feedback!</p> Holochain development environment setup support <p>This upcoming series of calls is an ‘open office hours’ sort of thing where you can come and get guided through the process of setting up all the dev tools you need to create hApps. We do ask that you try the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/quick-start/?ref=blog.holochain.org">quick start guide</a> first, but if you hit a roadblock, come to one of these calls with your needs, questions, and frustrations to get unstuck!</p><p>The first session is on Thursday, 3rd August at 13:00 UTC. Here’s the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/events/holochain-development-environment-setup-support?ref=blog.holochain.org">event page</a>, which has a registration link. See you there!</p> Developer-focused AMA in August <p>This will be the first in a new quarterly series of Holochain AMAs just for developers. Rather than a livestream, it’ll be an intimate Zoom call where developers and other dev-related folks can ask focused questions about the things that matter to them. (We will publish the recording afterwards though!)</p><p>We’ve had one or two Holo/Holochain AMAs targeted at developers in the past, but this will be a dedicated AMA just for you, with a regular rhythm that you can put on your calendar. This event joins the fabulous community-led Holochain In Action calls in fostering a community you can journey with as you develop your skills (and your applications).</p><p>The first AMA will be on Tuesday, 15th August at 17:00 UTC. Submit your questions <a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/developer-AMA-1?ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a> and register for the Zoom call <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_TNW-BVjeTnyd_3hvvwDTzw?ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a>.</p><p>Even if you can’t make the call, please register anyway. This will ensure that you will get notified right away when a link to the recording becomes available.</p> Online developer training in October <p>Along with Marcus and Guillem from our education partner Mythosthesia, we’re co-hosting another online hApp developer training course this October. Just like the first one, it’ll be four days of instruction followed by a weekend hackathon. And just like the first one, the curriculum will be fantastic and you and your fellow students will learn a lot together. Read the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-oct-2023/?ref=blog.holochain.org">landing page</a> to learn more and register. Make sure you get your application in by 18th September!</p> Holochain 0.2.1 (unstable): Bug fixes, small improvements, and big changes <p>As mentioned in previous Dev Pulses, we discovered some performance issues and other bugs in Holochain 0.2.0. We <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-5-released/#quick-update-on-holochain-021-progress">promised</a> a quick turnaround to fix these issues, but some of them have been challenging to diagnose.</p><p>We’ve recently released Holochain 0.2.1, which tackles quite a few of these issues. We’re still aware of some outstanding issues, so we’re pronouncing this release unstable. But if you’ve been itching to update your hApp to the 0.2.x series, this release is ready for development with new features and improved performance over the 0.1.x series, but do expect to run into issues. If you need stability, stick with 0.1.5 or wait for a later release in the 0.2.x series. We intend for this release to be API-stable with future 0.2.x releases, but we may need to make unanticipated breaking changes in the service of fixing bugs.</p><p>Here’s a list of changes since 0.1.5, including those that landed in 0.2.0:</p> General   Breaking/new (network protocol): This is one of the two big news items with this release — a new WebRTC-based networking protocol, which lets us rely more on off-the-shelf libraries and tools than our QUIC-based protocol did. It means we can use standard WebRTC <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interactive-connectivity-establishment-ice/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ICE</a> (interactive connectivity establishment) strategies for making peer-to-peer connections over the public internet, and reduces our burden of security compliance due to the fact that WebRTC tools and libs are more mature and better maintained.  New (conductor): The conductor now supports ‘blocking’, in which a peer adds other peers to their block list. Blocking is the foundation of everything we’ll be doing to create the validation-based network immune system in future releases, and can also be used for things that don’t involve validation, such as community moderation or removing an employee from workspaces when they leave the company.  Breaking (conductor config): Networking types <code>proxy</code> and <code>quic</code> have been removed; please transition to <code>webrtc</code> if you have any conductor config files lying around (this is likely if you’ve generated test configs with <code>hc sandbox generate</code>). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2208?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2208</a>)  Breaking (<code>holochain</code> Rust crate): The feature <code>test_utils</code>, which builds Sweettest into the resulting binary, is no longer default. If you’re relying on the <code>holochain</code> crate to use Sweettest, use <code>default-features = false</code> and the feature <code>sweetest</code> (note only one <code>t</code>). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2281?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2281</a>)  New (networking, conductor config): There’s a new network tuning param called <code>gossip_arc_clamping</code> that lets you optionally override automatic arc size tuning to be either full or empty, allowing a node to claim responsibility for all or none of the DHT. This lets resource-constrained nodes (like cell phones) offload their work to willing ‘full nodes’, and is also accompanied by a new ability of standard nodes to tune their DHT coverage to compensate for freeloading (legitimate or otherwise). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2352?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2352</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2380?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2380</a>)  New/experimental: A chain head coordinator feature allows multiple machines to share the same source chain. This will be used mainly for redundancy in the Holo hosting network. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2502?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2502</a>)  Bugfix: A bootstrap server must be reachable when a conductor with installed hApps is launched. This fixes an issue where hApps would get paused if the conductor was launched without access to a bootstrap. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2419?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2419</a>)  Bugfix: Attempts to duplicate a clone cell (that is, a cell with the same DNA and agent hashes as a cell that already exists) now fail. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1997?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1997</a>)  Bugfix (networking): A lockup on certain network layer error types has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2315?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2315</a>, tx5 <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/31?ref=blog.holochain.org">#31</a>)  Bugfix (networking): Mismatched gossip rounds, caused by rounding errors in storage arc boundaries on multi-agent conductors, has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2332?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2332</a>)  Bugfix (networking): A bug in which self-authored data couldn’t be retrieved if the author wasn’t also responsible for that region of the DHT has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2425?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2425</a>)  Bugfix (networking): A race condition that caused network instability (temporary blocking of newly joined nodes) has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2534?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2534</a>)  Optimisation: When uninstalling an app, any DNAs that are no longer used by any other app will have their DHT data removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1805?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1805</a>)  Optimisation: Capability grant verification during a zome function call is faster, which speeds up calls (especially remote calls) considerably. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2097?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2097</a>)   Bundle manifests   Breaking/bugfix (DNA manifest, conductor APIs): <code>name</code> in a DNA definition no longer affects/forks the DNA hash. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2099?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2099</a>)  Breaking (app manifest): <code>version</code> is renamed to <code>installed_hash</code>, and now only accepts a single optional DNA hash value, where previously it could accept a list of values. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2157?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2157</a>)  New (app manifest): A new cell provisioning strategy <code>clone_only</code> has been implemented, designed for situations where a cell shouldn’t be instantiated for a DNA immediately upon app installation. This is useful for when you want to create clones of a DNA but don’t want to have a ‘default’ cell. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2243?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2243</a>)  New (zome manifest): The zome manifest can now take a <code>dylib</code> argument which points to a WebAssembly module compiled specifically to work on iOS. It’s used with artifacts produced by <code>hc dna pack --dylib-ios</code> option. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2218?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2218</a>)   HDI and HDK   Breaking/new (HDI/HDK): <code>HoloHash::retype()</code> is removed from the public API, along with <code>From&lt;AnyDhtHash&gt;</code> and <code>From&lt;AnyLinkableHash&gt;</code> impls. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2191?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2191</a>) Casting can now be done via the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2191?ref=blog.holochain.org">remaining impls</a>, new <code>TryFrom</code> impls, or a new <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/prelude/struct.HoloHash.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#method.into_agent_pub_key"><code>.into_agent_pub_key()</code></a> conversion function (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2283?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2283</a>).  Breaking/new (HDI/HDK): <code>ChainQueryFilter</code> now lets you filter on multiple entry and action types in one query. The query builder API hasn’t changed, but the underlying data structures have, so you’ll still need to recompile your code. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2302?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2302</a>)  Breaking (HDI): The `DhtOp``validation rules have been significantly expanded on and changed. While the data structures and API haven’t changed, stricter rules may cause some previously accepted ops to be rejected. Run those automated tests! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2215?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2215</a>)  New (host API): <code>block_agent</code> and <code>unblock_agent</code> have been added to allow for app-level, agent-driven blocking of peers. This means that a hApp can allow an agent to add other peers to their blocklist, rejecting any signals, remote calls, or gossip attempts from them. (Their DHT neighbours may still ask them to validate and store DHT data for the blocked peers though.) This is useful for moderation of things that can’t or shouldn’t be covered by validation, especially of the <a href="https://cblgh.org/articles/trustnet.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">subjective</a> kind. (Note: as far as I can tell, these functions haven’t yet been wired up to the network plumbing, nor do they yet have convenience functions in the HDK. But the functionality that makes it possible is all there.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1828?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1828</a>)  New (HDK): <code>OpType</code> is now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.3.1/hdi/flat_op/enum.FlatOp.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>FlatOp</code></a>, and <code>Op::to_type()</code> is now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/prelude/enum.Op.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#method.flattened"><code>Op::flattened()</code></a>. The old names still exist as aliases, though, so this isn’t (yet) a breaking change. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1909?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1909</a>)  New (HDK): <code>Path</code> has a <code>String&lt;TryInto&gt;</code> conversion for easy string representation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2544?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2306</a>)  New (HDK): There’s a new <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/link/fn.count_links.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>count_links</code></a> function that works like <code>get_links</code> but only returns a number. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2430?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2430</a>)  Bugfix (HDI): Fixed a problem with validation of private entry data, where <code>Op::to_type()</code> would fail for <code>StoreEntry</code> ops. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1910?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1910</a>)   Conductor APIs   New (admin API): <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/storage_info/struct.DnaStorageInfo.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>DnaStorageInfo</code></a> gives information about the data that is being stored for a DNA across all apps/cells that use it. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2147?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2147</a>)  New (admin API): <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#variant.DumpNetworkStats"><code>DumpNetworkStats</code></a> is an endpoint that lets you do diagnostics on the conductor. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2182?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2182</a>)  Bugfix (admin API): Supplying a network seed during <code>InstallApp</code> now properly updates the network seed for roles whose provisioning strategy is set to <code>None</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2102?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2102</a>)   <code>hc</code> CLI   There have been a lot of small documentation updates and bugfixes; you should find the dev experience slightly smoother now. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2125?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2125</a>)  Breaking: <code>hc sandbox run</code> now outputs a new string when an app port is successfully provisioned. If you’ve written tools to help you manage conductors via this command and are watching for this string, you may to update your code. See <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2320/files?ref=blog.holochain.org#diff-ededbc680fd88848f49dcf0bc4c373e14c916cfdaac39839d9eee262a46614a8R56-R60">this diff</a> for details.  Bugfix: A comma-separated argument passed to <code>hc sandbox generate --directories</code> is now parsed properly as multiple directories. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2080?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2080</a>)  New: <code>hc dna schema</code>, <code>hc app schema</code>, and <code>hc web-app schema</code> output JSON schemas for integration into your favourite IDE. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2138?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2138</a>)  New: <code>hc sandbox generate</code> has a new <code>in-process-lair</code> option, which comes with an associated changes to make <code>hc sandbox run</code> respect the config and only launch an out-of-process lair instance when required.  New: <code>hc dna pack</code> now takes a <code>--dylib-ios</code> option, which produces iOS-optimised WASM files. This is paired with a new <code>dylib</code> property in the zome manifest. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2218?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2218</a>)  New: The new <code>hc run-local-services</code> command runs a local WebRTC signal server whose URL can be passed to <code>hc sandbox generate network webrtc</code>, as well as a local bootstrap server. These aren’t appropriate for use as production servers; rather, they’re meant to be used during testing. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2265?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2265</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2353?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2353</a>)  <p>For more information, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.2.1/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">read the full changelog</a> for 0.2.1 all the way back to 0.2.0-beta-rc.0.</p> JavaScript client 0.15.0: Holochain 0.2 support <p>If you’re planning to update to the unstable Holochain 0.2.1, you’ll also want to update the JavaScript client in your hApp’s UI to 0.15.0. Here’s a list of changes:</p>  Breaking: The input params for the <code>networkInfo</code> API endpoint have been changed to match changes in the conductor API.  Breaking: The client and websocket classes have been refactored to accept <code>URL</code> objects rather than strings.  Breaking: Error responses from the conductor are thrown as new instances of <code>HolochainError</code>, which extends <code>Error</code>.  New/breaking: The dependency on the encryption package <code>tweetnacl</code> has been replaced with <code>@noble/ed25519</code>, because <code>tweetnacl</code> is getting old — so old that it didn’t support modern ES modules. This may break your build pipeline because your bundler will need to target ES2020 in order to support <code>BigInt</code>. The crypto module is imported conditionally — it’s only needed in Node.js, as browsers use the Web Crypto API instead.  New: When making a <code>WsClient</code> request, the client will try to reconnect automatically if the socket is closed.  New: admin API endpoints for <code>storageInfo</code>, <code>dumpNetworkStats</code>, and <code>updateCoordinators</code>.  Changed: The default timeout for API calls has been bumped from 15 seconds to 60 seconds.  <p>Read <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">all the changelogs</a> from v0.15.0 back to v0.13.0 to see everything that’s changed.</p> Tryorama 0.15.0-rc.1: Holochain 0.2 support <p>And of course, with an update to the JS client, Tryorama needs to change too. It inherits all the changes in the client, along with:</p>  Breaking: A local signal server (provided conveniently by <code>hc run-local-services</code>) is required for Tryorama tests, but optional for tests orchestrated by TryCP.  Breaking: With the update to Holochain 0.2.1, there’s a change in Tryorama that depends on a changed output from <code>hc sandbox run</code> on conductor startup.  Breaking: <code>runScenario</code> re-throws errors that it catches rather than consuming them.  Breaking: App websockets are decoupled from conductors, to better imitate real-life scenarios, in which different agents would not be using the same websocket to connect to their own conductor.  New: <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/main/docs/tryorama.dhtsync.md?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>dhtSync</code></a> is a new utility function that waits until two players’ views of the DHT are identical.  Changed: <code>runScenario</code> catches and outputs errors.  Optimisation (TryCP): App installations for a conductor, and conductor installations for a client, are done in parallel.  <p>Read <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">all the changelogs</a> from v0.15.0-rc.1 back to v0.13.0.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@innocentrip?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Suzuha Kozuki</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/expMk3K5v_c?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Eager to close the loop on corporate assets and improve threat protection, many global enterprises are looking for new ways to approach cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust framework</a>. Originally coined by former Forrester analyst John Kindervag in 2010, this dynamic strategy has the power to harden cyber defenses and take security to the next level.</p>
<p>However, implementing Zero Trust isn’t a walk in the park. In most cases, it’s a multi-year journey that requires company-wide effort to accomplish. Luckily, organizations can assess their progress and take guidance from the Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM).</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the basics of Zero Trust and how the maturity model can help you complete a successful implementation.</p>
 Zero Trust security explained 
<p>Zero Trust is based on the principle of “never trust, always verify.” It encompasses many cybersecurity tactics where access to data, networks, and infrastructure is kept to a minimum, and the legitimacy of that access is continuously authenticated. The combination of these various techniques layered on top of one another is what’s known as a Zero Trust architecture (ZTA).</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST), a ZTA is an enterprise cybersecurity strategy that applies Zero Trust principles to component relationships, workflow planning, and access control policies. In short, organizations that implement Zero Trust security take a hard stance against implicit trust, assuming that all users, devices, and cloud applications requesting network access may be potential threats.</p>
<p>Like any data security policy, the Zero Trust model aims to protect sensitive data and other corporate assets from unauthorized access and exposure. But, unlike traditional methods, it focuses not only on the network perimeter but on any and all vulnerabilities inside and out. Simply put, Zero Trust security assumes internal traffic isn’t any more trustworthy than traffic coming from outside the network.</p>
<p>This makes all the difference in today’s environment. With users needing to leverage critical work applications from anywhere, at any time, and on any device, organizations must adopt new policies that can flexibly adapt to their changing risk landscape.</p>
 Why is Zero Trust necessary? 
<p>The truth is that cybersecurity has never been more complex. In an era of rapid digital transformation and cloud acceleration, traditional network security tools don’t stand a chance of protecting sensitive data — and certainly not at the success rate expected of today’s organizations. Beholden to both compliance regulations and consumer responsibility, enterprises are under pressure to upgrade their cyber defenses and keep information under lock and key.</p>
 Attacks on the rise 
<p>Here’s the problem: Cyber threats are evolving and becoming more sophisticated over time. Yet, perimeter-based security controls are stuck in the past.</p>
<p>Take malware, for instance. This threat vector saw a rapid resurgence in 2022, climbing to a whopping <a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/medialibrary/en/infographic/mid-year-update-2022-sonicwall-cyber-threat-report.pdf">2.8 billion attacks</a> just one year after hitting a seven-year low. However, what’s more frightening is that hackers deployed over 270,000 malware variants, the likes of which security experts had never seen.</p>
<p>Traditional detection-based techniques rely on a combination of technology and human judgment — and with that comes human error. With an infrastructure based on implicit trust, it’s only a matter of time before an attack slips through the cracks and bypasses your cyber defenses.</p>
<p>Even worse, enterprises are dealing with an increasingly high volume and velocity of threat vectors. From ransomware and phishing to DDoS attacks and insider risks, organizations are under fire like never before. In fact, <a href="https://www.keepersecurity.com/ponemon2020.html">68% of businesses</a> around the world have experienced a cyber attack in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that successful attacks can have significant consequences. According to IBM, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">average cost of a data breach</a> is almost $4.5 million per incident. By 2025, global cybercrime will cost companies a combined <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/18/2129432/0/en/Cybercrime-To-Cost-The-World-10-5-Trillion-Annually-By-2025.html">$10.5 trillion annually</a> — up from $3 trillion in 2015.</p>
<p>Regardless of size, businesses simply can’t afford the long-tail costs of poor data security. Critical events can impact organizations in many ways, whether it be a prolonged business disruption or a major compliance violation. No matter the type of attack or how it originates, the mess created can take months, if not years, to clean up.</p>
 Digital transformation 
<p>These challenges are compounded by the recent and sudden transition to hybrid, cloud-first work environments.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated cloud transformation. In fact, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">McKinsey research</a> indicates the majority of organizations speeded the adoption of digital and cloud services by an average of seven years. Now, it’s predicted that the total amount of cloud data — which includes public, private, and government clouds — will <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/the-world-will-store-200-zettabytes-of-data-by-2025/">surpass 100 zettabytes</a> by 2025. For context, that’ll be over 50% of the world’s data at that time, up from 25% of what was stored in the cloud in 2015.</p>
<p>This surge is no doubt a response to the increasingly distributed work environment. Currently, <a href="https://owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2022">78% of global employees</a> prefer remote or hybrid to in-office work. So, more likely than not, flexible arrangements are here to stay. Unfortunately, this is putting a tremendous strain on enterprise security teams.</p>
<p>Not only are distributed workforces relying on cloud applications to stay productive, they’re also accessing them — alongside other network resources — on unmanaged devices. That means security teams cannot secure data in use or in movement to and from personal endpoints, creating a glaring hole in their perimeter. Worse yet, because cloud adoption continues to rise, these vulnerabilities are growing at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>Bottom line: With attack surfaces stretched thin, existing cyber defenses are inadequate against a growing swarm of potential risks.</p>
 What is the Zero Trust Maturity Model? 
<p>Developed by the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> is a roadmap for transitioning to a Zero Trust architecture. The model, originally intended for federal agencies, aims to help organizations leverage Zero Trust principles and better protect sensitive assets.</p>
<p>CISA released version 1.0 in September 2021, as directed by President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">executive order</a> on cybersecurity. An updated version, released in April 2023, added a fourth maturity stage alongside additional guidance on Zero Trust implementation.</p>
<p>The model reflects the <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">seven tenets</a> of the Zero Trust framework, as established by the NIST:</p>
 
 All data sources and computing services are considered resources.
<p>Translation: Networks are composed of many devices, applications, and other resources that may have access to enterprise-owned assets. Therefore, they should be treated as potential risks.</p> 
 All communication is secured regardless of network location.
<p>Translation: Location alone doesn’t imply trust. Access shouldn’t be automatically granted based on the device being on enterprise network infrastructure. Regardless of where a request originates, it must meet the same security requirements.</p> 
 Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis.
<p>Translation: Just because a device is trusted in a previous session doesn’t mean it should be inherently trusted for the next. Each session must be authenticated so that the user’s identity can be continuously validated.</p> 
 Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy.
<p>Translation: Authorization decisions should take external sensors into consideration. This includes a user’s location, device, and real-time application context.</p> 
 The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated assets.
<p>Translation: No device or asset receives implicit trust. Every request triggers a security posture assessment, and all assets are continuously monitored to ensure they’re updated, safe, and uncompromised.</p> 
 All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed.
<p>Translation: Trust is granted on an ongoing basis, factoring in a myriad of elements before making an enforcement decision.</p> 
 The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of assets, network infrastructure, and communications and uses it to improve its security posture.
<p>Translation: Collecting analytics and insights on assets can enhance decision-making and avoid risky approvals.</p> 
 
<p>These tenets lay the groundwork for an effective ZTA and are therefore essential to achieving Zero Trust maturity. As we dive into the model in more detail, it’s best to keep these principles in mind.</p>
 The levels of Zero Trust maturity 
<p>CISA created the ZTMM to help agency IT departments strengthen their security postures through a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/05/the-critical-role-of-clm-for-zero-trust-today-and-pq-tomorrow/">Zero Trust strategy</a>. However, its highly prescriptive nature lends itself to organizations of all varieties, outlining actions that any enterprise can take to better protect sensitive information.</p>
<p>The four levels of Zero Trust maturity include:</p>
 
 Traditional: At the most basic level, organizations have manually configured lifecycles and attribute assignments, static security policies and solutions that only address one pillar at a time, and siloed policy enforcement capabilities. 
 
 
 Initial: Organizations at this stage start to automate configurations, attribute assignments and enforcement decisions. They begin implementing responsive changes to least privilege after provisioning and aggregate more visibility into internal systems. 
 
 
 Advanced: Enterprises use automated controls for lifecycle configurations, attribute assignments, and cross-pillar coordination. They have centralized visibility and identity control. They’re also able to enforce integrated policies across pillars and dynamically make changes to least privilege based on risk and posture assessments. They’re actively building toward enterprise-level awareness. 
 
 
 Optimal: At the most mature level, organizations have fully automated lifecycles and assignments of attributes to assets and resources that self-report with dynamic policies based on automated triggers. 
 
<p>Generally, these maturity stages represent the ideal progression from a traditional security stature to one that features dynamic updates, automated processes, integrated capabilities, and other best practices.</p>
 5 pillars of Zero Trust maturity 
<p>The ZTMM consists of five main pillars, each with its own individual and cross-functional security controls. By addressing these areas, organizations create a comprehensive and adaptive security framework.</p>
 1. Identity 
<p>Perhaps the most important pillar, identity focuses on user access management in a dynamic environment, emphasizing continuous validation and behavioral analysis. Why? Because in a post-perimeter world, people are at the forefront of security.</p>
<p>According to Verizon, <a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/">over 80% of breaches due to hacking</a> involve lost or stolen credentials. Zero Trust mitigates this risk by enforcing a policy of least-privilege access. In short, this means users are only allowed to access resources that are essential to their role, thus preventing lateral movement in case of a breach.</p>
 2. Devices 
<p>The ZTMM defines a device as any asset — including hardware, software, firmware, etc. — that connects to a network, including servers, computers, printers, mobile phones, IoT devices, and so on.</p>
<p>Regardless if the device is enterprise-owned or not, Zero Trust advocates for maintaining an inventory of all assets with network access. By enhancing visibility into these devices, organizations can keep tabs on their configurations, associated vulnerabilities, and patch requirements.</p>
 3. Networks 
<p>A network is considered any open communications medium used to transport messages. That includes internal and wireless networks, the Internet as a whole, as well as cellular and application-level channels.</p>
<p>Organizations that have a mature <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/a-zero-trust-framework-for-the-new-hybrid-workforce/">Zero Trust architecture</a> focus less on perimeter-based security and more on managing internal and external traffic flows. This allows them to isolate risks, enforce encryption, and practice “microsegmentation” — the process of breaking the network down into pieces, thereby creating boundaries that keep threats at bay.</p>
 4. Applications and Workloads 
<p>This pillar encompasses all systems, computer programs, and services that execute on-premises, on mobile devices, and in the cloud. This area is of particular importance now that the majority of businesses are adopting cloud services at lightning speeds.</p>
<p>According to the ZTMM, organizations should apply granular access control and threat protection policies capable of mitigating application-specific threats.</p>
 5. Data 
<p>Data at rest, in use, or in motion — it doesn’t matter. Zero Trust principles say that all structured and unstructured files and fragments should be continuously monitored, encrypted, categorized, and labeled regardless of where or how they’re stored.</p>
<p>Specifically, organizations should deploy mechanisms to detect and prevent data exfiltration. The ZTMM also says it’s best to craft and review governance policies to ensure security procedures are enforced across the enterprise.</p>
 Cross-cutting capabilities 
<p>Additionally, CISA’s maturity model also outlines three “cross-cutting capabilities” that organizations are meant to use throughout their Zero Trust journey. They’re intended to support interoperability and cross-functionality, thus weaving together the five pillars.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
 
 Visibility and Analytics: Increases line of sight, informs policy decision-making, and facilitates response activities in case of threat detection 
 Automation and Orchestration: Leverages analytics and other insights to streamline operations and mitigate security risks as they arise 
 Governance: Enables organizations to manage and monitor their regulatory, legal, environmental, federal, and operational requirements 
 
<p>Strengthening these abilities is key to a fast and effective Zero Trust migration. Organizations can conduct a maturity assessment to better understand where they’re currently at in their journey. Once you’ve evaluated and identified your stage, you can implement CISA’s guidance for progressing to the next phase of maturity.</p>
 Identity Access Management: The foundation of Zero Trust 
<p>Mobile and cloud-first transformations have erased the traditional security perimeter. In its place stands a distributed, decentralized, and sprawling environment. With threats looming on the horizon, secure access is a must-have for enterprises of all shapes and sizes — if only it were that easy.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is Zero Trust is a complex, multi-year commitment. The good news? There are ways to simplify the process.</p>
<p>Users are your first line of defense in today’s threat landscape, but they’re also your greatest risk. Protecting identities is key to preventing unauthorized access and exposure — that’s why Identity Access Management (IAM) is a pivotal first step in the right direction.</p>
<p>At Entrust, we designed our comprehensive IAM portfolio to empower organizations as they begin their Zero Trust journey. Our solutions use a variety of technologies to help you protect identities, secure data, and safeguard applications, including:</p>

				  Adopting new technologies can be a daunting task, tying up resources and taking much longer than planned. Better the broken system you know than the new system breaking in ways you never anticipated! Verifiable credential technology was designed to minimize all these adoption problems. How? Read on! 
<p>New to decentralized identity? A good place to start would be the <a href="https://indicio.tech/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">Beginner’s Guide!</a></p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials enable high value data to be shared seamlessly and verified instantly — without having to check in with the source of the data, or the data itself having to be stored and managed by a third party. New technologies enable you to instantly trust, cryptographically, both the source of the credential, and the authenticity of the data stored inside.</p>
<p>The ability to use this immediately actionable data to create more seamless processes is a powerful value proposition. With verifiable credentials you can create an identity and verification layer that can transform the creaky, fraud and security nightmare that is Web 2.0 — if, and only if, it’s easy to implement, right?</p>
<p>The specter haunting IT is lifting and shifting to new systems. Spiraling costs and receding deadlines make the new, shiny thing a difficult bet. And then there are the risks of sudden obsolescence (the newer, shinier thing) or vendor lock-in to a system that’s suddenly a lot more costly to run and update.</p>
<p>There are a few ways verifiable credential technology enables safer, smarter digital transformation.</p>
<p>1. You don’t need to replace your existing system. Verifiable credentials and decentralized identity can be added as a layer that orchestrates your existing identity and access management systems and cloud services. This means you can slowly transform your systems at a pace that’s comfortable and cost effective.</p>
<p>2. Off-the-shelf ecosystems and solutions are available to create this layer, you can build as much or as little as you want in-house.</p>
<p>3. You can choose open-source solutions. Open source means freedom from vendor lock-in. Not only can you build on a system you fully own in a way that meets your needs, you get to benefit from a community of developers constantly innovating on the codebase.</p>
<p>Start simple and small</p>
<p>At Indicio, we believe in starting small and picking a simple use case. It doesn’t matter whether you are an SME or a global corporation. Learn how the technology works by solving a simple problem and then expand. Often once our customers discover how easy it is to implement and use verifiable credentials, they quickly hit the scale button.</p>
<p>A typical customer journey might look something like this when learning about, experiencing, and then implementing verifiable credentials:</p>
<p>Depending on your technical background, you might want to start with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3LvHy3eIPsnRX3W06q6dpsciH1FoPFxt">demo video</a> or <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/comprehensive-introduction-to-decentralized-identity-workshop/">hands-on workshop,</a> where you get to issue, hold, and verify a credential.</p>
<p>For the next step you can explore the <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-sandbox/">Proven™ Sandbox,</a> where you can develop and demonstrate a proof-of-concept using a constrained version of our complete verifiable data ecosystem solution, Proven — with support from the Indicio team.</p>
<p>Once your happy with the proof of concept you’re ready for the full version of Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven.</a> This pre-built ecosystem provides everything you needed for a complete interoperable solution, and the open-source codebases offer visibility so your developer teams unfamiliar with the code have the shortest possible learning curve while providing you with a solution that you fully own.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is inescapable. There is a lot of money to be made with faster, easier to use products and services. But they can’t be delivered without verifiable data and identity. The key to mastering the next stage of the web is to combine flexible, low-cost, low-risk transformation with a maximal capacity to interact, interoperate, and scale.</p>
<p>Why wait to catch up?</p>

 Purpose of Challenge <p>The objective of this data challenge was to develop machine learning models that accurately assess risk in supply chain transportation vehicles of perishable goods such as livestock and food&nbsp;items.</p><p>It’s summertime and humidity is a problem in most of the western world this summer. This data challenge sought to understand the impact temperature and humidity have on the lifecycle of a given supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Supply chain management has been in flames in recent years. This challenge scratched the surface to learn how machine learning and artificial intelligence streamline and improve efficiency and sustainable practice in the transportation of perishable goods and&nbsp;animals.</p> Winners are as&nbsp;follows: <p>First place: Mohammad Jamali ($2500&nbsp;Prize)</p><p>Mohammed took a unique approach to analyze the dataset provided and drew conclusions that were not initially thought of at the origin of this experiment hosted by Ocean Protocol. Mohammad's report included in-depth heat mats that helped us understand the geolocation and internal weather conditions in a new light. This paper sought the best way to find the correlation between the timestamp and temperature to approach the problem as a classification task. This was done by segmenting the timestamp as an example into 24 one-hour intervals or classes and assigning temperature values to these segments. By doing so, it became possible to estimate the likelihood of specific temperature ranges occurring within each time&nbsp;segment.</p><p>Second place: Marco Rodrigues ($1500&nbsp;Prize)</p><p>Marco dug deep through the data set to prove how some hours of the day are warmer than others. This makes perfect sense and is verified by sound data regression models. This metric became interesting when comparing external weather temperature to the temperature inside the shipping vehicle temperature used for this data challenge. Marco’s report used sound data polishing tactics, extensive diagrams, and data visualization. He also used the data set to expose natural weather humidity levels in the context of this challenge.</p><p>Third Place: Andrey Bessalov ($1000&nbsp;Prize)</p><p>Andrey built cutting-edge clusters by using weather features and concluded the best factors concluding the ideal conditions inside the vehicle. They are medium temperature, medium humidity, low wind, no snow, no rain. Andrey cleaned and visualized the dataset provided in terrific detail. From this report, we can assume the best conditions and humidity levels for shipping perishable goods.</p><p>There were 12 total submissions to this challenge, less than previous challenges which reach between 20–40 submissions. This challenge was a bit more challenging than others with the use of in-vehicle sensor data, IoT data, temperature and humidity metrics. Specs on the challenge itself can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://desights.ai/g/challenge/10">here</a>.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how AI and ML can impact a real-world business case like supply chain management? This challenge was an indicator of that. Or, curious about how the performance of your supply chain is mitigating risk in handling shipping logistics and humidity? Let us know in our community channels, and your protocol may be selected next to run a data challenge on.</p><p>Congratulations to the winners, and thank you to all the participants for their hard work and dedication.

<p>In early July, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/14/analysis-of-storm-0558-techniques-for-unauthorized-email-access/">Storm-0558</a> where a Chinese threat actor used forged authentication tokens to access the information – primarily email accounts – of about 25 organizations. This attack included some significant organizations including the US Department of Commerce and, reportedly, the US Ambassador to China. The attack was particularly concerning because Microsoft revealed that the attacker was forging Azure AD tokens using an acquired Microsoft account signing key. &nbsp; In Microsoft’s words, "Though the key was intended only for MSA accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be trusted for signing Azure AD tokens. This issue has been corrected."</p>  
<p>(CISA has posted guidance for addressing the threat <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-193a">here</a>.&nbsp; Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/19/expanding-cloud-logging-to-give-customers-deeper-security-visibility/">expanded licensing for Purview</a> to include companies that do not have an E5/G5 license.)</p> 
 What This Means for Defenders  
 Wiz stated in their research, “Identity provider’s signing keys are probably the most powerful secrets in the modern world.”&nbsp; As identity experts, we agree.&nbsp; Attacks like this look like entirely legitimate authentication and, without additional monitoring, can pass undetected for significant periods of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
 HYPR Adapt and Updating Monitoring  
<p>On July 26, we announced <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> which helps organizations to maintain real-time risk assessment and adaptive security controls.&nbsp; In other words, it’s entirely focused on protecting authentication by detecting anomalous activity and taking action such as requiring re-authentication.</p> 
<p>While Microsoft believes that Storm-0558 has been mitigated, it’s instructive to look at how monitoring could be employed to address scenarios where their MSA or Azure AD signing keys have been compromised.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>One of the key observations is that because of Adapt’s ability to deploy Policy as Code, it can be quickly updated with new policies based on recently identified threats known as IOC and IOA.&nbsp; Once the risk has been identified, HYPR Adapt takes targeted action against the identified risk.&nbsp; These patterns can be detected and action taken to revoke access or mitigate the impact of a newly identified identity threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 How it Works  
<p>Below are the implementation steps to prevent identity-based attacks in the event that a Microsoft signing key is compromised.&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Configuring HYPR ADAPT to ingest Azure Audit logs requires only a simple webhook client configuration, from there HYPR ADAPT will receive all Audit entries from Azure ( in the case of STORM-0558, this would be the Audit. Exchange logs.)  
  As the logs enter HYPR ADAPT they are transformed into datasets that can be leveraged for policy evaluation. As noted earlier, the flexibility of policy as code allows any of the information in these datasets to be computed and evaluated.&nbsp;  
  The HYPR Adapt policy will evaluate the user’s events by looking for the MailItemsAccessed event from Microsoft and will determine if this is an event that’s potentially generated using a token generated by a compromised MSA key. This is done using a combination of the user’s behavior such as applications, and client ids typically used, the token issuance process, and additional metadata that is evaluated in real-time.&nbsp;  
  If the HYPR Adapt policy determines the token is maliciously generated and utilized, it will terminate that token on Azure AD and the user will be asked to immediately re-authenticate. If the policy is not breached, the user will not be interrupted.&nbsp;  
  
<p></p> 
<p>The HYPR Adapt policy can also be implemented to alert the enterprise SOC or similar to be notified and react to any indicators of compromise. However, we believe that having actionable insights and policies that can be executed in real-time is critical for reacting to threats quickly and decisively with accuracy. This is what HYPR Adapt is enabling our customers to do!&nbsp;</p> 
 Maintaining Vigilance  
<p>Microsoft indicated in early July that Storm 0558 has been fully mitigated.&nbsp; Smart security teams are continuing to look for other examples where compromised tokens are being utilized to create new attack vectors.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Finding evidence of attack in the rearview mirror is now insufficient.&nbsp; Risk assessment needs to include the ability to automatically take action to defend against identity threats while minimizing the overall impact to the user experience.

<p>I must admit that I enjoy the convenience of e-commerce shopping. Grocery delivery is just incredibly convenient with my busy schedule. I value my time and want to make sure that I’m working smarter, not harder. But I sometimes find that the online payment process can take a while, especially if I do not feel comfortable storing my card details on merchant websites.</p>
<p>Consumer-preferred payment methods for e-commerce transactions are very dynamic and depend on the situation. So, to learn more about cardholder payment preferences, we recently surveyed 1,000 cardholders. We also asked the respondents how they typically complete an e-commerce transaction. We discovered that more than half of respondents (53%) indicated that they opt to either use the stored card on file or use an expedited checkout button for an easier checkout experience.</p>
<p>Providing the highest level of security for e-commerce payments is possible</p>
<p>Even though both methods are equally convenient for the cardholder, banks that provide the ability to use an expedited checkout button are providing an additional layer of security. This is because the payment information can be tokenized, if the card is pushed to the provider from the bank app.</p>
<p>Thanks to tokenization, card numbers are replaced by encrypted tokens, bringing more security to consumers when it comes to using a digital card to pay. The token is linked to a specific use case and device; e.g., the token can only be used on merchant page x and only from device y. Meaning should the data become compromised, it will not be of use for the fraudster. Providing tokenization and token management capabilities can empower the cardholder with more security and self-service options. And security is a major concern for the cardholder, as we have seen in our recent survey.</p>
<p>Banks can combine this with convenience: Expedited checkout buttons allow the consumer to pay faster online. While those options are proposed by the merchants, banks can also offer an option to push provision cards to digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, Click to Pay, Amazon Pay, PayPal, etc. from the banking app. The advantage is that the cardholder does not have to store the card information on file, and it is faster and more secure than typing in the actual PAN/card info on the merchant website.</p>
<p>Contactless payment and accelerated e-commerce checkout experiences will drive the next evolution in consumer payments, and banks will need to jump on the bandwagon if they want to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Entrust offers push provisioning to third-party wallets, and we now also <a href="https://go.entrust.com/click-to-pay-whitepaper-A">offer push provisioning to Click to Pay</a> for seamless and accelerated e-commerce checkout while providing the highest level of security. Click to Pay, and the enrollment from the banking app, gives cardholders the benefit of a seamless e-commerce checkout experience. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWITpLAlmbg">video</a> shows how the enrollment and payment experience works with Click to Pay.</p>
<p>While physical payment cards remain preferred for in-person transactions, Click to Pay will reignite competition in the virtual checkout lane. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/06/why-banks-should-offer-both-physical-and-digital-card-issuance/">Banks should consider offering a seamless payment portfolio, offering both digital and physical payment options</a>.</p>

 Everything you need to know about PVID. Discover why you need a PVID-certified identity verification provider to unlock the potential of remote identity proofing today. 



 



<p>One in four companies in France are affected by fraud.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">Identity theft</a>, which is often the preferred technique of fraudsters, affects companies disproportionately, with 14% of French companies attacked revealing they suffered <a href="https://www.allianz-trade.fr/actualites/etude-fraude-2021.html">a loss of more than €100,000</a>. In an attempt to protect companies and customers from the threat of online fraud, <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ANSSI</a> (National Safety and Security Agency) rolled out a framework in 2021: the (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) Remote Identity Verification Providers (PVID) standard.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr">ACPR</a> (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution) quickly mandated that financial and banking institutions should use this standard.</p>



<p>(We are now PVID-certified! Read more about our PVID-standard identity verification services in our recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/pvid-certification-idcheck-io-and-videoident/">press release.)</a></p>



<p>All service providers that wish to comply with the Financial Markets Code (FMC) in France for remote onboarding are also required to meet the same requirements. So how do you select the right PVID-certified  provider for you?</p>



 What is the PVID standard? 



<p>To reduce identity theft, the PVID standard requires providers to offer a certified service that is equivalent to face-to-face.</p>



<p>The PVID-standard goal was developed to add due diligence measures to the remote identity verification process to ensure financial and banking institutions comply with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5th AML Directive</a>&nbsp;by using robust and effective ANSSI-certified solutions. Key to becoming certified as a PVID-standard provider is being able to offer reliable identity verification that is equivalent to face-to-face experience, or a&nbsp;high level&nbsp;of assurance of identity theft prevention.</p>



 How can you become PVID certified? 



<p>Nowadays, all remote ID verification providers that wish to comply with the FMC’s requirements regarding remote onboarding must be ANSSI certified.</p>



<p>Service providers must prove that their services comply with all&nbsp;technical and organizational requirements&nbsp;as dictated by the March 2021 ANSSI standard.</p>



 What steps are involved in the PVID certification process? 



  The service provider submits its application to ANSSI, which delegates a certification agent to the applicant.<br>  Evaluation tasks are carried out to ensure the remote service is equivalent to the face-to-face experience, and that biometrics, ID document verification, micro payments and other aspects of the technology (including its Qualified Electronic Signature functionality) are safe and secure.<br><br>As part of the certification process, ANSSI collaborates with the Bureau of Document Fraud of the <a href="https://www.police-nationale.interieur.gouv.fr/Organisation/Direction-Centrale-de-la-Police-Aux-Frontieres">Central Directorate of Border Police</a>, and the Documents Department of the <a href="https://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/pjgn/ircgn/presentation/the-gendarmerie-forensic-institute-model-english-version">Criminal Research Institute of the National Gendarmerie</a>.  



  If the applicant meets the requirements, the ANSSI will issue a certification, and the remote identity verification provider will then be able to meet the banks’ requirements.  



 3 steps to the PVID standard. 



  Video capture of document data and user’s face: Our identity verification services enable the dynamic capture of an ID document and ID holder’s face, which is cross-referenced during analysis.<br>  Automated and manual data verification: Completed in two steps, identity verification is first conducted through automated document analysis (via optical character recognition and deep learning algorithms.) The second step is manual analysis, which is completed by trained fraud operators.<br>  Creation of evidence file and result submission: Containing the identification data as well as submission results, evidence files are kept for the duration required, and available in case of disputes. Results are also submitted to the company and includes the identity of the user, the dynamic captures of the document and ID holder’s face, and, in case of failure, the reason for the analysis failure.  



 What to consider when choosing a PVID provider. 



<p>All <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/solution-pvid/">PVID certified providers</a> are compliant with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fr/glossaire/lcb-ft-5-directive/">LCB-FT 5</a> (The French equivalent of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD)</a>. So what should you consider when choosing a provider? What sets apart a good PVID provider from a bad one?</p>



  User experience: Which provider offers the most intuitive experience?<br>  Processing time: Which provider completes the verification process the fastest?<br>  Document processing capability: The ability to process a variety of documents<br>  Geographic coverage: Does the provider have multi-geographical coverage?<br>  Size of product portfolio: What other solutions are offered by the provider?<br>  Offering <a href="https://www.idnow.io/esign/">Qualified Electronic Signature</a> functionality.<br>  Capturing documents in real time, web and mobile SDKs enable the capture process to be integrated through different channels: directly from the service provider’s website, or application, in an email path or via SMS.  



 One identity verification provider for many regulations. 



<p>Ensuring you meet the myriad of different regulatory requirements across regions, countries and jurisdictions can take significant time and effort, and stifle and inhibit growth and innovation. However, not offering a PVID-standard identity verification service could result in substantial fines, penalties, and reputational damage.</p>



<p>At IDnow, we are committed to helping global businesses navigate the complex regulatory landscape in order to drive growth and scale with ease. Adding to our&nbsp;expansive regulatory certification&nbsp;and expertise across Europe, our latest PVID certification for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">IDCheck.io</a> demonstrates once again the integrity, security and strength of our remote identity proofing services – a certified service that you can trust anytime, anywhere.</p>

<p>In an era where digital transformation is rapidly reshaping industries, businesses face mounting challenges in safeguarding their sensitive information and ensuring user authentication is both secure and seamless.Yet they cannot afford to continue treating security as an endlessly growing cost center that takes time and resources from other strategic priorities. Recognizing the strong demand for more robust security solutions that also serve as a revenue accelerator, Forrester, a renowned research firm, conducted a Total Economic Impact (TEI) study of HYPR. The study reveals impressive key findings that underscore the significance and fiscal impact of modern authentication in enhancing business performance and reducing risk.</p> 
<p>Learn More &gt; <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-forrester-tei-of-hypr">Get the HYPR TEI Study</a></p> 
 Understanding the Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) Study  
<p>Forrester's TEI methodology is a well-regarded approach to assessing the potential economic impact of implementing specific technologies within an organization. The study analyzed data gathered from five organizations that had already adopted HYPR Authenticate. All data was gathered directly by Forrester, without HYPR involvement, so that participants would answer freely. The research evaluated the financial and operational benefits experienced by these companies, providing valuable insights into the value of passwordless MFA in real-world scenarios.</p> 
<p>Based on these interviews, Forrester constructed a composite company which models the results experienced by the real-life companies. In this case, Forrester modeled HYPR’s results by looking at a 10,000 person company with $5B annual revenue in a highly regulated industry such as banking.</p> 
 Key Findings from the TEI of HYPR Study  
 ROI of 324%  
<p>One of the most remarkable findings from the TEI study was the impressive Return on Investment (ROI) that may be experienced by organizations implementing HYPR's passwordless MFA solution. Forrester reported an ROI of 324%, indicating that the benefits far outweighed the costs associated with adoption and integration. For the composite company, this amounted to a present value (PV) of $8.1 million realized in total benefits over a three-year period.</p> 
 More than $2.7 Million Savings in Business Risk Related to Data Breaches  
<p>Data breaches and cyberattacks pose a significant threat to businesses of all sizes. Forrester's study calculated a savings of more than $2.7 million (PV) in business risk from breaches for the composite company over three years. . By eliminating passwords and adopting stronger authentication methods, organizations using HYPR Authenticate can effectively mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to critical systems and sensitive data.</p> 
 95% Reduction in Help Desk Support Costs Related to Passwords  
<p>Passwords are not only a security risk but also a common source of frustration for users. The study found that with HYPR Authenticate, organizations witnessed a 95% reduction in help desk costs related to passwords, worth more than $2.5 million (PV) in a three-year period to the composite organization. This reduction was attributed to a decline in password-related issues, such as password resets and account lockouts, which traditionally necessitate user support.</p> 
 $2.7 million Savings in End User Productivity  
<p>User experience plays a crucial role in driving business productivity and an inefficient user experience can be an immense drain on capital. The TEI study demonstrated that employees of organizations using HYPR Authenticate have less downtime and spend less time logging in , resulting in more than $2.7 million (PV) in savings over three years for the composite organization. The elimination of passwords simplifies the authentication process, enabling users to access systems and applications seamlessly and with a more streamlined workflow.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Importantly, the research demonstrated that employees using HYPR Authenticate log into their systems 30% faster than employees using traditional authentication methods. This helps to speed user acceptance and adoption of the new solution.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>Forrester's TEI study for HYPR offers valuable insights into the impact of passwordless MFA on businesses. The study's key findings demonstrate and quantify, based on real HYPR customer data, the immense potential of passwordless MFA in enhancing security, improving user productivity, and delivering substantial financial benefits.</p> 
<p>As businesses strive to meet the growing demands of a digitally driven world, adopting innovative solutions like passwordless MFA becomes a strategic imperative. By leveraging HYPR, businesses can create a more secure, efficient, and user-friendly environment for employees and customers alike, ensuring they are better equipped to navigate the challenges of the digital age.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, we take great measures to secure our physical belongings, such as locking our homes and storing valuables in safes. However, when it comes to our online safety, we often wonder how to protect ourselves effectively. The answer is simple: we need to be proactive in our internet usage. With the internet playing an integral role in our daily lives, it’s crucial to understand the risks it presents, including cyberattacks, identity theft, malware, and phishing scams. In the year 2022, India experienced a staggering 13.91 Lakh cyber security incidents, as revealed by Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the Minister of State for Electronics and Information and Technology, during his address to the Parliament on 10th Feb 2023. The accessibility of data in the digital era has made it valuable globally, but it has also exposed us to risks such as data breaches and identity theft. India has experienced significant financial losses, reputation damage, and identity theft due to data breaches. Therefore, safeguarding personal information becomes crucial for our protection.</p><blockquote>So, how can we ensure online safety? One potential solution to reduce or prevent data breaches is self-sovereign identity (SSI). Let’s explore what SSI is and how it can safeguard our digital identities and mitigate data breaches.</blockquote><p>India’s Cybersecurity Landscape: A Wake-Up&nbsp;Call:</p><p>Data breaches and identity theft have been on the rise in India, resulting in substantial financial losses, reputation damage, and identity theft. Based on real-world data gathered from 550 businesses between March 2021 and March 2022, a breach of approximately 29,500 records led to a 25% increase in the average cost of data breaches. Hackers employ various techniques like hacking, phishing, and malware to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. The consequences extend beyond financial losses, tarnishing the reputation of individuals, businesses, and entire&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>Numerous high-profile data breaches affecting millions of individuals worldwide highlight the urgency of adopting robust security measures.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): A Solution for Data&nbsp;Breaches</p><p>Can SSI protect your data from hackers? Absolutely. <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a> is a user-centric, decentralized approach to digital identity. With SSI, individuals have full control over their personal information, deciding what to share, with whom, and how. SSI utilizes blockchain technology, ensuring that all identity-related transactions are securely recorded in an immutable and tamper-evident manner. In other words, individuals no longer need to rely on centralized authorities to authenticate their identity or ownership of personal information. Users possess a portable, privacy-preserving digital identity that can be verified both online and&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Taking Control: How SSI Can Safeguard Your&nbsp;Data</p><p>How does self-sovereign identity prevent data breaches? Data breaches occur when hackers gain unauthorized access to personal information, including usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data. This stolen data can be used for fraudulent activities, identity theft, or sold on the dark web. SSI provides a highly secure and private identity and data protection solution by eliminating the reliance on centralized identity systems, making it extremely challenging for hackers to breach the system. In an SSI ecosystem, personal data is stored on an individual’s device, such as a smartphone or computer, and shared only with chosen entities. Even if a hacker gains access to a user’s device, they can only access the data explicitly authorized by the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials: Building Trust in a Digital&nbsp;World</p><p><a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials(VCs)</a> play a crucial role in SSI, allowing individuals to authenticate their identity and ownership of personal data without depending on a centralized authority. Each transaction involving personal information is securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. The public-private key architecture further enhances data protection, as individuals retain complete control over their information and sharing permissions.</p><p>In conclusion</p><p>In an era defined by digitalization, safeguarding personal information from data breaches has become a paramount concern. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) emerges as a powerful solution that empowers individuals to take control of their data while leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology. By embracing SSI and collaborating with trusted providers like AyanWorks, individuals and organizations can strengthen their digital identities and proactively combat the risks associated with data breaches.</p><p><a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> is a leading provider of user-centric solutions that enable organizations to maintain control over their digital identities and data.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>With the increase in automation, there are new cybersecurity threats that need to be addressed, and in order to address the new cybersecurity threats, there are a few technological challenges that need to be understood.</p>
<p>The first challenge is the availability and quality of training data that is required for training cybersecurity-related ML models. This data almost always contains massive amounts of sensitive information – intellectual property, PII, or otherwise strictly regulated data – which companies aren’t willing to share with security vendors. Formal verification and testing of machine learning models is a massive challenge of its own. Making sure that an AI-based cybersecurity product does not misbehave under real-world conditions, or indeed under adversarial examples specifically crafted to deceive ML models is something that vendors are still figuring out, and in many cases, this is only possible through a collaboration with customers.</p>
<p>The field of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, so while in many applications, it’s perfectly fine to train a model once and then use it for years. Cyber threat models must be continuously updated, expanded, and retrained on newly discovered vulnerabilities and attack vectors.</p>
 Recommendations 
<p>While automation is currently in the spotlight, the role of humans cannot be underestimated. In fact, automation was intended to enable humans to focus on priority tasks with reduced effort rather than replacing them. Thus, to secure the autonomous world against cyber threats, organizations and cybersecurity experts must embrace a collaborative working environment between humans and technology. By combining human expertise and automation tools, organizations can create an effective threat intelligence framework to identify, respond and mitigate threats. This can be achieved by real-time monitoring and analysis of user behavior, network traffic, and activity logs. This will allow organizations to identify threats related to data theft and bypass the automation systems using a disguise to infiltrate critical systems in real-time.</p>
<p>One thing which automation currently lacks is contextual understanding. Policies and procedures need to be robust to fill contextual gaps, which will allow the software to not cause disruption in business activities. Human expertise can support in cases of critical decision-making. Finally, cybersecurity professionals should be equipped to tackle ever-evolving cyber threats towards autonomous machines.</p>
 Moving Forward 
<p>The relevance of the autonomous world will continue to increase in the coming years. With more and more organizations from various sectors embracing initiatives such as digital transformation and the power of AI and machine learning, there will be a proportional increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks. By addressing the security challenges and reinforcing the cybersecurity infrastructure, organizations will truly be able to extract the potential of automation.</p>

 The PVID certifications issued by ANSSI for the automated IDCheck.io identity proofing service and the videochat-based VideoIdent mark a new milestone in the identity proofing service provider’s desire to become the leading European player on the digital identity market. 



<p>Munich, August 1, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, has obtained the remote identity verification <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/produits-certifies/prestataires-de-verification-didentite-a-distance-pvid/">certification known as PVID</a> (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) on the level “substantial” for its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/solution-pvid/">IDCheck.io Identity Proofing Service</a> and VideoIdent Qualified Electronic Signature. A symbol of the culmination of months of collaboration and involvement of all teams, this certification demonstrates the company’s desire to offer its customers solutions that are safe, compliant, and fully in line with the regulations in France.</p>



<p>PVID – European leadership in digital and financial security</p>



<p>In a society where transactions have become considerably digitized and are now mostly done remotely, the risk of identity theft has increased, particularly in the banking and financial sector. This is why the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information, the ANSSI) established a new framework defining stricter requirements of identity verification providers. The new standard leads the way for select identity providers to effectively fight against fraud – a singular goal across rigorous Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws in France and throughout Europe. PVID raises cybersecurity standards for traditional finance, digital finance, trust services, and beyond.</p>



<p>Introduced in March 2021, PVID certifies providers the ability to offer identity verification as defined by Europe’s Regulation on Electronic Identification and Trust Services, eIDAS Regulation. Where eIDAS establishes European levels of security to meet the equivalence of a face-to-face verification for various use cases, PVID implements these levels of security to enable compliant digital onboarding for banking and other financial services in France. The certification, issued for two years, allows highly regulated banking or FinServ players to access a robust, secure service offering, thus enabling remote identification while reducing the risk of identity fraud.</p>



<p>France is the first country in the European Union to have established an effective policy for remote identity verification, and was followed by the work of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-among-first-etsi-ts-119-461-certification/">European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) on the ETSI TS 119 461 standard</a>, which pursues a similar purpose.</p>



<p>An undeniable competitive advantage in the digital identity proofing market </p>



<p>As only the second private player to obtain the coveted certification, IDnow has a major advantage in the digital identity proofing market. The certified IDCheck.io Identity Proofing Service and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent Qualified Electronic Signature</a> offer customers a trusted onboarding process that meets the security requirements of the ACPR (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution) and supports the fight against money laundering and fraud. The solutions allow banks to offer flexible, simple, and fast digital paths to improve conversion rates through 100% remote identification, equivalent to a face-to-face process.</p>



<p>“Obtaining PVID certification is a source of great pride and validation for IDnow and a real recognition of our expertise in the digital identity market in France,” comments Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow. </p>



<p>“As the regulatory landscape aims to extend its reach to additional digital services across Europe, PVID offers national regulators an example of a consistent framework that places privacy and security at its forefront. Beyond France, PVID represents one more step for IDnow in its ambition to offer its customers the most secure solutions certified by reference organizations, such as ANSSI. Standards like PVID or TS 119 461 have the potential to be building blocks for future onboarding regulations across geographies and applications, like digital identity wallets. The experience gained from PVID or our contribution to writing TS 119 461 will prove invaluable, and few companies will be able to advise customers as well as IDnow on navigating in this sphere,” adds Rayissa.</p>

  <p>In this increasingly digital world, identity is the most attacked surface area, and the sophistication and frequency of attacks continue to rise. Manual investigations and responses can’t keep pace. We need to think differently about how we protect identities from compromise and respond rapidly to emerging threats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID Protection (recently renamed from Azure AD Identity Protection) helps stop attacks before they happen. ID Protection blocks identity takeovers in real-time and automates attack mitigation by providing advanced machine learning (ML)-based detections, risk-based access policies, and comprehensive risk reports and insights. To protect customers with our latest innovations, we’re excited to announce key enhancements to Microsoft Entra ID Protection: a brand-new dashboard to provide key insights, new detections to block existing attacks, a new mechanism for Microsoft to rapidly protect users from emerging threats, and the integration with Microsoft 365 Defender. Read below to learn more about these exciting new features. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New dashboard&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to present a brand-new dashboard in Entra ID Protection, a central hub designed to help identity admins and IT practitioners better understand their security posture and enable effective protections against identity compromises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Microsoft Entra ID Protection dashboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new dashboard surfaces in-depth insights with compelling visualizations and actionable recommendations. These will help you and your identity teams answer questions like “How well is my organization protected?” “What kinds of attacks are targeting my organization right now?” and “What should I do to address those attacks?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you &nbsp;increase security measures by using <a href="http://risk-based%20conditional%20access%20policies/">risk-based conditional access policies</a> and modern strong authentication policies, the protection of your tenant is gradually strengthened. You’ve asked for better insight into how well you’re protected over time, so we now provide four key metrics with monthly trends to demonstrate the effectiveness of your deployed protections. The number of attacks blocked and users protected metrics can demonstrate the effectiveness of your security measures, and mean time to remediate highlights how quickly your organization is able to respond to and recover from possible compromises. By adopting automated capabilities like risk-based policies and self-service password resets, you can significantly boost your recovery speed, enhancing security and operational efficiency. Finally, high risk users gives insight into how much account compromise risk you are carrying over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key metrics with monthly trends in Microsoft Entra ID Protection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate your risk exposure and where vulnerabilities lie, we’re thrilled to introduce our cool new attack graphic to help you visualize common identity-based attack patterns detected within the past 30 days for your tenant, and - more importantly - how many were successfully blocked, and how many still need to be remediated. These attack patterns are identified based on our advanced ML detections such as leaked credentials, anomalous token, password spray, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 New advanced detections&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working on Microsoft Entra ID Protection, we always strive to provide our customers with new detections that can help protect their environment from malicious actors and activities. By leveraging the vast database of threat intelligence across Microsoft, we’ve now released two high fidelity detections that, in conjunction with risk-based conditional access policies, provide our customers with an opportunity to disrupt attacks at a very early stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first detection is verified threat actor ID. In the past couple of years, a lot of the major security incidents have been initiated by known nation state actors and cyber-crime groups. By utilizing the research carried out by the various security teams at Microsoft, we’ve created a comprehensive knowledge base of these actors, which we now use to assign <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#risk-types-and-detection">real-time sign-in risk</a> to sign-ins performed by them.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User risk detection details</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is attacker in the middle. One of the common scenarios used to gain access and compromise users is to use phishing, usually by way of a fake login experience, to get the user to enter their credentials and then proxy those credentials to a real session in Entra ID. Even if the user is prompted for multifactor authentication (MFA), since they are going through the expected login experience, it’s likely that they will successfully complete the login, thus providing the attacker with a working session and with the credentials to be used in future attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>We use signals provided by Microsoft 365 Defender, together with data from Entra ID, to accurately detect this type of attack and apply risk to both the affected sign-in and the user via the Azure AD threat intelligence detection, allowing customers to revoke the session by requiring a password reset and preventing future use of the credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both detections are now available to all ID Protection customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-time Azure AD threat intelligence&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To protect customers from emerging identity-based attacks, Entra ID Protection now offers real-time Azure AD threat intelligence detections. When new attack patterns are identified, ID Protection can now rapidly issue new, real-time detections in response to these attacks. These detections will utilize Microsoft’s threat intelligence in real-time – meaning ID Protection will detect identified patterns of compromise during sign in, and customers will be able to leverage risk-based conditional access policies to protect their identities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a user sign-in, if the properties of that sign-in match the signatures of a real-time threat intelligence detection, the real-time risk evaluation engine in ID Protection will report the detection, elevating the risk level of the sign-in and the user, and enforce the access control configured in your risk-based conditional access policies to block or challenge the user, protecting your organization from malicious actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers will be able to investigate this detection in the risk detections report in ID Protection. The specific detection rule will be noted in the Additional Info field of the existing Azure AD threat intelligence detection.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Generally available: Integration of Entra ID Protection with Microsoft 365 Defender&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're also excited to announce that the integration of Entra ID Protection with Microsoft 365 Defender is now generally available. Entra ID Protection alerts are critical indicators of identity compromises and are generated by advanced detection algorithms. They’re now surfaced in Microsoft 365 Defender and are correlated into incidents along with alerts from the other security domains. Security teams will be able to investigate incidents efficiently and effectively, gaining a comprehensive understanding of end-to-end attacks and facilitating a quicker response to identity compromises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These alerts are also available via the Microsoft 365 Defender Incident API, allowing you to track incidents involving Entra ID Protection alerts in Microsoft Sentinel or any other solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Microsoft 365 Defender user page, you can now view a user’s risk score and provide feedback on potentially compromised risky users. When an investigation is concluded, the status of the incident and the alert can be updated and will automatically sync back to Entra ID Protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seamless integration empowers customers to disrupt security attacks early on when identities are at risk of being compromised. Get started today by visiting <a href="https://security.microsoft.com/">security.microsoft.com</a> and reviewing our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk#investigate-risk-with-microsoft-365-defender">documentation</a>. We look forward to your feedback on this integration!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 With summer in full swing, we can’t help but think of the endless queues at the various airport checkpoints. Arriving 2 or 3 hours before take-off for flights that are sometimes shorter is a frustrating experience for passengers who are often exhausted or in a hurry. What if there was a way of considerably reducing this wait and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">improving the travel experience</a>? 



 What is biometric verification? 



<p>What if travelers could <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">verify their identity</a> and passport directly from home? Well, it’s possible. Using a smartphone, passengers can capture their identity document (ID card or passport) before they even get to the airport by doing so <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/optimizing-the-online-travel-booking-experience/">during the booking process</a>. The passenger is then invited to carry out a biometric capture of their face (also known as an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">identity check by liveness detection</a>). The physical attributes resulting from the biometric capture are then compared with those on the identity document. This method of identification using biometrics is highly effective. Facial recognition or liveness detection have unique characteristics that enable us to ensure that a person is who they claim to be, and therefore that there is no attempt at identity theft.</p>



<p>Once verified, the passenger’s biometric data is stored in the airport’s or airline’s application for a specific period, enabling the traveler to pass through checkpoints without difficulty.</p>



 The advantages of biometric checks at the airport. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/biometrics/">Biometric checks</a> at airports offers a number of advantages that are revolutionizing the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel</a> experience for passengers. Here are some of the main benefits of this innovative technology:</p>



  Reduced waiting times: one of the greatest benefits of biometric control is the significant reduction in queues at the various checkpoints in the airport. Thanks to facial recognition, travelers can quickly pass through security checks and boarding gates without having to constantly present their identity documents, making the check-in and boarding process much smoother.  



  Improved passenger experience: by eliminating the tedious and repetitive steps involved in checking identity, biometric control offers passengers a smoother and more pleasant travel experience. They can concentrate more on their journey, relax and enjoy the services offered at the airport, without stress.  



  Enhanced security: biometric technologies provide a higher level of security than traditional control methods. Biometric characteristics are unique to each individual, reducing the risk of document fraud and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a>. Advanced biometric systems enable airport authorities to detect any suspicious activity or potentially dangerous behavior more effectively.  



  Seamless integration: biometric control can be seamlessly integrated into existing airport processes. Passengers can enroll their biometric data just once, enabling automatic recognition during subsequent checks. This integration facilitates collaboration between airlines, security services and airport authorities for a frictionless travel experience.  



  Respect for privacy: biometric identity verification solutions generally adopt strict standards for the protection of personal data (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>). Travelers’ biometric information is securely stored and accessible only to authorized persons, ensuring confidentiality and protection of sensitive data.  



 Biometric checks at airports: which countries are pioneers? 



<p>Due to the rapid development of technology and airport security policies, several countries have already introduced biometric control systems at their airports. Here are a few examples:</p>



  United States: The United States has deployed biometric screening programs at some major airports, such as Orlando International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport and Miami International Airport, as part of the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) ‘<a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Oct/biometric-exit-process-fact-sheet.pdf">Biometric Exit</a>‘ program.  United Kingdom: Biometric screening is being trialed at a number of UK airports, including London’s Heathrow airport, as part of the Heathrow Biometrics project to facilitate the passenger screening process.  Singapore: Singapore’s Changi airport is known for its early and extensive use of biometrics for immigration and boarding controls, offering a smoother and more efficient travel experience.  United Arab Emirates: Dubai International Airport is one of the first large-scale airports to deploy biometric screening for check-in, security screening and boarding.  Netherlands: Amsterdam-Schiphol airport has also implemented biometric control systems to simplify the travel process.  



<p>Many countries around the world have adopted or are considering adopting biometric screening at airports to improve the passenger experience and enhance airport security. Implementation varies according to the specific policies and regulations of each country and airport, but there is a global drive.</p>



 In France, what are the challenges inherent in introducing biometric checks at airports? 



<p>For several years, Lyon Saint-Exupéry airport has been running a free “Biometric Experience” service for passengers travelling to Portugal, Ajaccio and Bastia. Passengers download the Lyon airport application and select their eligible flight. They then create their biometric profile by capturing their identity document and taking a selfie. The final step is to capture the boarding pass and link it to the biometric profile. This option allows access to a fast lane dedicated to biometric checks, eliminating frustrating delays before departure.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/passengers/flight-preparation/facial-recognition">In Paris, other similar systems have been in place since March 2021</a>, notably with the airlines Air Caraïbes and French Bee. Passengers can carry out biometric verification directly at the airport on dedicated kiosks. However, there are a number of obstacles to the smooth running of the project.</p>



<p>Older passports without the NFC chip required for biometric services are excluded from trials on certain routes. In addition, the verification of biometric data carried out at home differs from that carried out at a kiosk at the airport. Although the latter has the advantage of offering the possibility of local assistance in the event of a problem, passengers do not seem to be rushing to use this latest technology, because of its similarity to a traditional check-in kiosk.</p>



<p>However, the results of these remote check-in pilot projects will not hinder their development. As further trials are implemented, the benefits of biometric boarding will become increasingly clear to all parties involved, and at every stage of the passenger journey through an airport.</p>



<p>Staff shortages at check-in counters and baggage depots will be alleviated, and passengers will no longer be forced to queue.</p>



 Biometric control and digital identity: What are the prospects for travelers? 



<p>In the future, frequent travelers will be able to take advantage of a European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) containing all their personal data, including biometric data, which they will be able to use on every flight, eliminating the need to manually enter their personal details every time they fly. This wallet will enable everyone to store and manage their electronic credentials in one place (directly on their smartphone), all securely and transparently.</p>



<p>The use of biometric technology in the aviation sector has considerable potential, and airlines and airports are undoubtedly open to it as they see the results. Commercial aviation, like the mobility and tourism sectors in general, is undoubtedly undergoing a revolution that should not be missed.</p>

<p>There was once a day and age when castles and moats were considered cutting-edge defense strategies. Now, in our digital and cloud-first world, it’s safe to say that times have changed.</p>
<p>And yet, perimeter-based cybersecurity policies are still the status quo for many organizations. Why? Because they work — at least, they did until recently.</p>
<p>The truth is that traditional data security doesn’t suffice in today’s increasingly complex environment. Enterprises are facing an unprecedented array of threats, all chomping at the bit to get ahold of sensitive data. Fortunately, that’s where a Zero Trust architecture comes into play.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the value of Zero Trust security and how it can help you safeguard company assets. From its principles and components to the steps involved in the process, you’ll learn how to start implementing Zero Trust and protecting your business from its dynamic threat landscape.</p>
 Understanding Zero Trust 
<p>Security teams are excited about the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust framework</a>, and for good reason. With its fresh approach to strong authentication and access control, it’s poised to usher in a major paradigm shift when it comes to cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the ins and outs of Zero Trust architecture and why it should become a tentpole of your enterprise security policy.</p>
 What is Zero Trust? 
<p>John Kindervag, a former Forrester analyst, <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/No-More-Chewy-Centers-The-Zero-Trust-Model-Of-Information-Security/RES56682">coined the term</a> “Zero Trust” in 2010. Originally, the concept was specific to network protection, but has since evolved to encompass everything from endpoint to cloud security.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-definition-of-modern-zero-trust/">Forrester defines</a> the Zero Trust model as a data security policy that denies the user access to applications and network resources by default. It eliminates implicit trust and acknowledges that threats exist both inside and outside traditional boundaries.</p>
<p>In other words, Zero Trust security takes a guilty-until-proven-innocent approach. Rather than blindly assuming certain users are always safe, it ensures all identities are validated before granting access to company assets. Additionally, it takes a hard stance against implicit trust by continuously requiring users to authenticate themselves, even after they already have.</p>
<p>When it comes to understanding what Zero Trust is, it also helps to clarify exactly what it isn’t. More specifically, implementing Zero Trust isn’t as simple as a single solution or cybersecurity platform. It requires a layered, multi-faceted foundation of technologies and policies. With these in place, you can continuously build upon and strengthen an evolving Zero Trust architecture.</p>
 Why is Zero Trust important? 
<p>It’s an open secret that cybercrime is running rampant across the globe. In fact, a <a href="https://surfshark.com/research/data-breach-impact/statistics">recent Surfshark report</a> revealed that the online crime victim count has increased 16 times since 2001. Financial losses have grown over 570 times during the same period, now costing the world $1 million per hour.</p>
<p>With a growing swarm of attack strategies at their disposal, bad actors are targeting sensitive data like never before. These sophisticated tactics include (but aren’t limited to):</p>
 
 Malware 
 Ransomware 
 Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks 
 Phishing 
 Zero-day strikes 
 Structured query language (SQL) injections 
 Cryptojacking 
 
<p>Worse yet, security teams are encountering these threats at a greater volume and velocity than they’re able to manage. Why? Because their organization’s attack surface has expanded exponentially. Let’s consider the numbers:</p>
 
 Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the vast majority of enterprises have implemented flexible work models. Globally, about <a href="https://www.ifebp.org/store/employee-benefits-survey/Pages/default.aspx">75% of businesses</a> offer some form of hybrid work arrangement, many with a Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policy. That means employees are accessing network resources on unmanaged devices that the security team can’t protect. 
 And, to accommodate these policies and stay productive, even more organizations are investing in cloud services. According to McKinsey, many large enterprises aspire to have <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/projecting-the-global-value-of-cloud-3-trillion-is-up-for-grabs-for-companies-that-go-beyond-adoption">at least 60%</a> of their environment in the cloud by 2025. 
 
<p>In short, these factors are converging to create an expansive (and largely unprotected) attack surface. Each application, device, and network is an entry point hackers can exploit to their advantage.</p>
<p>To make matters even more complicated, many enterprises are still relying on outdated, legacy cybersecurity strategies. Per IBM’s research, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ">almost 60% of organizations</a> don’t have a Zero Trust security model. However, on average, those that do&nbsp;leverage Zero Trust save $1 million in data breach costs per incident.</p>
 Zero Trust vs. Traditional security models 
<p>Standard data security policies are based on the assumption that everything happening inside the network perimeter is inherently trusted. They’re developed to protect against external threats — not necessarily those that originate from within.</p>
 Traditional security 
<p>The main principle behind traditional security is the castle-and-moat analogy. The idea is simple: Keeping bad actors out will ensure any and all assets inside the perimeter remain safe. So, people must first cross the moat (i.e., your firewall) to access the castle (your network). Once they’re checked at the perimeter, they’re allowed to continue as they please.</p>
<p>But what happens when someone isn’t who they seem? What if a hacker gets their hands on someone’s login credentials? In this case, they’re free to roam about and access information at their convenience. Oftentimes, they can do so undetected, as they appear to be a legitimate user. And, as they do, bad actors are even taking the time to harvest encrypted data with hopes of cracking it at a later date with the help of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/post-quantum-cryptography">powerful quantum computing</a>.</p>
<p>According to IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">2023 Cost of a Data Breach report</a>, compromised or stolen credentials are the two most common initial attack vectors, responsible for 16% and 15% of breaches, respectively. Worse yet, it takes organizations, on average, about 10 months to identify and contain these types of attacks. This means, more likely than not, an ongoing data breach could be happening right under your nose.</p>
<p>This threat underscores the inherent risk created by the typical username-and-password posture. Recognizing as much, many Zero Trust enterprises are adopting <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passwordless-login">passwordless security policies</a> and certificate-based authentication procedures as a safer alternative.</p>
<p>Additionally, given the fluid nature of cloud services and how they can span many locations and providers, perimeter-based defenses simply don’t provide adequate cloud security. Employees can access resources on any number of unmanaged devices, making it inherently difficult to enforce consistent security policies across the enterprise. All things considered, it’s no surprise that 82% of breaches in 2022 involved public, private, and multi-cloud environments.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Traditional frameworks are no longer sufficient, as attackers can easily bypass defenses and gain unfettered access to critical information.</p>
 Zero Trust security 
<p>In contrast, the Zero Trust security model is designed to prevent unauthorized network and cloud application access. It requires users and devices to authenticate themselves continuously regardless of identity or location. This ensures that only verified, legitimate users can access information.</p>
<p>Overall, deploying a Zero Trust architecture has a number of tangible benefits, including:</p>
 
 Enhanced data security: Zero Trust’s continuous monitoring and verification allow you to enforce security policies at scale, no matter how the user access request originates. It ensures all users, devices, and applications are authenticated beforehand, thereby mitigating the risk of untrusted connections. 
 
 
 Greater visibility: It’s difficult to keep tabs on a cloud-first environment. Luckily, Zero Trust security offers an unparalleled line of sight into the network, allowing you to spot suspicious activity from miles away. With granular control, you can ensure security operations are performing at their best. 
 
 
 Increased scalability: Rapidly growing businesses are adopting new cloud technologies at an accelerated rate. Network security tools have difficulty scaling at pace, but a cloud-based Zero Trust model can flex to meet your changing needs. That way, you can confidently expand your tech stack without jeopardizing sensitive data. 
 
 
 Seamless user experience: Zero Trust empowers you to offer employees secure access to critical resources without hindering their productivity. Security measures work in the background, meaning that although identities are constantly verified, there’s no impact on the user experience. 
 
 
 Improved risk mitigation: The Zero Trust model aims to close security gaps and prevent lateral network movement. That means it not only augments your security team, but also enhances their risk management skills through robust capabilities and proactive policy enforcement. 
 
 
 Reduced attack surface: In contrast to traditional approaches, Zero Trust adequately defends against a wide variety of risk factors, including ransomware, malware, phishing, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). 
 
<p>That’s what you stand to gain from implementing Zero Trust. Now, let’s break down the security model and get to know the building blocks of the Zero Trust framework.</p>
 A closer look at Zero Trust architecture 
<p>The Zero Trust Maturity Model is built upon three foundational principles and five core pillars. When used in combination, they empower organizations to strengthen their cybersecurity posture and eliminate implicit trust from top to bottom.</p>
 Zero Trust principles 
<p>Based on the concept of “never trust, always verify,” the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/a-zero-trust-framework-for-the-new-hybrid-workforce/">Zero Trust framework</a> operates on three fundamental tenets:</p>
 
 Explicit verification: Organizations must establish trusted identities through strong authentication and continuous authorization. This includes evaluating context-aware risk signals and user behavior for suspicious activity, thereby verifying the entity requesting access is actually who they claim to be and has the right to do so. 
 
 
 Least-privilege access: Because credentials are often the root cause of a breach, businesses must limit access based on user roles and responsibilities. In simple terms, this Zero Trust principle ensures that employees can only access resources essential to their job — no more, no less. 
 
 
 Assume breach: The Zero Trust framework underscores the notion that breaches are inevitable. So, it’s critical for organizations to minimize the blast radius during an ongoing attack through various methods, such as microsegmentations, encryption, and so on. 
 
<p>With these three concepts in mind, remember that Zero Trust is more of an enterprise-wide strategy than it is a single solution. As the sum of its parts, an effective architecture requires a cohesive effort from all stakeholders, tools, and processes. According to the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a>, security teams can best strengthen their posture by focusing on five distinct pillars:</p>
 
 Identity: As with any cybersecurity strategy, an organization’s people are at its center. It should ensure every user has access to the right resources without granting excessive permissions. In an optimal environment, a user’s identity is constantly verified. 
 
 
 Devices: Any hardware or virtual asset that connects to the network is an entry point and can be used to infect the network with malware and other malicious threats. This pillar addresses device tracking and management and how users operate them according to rules and procedures. 
 
 
 Networks: Ideally, organizations adopt micro-parameters that prevent lateral movement and enable early threat detection. Isolating network resources can stop bad actors from accessing them, thus greatly reducing the potential blast radius. 
 
 
 Applications &amp; Workloads: This pillar refers to cloud-based resources and processes used by an organization for operational purposes. Security measures aim to protect assets and prevent unauthorized access or tampering with sensitive cloud services. 
 
 
 Data: Categorizing and classifying corporate data allows it to be isolated from all but those who need constant access. This pillar also includes the process of encrypting data at rest, in movement, and use. 
 
 Implementing Zero Trust 
<p>By now, it’s clear that the Zero Trust architecture is well worth the effort. However, it’s wise to understand the roadblocks you might encounter along the way.</p>
 Challenges of Zero Trust implementation 
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/06/achieving-zero-trust-that-works/">achieving Zero Trust</a> maturity isn’t an overnight process. More often than not, implementing Zero Trust is a multi-year journey — one that won’t always be easy to navigate. Knowing how to steer your business in the right direction effectively requires an understanding of the obstacles in your path. These most often include:</p>
 
 Complexity: Organizations may have a tough time if their IT infrastructure consists of many interconnected and distributed systems. You may have hundreds of databases, servers, and third-party applications that need consideration. 
 
 
 Cost: Implementing Zero Trust can be expensive, especially if you’re transitioning from legacy technologies. You may have to replace old hardware and deploy new solutions, which can mean a long-term, multi-phase rollout process. 
 
 
 Legacy systems: Another challenge of having dated solutions is that they’re designed specifically for implicit trust. It may be hard to configure legacy tools in a way that aligns with Zero Trust principles. 
 Stakeholder buy-in: Key stakeholders must sign off on the transition; otherwise, you won’t have the resources to get the job done right. Leaders may not always see the value in Zero Trust right away. One way to circumvent this issue is to communicate the cost of security in terms they’ll best understand: the bottom line. 
 
 Steps in the Zero Trust journey 
<p>Not sure how to get started? Don’t worry — we have you covered. Here’s a breakdown of the most critical steps you need to take as you implement a Zero Trust architecture:</p>
 
 Evaluate vulnerabilities: It’s best to assess the environment before getting ahead of yourself. Take a comprehensive inventory of devices, users, applications, and accounts that have access to your network. This helps you pinpoint vulnerabilities and determine key network flows. 
 
 
 Identify the protect surface: The “protect surface” refers to everything that must be shielded from harm. That includes sensitive data, critical assets, cloud services, and internal applications. 
 
 
 Strengthen access control: It’s not enough to implement strict policies. You should support them with specific technologies, such as phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) and risk-based adaptive verification, which make it harder for bad actors to bypass defenses even if they’ve stolen credentials. 
 
 
 Segment the network: Microsegmentation is a process of creating smaller, more secure network areas. These micro-perimeters limit the spread of a data breach and make it easier to contain the incident. 
 
 
 Practice continuous monitoring: Keep an eye on network traffic and user activity so that you can spot risks in real-time. More importantly, continue to strengthen security operations over time, as Zero Trust is an iterative process that demands dynamic enforcement.

<p>As a security professional, you understand protecting your customers and their data is critical. Customers want to trust that as a vendor, you’ve taken the appropriate precautions to ensure a secure digital experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me log in, look at my stuff, and transact, but keep others away from my account, especially those fraudsters. While you’re at it, please make it convenient as well. And then there’s the aspect of storing personal customer data, which is often like gold, oil, or maybe lithium—it's valuable and can make or break a business. It drives an organization’s product development plans and future revenue. If you don’t know your customers, then you’ll likely build a less desirable product. So organizations try to collect as much customer data as possible, but it must be well protected once collected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our digital world, your customers' primary interaction with your brand is through your website or app. With more digital interactions than ever before, you need to make gaining access as secure and seamless as possible, which most often requires a username and password. And don’t forget about registration. If it’s a prospect, you’ll want to make a good first impression. Passwords and lack of real-time threat signals are the #1 security threat to organizations today and are prime targets in cyberattacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Did you know? 
<p><a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/2016/">86% of breaches involve the use of stolen credentials (VZ)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, it's all about keeping your customers' sensitive info safe and sound. We're talking personal details, financial records, and transaction history. By locking down that data, you prevent the bad guys from pulling off identity theft, fraud, and sneaky unauthorized access. The goal is to prevent any data breaches or at least quickly identify any possible security concerns. Otherwise, you’ll incur big costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Did you know? 
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OJDVQGRY">$150 is the average cost per lost or stolen record (IBM)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that's not all. When you go the extra mile to protect consumer data, you're showing them that you're the real deal—a company they can trust. You become their go-to when it comes to privacy and ethical practices. And that trust goes a long way in building customer loyalty and boosting your brand reputation. People want to do business with companies that take their privacy seriously. Essentially, just common courtesy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and let's not forget about the legal side of things. Protecting customer data is not just a good idea–it's the law. You have to stay compliant with data protection regulations, or you could be facing some hefty fines and legal troubles. So, by putting customer data protection at the top of your priority list, you're not just doing the right thing—you're also reducing major risks to your business.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Greetings! At the recent Microsoft Secure event, we provided an early look at a new feature of conditional access which lets you strictly enforce location policies with continuous access evaluation (CAE), allowing you to rapidly invalidate tokens which violate your IP based location policies. Today, we’re delighted to announce this feature is in public preview. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, in the event of an access token theft, attackers could take advantage of the refresh interval to replay the token, regardless of whether it fell outside the location range permitted by a conditional access policy. With our ability to strictly enforce location policies and CAE, CAE enabled applications like Exchange Online, SharePoint, Teams, and Microsoft Graph can now revoke tokens in near real-time in response to network change events noticed by the app – preventing stolen tokens from being replayed outside the trusted network. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a client’s access to a resource is blocked due to CAE’s strictly enforce location policies being triggered, the client will be blocked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Here’s a brief overview of how you can enable this capability&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling Strict Location Enforcement:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before turning on strictly enforce location policies in CA you must ensure that all IP addresses from which your users can access Microsoft Entra ID and resource providers are included in the IP-based named locations policy. Otherwise, you may accidentally block your users. You can use the CAE Workbook or Sign-in logs to determine which IP addresses are seen by CAE resource providers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAE Workbook:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign-in Logs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, notice that the column “IP address” refers to “IP (seen by Azure)” versus “IP address (seen by resource).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While troubleshooting and testing how to configure your strictly enforce location policies, use the filter “IP (seen by resource)” to find scenarios where strictly enforce location policies could be blocking users with an unallowed IP seen by the CAE resource provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strictly enforce location policies is a step forward for session management. As you enable this feature, carefully consider including safe and trusted IP addresses from which your users access Microsoft Entra ID and resource providers to avoid unintentional blocks by leveraging the CAE Workbook and Sign-in logs for precise configuration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the rise of Web3, there is a renewed interest in the benefits of distributed systems. Distributed systems are scalable, fault-tolerant, cost-effective, and used to power blockchains, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, social media networks, and more. &nbsp;</p><p>But are all distributed systems truly decentralized? When it comes to authorizing users, the answer isn't always yes. Blockchains, for example, use cryptographic key signatures to provide access to resources. But what about non-blockchain examples? </p><p>If any server instances in a network are using an access control list (ACL), they are not fully decentralized. &nbsp;</p><p>So how do we handle authorization in a distributed system?</p> What is a UCAN? <p>In 2019, Fission's co-founder and CTO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a>, created the UCAN. <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec">UCAN stands for User-Controlled Authorization Network</a>. It is a user-originated authorization and revocation scheme that is trustless and secure, with no ACL required. UCANs provide public-key verifiable, delegable, expressive, and openly extensible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">capabilities</a> by extending the familiar <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519">JWT</a> structure. </p> How Do UCANs Work? <p>There are three main parts of a UCAN: Header, Payload, and Signature. </p>Source: Brooklyn Zelenka's IPFS Thing 2023 Presentation: UCAN Decentralizing Auth<p>Header</p><p>The Header is a standard JWT header. It includes the algorithm (EdDSA) used to sign the UCAN.</p><p>Payload</p><p>The Payload includes a Decentralized Identifier or DID, the period during which the UCAN is valid, the capabilities (what the receiver of the UCAN, or audience, is allowed to do), and embedded encoded UCANs used as proofs for delegated capabilities. &nbsp;</p><p>It's important to understand capabilities, as they are at the heart of the UCAN token. Below is the anatomy of a capability:</p> <code>{ $RESOURCE: { $ABILITY: [ ...$CAVEATS ] } }</code> <p>A resource is a unique URI whose associated abilities include what the UCAN receiver can or cannot do, like send a message "msg/send". &nbsp;The issuer or delegator may also include caveats only if the eventual invocation can read them.</p><p>Signature</p><p>The Signature (which must match the DID in the issuer) denotes the validity of the UCAN.</p> Authority in a Distributed System <p>To authorize a user, there must be some authority that can approve them to carry out various tasks. In the case of UCANs, the set of capabilities delegated by the UCAN is its authority. Furthermore, except for <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec#64-rights-amplification">rights amplification</a>, every unique delegation MUST have equal or narrower capabilities from their delegator. This also controls the flow of authority in the system.</p> The Lifecycle of a UCAN <p>After the UCAN is generated, there are a few ways it can be managed. &nbsp;</p><p>Delegation</p><p>The UCAN holder can delegate the capability to use a resource they have. A proof acts as authorization. Proofs are either the owner's signature or a UCAN with access to that capability in its authority. In other words, another user who has been delegated access to a resource by a UCAN can, in turn, delegate that resource to someone else. </p><p>Invocation</p><p>An important note is that delegation is a separate concept from <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/invocation">invocation</a>. Delegation is the act of granting a capability to another, not the act of using it. UCAN invocation defines a standard for authorizing, chaining, and executing compute tasks. In addition, invocation lays out the format for completed receipts (proof that the computation was completed and what the result was) and how to optimize and resolve inputs for correlated computation tasks.</p><p>Attenuation</p><p>Attenuation is the process of constraining the capabilities in a delegation chain. It checks that the claimed capabilities match the proofs.</p><p>Revocation</p><p>Revocation invalidates a UCAN after the fact, outside of the limitations placed on it by the UCAN's fields (such as its expiry). This must be done by a proof's issuer.</p> Use Cases <p>We've reviewed how UCANs function, and now let's consider some exciting use cases.</p><p>1- Authorized Data Retrieval</p><p>UCANs offer a secure way to ensure files are only accessible by authorized users. Fission's <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD SDK</a> uses UCANs to manage access to files in <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a>-enabled apps.</p><p>2- App Write Access</p><p><a href="https://fission.codes/blog/capyloon/">Capyloon</a>, a resurrected version of Firefox OS, allows users to locally create DIDs and use them to grant capabilities to 3rd party websites through UCAN tokens, allowing selective access to device resources.</p><p>3- Fediverse</p><p>Federated social media accounts distribute control and data across multiple independent servers or instances. UCANs offer a way to handle account authorization so the server administrator doesn't have access to participant credentials but can still revoke access as needed.</p><p>4- Internet of Things </p><p>Computing at the edge requires fast processing and minimal friction. IoT devices need to be able to work even with intermittent Internet access. Since UCANs include the necessary authorization proofs, they can be used to keep the process moving without delay.</p> UCANs Today <p>UCAN is an open-source protocol and has stabilized at 0.10.0! As you can see, it's already gaining adoption in the DWeb community. There are Rust, TypeScript, and IPLD libraries, and other implementations are underway. There is also a Go library that needs a maintainer. </p><p>If you're interested in learning more about UCANs, or getting involved as a collaborator, we encourage you to check out the following resources: </p><p><a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">GitHub</a> - includes the spec and UCAN working group</p><p><a href="https://lu.ma/ucan">Community Calls</a> - we host public calls every month and discuss improvements to the protocol</p><p><a href="https://ucan.xyz/">Community Website</a> - use the UCAN validator to break down the parts of the UCAN, read blog posts, watch talks, and even play games all focused on UCAN education</p>

  <p>Most enterprises today run hybrid IT environments. They store some data and applications locally in the data center and run others in multiple clouds, and their employees use both managed and unmanaged devices over various networks. With such complexity — and so much at stake — identity and access management (IAM) is more important than ever.</p>
	
<p>But relying on disparate IAM systems creates identity silos and with them a multitude of problems. Identity silos prevent sufficient IT visibility into all the apps and systems in operation and open the door to shadow IT. Silos create inefficiencies, redundancies, and, worst of all, the possibility of damaging and costly breaches.</p>
	
<p>Enterprises need a robust and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">unified IAM platform</a> that enables them to secure every identity and manage access privileges centrally. This is particularly true in light of the fact that identities remain the prime target of cyberattacks. With a single compromised identity, entire networks can be infiltrated and sensitive data can be exposed, stolen, or held for ransom.</p>
	
 What are identity silos? 
	
<p>Siloed identity and access management (IAM) happens when people use different systems that cannot properly communicate with one another. Siloed IAM's symptoms include inconsistent access controls, limited visibility, and manual storage provisioning.</p>
	
<p>Identity silos are common given how many different programs companies will utilize. Siloing leaves identities fragmented across the platforms people use, without any standard for access rights or user permissions. This fragmentation creates the perfect environment for social engineering and other potentially harmful situations.</p>
	
 The causes of identity silos 
	
<p>Identity silos are sometimes caused by employees using programs without informing IT. In other cases, they occur simply because an IT department doesn't request visibility into the systems people use.</p>

<p>Here are a few other causes of identity siloing:</p>

  Mergers and acquisitions: A company that merges with another company will often inherit disparate systems. These systems have their own identities, user licenses, and access permissions. 
   Departmental independence: In many cases, company departments operate independently. These conditions can naturally lead to identity silos over time, particularly when people in different departments begin using the same platform. 
   Legacy systems: IT departments often face <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ibmsecurity/2020/04/22/legacy-technology-could-prove-a-problem-for-remote-working/">challenges when securing older systems</a>. These challenges often prevent IT departments from fully unifying user identities across different systems.&nbsp; 
 <p>Many companies are already taking steps to control identity silos and prevent future occurrences. These steps begin with an IAM strategy, one that helps identify where a company's disparate identities come from.</p>
	
 Identifying and understanding your identity silos 
	
<p>An IAM assessment can provide valuable information for identifying and solving identity problems across the company. Here are a few steps companies should take to fully understand their identity silos:</p>

  Complete a comprehensive IAM assessment 
   Identify identity silos by performing network audits and interviewing employees to create a comprehensive list of programs and access rights 
   Diagnose root causes for identity problems by analyzing the history of your company's technology usage habits 
   Implement a restorative IAM policy that educates all employees on proper technology usage and compliance strategies 
 <p>Understanding identity silos helps educate employees and prevent dissociated identities. It also helps centralize departments' efforts to improve efficiency, since each department will be unified with the same programs and usage rights.</p>
	
 The impacts of identity silos on companies 
	
<p>Identity silos represent fragments in your company's strategy. They leave your organization vulnerable to wasted company resources, miscommunication, and serious security concerns.</p>
	
 Wastes company resources 
	
<p>Enterprise software almost invariably requires user authentication, but fragmented identity management creates a range of problems. For example, access rights should be terminated when an employee leaves a company. But without centralized management, that license could remain active and cost the company money. Furthermore, former employees may retain access to sensitive company information.</p>
	
 Limits the view of company data 
	
<p>Identity silos can limit IT's perspective on enterprise-wide information. For example, legacy systems in a domain controller, cloud application, or business unit often do not share information. This makes it challenging to understand who can access certain data points and sources.</p>

<p>This situation is common for companies that only partially migrate their data to the cloud. While one department might store files on local servers, another might store data in a public or private cloud. Because neither department has access to the other's files, they are limited in their ability to use information effectively. This can also lead to trouble with breach vector identification, both in disaster recovery planning and in the event of an actual breach.</p>
	
 Reduces cost efficiency 
	
<p>While siloed IAM can improve operational efficiency by consolidating disparate systems, it can be expensive to keep more specialists on staff to manage identities for different systems.</p>

<p>In some cases, departments like HR, sales, and marketing set up their own user profiles, access permissions, and rights without oversight from IT. For example, a sales representative who needs access to payroll information must request it from HR. HR will often require a complicated, time-consuming data request process before they provide access.</p>
	
 Raises security concerns 
	
<p>Perhaps most importantly, identity silos can leave companies vulnerable to security threats. Isolated permissions make it more difficult for IT to reserve access only for authorized users.</p>

<p>Siloed IAM can also delay a company's response to a data breach. Companies sometimes require time to sort out access permissions and identify the source of an issue. This delay creates a window of opportunity for hackers to steal identities and further compromise a network.</p>
	
 How to dissolve your company's identity silos 
	
<p>A comprehensive IAM roadmap is a great first step in dissolving your company's identity silos. This means identifying silos, understanding where they come from, and taking steps to eliminate them. It involves changing how access permissions are managed across your organization. You might also consider automated solutions that make it easier to protect users and platforms.</p>

 Change management 

<p>Change management should be a primary phase of your IAM roadmap. It means ensuring proper guidance, implementation, and resolution of projects that ensure all access permissions are centralized and appropriately transparent.</p>

<p>Change management also ensures that the right digital assets are protected while others are cleaned up and purged. Protecting digital assets is a difficult undertaking, especially for established organizations with large data libraries. Indeed, the process of dissolving identity siloes and preserving the right information is not dissimilar to protecting digital data following a business split-up. This is a multi-step process that typically involves:</p>

  Performing a data inventory check 
   Developing a plan to transfer data to more secure, compliant programs 
   Coordinating with the management team to ensure you share the same security strategies and priorities 
   Encrypting or re-encrypting sensitive information 
   Monitoring data before, during, and after the transfer process 
 <p>These steps help companies of all sizes end identity silos and maintain security as leadership responsibilities change hands.</p>

 Data-sharing solutions 

<p>Data-sharing strategies can also help your organization dissolve identity silos. These solutions streamline the data-sharing process, upholding security while making it easier for employees to access the right programs and information.</p>

<p>Here are some data-sharing solutions that can help:</p>

  <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/iam-101-series-federation-and-federated-sso">Identity federation</a>: This solution links your identities across several disparate systems. It gives multiple employees, even multiple companies, the ability to access programs with a single login credential. 
   <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">Single sign-on (SSO)</a>: SSO allows employees to log into multiple programs or platforms with a single username and password. 
 <p>The right solutions promote data-sharing and give the right people access to the right files. They also prevent unauthorized permissions and create centralized management for all identities.</p>

 Implementing automated solutions 

<p>Automation can go a long way in streamlining the IAM process and preventing silos. It helps improve efficiency across employees while reducing the possibility of error. The same automation solutions can also provide proactive security that monitors for cyberthreats.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Automated identity governance</a>, for example, enables IT admins to see who has access to what, enterprise-wide, and eliminate over-provisioning by automating access approvals and reviews. It also allows them to collect and analyze identity data and identify access blind spots.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-driven threat protection</a> automatically monitors login requests in real time, blocking malicious attempts and adding authentication steps when it detects anomalous behaviors.</p>

<p>And a comprehensive, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">scalable IAM platform</a> unifies and centralizes identity across the enterprise, including on-prem, multi-cloud, or hybrid. It also covers all users – <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/CIAM">customers</a>, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">machine identities</a> – to end silos and create a more unified and secure organization.</p>

 Permissioned Tokens: The Key to Interoperable Distribution 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in July 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>While the blockchain narrative fundamentally revolves around decentralization and empowerment of the individual, the realities of&nbsp;dealing with real-world assets and securities introduce a layer of complexity.</p>
<p>Particularly in financial markets – a heavily regulated industry due to the high risks involved – there are stringent guidelines and regulations that ensure the protection of all stakeholders.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, we efficiently navigate these two critical aspects – the vast potential of open blockchain infrastructure and the intricate details of securities laws. Our comprehension of these dual facets has led to the creation of&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_cA7eWEY0JKUdPoNuPKKOjDXK7AKN3i1R-qr0x0pA8MjJuZr6-TWMdHTBg8O9JJcLrbVaY">T-REX</a>, a platform designed to ensure compliant participation in this fast-evolving space.</p>
<p>Liquidity is one of the most enticing features that blockchain offers, prompting issuers to tokenize their assets. However, it’s essential to understand that tokenization alone doesn’t spontaneously generate healthy liquidity. The main takeaway is that&nbsp;while tokenization itself doesn’t guarantee liquidity, the opportunities provided by blockchain technology certainly&nbsp;can.</p>
<p>We at Tokeny are on a mission to create an open, standardized platform that will become&nbsp;the&nbsp;launchpad for highly-functional digital securities, offering the&nbsp;largest catalog of liquidity solutions for compliant security tokens.</p>
<p>In order to leverage a global ecosystem of liquidity providers to its fullest potential, several foundational activities should be performed:</p>
 
 Tokenize the asset on an EVM-compatible blockchain network and the ERC3643 standard. These are the main technical components used by the&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/dino/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_cA7eWEY0JKUdPoNuPKKOjDXK7AKN3i1R-qr0x0pA8MjJuZr6-TWMdHTBg8O9JJcLrbVaY">DINO</a>&nbsp;distribution network; 
 &nbsp;Encoding compliance rules in the token smart contracts to track ownership and eligibility of investors; 
 &nbsp;Embedding asset data, mostly valuation data, which serve as reference points for price discovery and asset credibility on trading venues. 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Once these key steps (issuance, compliance, and data) are taken, the tokenized assets may be “published” to the network and made available for any trading venue of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The necessary infrastructure, including compliance and data, is already in place thanks to the blockchain and the built-in features of the tokens.&nbsp;Only the discoverability is missing: This is the role of distributors and trading venues in a DLT-based financial system.</p>
<p>As an issuer, you now have the capability to increase the visibility and distribution of your securities through all ERC3643 compatible liquidity solutions. This, of course, is assuming that your use of these solutions is legally permitted.</p>
<p>Moreover, as your assets are tokenized, our platform also provides significant benefits with its&nbsp;automatic cap table updates&nbsp;for each transaction, no matter its origin.</p>
<p>For example, an issuer might list their token on both a South Korean centralized exchange and a decentralized exchange like Uniswap. All of these transactions will be settled on-chain and accurately recorded on their DLT-based cap table. They can then easily access this data through Tokeny’s T-REX platform since every transaction happens on the same shared IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>Tokenizing an asset enables the centralization of all the trading activity of the asset in a single ledger accessible by all authorized trading venues and distributors.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of the types of liquidity solutions an issuer has at their disposal:</p>
 
 Digital Trading Desks/Bulletin Boards:
 
 With our<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_cA7eWEY0JKUdPoNuPKKOjDXK7AKN3i1R-qr0x0pA8MjJuZr6-TWMdHTBg8O9JJcLrbVaY">&nbsp;‘Billboard’</a>&nbsp;solution, issuers enable investors to post buy or sell intentions for shares. Interested parties can accept and execute trades securely on the blockchain, with no counterparty risk, thanks to atomic swaps. 
 These bulletin boards are accessible on the investor portal of the token and/or on any digital asset marketplace(s) proposing these tokens to their audience of investors. 
 
 
 Regulated/Centralized Exchanges:
 
 Issuers can also enable their token to be traded on a regulated trading venue, which has the legal approval to operate with digital securities; however, it’s important to note these platforms are still very much the legacy infrastructure and are, in most cases, still restricted to utilizing off-chain order books and settlements. 
 
 
 Decentralized Exchanges:
 
 Like Uniswap or Quickswap you can use an automated market maker (AMM) to execute a trade without a counterparty via liquidity pools. 
 An Automated Market Maker (AMM) like Uniswap allows users to trade directly with a pool of funds (called a liquidity pool) rather than another person. 
 This is possible because other users deposit, or ‘stake’, their tokens into these pools and earn fees in return. So, if Investor A wants to swap their Security B for Stablecoin C, they can do so instantly, as long as both tokens are in the same pool. 
 
 
 DeFi Protocols:
 
 &nbsp;Investors can leverage and collateralize these highly-functional securities via DeFi protocols while retaining ownership. This enables seamless deposits and withdrawals, and guarantees lenders thanks to auto-liquidation systems. 
 
 
 
<p>As you can clearly understand now, liquidity is the holy grail of asset tokenization. In order to achieve healthy and sustainable liquidity, using a powerful token standard, enriching tokens with compliance rules and data, and having accessibility to a network of distribution providers are all integral components.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Viky Manaila and I did a podcast earlier in 2023 on everything that is happening in Europe that pertains to digital identity (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet/">Episode #51</a>). It was a very popular episode and so it felt like it was a topic that was worth exploring a bit more. So for a follow up, André Kudra and I decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>The European Union is currently witnessing a significant momentum in digital identity, with three parallel efforts underway (not forgetting the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scytales-ab-together-with-netcompany-intrasoft-wins-landmark-eu-digital-wallet-contract-301694498.html">open source wallet project</a> that the EU is funding): the new eIDAS 2.0 regulation, the EU Digital Wallet architecture reference framework, and four large-scale pilots.</p>
 
 The <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a> 1.0 regulation was a stepping stone towards an interoperable government-issued electronic identity for EU citizens. However, its implementation varied across member states, leading to a lack of uniformity and success. Now, the EU is moving towards eIDAS 2.0, which aims to correct the shortcomings of its predecessor and further digitalize identity systems. Viky had done a fantastic job in <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet/">Part 1</a> describing eIDAS and its evolution. 
 The <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/releases/tag/v1.1.0">EU Digital Wallet Architecture Reference Framework (ARF)</a> is an extension of eIDAS 2.0. It aims to make technology implementation more prescriptive, thereby facilitating adoption and interoperability. The wallet is expected to close the gap in digitalization, providing a reliable, strong, and widely accessible electronic identity. It will also extend the digital identity-based ecosystem to include other data items associated with an individual, such as diplomas, driver’s licenses, and more. 
 The Four Large-scale Pilots (LSPs) running in parallel with these efforts are expected to provide valuable insights into the practical implementation of these systems. They will help in addressing the technical and use case-driven aspects of the EU Digital Wallet and eIDAS 2.0. The pilots include, <a href="https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/">POTENTIAL for Digital Europe</a> – 148 participants from 19 EU states, invests 60+ mn € for 6 use cases – various use cases such as electronic registration, account opening, electronic driving licences, and electronic prescriptions; <a href="https://www.nobidconsortium.com/">NOBID Consortium of Nordic and Baltic countries+</a> – Payment focus, payment means by financial institutions &amp; retail payments; <a href="https://dc4eu.eu/">DC4EU – Digital Credentials for Europe</a> –&nbsp; Educational credentials, professional qualifications and Social Security; and <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EWC – EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium</a> –&nbsp; Cross-border Digital Travel Credentials and Organizational Digital Identities. 
 
<p>Existing digital ID systems in countries like Italy, Estonia, and Belgium are expected to transition to support eIDAS 2.0. These systems, which already have a critical mass of users, will likely layer the EU Digital Wallet ecosystem on top of their existing infrastructure. This approach will ensure that the benefits of the current systems are not lost during the transition.</p>
<p>However, several aspects still need clarification, such as the implementation of verifiable data registries, the security requirements of an individual identity wallet, and the management of trust lists. The large-scale pilots and ongoing work on the architecture reference framework are expected to provide answers to these questions.</p>
<p>The momentum in the digital identity space in Europe is indeed exciting. With the new eIDAS 2.0 regulation, the EU Digital Wallet, and the large-scale pilots, the EU is paving the way for a new era of digital identity. This progress is expected to significantly enhance digitalization processes, making them more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between André and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Success of eIDAS 1.0 and the Purpose of eIDAS 2.0 – whether eIDAS 1.0 was successful in enabling digital ID systems and what eIDAS 2.0 aims to correct. 
 eIDAS 2.0 and Interoperability – does eIDAS 2.0 aims to improve interoperability and technology adoption, and is the EU digital ID wallet architecture reference framework (ARF) an extension of this effort? 
 Future of Existing EU-based Digital ID Systems – what will happen to existing digital ID systems like those in Italy and Estonia, and whether they will transition to support eIDAS 2.0 or need to build a second system. 
 Importance of Identity Proofing Uniformity – the importance of uniformity in identity proofing processes across nation states and whether this has been a contentious topic under previous eIDAS legislation. 
 Prescriptive Governance and Technology Recommendations – if it’s better for the ecosystem to have more prescriptive governance and whether the technology recommendations are too prescriptive or not enough. 
 Key Decisions in the ARF Document – the key decisions made in the RF document and what was left unclear. 
 Negative Sentiment Around Blockchains or DLTs – why there might be a negative sentiment around blockchains or DLTs in the digital identity space. 
 Separation of Aries from the Hyperledger Foundation – would it make sense for Aries to be separated from the Hyperledger Foundation given its potential as an open agent. 
 EU’s Four Large-Scale Pilots – updates on the different large-scale pilots and their impact on technical and governance specifications. 
 Learnings from Large-Scale Pilots –&nbsp; learnings from the large-scale pilots, particularly from non-government bodies, and whether there’s a shift in mentality among these entities around digital credentials.

<p>Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) is a collection of security tools and practices for monitoring, identifying, and responding to identity-related cybersecurity threats. ITDR solutions can encompass straightforward security measures, risk assessment and management, machine learning algorithms, and comprehensive analytics.</p>
<p>ITDR is often integrated with other <a>identity and access management</a> systems and works within security frameworks such as <a>zero trust</a> to provide a comprehensive approach to managing and protecting access to valuable resources. It’s a key part of a defense-in-depth strategy in cybersecurity, explicitly aimed at one of the most commonly exploited vectors: user identities.</p>
 What Are Identity Threats and Why Do They Need Special Consideration? 
<p>Identity-based cybersecurity attacks involve unauthorized individuals or entities posing as legitimate users to gain access to systems, networks, or data. They are a significant threat because they exploit one of the most critical security aspects: trust.</p>
 Forms of Identity Attacks 
<p>Identity attacks are common, perhaps more so today than ever, and encompass almost every possible attack vector related to online site access and cloud computing. Some foundational identity attacks include:</p>
 
 <a>Phishing</a>: The attacker sends deceptive messages, often via email, to trick people into divulging sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details. A specific form of phishing is called “spear phishing,” or a more targeted attack that uses deep research and knowledge of targets to steal information.  
 <a>Credential Stuffing</a>: In this attack, stolen account credentials (typically from a data breach) are used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts through large-scale automated login requests. 
 Identity Theft: This attack involves someone impersonating someone to commit fraud, gain unauthorized access, or deceive other users or systems. 
 Session Hijacking: The attacker takes over a user’s session after they’ve logged in, gaining unauthorized access to their data or services. 
 
<p>Additionally, identity attacks can be a cornerstone of more complex and dangerous <a>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</a>. For example, in a “land and expand” approach, attackers first gain a foothold within an organization’s network or systems through a single compromised identity or weak security point (“land”). This could be accomplished through phishing, exploiting a vulnerability, or several methods.</p>
<p>Once inside, the attacker seeks to expand their access and control by escalating privileges, creating new accounts, or spreading malware (“expand”). The ultimate goal is to access more valuable resources, like sensitive data or control over critical systems. The process is often carried out slowly and subtly to avoid detection. </p>
 The Importance of Identity Threat Detection 
<p>ITDR relies heavily on threat detection. With the right detection tools, enterprise organizations can effectively identify, mitigate, and eliminate threats as they arise. Easier said than done, indeed, but that level of challenge doesn’t imply it’s improbable, or even prohibitively complex, to have suitable ITDR measures in place. </p>
<p>These measures include:</p>
 
 Data Collection: Identity threat detection systems monitor various data sources like network traffic, user behavior, login activities, system logs, etc. These data points help build a comprehensive picture of regular activity, and any deviations can signal a potential threat. 
 Risk Assessment: The system continuously assesses risk by looking for suspicious activities. This could include unusual login times, multiple failed login attempts, login from a new or unique location, etc.  
 Anomaly Detection: Using machine learning algorithms, the system can understand what is “normal” behavior for a given identity. Any deviation from this normal behavior can then be flagged as a potential threat.  
 Threat Intelligence Integration: Modern systems often integrate threat intelligence feeds, which provide up-to-date information on known wrong IP addresses, domains, malware signatures, etc. These feeds enhance the system’s ability to recognize potential threats. 
 
<p>Additionally, ITDR can be more effective when combined with other security measures like solid authentication practices (such as <a>multi-factor authentication</a>), regular user and privilege audits, and effective incident response procedures. It’s a vital part of a defense-in-depth strategy in cybersecurity.</p>
 How Does ITDR Relate to Zero-Trust Frameworks? 
<p>“<a>Zero Trust</a>” is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and must verify everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access. </p>
<p>While this approach seems “foolproof” (if you trust no one, then no one untrustworthy may impact your infrastructure), the truth is that all IT systems need to balance security (zero-trust) with accessibility so that people in your organization can use them. </p>
<p>By focusing on usable ITDR, you can maintain secure <a>identity management</a> within a zero-trust framework. Some of the features that support this coexistence include:</p>
 
 Verification: With zero trust, every user and device is treated as potentially hostile, even if it’s coming from inside the network. In this context, ITDR systems help verify user identities by looking for anomalies and signs of compromise. If a trusted user’s behavior changes, the system will flag it as a potential threat. 
 Least Privilege Access: Zero trust operates on a <a>“least privilege” principle</a>, granting users only the access they need to perform their jobs. ITDR helps monitor and enforce this by tracking who accessed what, when, and why. If a user attempts to access a resource they don’t usually interact with, the ITDR system can flag it. 
 Micro-Segmentation: Zero trust often involves breaking the network into smaller parts (micro-segmentation) to limit the potential impact of a breach. ITDR can monitor these segments for signs of unauthorized access or lateral movement. 
 Continuous Monitoring: Under a zero-trust model, trust verification is an ongoing process, not a one-time check. ITDR supports this by continuously monitoring user behavior and looking for potential threats. 
 
<p>In this way, ITDR enhances the effectiveness of a zero-trust strategy by providing an additional layer of security focused on one of the most commonly exploited vectors: user identities.</p>
 Where Does ITDR Fit Into Different Identity Security Approaches? 
<p>ITDR brings together several different types of authentication and identity security, and in many ways, it can seem like a replacement for, or retread, established security measures. The reality is that many security approaches we typically think of in identity management are distinct from, but part of, effective ITDR solutions.</p>
 ITDR, IAM, and PAM 
<p>ITDR, Identity and Access Management (IAM), and <a>Privileged Access Management (PAM)</a> are critical components of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, particularly around managing user identities and access. They’re closely related and often work together to enhance security. Here’s a brief overview of how they relate:</p>
 
 Identity and Access Management (IAM): This involves managing digital identities and controlling their access to resources. IAM systems ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access specific resources. They also facilitate user provisioning and de-provisioning, single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, and more. 
 Privileged Access Management (PAM): PAM is a subset of IAM focused on managing and auditing accounts with elevated privileges, such as administrators. Because these accounts can access sensitive data or critical systems, they’re attractive targets for attackers. PAM solutions control access to these accounts, monitor their activities, and can isolate their sessions to reduce risk. 
 
 ITDR, Endpoint Threat Detection, and Extended Detection and Response 
<p>Yes, ITDR systems are different from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) systems. However, they all contribute to a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. Here’s a brief overview of each:</p>
 
 Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): EDR is a subset of endpoint security technology. It focuses on detecting, investigating, and mitigating suspicious activities on hosts or endpoints (like laptops, mobile devices, or servers). It collects data from endpoint devices to identify threats or malicious activities. 
 Extended Detection and Response (XDR): XDR is a recent approach that extends EDR by collecting and correlating data across multiple security layers – endpoints, networks, email, servers, cloud workloads, and more – not just endpoint devices. Integrating multiple security controls into a unified platform aims to provide more effective threat detection and response. 
 
 What Is the Relationship Between ITDR, Identity Fabric, and Identity Orchestration? 
<p>ITDR, identity fabric, and identity orchestration are all key components of a comprehensive Identity and Access Management strategy. In essence, identity fabric provides the architectural foundation, identity orchestration automates the management tasks based on that architecture, and ITDR is a specialized function that leverages both to detect and respond to identity-based threats. </p>
<p>Together, they create a more secure and efficient approach to managing identities in an organization.</p>
 
 Identity Fabric: As discussed earlier, this refers to a unified and holistic approach to identity services across an organization. It can provide the framework that ITDR systems use to collect and analyze data from across different systems and applications. By ensuring a consistent approach to identity management, an Identity Fabric can also make it easier to spot anomalies and potential security threats. 
 Identity Orchestration: This involves automating and streamlining identity-related tasks, such as user provisioning and password resets. In the context of ITDR, identity orchestration can play a role in the response to a detected threat. For example, if a user’s account is compromised, the identity orchestration system can automatically deprovision or lock the account to prevent further unauthorized access. 
 
 What Should I Look For in ITDR Solutions? 
<p>To be clear, ITDR solutions are varied and distinct. Some are dedicated ITDR platforms that integrate with systems, while others are part and parcel with an existing identity or security solution.</p>
<p>An effective ITDR solution should include the following features:</p>
 
 Real-Time Monitoring: The system should continuously monitor user activity across various systems and applications in real-time. This includes both regular and privileged user accounts. 
 Behavioral Analytics: By employing machine learning and AI, the system should establish a baseline of normal user behavior and then identify anomalies that may suggest a potential threat. 
 Risk Scoring: A good ITDR solution should be able to assign risk scores based on user behavior and other risk indicators. This can help prioritize alerts and responses. 
 Threat Intelligence Integration: It should incorporate threat intelligence feeds to stay current with known threats, vulnerabilities, and malicious entities. 
 Automated Response: The system should be able to respond to detected threats automatically. This could involve forcing a user logout, deactivating an account, or initiating a password reset. 
 Forensic Capabilities: A good solution should have capabilities to store and analyze historical data, which can help in forensic investigations after a security incident. 
 Integration with IAM and PAM: The solution should integrate well with existing Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions to provide a comprehensive view of identity-related risks. 
 Alerting and Reporting: The system should generate alerts based on specific events or conditions and provide comprehensive reporting for audit and compliance purposes. 
 Scalability and Performance: As the organization grows, the solution should scale and perform effectively. 
 Ease of Use: The platform should be user-friendly, with an intuitive interface and easily understandable analytics and reports. 
 
<p>An ITDR solution with these features would provide robust capabilities to detect and respond to identity-related threats, helping protect an organization’s valuable assets and data.</p>

 When it comes to travel, most people are aware how stressful it can be getting to a destination. With digital identity verification at the forefront, waiting times are over allowing travelers to enjoy that cocktail on the beach sooner than expected. 



<p>With the travel industry booming once more, many people are booking their long-awaited vacation to far-off destinations around the globe. However, a majority of customers have directed their focus to booking their travels online with around <a href="https://www.condorferries.co.uk/online-travel-booking-statistics">82% of travelers booking</a> through a website or mobile app. Technology has taken the front seat when it comes to travel, and not only through booking, but the entire journey of the traveler.</p>



<p>It is estimated that around <a href="https://www.condorferries.co.uk/online-travel-booking-statistics">700 million people will make a booking online in 2023</a>, as people around the world click, book and leave on a jet plane to their dream destinations. Thus, it’s no surprise that the online travel market has been <a href="https://www.condorferries.co.uk/online-travel-booking-statistics">valued at $2.3 trillion in 2023</a> and will only go up from there with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 10.3%. But despite this surge in travel, with it comes the insecurities of fraud as well as the long waiting times throughout the journey from booking to arrival.</p>



 Online travel fraud awareness. 



<p>Travel fraud is a growing problem in the industry, with many different types facing travelers and booking platforms. Specifically in air travel, <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/99507-airline-fraud-shoring-up-defense-with-advanced-analytics-and-mlops">airlines account for 46% of all online fraudulent transactions</a>, so it’s no surprise that <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/80-billion-euros-lost-to-online-fraud-across-physical-and-digital-goods-and-e-ticketing-in-2021-reveals-fraugsters-new-payment-intelligence-report-301589345.html">airlines lost over 6.5 billion to fraud in 2021</a>. Even the <a href="https://www.iata.org/">International Air Transport Association (IATA)</a> estimates that the airline industry suffers about <a href="https://www.ravelin.com/blog/fighting-fraud-in-the-airline-industry">$858 million a year, coming out to $639 million just for the airlines</a> in payment fraud.</p>



<p>But what are the most common types of online travel fraud? Perhaps the most obvious, and what’s costing airlines millions of dollars, is stealing payment and personal information such as credit card fraud and using stolen payment information for last-minute bookings or hotel price spikes.</p>



<p>While credit card fraud and identity theft are two of the more widely known types of travel fraud, there are many other forms that can be just as damaging. Such instances include:</p>



  Travelers finding themselves victims of scams such as fake bookings or hidden fees on hotel rooms or airline tickets  Phishing attacks, where criminals attempt to gain access to sensitive personal information by pretending to represent legitimate companies  Ticketing frauds like double booking flights  Cyberattacks targeting airline loyalty programs  



<p>Additionally, data breaches on online booking platforms have become increasingly common. A data breach is when sensitive information, such as credit card details, passport or address information, is accessed without authorization. In the context of travel bookings, this information is often collected by third-party booking platforms, making it vulnerable to travel fraud. Hackers can use compromised data to book unauthorized trips or even sell that information on the dark web for monetary gain.</p>



<p>As technology continues to advance, so do the methods used by criminals to take advantage of unsuspecting travelers – making it essential for everyone involved in the travel industry to stay vigilant against these kinds of threats.</p>

 Planning ahead for a seamless journey. 



<p>But despite the threats and negative consequences that fraud causes in the travel industry, digital identity is there to step in not only to prevent fraud from occurring but to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">make travel seamless</a> for both travelers and booking platforms.</p>



<p>When it comes to digital identity verification, verifying travelers before they even check-in to a hotel, vacation rental or flight can provide security for both guest and host. By asking for a form of identity verification in advance, this allows hosts to know they are doing business with honest and responsible individuals and the guests in turn can rest assured they are using a verified site to book their travel needs. Even world-renowned rental platform <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/selfie-biometrics-for-id-verification-expand-on-airbnb">Airbnb expanded their ID verification</a> earlier this year to require all rental customers and hosts to verify themselves through an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/biometric-checks-at-the-airport-ready-to-board/">ID check with biometrics</a> and in some cases selfie, to help better manage fraud and hold guests and hosts accountable for their actions. But it doesn’t end there.</p>



<p>Along with upfront security, by asking for verification in advance, hosts and travelers can save time later when they are checking in to their rooms, homes or flights making the journey less stressful just like a vacation should be. By optimizing booking, the time that verifying identity would take up later during check-in can be spent instead already getting settled into a seat on a plane or unpacking in that nice hotel that was booked. All that is needed later is a smartphone for a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/leveraging-digital-check-ins-hotel-operations/">quick digital check-in</a>.</p>



<p>Furthermore, by preparing all verifications in advance, there will be fewer documentation requirements later and no need to continually have to search for them in bags at the airport or at the accommodation. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/eurostar-officially-launches-smartcheck-biometric-gates">Eurostar has already begun using such systems</a> at London’s St Pancras International Station where travelers have the ability to go contactless when verifying their identity at pre-departure gates. Paperless verification is just over the horizon.</p>



 Digital Identity Verification—the best travel buddy. 



<p>With the many benefits that digital identity verification has to offer, travelers and hosts can truly be at ease when booking and accessing their trips. Efficiency is reached along with improving the customer experience.</p>



<p>Hosts need only implement ID verification when booking in order to receive the peace of mind that guests are who they say they are. Once that has been approved, which only takes a couple of minutes, hosts can focus more on the customer experience which in reality they already did. By providing an easy-to-use verification system when booking, guests will know they are not only using a safe site, but also are saving time later when traveling.</p>



<p>IDnow’s verification services provide travel businesses with the assistance they need in order to implement a seamless experience for them and their guests. With fraud on the rise in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel industry</a>, especially data breaches and stolen payment and personal information, our fully automated identity proofing solutions provide the ease needed to verify customers’ IDs along with age and address verification. Our solutions protect your business in real-time and offer worldwide document coverage.</p>



<p>Waiting times are over with digital identity verification.</p>

<p>Our team has recreated popular consumer experiences you may be familiar with to demonstrate how you can integrate the power of decentralized identity into a variety of use cases: an AI chat assistant, an app for book reviews, and a social networking app. These example apps, which we call Sprouts 🌱, are designed to spark your creativity and give you inspiration for what you, as a developer, can build using SpruceKit.</p> A Brief Introduction to SpruceKit <p>Before we explore each example, what is SpruceKit? <br><br>SpruceKit is a collection of SpruceID’s open-source libraries that provide tools for implementing decentralized identity. In other words, they enable you to give your app users greater control over their digital identity and personal data by letting them:</p>  Authenticate into decentralized identity  Create and protect personal data vaults  Manage how their data are used and shared  Present verifiable facts about themselves  <p>To learn more about SpruceKit and the open-source libraries it includes, read our announcement blog:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">  Introducing SpruceKit: The Open-Source Toolkit for Decentralized Identity  We’re happy to announce SpruceKit: a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults.  SpruceSpruce    </a> ChatBot <p>ChatBot is an AI chat assistant that uses natural language processing to have human-like conversations, with decentralized identity built in.</p> <a href="https://chatbot.spruceid.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Explore Hosted App</a> <p>We integrated SpruceKit capabilities into up-and-coming ChatBot technology to show how you can offer increased control over the way ChatBot conversations can be used, stored, and shared. With this example, app users can ask a question to generate a conversation, and soon, prove that they generated the conversation by adding their digital signature and establishing credential issuance to enhance content integrity and authenticity.</p><p>SpruceKit allows you to empower users to store their data securely outside of the ChatBot app by authenticating into decentralized identity using technologies such as Sign-In with Ethereum. Rather than an app hosting the data, it is then stored in a way that enables secure data sharing, control and ownership, and increased data privacy.</p><p>Lastly, ChatBot makes it easy to share conversations with specific individuals or across other apps that use SpruceKit open-source libraries. This interoperability facilitates collaboration and innovation that feels seamless for a user who wants to access their data across multiple apps, while also allowing them more control over who has access to data, for what purpose, and when that access is revoked. </p><p>ChatBot is open source, so you can review how we built it directly in GitHub, or through the demo video below.</p> <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/chatbot?ref=blog.spruceid.com">View GitHub</a> ChatBot Demo Video Joyce <p>Joyce is a social app for finding, reviewing, and sharing books where reviews are verifiable.</p> <a href="https://joyce.spruceid.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Explore Hosted App</a> <p>Interacting with friends to share book reviews, recommendations, and more is made better when you feel a sense of increased privacy, ownership, and control over the content you generate.<br><br>SpruceKit was used to implement personal data vaults in Joyce where users can store their book ratings in their own data vault vs. in app-hosted storage, promoting a more transparent and user-centric experience around the way app data is handled.<br><br>This example also shows how you can create verification flows for users to claim ownership over book reviews that they write in order to enhance data integrity and trust. </p><p>Joyce is open source, so you can review how we built it directly in GitHub, or through the demo video below.</p> <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/joyce?ref=blog.spruceid.com">View GitHub</a> Joyce Demo Video Teal <p>Teal is a social networking app based on managing one's own BlueSky data.</p> <a href="https://teal.spruceid.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Explore Hosted App</a> <p>Protecting your privacy and sensitive information on social networking channels is critical in today’s age with data leaks, social engineering and individuals gaining unauthorized access.

<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with our VP of solutions, Vik Subramanian.</p>
<p>Vik, welcome to the vlog. It’s good to have you.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Hey, great being here too. Michael, it’s always a pleasure to speak with you.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Are you out of Chicago today?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Yes, I am. I am.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Oh, you’re wearing the very dapper 1Kosmos vest. Surprised it’s not the summer inferno a high humidity in Chicago right now.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
We’ve been having the tornadoes come and attack us these days. So better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
I remember those. Well, listen, I really appreciate you taking time. I know you’re super busy lately. I want to talk about Microsoft today and where 1Kosmos fits in. So on the marketing side, we’re seeing a lot of organizations interested in passwordless, but they have … Microsoft is their backbone and they’re either experimenting with or implementing Windows. Hello for business, but you’re knee-deep in this stuff. In your own words, what are you seeing with the companies that you’re working with on the Microsoft side?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Absolutely. So let me actually begin with telling the audience what I do for a living a little bit. So me and the team, I actually have a team of mad scientists who put solutions together, solve problems, and make sure that our platform is a great fit for the organization. Now we working with a lot of organizations that have really invested in Microsoft and rightfully so they’re investing in Azure or Entra ID and moving forward and going through that journey. Now what we’re seeing is that a lot of organizations are starting to adopt the cloud in a large way, and they are taking their on-premise infrastructure, even their domain controllers and moving it to the cloud and adopting Azure. They’re becoming an Azure-only shop. They’re starting to take their devices, put it on Azure, and they’re starting to experiment with Windows Hello for Business.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
That’s super interesting. I just read a research paper yesterday which plotted I think an eight-time increase in interest around identity access management in just the past year or so, and that speculation was that had something to do with companies moving to a hybrid or virtual … part of their infrastructure being virtual.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Yeah, I mean, it’s extremely interesting that a lot of companies going to the cloud, especially, I think everyone’s talking about the pandemic making everyone remote. Still people are coming back into the office, but they want the ability to work from anywhere, access resources, from anywhere, and the cloud allows them to do that. And I think the solutions that they’re looking at, especially going to the cloud, they want a single platform where they get everything. Microsoft or Windows Hello is kind of fitting the bill for the most part.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So these organizations have Microsoft, and there’s been this kind of full-throated market attack on passwords and eliminating SMS. So for organizations with Microsoft, where does 1Kosmos fit in?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Absolutely right. So let’s actually talk about what Windows Hello does do and doesn’t do where Block ID or the 1Kosmos solution would fit in. Windows Hello for Business is really a means for authenticating into your Microsoft assets, emphasis on Microsoft assets using biometrics. So a lot of solutions today or a lot of hardware today comes with biometric-based authentications such as your infrared cameras or fingerprint readers. Your laptops could have it.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this is applicable for Windows 10, Windows 11 systems, some of the latest pieces of software that not all organizations have are adopted just yet. Secondly, what it also requires is that your machines be joined to the Azure or to the cloud, and that takes more than a snap of a finger to deploy. So when you’re talking about an organization adopting Windows Hello, or really rolling out Windows Hello for Business, it is a large program that they need to embark on in order to enable their employees to utilize biometrics.</p>
<p>I mean, we still haven’t spoken about the human aspect about it saying, Hey, I don’t want my biometrics stored on your devices and all of those things that they are having to deal with with respect to humans having oppositions to it. These just technology constraints that organizations have to deal with.</p>
<p>The other thing is that Windows Hello for Business again on cold boot and on in certain situations it requires that a pin or a password to unlock the safe that is there on the device. So users still have to remember a password and which they can tend to forget very easily if they’re using biometrics on a daily basis. But the process to reset the password is still legacy. You’re still answering KBAs or it’s a completely separate process outside of this entire thing that needs to be managed.</p>
<p>And lastly, really, the biometrics are stored locally on one device. I mean in this day and age of hoteling where I’m going from one device to another device to another device, I should not be asked to go ahead and register by my biometrics across all of them. And also, there’s limitation on the number of users that can be enrolling their biometrics on one device. So there are some limitations that organizations do have to deal with, but it’s a very powerful solution. So this is where, like I mentioned again … so from a Microsoft asset standpoint, Windows Hello for Business can definitely be utilized. Organizations still need to start in … keep investing in Azure, integrate their applications into Azure, utilize conditional access. There’s a ton of features that Azure offers you. But think about it, you’ve got laptops in your organization that have Windows Hello for Business or Windows Hello enabled. Users are starting to use it. Great. You know what, they can be managed by Azure. You’ve got your applications that are federated, they can managed by Azure. You’ve got your devices, you can roll out MDM, managed by Azure.</p>
<p>Great, but what about the rest of your organization? You’ve got other flavors of Windows in there. You’ve got Mac, you’ve got the network devices, you’ve got your Linux devices, you’ve got legacy applications that don’t conform to standards. Then you’ve got users who simply want the flexibility or want their identity in their own hands. And the privacy-preserving method of being able to log in using passwordless. This is where 1Kosmos comes in.</p>
<p>So we have the capability of extending the Azure functionality and really working with your investment in Azure and extending that capability across your organization. We have the credential provider for Windows, which works really well, enables organizations to log in using device biometrics or I think Michael, you’ve spoken about Live ID. So Live ID is very powerful to utilize across your servers and very critical systems that are remote where again, Windows Hello would not work. Then we have the ability to deploy our passwordless technology onto Macs. So now you’re controlling the assets on the ground. Then get into your data centers. We’ve got network devices, VMware devices, you’ve got your virtualization layer, all of those things can be integrated with us. We support legacy protocols like Radius, LDAP, all of those things which will really make those systems passwordless-enabled.</p>
<p>And lastly, from a privacy standpoint, we put the power of identity in the hands of the user. It’s always in the hands. It’s protected using their biometrics. It’s stored on their device, which means that they have the confidence that they are authenticating onto their device, giving them access to an asset that’s provided to them by the organization.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. Wow. Well, that’s super interesting. So it’s sometimes convenient, maybe as some marketers just to talk about passwordless is this little thing that exists in a vacuum and how if you don’t have passwords, they can’t be stolen. Great flare for the obvious there, but what you’re mentioning here, all the edge cases, logging onto your Mac, for example, in a mixed environment, logging into the VPN. IT people have their … need to access domain controllers, maybe even what users might have different, I guess, security profiles. I mean, if you’re logging into a mission-critical system that’s got very careful permission access on it versus you’re logging to do something benign, I guess managing that scenario.</p>
<p>Another topic that’s gotten a lot of attention and maybe too much is zero trust. There’s so many claims about zero trust. Let’s start at the basic. What is zero trust when it comes to authentication?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Absolutely. So zero trust in terms of authentication would fall under the identity pillar. So there are seven pillars. We would be in the identity pillar where … I mean it forms it … We’d love to say that we’re the center of the universe of the zero trust universe. Why? Because you know what, the authentication is what determines are you who you say you are. It is the layer that really identifies the user. So authentication forms a very critical part of the zero trust strategy for an organization. Now, this is where it gets interesting. So when we are thinking about authentication till now, and even organizations that are deploying MFA and advanced MFA think they have the silver bullet, but think about it.</p>
<p>Really, what is the question you’re trying to answer? Anytime that a user is coming knocking on your door and wants to authenticate, you’re really asking the question, who are you? And then you want to validate, are you really telling me the right thing about who you are? So how are you doing that? The organizations today utilize a combination of username and password. They accept Fido keys and then they’ve got solutions all out there. Evaluate 50 other things about you, meaning, hey, where are you coming from, what is the browser version, hey, what’s behind you at the wall, let me evaluate 10 or a hundred different things about you, and then maybe have some more assurance that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>Now, 1Kosmos BlockID is changing that. I mean, in the physical world, really, the way that I would read to you, Michael, I mean he is like, I know I can see you. I would greet you. I’d shake your hand and say, Hey, show me your ID and probably I’ll look at your picture and then do it that way. I know that you’re Michael. So we’ve just digitized that process. So we’re taking the identity, helping a user enroll that identity, hold it within their wallet, the point of authentication, they’re able to prove it, really provide a piece of that identity that’s enough for the authentication. And now the system has a great deal of confidence that it is Vikram who’s authenticating, and now the authentication has a high degree of assurance, which means the other systems or the other pillars in zero trust at least can knock off one checkbox going, yes, I know who’s coming into my organization, now determine what they can do or cannot do.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. So my iPhone knows who I am. I look at my iPhone, it knows who I am. I put my finger on a fingerprint reader, it knows me, right?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Hey, I mean it knows you, but it doesn’t tell me that it is actually Michael who’s authenticating. That’s the difference. But it knows that it’s a human. Yes, that’s all it tell the system. But that’s where a Live ID solution comes into play. We can truly say it is Michael who’s coming in, it is Vikram who’s trying to authenticate and only then allow you to get in. This is where the Live ID comes into play. Sometimes it helps introduce a little friction in authentication. Customer experience. Well, with a little friction introduces confidence.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right. So Live ID is actually the technology that we have that kind of defeats spoofing, if you will, and asks a person to make facial movements or gestures. So it’s a live or a real biometric if you will.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Well, but you know, got to remember, we’re the only solution in the market that puts a smile to people’s faces when they’re authenticating it. We get people to smile, imagine, hey, which employees smiles when they want to come in and log into their laptop? We do that.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, there’s some truth to that– it’s creating an environment of trust versus an environment of distrust. So I totally agree with you there. Listen, I don’t know if we’ve missed anything but taking 50 minutes of your time, it’s been really formative. I appreciate you stepping away from your day-to-day to do this for me.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, and you have a great day. We’ll have you back sometime soon.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
All right. Thanks, Michael.</p>

<p>SelfKey iD may be a better alternative for identity verification, as it may offer a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly approach to KYC.</p>
<p>By using the potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts, SelfKey iD may provide a secure, decentralized, and efficient identity verification process. It may have the potential to eliminate many of the issues associated with traditional KYC methods, possibly making the process more user-friendly and safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, but with SelfKey iD, users may have complete control over their digital identities and they might exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">SSID</a> rights more easily than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
 How does SelfKey iD work? 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD is a smooth and hassle-free process that prioritizes user convenience without compromising security and privacy. The streamlined procedure may ensure that users have access to a secure and private digital identity that they can trust.</p>
 The process&nbsp; 
<p>By following the simple steps outlined by the platform, users can obtain a SelfKey iD quickly and with ease. The steps are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Users must first log in with their wallet and pay an entry fee.</p>
<p>2. The next step would be to undergo a KYC verification process. This method is designed to ensure that the user's identity is authentic and that they meet the necessary eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>The verification process typically consists of:&nbsp;</p>
 
 performing a <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">selfie check</a>. 
 providing personal information, such as name and address. 
 providing government-issued identification documents, such as a passport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, users will not be able to create duplicate accounts.</p>
<p>3. Once the KYC process is complete, legible users are automatically approved.</p>
<p>4. The final step in the process is to mint the soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT. This unique digital asset is generated using blockchain technology and is securely bound to the user's digital identity.</p>
<p>It might serve as proof of identity (POI) and it may be used to authenticate the user's identity in a variety of settings, such as:</p>
 
 online marketplaces. 
 financial institutions. 
 other digital platforms, such as social media and videogames. 
 
<p>Even more, as the concept of the metaverse gains popularity, the need for secure and reliable digital identities becomes increasingly important. SelfKey iD emphasizes privacy and self-sovereignty. Therefore, it may be the perfect identity credential for the exciting products and services of the future.</p>
 Minting soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT 
 Aggregating Multiple Credentials 
<p>By combining different SBT (soul-bound tokens) and identity credentials, SelfKey iD may provide a higher level of verification for the user's identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials which may be aggregated by a SelfKey iD include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Metaproof. 
 KYC credentials issued by SelfKey Network issuers. 
 Traditional accounts, such as: Google, Apple, Discord, Github, Twitter, and the likes. 
 Various identity tokens, such as Binance’s BAB token issued in 2022. 
 
<p>This implementation may have significant advantages over individual credentials, as it may increase the reliability and accuracy of identity verification. And, an increase in reliability and accuracy is crucial for online interactions and services that require trust between parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more credentials added to the SelfKey iD container, the more trust may be established, and the more reliable and secure the user's digital identity may become.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the integration of multiple SBTs and identity credentials within a SelfKey iD container might provide users with unparalleled flexibility. This may enable them to add as many credentials as they require to establish their identity in a variety of contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may enhance the SelfKey platform's versatility and utility. It might make it more appealing to individuals and institutions seeking a reliable and secure digital identity solution.</p>
<p>Essentially, SelfKey's implementation of an aggregated credential system in its platform may be a significant step forward in the development of a strong and reliable self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>
 Attaching NFT series to SelfKey iD 
<p>SelfKey continues to prioritize user-friendliness with the introduction of a unique feature that may enable users to attach a distinct NFT series to their SelfKey iD profile picture. This feature may add a touch of personalization and uniqueness to the user's digital identity. Even more, it might reflect the growing trend of NFTs in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may also enhance the user's experience by providing them with more options to personalize and showcase their digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the addition of the NFT series feature to the SelfKey iD platform reflects the platform's continued focus on user-friendliness, personalization, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
 Access to SelfKey DAO 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD may provide users with numerous benefits that enhance their experience on the platform and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These benefits may include:</p>
 
 access to the governance of the SelfKey Protocol. 
 the ability to mint SELF tokens. 
 participating in locking a POI credential. 
 exclusive access to member-only channels on Discord. 
 obtaining exclusive collectible NFT packs. 
 registering for KEY.ETH ENS domains. 
 enjoying instant login to partner apps. 
 
 Minting SELF tokens 
<p>Having access to the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. The token might then be used for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may add value to the user's experience and may provide them with more control over their digital identity.</p>
 Locking 
<p>By locking KEY tokens on their KYC credential, users may mint SELF tokens. Locking credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials. Users may withdraw tokens at any time, although this will result in the termination of SELF token generation.</p>
 Exclusive Discord Channels 
<p>Access to member-only Discord channels may be another perk of having a SelfKey iD. It may provide users with a community to engage with other DAO members through a designated channel. DAO members may also discuss proposals for the governance of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
 NTF packs 
<p>Exclusive collectible NFT packs may also be available to SelfKey iD holders. This may add a unique and personalized touch to their digital identity. These collectibles are released by the SelfKey DAO, further enhancing their customization and originality.</p>
 KEY.ETH ENS domains and SelfKey iD 
<p>Moreover, SelfKey iD holders may register for KEY.ETH ENS domains. This might enable them to create unique and easily identifiable domains for their online identity.</p>
 Instant login to partner apps 
<p>Instant login to partner apps may be another advantage of having a SelfKey iD. This may provide users with a seamless and secure login process across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the benefits of having a SelfKey iD express the platform's commitment to providing users with a comprehensive, valuable experience. It may enhance their ability to navigate the crypto space with ease and confidence.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>In theory, SelfKey iD may be a strong and reliable form of digital identity that might be used for a broad range of use cases in the crypto world. With its focus on user-friendliness, security, and privacy, the SelfKey iD may be well-suited to the needs of decentralized societies and Web3 applications.</p>
<p>However, SelfKey iD may also be suited for traditional Web2 platforms that want to benefit from security and anti-bot features inherent to the SelfKey iD system.</p>
<p>SelfKey iD may not only empower the governance of the SelfKey DAO but it may also provide a model for other decentralized governance systems. By offering powerful, privacy-preserving identity credentials, the SelfKey iD might enable more fair and democratic governance. This way, users may have greater control over their data and identities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to provide new forms of decentralized governance, which may allow members to experiment with different approaches and explore the full potential of the SelfKey iD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the crypto world continues to evolve, the SelfKey iD might play an increasingly important role in enabling secure and transparent transactions across a wide range of platforms and applications.</p>

There’s a steady pipeline of future challenges. Most competitions are judged on a combination of subjective merit (e.g. data analysis) and objective merit (e.g.&nbsp;error).</p> 2.2 Background: Predict-ETH Data Challenges <p>There’s great value in being able to predict ETH well. It helps to make $ in buying / selling ETH, DeFi trading, yield farming or DeFi protocol development. Such predictions — if accurate — would be of high interest to buy, e.g. as a datafeed within Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>Accordingly, we’ve encouraged the Ocean community to get good at predicting ETH. Specifically, within Ocean Data Challenges, we’ve held monthly <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth">“Predict-ETH” Challenges</a>, running from October 2022 to July 2023 (7 total). Participants had to predict the ETH price into the near-term future: 5 min, 10 min,&nbsp;…, 60 min ahead. Reward $ goes to those with lowest prediction error. Error is a 100% objective measure.</p> 2.3 Background: Ocean Data&nbsp;Farming <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is a rewards program that incentivizes for growth of Data Consume Volume (DCV) [1] in the Ocean ecosystem. DF is like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned to drive DCV. DF emits OCEAN weekly for (a) passive rewards and (b) active&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>We <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">launched DF</a> in June 2022, and arrived at <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main</a> phase in March&nbsp;2023.</p> 2.4 DF Evolution <p>We’d set expectations that we may tune DF to include data competitions [2][3]. Now, that’s happening.</p><p>We’ve moved the ETH prediction competitions from Data Challenges framework to Ocean DF framework for two reasons. First, the competitions were 100% objective, and so could be automated to lower administration overhead; DF already had relevant weekly ops to support such a competition. Second, it sets up DF for further evolution related to predictions, stay&nbsp;tuned;)</p> 3. DF,&nbsp;Updated <p>This section describes how DF is updated, in terms of structure, budgets, and how people can earn OCEAN in&nbsp;DF.</p> 3.1 DF Structure, Updated <p>Challenge DF is a new substream of Active DF&nbsp;[4].</p><p>Here’s the updated structure of&nbsp;DF:</p>  Passive DF. Lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, for passive rewards. Reward depends on veOCEAN amount, which in turn depends on amount of OCEAN locked and for how&nbsp;long.  Active DF. Substreams:<br>– Volume DF. Here, people curate data by pointing their veOCEAN towards data assets. Reward depends on asset DCV, veOCEAN amount, and more. (This is what was previously simply called Active DF; now it’s one substream of Active DF.)<br>– Challenge DF. Here, people predict future ETH price, and rewards are a function of prediction accuracy. (This is the new substream of active&nbsp;DF.)   3.2 DF Budgets,&nbsp;Updated <p>The DF budget change is mild: 5,000 OCEAN weekly that was going towards Volume DF, is now going towards Challenge DF. Everything else stays the same. Let’s elaborate.</p><p>We’re currently in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main 1</a>, with 150,000 OCEAN per week in rewards. This gets allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 75,000 OCEAN&nbsp;(50%)  Active DF: 75,000 OCEAN (50%), allocated as:<br>– Volume DF substream: 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF substream: 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>There is no change to how DF Main ratchets up OCEAN rewards over time. Here’s a summary. In Mar 2024, rewards increase 2x to 300,000 OCEAN. Six months later, another 2x to 600,000 OCEAN. Six months later, another near-2x to 1.1M OCEAN/week, then decaying over time. It’s always a 50/50 split between passive/active DF. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">This post has&nbsp;details</a>.</p> 3.3 Earning DF Rewards,&nbsp;Updated <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the <a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean">DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards">Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF <br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards">Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once). <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md">Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p> 4. Challenge DF&nbsp;Details  4.1 Punchline <p>You can participate in Challenge DF by making ETH predictions for specific times. The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md">Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions [5]. We share key aspects&nbsp;here.</p> 4.2 Key&nbsp;dates <p>Each Challenge DF competition is weekly, in line with the rest of&nbsp;DF.</p>  Submission deadline: Every Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the Data Farming round finishes.  Prediction at times: Every Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total).  <p>Challenge DF competitions start now. Therefore the first submission deadline is Wednesday Aug 2, 2023 at 23:59 UTC, as part Data Farming Round 48&nbsp;(DF48).</p> 4.3 Criteria to&nbsp;Win <p>The winner = whoever has lowest prediction error (normalized mean-squared error, or&nbsp;NMSE).</p><p>To be eligible, competitors must produce the outcomes that the README guides. This includes:</p>  Created an Ocean data&nbsp;NFT  Filled it with (encrypted) predictions  Transferred it to the Ocean judges before the&nbsp;deadline  And a bit more; the README has full&nbsp;info   4.4 Challenge DF&nbsp;Prizes <p>Weekly Prize Pool: 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN</p>  1st place: 2,500&nbsp;OCEAN  2nd place: 1,500&nbsp;OCEAN  3rd place: 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN   4.5 Winners Reward Distribution <p>We will identify winners by the blockchain address they use in the competition (on&nbsp;Mumbai).</p><p>Rewards get distributed as part of DF rewards: we allocate OCEAN to winners’ accounts on Ethereum mainnet as part of Active Rewards contract.</p><p>If you are a competitor and want to know if you won, go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF Webapp</a> “Challenge DF” section and see the listing of winners for each previous DF&nbsp;Round.</p><p>To claim your reward, go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp “Rewards” page</a>. Then, within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button. This will claim rewards across all Active DF substreams at&nbsp;once.</p> 5. FAQ   Q: Data Farming is supposed to be about driving DCV. How does Challenge DF&nbsp;help?  A: ETH price predictions — if accurate — make for price feeds that people will readily pay for to trade against and more. Challenge DF catalyzes creating such feeds, and has more streamlined ops than the previous Predict-ETH Data Challenges.  Q: Are Challenge DF rewards a function of stake, e.g. veOCEAN&nbsp;held?  A: No. Challenge DF rewards are only a function of accuracy. (For&nbsp;now.)  Q: Predict-ETH had a blog post announcing each challenge, and another post announcing winners. Will you have the same&nbsp;here?  A: Partially. There is already a weekly DF blog post that wraps up the previous DF round and gives parameters for the next DF round. To keep ops streamlined, the blog post will not list winners. If you had submitted to Challenge DF and want to know whether you won, go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF Webapp</a> “Challenge DF” section and see the listing of winners for each previous DF Round. Your winnings are claimable as part of regular Active DF&nbsp;rewards.  Q: Going from Predict-ETH Data Challenges to Challenge DF, does the prize pool stay the&nbsp;same?  A: Approximately, yes. The changes are (a) weekly not monthly, and (b) denominated in OCEAN not USD. Let’s elaborate. Each monthly Predict-ETH competition had total 5000 USD worth of OCEAN worth of prizes. Dividing that by 4 (approx. 4 weeks in a month) gives us 1250 USD per week. Since DF is automated, it’s cleaner to calculate everything in OCEAN not USD. With <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">current OCEAN price</a> about 0.35 USD, then 1250 USD is 3571 OCEAN. We round up to 5000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Q: What’s the difference between “Predict-ETH” and “predict&nbsp;ETH”?  A: “Predict-ETH” refers to the specific set of Ocean Data Challenges to predict the price of ETH. “predict ETH” is simply a verb combined with the “what”, around someone predicting the price of ETH; it’s not referring to any given&nbsp;product.   6. Conclusion <p>Challenge DF is a new substream of Active DF, which rewards 5,000 OCEAN total in prizes towards those who predict the price of ETH with the lowest error. Expect Active DF to evolve further, towards driving DCV in Ocean ecosystem. Passive DF and total OCEAN rewards emissions are unchanged and will remain&nbsp;so.</p><p>Predict ETH price accurately to win! Weekly competitions and prize $. Get started&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md">here</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Data Consume Volume (DCV) is the USD$-denominated amount spent to purchase data assets and consume them, for a given time period (e.g. one&nbsp;week)</p><p>[2] Expectation setting in the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">DF Main launch post</a>, section 4.4 “DF Evolution”: “With each weekly cycle, the DF core team may tune the Reward Function or make other changes based on learnings. After DF Main is shipped, the DF core team will expand scope. Current plans are&nbsp;… DF Crunch Program — <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a>-style data science competitions. Initially, there will be a weekly reward to the best predictor of&nbsp;OCEAN.”</p><p>[3] Expectation setting in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">“DF Main is Here” post</a>, section 4.4: “Competition Data Farming. At some point, some of the Ocean-run competitions (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth">Predict-ETH</a>) can get streamlined &amp; automated enough to put into weekly DF&nbsp;ops.”</p><p>[4] Where in DF should Challenge DF fit? One constraint, out of our commitment to the OCEAN community, was “don’t touch passive DF”, which has 50% of the weekly DF rewards budget. In contrast, Active DF was always meant to evolve, all towards driving DCV. This is why we made Challenge DF a new substream of Active&nbsp;DF.</p><p>[5] Challenge DF’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md">README</a> may evolve week-to-week.

<p>Bluesky is one of the first social media companies that has made algorithmic choice a reality. On Bluesky, anyone can create a feed — cat lovers, coffee aficionados, Swifties, NBA fans, and more. As a user, you’re given a few default feeds to start out with as you get settled into the app, but you can easily swap them out for one of the many feeds that others have created.</p>
<p>Welcome to a new paradigm in social media where users have more choice and control. Our implementation of algorithmic choice lets users customize one of the most important parts of their social media experience: their feed.</p>
<p>In May, we launched custom feeds, a feature that lets users choose between feeds and helps developers build them. Custom feeds allow third party developers to create entirely new feeds that users can install.</p>
 How Custom Feeds Work 
<p>Instead of using a black box algorithm that leaves users guessing how posts are ranked or how to get to the “top” of an algorithm, we provide an open marketplace of feeds and let users choose which ones they want to use.</p>
<p>This changes the game — for example, news publishers no longer need to guess what media format gets ranked at the top in order to deliver crucial information to readers. You can also think of these feeds as super-powered hashtags or lists. Whether you want to subscribe to a feed of only cat pictures or to posts from only your mutuals, this is possible.</p>

Your custom feeds settings, where you can pin and sort your feeds in the app.

The Popular With Friends custom feed, with tabs for other feeds above.
<p>For now, it’ll take a bit of developer familiarity to <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator">create your own custom feed</a>. We’re still working on improving the search &amp; discovery of custom feeds, as well as the developer experience, but the basics of what it looks like to have a customizable social experience are here. In the meantime, third-party developers have built tools like <a href="https://skyfeed.app/#/">SkyFeed</a>, which not only allows users to easily create their own custom feeds, but also provides a <a href="https://atproto.com/blog/feature-skyfeed">Tweetdeck-like experience</a> where you can view multiple feeds in one dashboard.</p>

SkyFeed, a third-party tool built by @redsolver.dev
 What Can You Do With Custom Feeds? 
<p>The Bluesky team initially provided six custom feeds for users to subscribe to, but now, the vast majority of feeds on the network are built by independent third-party developers.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atproto.com/post/3k53mbdg4gi2g">asked</a> our current users about how they’ve been using custom feeds:</p>
 
 When Taylor Swift released one of her albums, Swifties created a custom feed to find each other and discuss the album 
 Use feeds as superpowered hashtags to follow along with live events like sports games and TV show premieres. 
 Use keywords to add your posts to topic-specific feeds. For example, any post with the test tube emoji 🧪appears in the popular What’s Science feed. 
 Be intentional about when you consume news by subscribing to a feed specifically for news. 
 Prioritize posts over replies and quote-posts by subscribing to a feed that contains only posts. 
 Only see posts from your friends and their circles, instead of viral posts across the whole network, by subscribing to algorithmic custom feeds that prioritize your local social graph. 
 Use custom feeds to advertise which artists have open submissions or stores that you can purchase their art from. 
 Create novel algorithmic feeds tailored to your specific interests — for example, a feed that prioritizes posts from your mutuals with some network-wide viral posts sprinkled in, or a feed that priorities posts that received the most engagement. 
 
<p>This is still just the beginning of custom feeds, and we’re excited to see where the Bluesky community takes them!</p>
 Default Feeds 
<p>Now that we’ve arrived at a stable first iteration of how custom feeds will work, we’re improving the default experience. Even though users have a wide variety of custom feeds to choose from, defaults are still powerful.</p>
<p>We’ve added Discover, a more complex feed that you can expect to evolve over time. Unlike our earlier iterations of simple feeds, Discover is customized for what you like to see, while still giving you a view into what’s trending in the network. The initial version of Discover mixes in a global view of what’s trending in the network with posts from accounts you follow and posts from accounts near your social graph. We’ll continue to improve this algorithm, with the goal of making a feed full of interesting content that refreshes often and takes your unique interests into consideration.</p>
<p>Our approach to making an algorithmic feed isn’t new. Most social networks take into account your interests and social graph to curate an unique feed for you. What’s new is our focus on algorithmic choice — letting you unpin feeds you don’t like, and discover and install new feeds that better suit your interests. If you don’t like our default Discover feed, you can simply remove it and replace it with any other custom feed. This mirrors our overall design philosophy: give users sensible defaults but leave them the option to fully customize their experience if they don’t like our choices.</p>
<p>If you have feedback on the updates, feel free to contact us via our feedback form <a href="https://blueskyweb.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?">here</a>.</p>

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>Have you ever seriously considered the negative impacts of a data breach? Are you aware of the digital safety risks that lurk around the corners of the internet? And, did you know that cyberattacks may produce life-long consequences?</p>
<p>Nowadays, applications and websites have become so common that we consider them an integral part of our daily lives. And, because we have normalized it, individuals blindly share their private information with little thought given to the implications of doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We rarely ever stop to consider what happens to our personal data once we share it with large technology corporations. And that’s because we live with the illusion that our valuable or sensitive private information is safe. That cyber attacks cannot possibly reach us.</p>
<p>However, some serious privacy violations have occurred in the past several months. And they have exposed the severe effects of sharing personal information without proper caution to safety and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite data breaches occurring on a daily basis, they aren’t discussed as often as they should be. Individuals who have not experienced such incidents may assume that they are immune to them. But anyone can fall victim at any time, and the consequences of a data breach can be irreversibly harmful.</p>
<p>In this article, SelfKey aims to provide an in-depth analysis of data breaches, recent events, and the potential aftermath for individuals whose personal information is compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly important to spread awareness about the possible consequences of data breaches. To attempt to prevent them from happening at all. With SelfKey’s decentralized solutions, a safer digital future may await us.</p>
<p>Let us elaborate on these crucial aspects in the paragraphs below.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 Defining data breaches: Meaning and Overview 
 A brief, but fundamental introduction 
<p>Data breaches are serious security violations where confidential, protected or sensitive data is accessed, stolen or used by an unauthorized person or organization. These devastating incidents are also known as data spills, data leaks, or information disclosures, and they can occur in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>These digital attacks are typically well organized and initiated by malicious players, including organized crime, political activists, and national governments. However, even individuals who accidentally gain unauthorized access to systems with poor security configurations can cause data breaches.</p>
<p>The information that hackers may disclose can range from matters that may compromise national security to information that government officials want to keep hidden. When a person who has access to such information deliberately exposes it, for political reasons, it is usually referred to as a "leak".</p>
 The negative effects of a cyber attack: What happens after? 
<p>Data breaches can have far-reaching consequences, impacting a variety of information types including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 financial data, such as credit card information and bank details. 
 personally identifiable information (PII), such as full name, full address, IDs, birth certificate information, etc. 
 personal health information (PHI), such as full name, home address, or dates related to the health or identity of individuals. 
 trade secrets, and intellectual property.&nbsp; 
 sensitive or valuable information, like photos or videos. 
 
<p>Unstructured data, such as files, documents, and private information, can also become exposed and vulnerable if proper security measures are not in place to protect them.</p>
<p>These cyberattacks aren’t limited to organizations or powerful institutions, though. Anyone could be a victim. And, worst of all, the compromise or theft of the information listed above can lead to anything from:</p>
 
 financial losses 
 identity theft 
 reputational damage 
 legal repercussions 
 
<p>It's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect their sensitive information and implement strong security measures to prevent data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey understands the devastating consequences of data breaches and emphasizes the significance of implementing preventive measures. Responding promptly and adequately in case of such incidents is also highly important.&nbsp;</p>
 Recent Data Breaches: The beginning of 2023 
<p>The frequency of data breaches has increased in recent years. Alarmingly, the past several months have seen a handful of significant incidents.&nbsp;</p>
 
 One such example is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches">TikTok’s illegal processing of data</a> belonging to 1.4 million children under 13, who were using its platform without parental consent. This breach highlights the importance of proper data management practices, particularly when dealing with children's information. 
 Another example is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kfc-pizza-hut-owner-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/">the cyberattack on Yum! Brands</a>, where attackers stole personal information belonging to some individuals, including names, driver's license numbers, and other ID card numbers. This kind of data is particularly sensitive and can be used to commit identity theft, among other crimes. 
 Finally, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kodi-discloses-data-breach-after-forum-database-for-sale-online/">the hacking of The Kodi Foundation</a> resulted in the exposure of personal information and private conversations of over 400,000 users. Such incidents can have long-term consequences for the affected individuals, including reputational damage and financial losses. These breaches emphasize the need for better cybersecurity measures and data protection practices across industries. 
 
 Factors contributing to data breaches: Why, Who, and for What? 
<p>Cyberattacks have become a prevalent threat to our digital lives, and they occur on both personal and larger scales. While most people may assume that only organizations with weak security measures are at risk, individuals are also susceptible to data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, personal cyberattacks often happen due to a lack of caution when it comes to protecting oneself online.</p>
 Why do data breaches occur? 
<p>One of the most common ways individuals make themselves vulnerable to cyberattacks is by using weak or predictable passwords. This makes it easy for hackers to access their accounts and steal sensitive information. Additionally, using the same password on multiple accounts makes it even easier for hackers to gain access to a person's entire online presence.</p>
<p>Lack of proper security measures is another way individuals put themselves at risk. Failing to have anti-malware protection on their devices can allow malware to infiltrate and infect their system. Similarly, exposing personal information publicly online, such as on social media, can provide hackers with the necessary information to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Clicking on or accessing suspicious links is another way individuals can become victims of cyberattacks. It is worth mentioning that bad players often use phishing emails to trick people into giving up sensitive information. These emails can appear legitimate, so it's important to be cautious and verify the source before clicking on any links or providing personal information.</p>
 Who is responsible for data breaches? 
<p>Anyone could carry out a cyberattack, if they have the necessary tools, and if that is their intention.</p>
<p>Data breaches are a serious concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. These breaches are often the result of bad players with malicious intent. Perpetrators can range from organized crime groups seeking financial gain to political activists looking to disrupt or expose sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some instances, national governments have conducted data breaches for espionage or other motives. Regardless of the motive, it's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect themselves from potential breaches and to respond quickly and effectively if one occurs.</p>
 What are the intentions of those who initiate cyberattacks? 
<p>Malicious individuals typically have two main intentions: financial gain or causing damage to institutions for various reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of these goals, they may carry out data breaches that can have serious consequences for their victims. These attacks can result in the exposure of personal information and sensitive data, which can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, larger feuds between hackers and their targets can result in victims becoming collateral damage and suffering the consequences of attacks that were not specifically directed at them.</p>
 Caught Off Guard: When and Where Data Breaches Strike 
<p>Data breaches can happen every second and anywhere, from major technology companies to large financial institutions, and even in our own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public places such as cafes or airports, which offer public Wi-Fi, can also provide opportunities for hackers to access personal data.</p>
<p>Recently, incidents involving Yum!Brands and TikTok have highlighted the vulnerability of powerful institutions to cyber attacks. However, individuals are also at risk in their personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any given moment, scam messages spread by viruses or hackers can target friends and family members. Weak personal security measures, such as predictable passwords and email addresses, can leave individuals vulnerable to attacks. As a result, the malware can spread to the victim’s circle of friends, family, or acquaintances via personal messages or emails.</p>
<p>One common method used by attackers is phishing emails. They appear to be legitimate messages from a trusted source but actually contain malicious links or attachments. Clicking on these links can result in the installation of malware on a device, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
 Victims of data breaches: Are you safe? 
 Who do bad players target? 
<p>The victims of data breaches can be anyone whose personal data was involved, regardless of age, gender, occupation, or level of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes children, women, men, students, teachers, and employees who trust their employers with their personal information. It also includes clients, customers, and patients who share their data with businesses and healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that anyone who uses the internet is at risk of being affected by a data breach, regardless of how small or popular they are. Constantly searching for vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them, bad actors can breach even the most seemingly secure systems.</p>
<p>That's why it's essential to take the right security measures, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and being cautious when sharing personal information online. By being proactive about data security, individuals and organizations can help protect themselves and minimize the potential impact of a breach.</p>
 How can Data Breaches affect you?&nbsp; 
<p>Individuals can be affected by data breaches in two different ways:</p>
 
 At a large scale, when a centralized system is hacked, which can affect millions of people.&nbsp; 
 On a personal level, when an individual's personal online accounts are hacked. In this case, the breach may only affect one person, but it can still have severe consequences, such as financial loss or identity theft.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In both cases, it's crucial to take steps to protect yourself and your personal information. SelfKey advises using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly monitoring your financial accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
 Large Scale: Attacking Businesses 
<p>Large-scale data breaches can have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the immediate victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While companies, institutions, and organizations are often the primary targets of such attacks, individuals can also suffer the consequences on a personal level. Even if the attack was not personally directed at them, they could still become collateral damage if the company they have trusted their PII with falls victim to a data breach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of this kind of data breach can be severe and long-lasting, for instance:</p>
 
 Companies can face financial losses, damage to their reputation, and even legal action. 
 Institutions may lose the trust of their stakeholders and customers, leading to a decline in business.&nbsp; 
 Organizations may find it difficult to attract and retain talent if they cannot demonstrate that they take data security seriously. 
 
<p>Furthermore, large-scale data breaches can lead to a loss of trust in the digital economy. If people cannot trust that their personal information is secure, they may be less likely to use online services and conduct transactions digitally. This could lead to a decline in e-commerce and other digital industries, negatively impacting the overall economy.</p>
<p>All in all, the consequences of large-scale data breaches are not limited to the immediate victims. Companies, institutions, organizations, and individuals can all suffer the effects of these attacks.</p>
<p>Below, we will examine some of these negative impacts more thoroughly.</p>

<p>Data breaches can have a significant impact on companies, not only in terms of the immediate costs but also in terms of long-term consequences. When a company experiences a data breach, it may be forced to halt its activity temporarily, which can result in millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<p>According to industry surveys, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">Gartner</a> concludes that the cost of operational downtime can be around $5,600 per minute, which translates to $300,000 per hour. This can add up quickly, especially if the breach is not resolved promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the financial costs, a data breach can also damage a company's reputation and erode the trust of its customers, leading to long-term consequences.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cyberattack-forced-a-logistics-company-to-temporarily-halt-operations-dde27a19">Expeditors International</a> is still dealing with the aftermath of a data breach that occurred in February 2022, which forced it to halt its activity temporarily. The company is likely to experience long-term consequences as a result, including a potential loss of business and damage to its reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial for companies to take proactive steps to prevent data breaches from occurring and to have a solid plan in place for responding to them if they do occur.</p>
 Financial Loss 
<p>Financial losses can arise from two main sources following a cyberattack:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ransomware 
 Legal actions 
 
<p>Ransomware attacks can result in significant financial losses for organizations, as hackers can demand large sums of money in exchange for unlocking access to their encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of ransomware attacks is a cause for concern, with experts predicting that the total cost of ransomware damages worldwide could reach <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/ransomware-payouts/">$265 billion by 2031</a>.</p>
<p>Legal actions can also result in substantial financial losses for organizations. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html">The Equifax data breach</a> in 2017 affected over 145 million people worldwide and has already cost the company more than $700 million in compensation to affected US customers. The breach also affected an estimated 15 million customers in the UK, who have launched their own separate legal action in the high court seeking £100 million in compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal actions can be costly and time-consuming, and the reputational damage caused by a data breach can have long-term consequences for an organization's financial performance.</p>
 Reputational Damage 
<p>Reputational damage is a major concern for companies that experience large-scale data breaches. Such damage can lead to revenue loss and have long-term impacts on the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a company's reputation is tarnished due to a history of data breaches, people are less likely to trust the company with their payment information, and they may choose to take their business elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loss of trust can be difficult to overcome. Therefore, companies must take steps to protect themselves and their customers from data breaches. Additionally, they must try to maintain their reputation and ensure their long-term success.</p>
 Loss of Private Data 
<p>Sensitive data and intellectual property are two key areas that hackers target in a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensitive data can include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Personal information belonging to customers, patients, and employees. 
 Private company emails that contain personal health history, home addresses, and payment information.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When this type of data is breached, it can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage for the company.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is another target of hackers, particularly designs, strategies, and blueprints. When intellectual property is stolen, the competition can take advantage of the leaked information. And this, in turn, may cause long-term damage to the company's competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Businesses within the manufacturing and construction industries are particularly vulnerable to these types of cyber threats. Therefore, many small businesses believe that they are unlikely to be targeted by hackers, but this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, 60% of all hacks target small businesses because they are often easier to attack. It is therefore crucial for businesses of all sizes to take proactive measures to protect their sensitive data and intellectual property from cyber threats.</p>
 Personal Level: Targeting the Individual 
<p>Data breaches at a personal level often occur due to a lack of caution when operating in the digital world and inadequate security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People may accidentally share sensitive information, such as their social security number or credit card details, on unsecured websites. Alternatively, they could fall victim to phishing scams that trick them into revealing their login credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, using weak passwords and not updating software and operating systems can leave personal devices vulnerable to hacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey’s decentralized solutions are centered around the individual’s privacy and security, with a strong emphasis on individuality. It is highly important for individuals to be vigilant when using digital platforms and take appropriate security measures to protect their personal data from cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
 Identify Theft 
<p>Identity theft is a serious crime that can have devastating consequences for its victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When criminals gain access to a victim's personally identifiable information (PII), such as their full name, Social Security number, and birthday, they can wreak havoc on their financial and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims can have their bank accounts emptied, credit histories ruined, and valuable possessions taken away. <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/archives/factsheets/ojpfs_idtheft.html#:~:text=Identity%20theft%20has%20profound%20consequences,crimes%20they%20did%20not%20commit.">In some cases</a>, victims have even been wrongly arrested for crimes they did not commit. This is because the criminal may use the victim's identity to commit cybercrimes or other illegal activities, leaving the victim facing legal action and potentially a criminal record.</p>
 Notable examples of identity theft 
 
 The case of <a href="https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/famous-identity-theft-cases/#nicole-mccabe-identity-theft-and-assassination">Nicole McCabe</a>, an Australian woman suspected of murder after her passport was compromised and her identity stolen.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www2.texasattorneygeneral.gov/identitytheft/real-stories-of-identity-theft">Several victims</a> of identity theft had to struggle with proving they were not responsible for the withdrawal of large amounts of cash from banks, or illegally attempting to obtain loans worth thousands.&nbsp; 
 The terrifying story of <a href="https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294978560">Andorrie Sachs</a>, whose medical identity was stolen by a pregnant woman who gave birth in Sachs' name and left the baby at the hospital, resulting in a $10,000 hospital bill.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Local authorities mistakenly reported Sachs as an unfit mother and threatened to take her children away. This could also have lifelong implications for Sachs as the perpetrator had a different blood type, and uncorrected medical records could result in Sachs' death if she ever needed a blood transfusion. A healthcare provider could even prohibit Sachs from reviewing her own medical records as they might not be in her name.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why SelfKey strongly encourages individuals to take proactive steps to protect their personal information, such as:</p>
 
 Using strong passwords. 
 Regularly checking their credit report. 
 Being cautious when sharing personal information online.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By being vigilant and taking appropriate security measures, individuals can reduce their risk of falling victim to identity theft and the devastating consequences that can follow.</p>
 Personal Health Information 
<p>The theft of personal health information (PHI) is <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">highly valuable on the Dark Web</a>, as it can be worth more than 200 times stolen credit card information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of identity theft can have serious consequences, including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 Obtaining illegal medical treatments or prescription drugs. 
 Altering the victim’s medical history. 
 Using up the victim’s medical benefits.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Hackers can also sell stolen PHI to other criminals, who can use it for a range of illegal activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given these horrifying facts, SelfKey strongly advises individuals to take steps to protect their medical identity, such as:</p>
 
 Regularly checking medical records for errors. 
 Checking for signs of fraudulent activity. 
 Ensuring that their healthcare providers have proper security measures in place to protect their PHI. 
 
 Financial loss 
<p>Once malicious individuals obtain your PII, they could potentially use it to <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">damage your credit</a> score and commit financial fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lowered credit score can make it challenging for the victim to:</p>
 
 Obtain a personal loan. 
 Secure a mortgage. 
 Even impact job prospects.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, individuals who commit identity fraud can open new bank accounts in your name, drain your existing accounts, and commit check fraud. They can also apply for credit using your information, and engage in a variety of other banking scams. All things considered, it’s important to be vigilant in safeguarding your PII. The long-term financial consequences of a data breach can be severe.</p>
 Impersonation on Social Media 
<p>Cybercriminals can use your digital identity to carry out various malicious activities that can cause significant harm. Here are only a few terrifying examples:</p>
 
 They can use your digital identity to phish for credentials from your friends and family, leading to further attacks.&nbsp; 
 They can ruin your reputation by posting obscene or profane content online, damaging your personal and professional relationships.&nbsp; 
 They may look for sensitive photos and videos in your account and use them to extort you, leading to emotional distress and financial loss.&nbsp; 
 
<p>As horrifying as this may sound, there are ways to prevent this kind of disaster from causing irreparable damage to your digital identity. For instance, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> methods may be the key to protect individuals against identity theft.</p>
 Emotional and Mental impact 
<p>A personal data breach can lead to significant mental and emotional distress. The harm caused can take a long time to recover from, depending on the extent of the damage done by the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with reputational damage, victims may also have to spend a considerable amount of time and money to mitigate the fallout. And, the steps towards recovering from such a cyberattack could be draining in themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims may have to spend endless hours or days:</p>
 
 Contacting their bank, lenders, and creditors. 
 Securing all their online accounts. 
 Replacing stolen identification documents. 
 Canceling and replacing bank accounts and credit cards. 
 Dealing with criminal charges made in their name.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Victims will also need to remove malware and viruses from their devices, while constantly proving their identity and showing that it was stolen. A process which can be emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting in itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst of all, if affected individuals fail to repair compromised information or remove malware from their devices, they will risk falling victim to the same attacks over and over again.</p>
<p>The long-lasting consequences of a data breach can be devastating, particularly if your PII or PHI end up on the Dark Web. The information could be in circulation there indefinitely, making you vulnerable to further harm.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 What is Online Identity? 
 A brief definition 
<p>The concept of online identity refers to a persona which people establish for themselves on the internet. Also called internet identity, online personality, or internet persona, it may be used in online communities and websites. It can also be a way of intentionally showing and representing oneself.</p>
<p>Although some people choose to use their real names online, some internet users prefer to be anonymous. They identify themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, an online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Identity vs Digital Identity 
<p>Even though online identity and digital identity are often found in the same context, there is a notable distinction between them. The difference between online identity and digital identity lies in their scope and focus.</p>
<p>Online identity specifically pertains to the persona and representation of a person in the online realm. It encompasses the social identity an individual establishes in online communities, websites, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>It includes elements such as:</p>
 
 Usernames and profiles. 
 Personal information. 
 Digital footprints. 
 
<p>All in all, it is the perception others have of the individual based on their online presence.</p>
<p>Digital identity, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses the information and attributes associated with any entity, not limited to individuals. It extends beyond just personal online presence and encompasses a wider range of entities and their attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes organizational identities, system identities, device identities, and more. It focuses on how entities are identified, authenticated, and represented in the digital domain.</p>
<p>In simple terms, online identity refers to how a person appears and acts online, while digital identity is a broader concept that includes representing any entity in the digital world, such as people, organizations, apps, and devices.</p>
 Digital Footprints 
<p>While navigating the internet, it's important to remember that our online actions can have lasting effects on specific websites. These effects are referred to as digital footprints.</p>
<p>Digital footprints are the marks or records of our online activities and interactions that remain after using digital devices and platforms. They can include different types of data, like personal information, online behaviors, communications, and contributions.</p>
<p>Some examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Social Media Posts 
 Web Browsing History 
 Online Purchases 
 Email Communication 
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
 
 Social Media Posts 
<p>Any content shared on social media platforms, including photos, videos, comments, and likes, contributes to a person's digital footprint. These posts can provide insights into their interests, opinions, and activities.</p>
 Web Browsing History 
<p>Every website visited and the search queries made leave a digital trace in the form of browsing history. It can include information about the types of websites visited, articles read, products searched for, and online services used.</p>
 Online Purchases 
<p>When making online purchases, individuals leave a digital footprint through transaction records. This can include payment information, shipping addresses, and product preferences. This data can be collected and analyzed to understand consumer behavior and tailor personalized advertisements.</p>
 Email Communication 
<p>Emails sent and received, including attachments, provide a digital trail of personal and professional conversations. The content of these emails can reveal information about relationships, affiliations, and communication patterns.</p>
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
<p>The creation and maintenance of online profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, dating websites, or gaming communities contribute to a person's digital footprint. These profiles often contain personal information, employment history, educational background, and connections. And they form a digital representation of an individual's identity.</p>
<p>It's important to note that digital footprints can have implications for privacy, security, and reputation management. The data accumulated over time can be used for various purposes, including targeted advertising, data analysis, and even potential misuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s vital that individuals take extra caution when browsing the internet, especially when sharing private information. Even websites that appear trustworthy may be at risk of data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
 How Online Identity Works 
<p>On a daily basis, individuals rely on their online identities to access various applications. Certain websites play a pivotal role in everyday work, communication, and education. However, there are also online domains that serve as sources of entertainment or offer delightful distractions.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples in which people make use of their online identities:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Social Media 
 Online Gaming 
 Professional Networks 
 Online Communities and Forums 
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
 
<p>Now, let's take a moment to briefly discuss them.</p>
 Social Media 
<p>On platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, online identity is built through the creation of profiles. This may also include sharing personal information, posting content, and engaging with others. For example, a person's online identity on Instagram might include their username, profile picture, bio, and the photos or videos they share.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Gaming 
<p>In the realm of online gaming, players often create unique usernames, avatars, and profiles that represent their gaming persona. Their online identity in this context is influenced by their gaming achievements, playstyle, interactions with other players, and reputation within the gaming community.&nbsp;</p>
 Professional Networks 
<p>Platforms like LinkedIn focus on professional networking and career development. Online identity on LinkedIn is shaped by an individual's professional experience. This can include work experience, education, skills, recommendations, and professional achievements. It allows professionals to establish their expertise, connect with colleagues, and showcase their qualifications.</p>
 Online Communities and Forums 
<p>Though online communities and forums centered around specific interests or hobbies, individuals have the opportunity to participate in discussions, ask questions, and share knowledge. Online identity within these communities is built based on the content contributed, expertise demonstrated, and the respect gained from other community members.&nbsp;</p>
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
<p>When engaging in online shopping, individuals create accounts and profiles on e-commerce platforms. Online identity in this context involves personal information, purchase history, reviews, and ratings given to products or sellers. It influences the trustworthiness and credibility of an individual as a buyer or seller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each of these contexts, online identity is constructed through the information individuals share, their online activities, and the interactions they have with others. It plays a role in shaping how others perceive them and how they navigate various online spaces.</p>
 The Benefits of Having an Online Identity 
<p>Because the wide majority of the world has already adopted modern technology, having an online identity has become a necessity. However, there are a multitude of benefits which come with having an online identity, namely:</p>
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
 Professional Opportunities 
 Networking and Collaboration 
 Personal Branding 
 Access to Resources and Information 
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
<p>Having an online identity allows individuals to extend their reach beyond physical boundaries. It provides a platform to share ideas, expertise, and creativity with a global audience. And this may potentially lead to increased influence and impact.</p>
 Professional Opportunities 
<p>An online identity can open doors to various professional opportunities. It allows individuals to showcase their skills, accomplishments, and qualifications to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It acts as a digital resume, making it easier for others to discover and connect with them.</p>
 Networking and Collaboration 
<p>An online identity facilitates networking and collaboration by connecting individuals with like-minded people, professionals in their field, or communities of interest. It provides a platform to engage in meaningful discussions, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects, fostering valuable connections and relationships.</p>
 Personal Branding 
<p>Online identity enables individuals to shape and manage their personal brand effectively. They can curate their online presence to reflect their values, expertise, and unique qualities. This branding can help individuals stand out, establish credibility, and create a positive perception among peers, potential clients, or collaborators.</p>
 Access to Resources and Information 
<p>Having an online identity grants individuals access to a vast array of resources, information, and opportunities available on the internet. It allows them to tap into online communities, educational platforms, industry-specific websites, and research databases. This empowers them to stay informed, learn, and grow in their personal and professional pursuits.</p>
 Online Identity Risks and Challenges 
<p>As with any innovation, having an online identity does not come without risks. It’s important for people to be aware of these negative aspects and to take precautions to avoid becoming victims. Even more, it’s equally important to spread awareness and educate as many people as possible about these matters.</p>
<p>If proper security measures would be in place, the following situations could be prevented:</p>
 
 Identity Theft 
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
 Online Reputation Damage 
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
 
 Identity Theft 
<p>Online <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> occurs when someone gains unauthorized access to personal information and uses it for fraudulent purposes. For example, a hacker might gain access to an individual's online banking account and use their identity to make unauthorized transactions or steal funds.</p>
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
<p>Phishing is a tactic used by cybercriminals to deceive individuals into sharing sensitive information such as passwords or credit card details by disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity. For example, a person may receive an email appearing to be from their bank, asking them to click on a link and provide login credentials. Hackers may use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the victim's accounts.</p>
 Online Reputation Damage 
<p>In the digital age, a person's online reputation can have significant consequences. Negative or inappropriate content shared online, whether by oneself or others, can harm one's personal or professional reputation. For instance, a controversial tweet or a compromising photo shared online without consent can damage an individual's reputation and have long-lasting consequences.</p>
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">Data breaches</a> occur when sensitive information is accessed, stolen, or exposed due to security vulnerabilities in online systems. This can lead to the compromise of personal information, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, or financial data. An example is when a major retail company experiences a breach, resulting in the theft of customer credit card information from their database.</p>
<p>These risks and challenges highlight the importance of maintaining strong online security practices, being cautious with personal information sharing, and being vigilant about potential threats to online identity.</p>

 An Introduction to Web3&nbsp; 
<p>Evolution is natural in many aspects of life. With modern technology, however, it’s especially beneficial when networking and artificial intelligence can considerably enhance the way society functions. Let us discover the concept of Web3, what it is, and how it can affect our daily lives.</p>
 What is Web3? 
<p>Web3, or Web 3.0, represents a new vision for the next phase of the World Wide Web. It aims to integrate principles like decentralization, blockchain advancements, and token-driven economies.</p>
<p>The range of emerging technologies and projects it encompasses include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 decentralized finance (DeFi) 
 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 
 decentralized applications (dApps) 
 
<p>At its core, Web3 envisions a future where individuals have greater sovereignty over their digital lives. Where trust and transparency are built into the very fabric of the internet.</p>
 Web2 to Web3: How different are they? 
<p>Web2 is the current version of the internet, encompassing all the technologies and projects people are accustomed to nowadays. While Web2 has proven to be an inclusive and dynamic form of the web, it has its limitations due to its centralized nature. In this context, Web3 aims to enhance user freedom, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>There are many differences between Web2 and Web3. For now, let us explore two of the most prominent aspects which set them apart:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
<p>Web2 platforms and services are predominantly centralized, meaning they rely on centralized servers and intermediaries to operate. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon control and manage user data and have the authority to set rules and policies. Because of this, users have limited control over their data and are dependent on these centralized entities.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, emphasizes decentralization. It operates on peer-to-peer networks and blockchain technology, where data is distributed across multiple nodes. Users have greater control over their data and can interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) without the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts and consensus mechanisms enable decentralized governance models where the community collectively makes decisions, instead of relying on a single authority.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>In Web2, user data is often collected, stored, and controlled by centralized platforms. Users typically agree to terms and conditions that grant these platforms the right to use and monetize their data. Privacy concerns arise due to the potential for data breaches, surveillance, and unauthorized access to personal information.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, prioritizes user ownership and control over data. With decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain technology provides transparency and auditability, which may reduce the risk of unauthorized manipulation or access. Users have the ability to grant and revoke access to their data on a case-by-case basis, enhancing privacy and data sovereignty.</p>
<p>All in all, these differences highlight the shift from a centralized and controlled web to a more decentralized, user-centric, and economically empowering Web3 ecosystem.</p>
 Web3 Benefits and Opportunities 
<p>Due to its decentralized nature, and not only, Web3 can offer a multitude of benefits and opportunities. Let’s examine a few:</p>
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 Economic Empowerment 
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
<p>Web3 aims to decentralize power and eliminate the need for intermediaries by leveraging blockchain technology. This can result in a more trustless and transparent online environment. Users may interact directly with each other and verify transactions without relying on centralized authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to be a decentralized and trustless digital environment, due to its emphasis on limited data sharing.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>One thing that Web3 prioritizes is user ownership and control over personal data. This is also known as <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereignty</a>, and it aims to reduce the risk of data breaches by enabling individuals to be the sole owners of their data.</p>
<p>Through decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data. They can selectively grant access to their data and have more control over how it is used and shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shift towards user-centric data ownership may enhance privacy and empower individuals to protect their personal information.</p>
 Economic Empowerment 
<p>Another advantage of Web3 is that it introduces new economic models enabled by cryptocurrencies and tokens. This may allow individuals to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, where they can lend, borrow, and invest without relying on traditional financial intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization and the concept of ownership over digital assets may open new opportunities for creators, artists, and content providers to monetize their work directly. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, Web3 could potentially create more equitable economic systems.</p>
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
<p>Web3 aims to promote interoperability between different blockchain networks and protocols. This means that users may seamlessly interact with various decentralized applications (dApps) and move assets across different platforms without facing barriers or restrictions.&nbsp;It allows for a more connected and cohesive ecosystem where users may access a wide range of services and functionalities.</p>
<p>To aid this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a decentralized solution which may enhance digital security as individuals operate in these platforms.&nbsp;</p>
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
<p>Finally, Web3 enables decentralized governance models through mechanisms like smart contracts and decentralized <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">autonomous organizations (DAOs)</a>. This allows users to have a say in the decision-making processes of the platforms they engage with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can participate in voting, propose changes, and contribute to the development and evolution of the platforms they use. And this fosters a sense of community ownership and collaboration, empowering users to shape the direction of the platforms and protocols they rely on.</p>
<p>All in all, these benefits highlight Web3’s potential to transform the internet into a more user-centric, transparent, and inclusive ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that Web3 is still an emerging concept. Therefore, its actual realization and impact will depend on the development and adoption of relevant technologies and applications.</p>
 The Dark Side of Web3 
<p>While Web3 brings potential benefits, it also presents certain risks and challenges that need to be considered. It’s important to be aware of these challenges in order to take preventive measures and remain vigilant.</p>
<p>Here are five potential risks that may occur with Web3:</p>

 Security and Privacy Concerns 
<p>As Web3 relies heavily on blockchain technology and decentralized systems, it introduces unique security and privacy considerations. Although blockchain is renowned for its robust security, vulnerabilities and exploits can still occur.</p>
<p>Additionally, decentralized storage and peer-to-peer networks may face privacy challenges. Therefore, they require careful attention to encryption, data protection, and identity management to ensure user privacy.</p>
 Bots and Maliciously-used AI 
<p>In Web3, identity and reputation systems can be compromised by bots through <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/sybil-attack/#:~:text=A%20Sybil%20attack%20uses%20a,of%20influence%20in%20the%20network.">sybil attacks</a>. Bots can create multiple fake identities to gain influence, voting power, or access to certain resources within decentralized networks. This can undermine the trust and fairness of the system.</p>
<p>Bad players can also program AI to distribute spam messages or engage in phishing attacks within decentralized communication platforms. These attacks aim to deceive users into sharing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links, compromising their security and privacy.</p>
 User Responsibility and Risks 
<p>Web3 shifts more responsibility onto users, as they have greater control over their digital assets and interactions. With increased control comes increased risk, as users are solely responsible for managing their private keys. This includes securing their wallets, and avoiding scams or fraudulent activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>User error or negligence can result in irreversible loss of funds or unauthorized access to personal data, necessitating heightened user awareness and education.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize these risks and address them proactively. One can do this through responsible development, regulatory frameworks, user education, and sustainable practices. The purpose is to maximize the promising benefits of Web3 while mitigating potential downsides.</p>
 Web3 and SelfKey

 Conclusions 
 
 What is Tokenization? 
 A brief definition&nbsp; 
<p>Tokenization, in the context of data security, involves the substitution of sensitive data with a non-sensitive equivalent, known as a token. The purpose of tokenization is to render the original data meaningless and devoid of exploitable value. Instead, a token is generated, which serves as a reference point linking back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system.</p>
<p>The tokenization process is designed with the aim to enhance data protection by reducing the risk associated with storing or transmitting sensitive information. By replacing sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personal identification details, with tokens, the likelihood of unauthorized access or misuse of the original data may be significantly minimized.</p>
<p>The tokenization system manages the mapping between the tokens and their corresponding sensitive data, ensuring that the original information can be retrieved when needed by authorized entities. This system may provide a secure and efficient way to handle sensitive data, reducing the exposure to potential breaches or theft.</p>
<p>Overall, tokenization plays a vital role in safeguarding sensitive information, preserving data privacy, and maintaining the integrity of systems that handle sensitive data elements.</p>
 Tokens Explained 
<p>Tokens may function as digital assets or representations of value that are built on top of existing blockchain networks. They can serve various purposes and operate within specific ecosystems.</p>
<p>Technically, tokens are programmable digital objects that are created and managed through smart contracts. These contracts dictate the rules and behaviors of the tokens, such as their supply, transferability, and functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals can create tokens on different blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana, using their respective token standards like ERC-20, BEP-20, or SPL. And, depending on their design, they can have different functionalities.</p>
<p>For instance, tokens can:</p>
 
 Be used as a medium of exchange and stores of value. 
 Represent ownership rights in a particular asset or project.&nbsp; 
 Have utility functions within decentralized applications (DApps), enabling access to specific features or services. 
 
<p>Overall, tokens operate within the framework of blockchain technology. They offer a flexible and programmable way to represent and exchange data or value within digital ecosystems.</p>
 Types of Tokens 
<p>In addition to the general definitions mentioned earlier, there are specific categories of cryptoassets that include the word "token" in their name. Here are a few examples:</p>
 
 DeFi tokens refer to crypto tokens issued by decentralized finance protocols, which aim to replicate traditional financial functions. These tokens serve multiple purposes within their respective protocols and can be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency. For instance, individuals may use them for lending, saving, insurance, and trading.&nbsp; 
 Governance tokens are specialized tokens which grant holders the ability to participate in decision-making processes for a protocol or application. As decentralized platforms lack central authorities or boards of directors, governance tokens provide voting rights.&nbsp; 
 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent ownership rights to unique digital or real-world assets. They have been utilized to combat unauthorized copying and sharing of digital creations. Additionally, NFTs have gained popularity in the art world for issuing limited editions of digital artwork or selling exclusive virtual assets like rare items in video games. 
 Finally, security tokens are cryptoassets which are designed to function as the cryptocurrency equivalent of traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Security tokens enable the sale of shares in companies or other ventures, including real estate, without the involvement of brokers. Major companies and startups are exploring security tokens as an alternative fundraising method. 
 
<p>By familiarizing oneself with these different categories of tokens, one can gain a better understanding of the diverse applications and functionalities within the crypto space.</p>
 The difference between Crypto and Tokenization 
<p>The difference between cryptocurrency and tokenization lies in their underlying concepts and functionalities.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that utilize cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies typically operate as independent entities with their own blockchain networks. They can function as a medium of exchange, a store of value, or a unit of account.</p>
<p>On the other hand, tokenization is the process of converting data, real-world assets, rights, or functionalities into digital tokens that exist and operate on a blockchain. Tokens can represent various forms of value, such as ownership rights, access to services, or participation in a project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that operate independently on their respective blockchain networks, while tokenization involves the creation and representation of data, assets or functionalities as digital tokens within a specific platform or ecosystem.</p>
 The Benefits of Tokenization 
<p>Tokenization offers several benefits for data security and efficiency. Here are a few key advantages of tokenization, which we will discuss more thoroughly below:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enhanced Data Security 
 Improved Data Processing Efficiency 
 Simplified Data Management and Migration 
 
 Enhanced Data Security 
<p>Tokenization helps protect sensitive information by replacing it with randomly generated tokens that have no intrinsic value or meaning. Unlike encryption, tokenization removes the need to store sensitive data, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches. Even if a hacker gains access to the tokenized data, it is almost impossible to&nbsp; reverse-engineer the original information.</p>
 Improved Data Processing Efficiency 
<p>Tokenization accelerates data processing and retrieval by replacing long and complex data strings with shorter tokens. These tokens are easier and faster to search, index, and analyze. And this leads to improved performance and efficiency in data-intensive applications such as databases, data warehousing, and big data analytics.</p>
 Simplified Data Management and Migration 
<p>Lastly, tokenization facilitates data management and migration processes, particularly when transitioning between different systems or databases. When migrating data, tokens can be used to maintain data integrity and relationships while ensuring sensitive information remains secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, tokenization simplifies data integration, as systems can exchange tokens instead of transferring actual data. This may reduce the complexity and overhead of data sharing.</p>
<p>All in all, tokenization may offer notable security advantages. However, it is crucial to prioritize the management and protection of the tokenization system itself. This will ensure comprehensive security throughout the process.</p>
 Tokenization: Challenges and Risks 
<p>While tokenization offers numerous benefits, there are also potential risks associated with its implementation, for instance:</p>
 
 Dependency on Tokenization System 
 Token Reversal Attacks 
 Token Mapping Vulnerabilities 
 Single Point of Failure 
 
 Dependency on Tokenization System 
<p>Organizations adopting tokenization may become reliant on the tokenization system and infrastructure. If the system experiences a breach, suffers from downtime, or becomes unavailable, it can disrupt operations and impact business continuity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial to implement robust security measures and backup systems to mitigate such risks.</p>
 Token Reversal Attacks 
<p>Although tokenized data is not directly reversible, attackers may attempt token reversal attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the tokenization system or its implementation. If successful, these attacks could potentially derive sensitive information from the tokens. And, in turn, it may&nbsp; undermine the security benefits of tokenization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vigilance in system design and implementation, as well as regular security audits, can help mitigate this risk.</p>
 Token Mapping Vulnerabilities 
<p>Tokenization relies on a mapping or lookup table that connects tokens to their original data. If malicious individuals compromise this mapping table, they may gain access to the original sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robust security measures are therefore essential to protect against this risk, such as:</p>
 
 strong access controls. 
 encryption of the mapping table 
 secure key management. 
 
 Single Point of Failure 
<p>Centralizing tokenization processes introduces a single point of failure. If the tokenization system or central repository is compromised, it can have widespread implications across the organization, potentially exposing sensitive data or disrupting operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing redundancy, disaster recovery mechanisms, and distributed tokenization systems can help mitigate this risk.</p>
<p>All in all, it's important to note that while these risks exist, there are methods which may mitigate them and maximize the benefits of tokenization. These methods include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 implementing proper security measures. 
 conducting regular assessments. 
 adhering to best practices. 
 
 A Glimpse into SelfKey’s Protocol 
<p>When developing decentralized solutions, SelfKey places great emphasis on digital identity privacy and security. The vision is to create a more secure decentralized network, in which members may be able to exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may be such a platform by treating its members with transparency, equality, and fairness. Within the SelfKey Protocol, there are currently two tokens which serve as pivotal elements: KEY and SELF.</p>
 KEY: A Brief Introduction 
<p>Utility tokens derive their value from their utility or functionality within the ecosystem they are associated with. One may use them within the platform to exchange for goods or services, participate in voting or governance processes, access premium features, or facilitate interactions.</p>
<p>The KEY token may find utility in various ways, including:</p>
 
 Serving as a method of exchange for services within the SelfKey Protocol. 
 Enabling users to lock their credentials more securely. 
 Empowering members to govern the SelfKey DAO. 
 Equipping users with essential tools which may allow them to take charge of their digital identity and increase privacy protection. 
 
 The Purpose of SELF 
<p>While KEY remains the vital utility token to lock credentials, SelfKey introduces the SELF tokens to facilitate tracking of an individual's locked credentials and their duration.</p>
<p>Having access to the SelfKey DAO may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. Individuals may use these tokens for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some notable attributes of SELF tokens:</p>
 
 Individuals who successfully lock a real identity may mint SELF tokens. 
 SELF tokens may serve as a metric for reputation measurement. 
 As a reputation signal, they may strengthen legitimate credentials and help identify illegitimate ones. 
 Users themselves may mint SELF tokens, and they hold no inherent value. 
 SELF tokens may also serve as a governance mechanism, granting influence to those who use the platform, accumulate reputation, or engage in "identity mining" to enhance platform security. 
 As users lock valid credentials, they accumulate reputation in the form of SELF tokens. 
 
<p>By introducing SELF tokens, SelfKey may enhance the ecosystem by providing individuals with a way to monitor their locked credentials and reputation. At the same time, it may promote the integrity and security of the platform.</p>
 Locking for Digital Safety 
<p>By locking KEY tokens on their credentials, users may mint SELF tokens. Locking credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of locking, therefore, is to enhance digital security. This may prevent data breaches, identity theft, and unlawful attempts by malicious bots to infiltrate your private online accounts and systems.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rapid progress of modern technology constantly astonishes us, bringing forth opportunities for knowledge, efficiency, communication, and speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization, a relatively new concept, has the potential to simplify private data management and enhance online security through encryption methods, offering benefits in terms of privacy, security, speed, and efficiency.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Sybil attacks present a distinct challenge in safeguarding the security and equilibrium of a system, among other types of cybersecurity threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advancement of modern technology has enabled malicious individuals to generate highly convincing fake, digital identities. Therefore, the difficulty in distinguishing between a malevolent bot and a genuine human being becomes especially challenging.</p>
<p>Even when targeting smaller online groups or individuals, counterfeit digital duplicates can inflict significant harm. On a larger scale, within a private system, the infiltration of these malicious replicas can lead to catastrophic consequences. Not only do they endanger individual security, but their calculated intentions have the potential to disrupt the overall security and equilibrium of the entire system.</p>
<p>To combat this issue, SelfKey is aiming to develop decentralized solutions that may prevent the unauthorized access of these malicious bots to private online accounts and systems. By harnessing the very technology used to create fraudulent identities, SelfKey's online security methods aim to counterattack Sybil attacks and establish a secure digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>This article provides an in-depth exploration of Sybil attacks and their detrimental impact on the security of digital spaces. Additionally, we’ll elaborate on how SelfKey strives to reinstate security and balance to private accounts and systems.</p>

 Sybil Attacks: The horrifying truth 
 In a nutshell 
<p>According to literature, Sybil attacks are a method of network-based attacks in which a perpetrator creates multiple fake identities or accounts to gain control or influence over a system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the term "Sybil" comes from the book "Sybil" by Flora Rheta Schreiber, which portrays a case of multiple personality disorder. In the context of digital security, this refers to a multitude of counterfeit identities which may be controlled by one, single, malicious individual.</p>
 What happens in a Sybil attack? 
<p>During this kind of cyber attack, bad players create numerous fake identities, also known as Sybil nodes or Sybil identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The perpetrators then use them to deceive a network or system into believing that each identity represents a unique and independent user. By controlling multiple identities, the attackers can manipulate the network's behavior, disrupt its operation, or undermine its security.</p>
 Who do they target? 
<p>Sybil attacks are commonly associated with decentralized systems, such as peer-to-peer networks or blockchain networks. Here, participants rely on the assumption that each identity is unique and represents a distinct user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By creating a large number of Sybil identities, an attacker can:</p>
 
 gain disproportionate influence. 
 compromise consensus mechanisms. 
 launch various malicious activities, such as spreading misinformation, performing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">Distributed Denial of Service</a> attacks, or controlling a majority of voting power. 
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks can be challenging since traditional identification methods may not be effective in decentralized systems that rely on pseudonymous identities. Mitigation strategies often involve:</p>
 
 implementing reputation systems. 
 proof-of-work mechanisms. 
 identity verification protocols to establish trust and distinguish between legitimate users and Sybil nodes. 
 
<p>Overall, Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems. Therefore, robust security measures and consensus algorithms are necessary to prevent or minimize their impact.</p>
 The dreadful consequences of Sybil Attacks 
<p>Sybil attacks can be highly dangerous to digital systems, especially in decentralized networks or systems that rely on trust and consensus. Some reasons why Sybil attacks are considered a significant threat include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
 Undermining Consensus&nbsp; 
<p>In decentralized networks, like blockchains, where consensus is essential for maintaining integrity and security, a Sybil attack can disrupt the process. By controlling multiple identities, malicious individuals may manipulate voting or decision-making processes. And this may potentially lead to false consensus or control over the network.</p>
 Disrupting Network Operations 
<p>Sybil attacks can disrupt the normal operation of a network or system. For instance, an attacker may flood the network with fake identities, overwhelming the resources and causing performance degradation or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
 Spreading Misinformation 
<p>Bad players can leverage Sybil identities to spread false information or manipulate the perception of consensus. By taking control of a significant number of identities, they can amplify their influence and create the illusion of broad support for malicious content.</p>
 Exploiting Trust and Reputation Systems 
<p>Many digital systems rely on trust and reputation systems to establish credibility and make informed decisions. During a Sybil attack, a perpetrator can create a large number of fake identities with positive reputations. This way, they may mislead others into trusting them and granting them privileges they shouldn't have.</p>
 Security Risks 
<p>Lastly, Sybil attacks can compromise user security. For instance, if a Sybil attacker gains control over multiple identities, they may have access to sensitive user information, financial data, or private communications. Horrifyingly, this may lead to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a>, fraud, or unauthorized access to personal accounts.</p>
<p>Because the consequences of Sybil attacks can be devastating to a decentralized system, it’s crucial for certain security measures to be implemented, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identity verification protocols. 
 Reputation Systems. 
 Proof-of-Work mechanisms. 
 Consensus algorithms that incentivize honest behavior. 
 
<p>By doing so, individuals may help minimize the risks and consequences of Sybil attacks, before they corrupt whole systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In spite of all these security methods, though, developing strong defenses against Sybil attacks remains a continuous challenge. Therefore, constant vigilance and research are necessary to ensure the security and integrity of digital systems.</p>
 Ways in which Sybil attacks may occur 
<p>Unlike other methods of cyberattacks, which target one type of individual in particular or have a single scope, Sybil attacks can occur in many ways, with many specific purposes. Let us examine a few of them.</p>
 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks 
<p>In this type of attack, malicious individuals can create multiple Sybil nodes and use them to flood a target system or network with requests. This process can overwhelm the system’s resources and cause it to become unresponsive. And, by controlling a large number of identities, the attackers can amplify the impact of the attack.</p>
 Influence Manipulation in Social Networks 
<p>In social networks, attackers can create multiple fake profiles and use them to manipulate discussions, spread propaganda, or artificially inflate the popularity of certain content. Because they can appear as different individuals, the attackers can exert undue influence and manipulate the perception of consensus.</p>
 Blockchain Network Attacks 
<p>In blockchain networks, malicious individuals may create numerous Sybil identities to gain control over the consensus process. By controlling a majority of identities or computing power (known as a Sybil attack on proof-of-work), the attackers may:</p>
 
 manipulate transaction verification. 
 double-spend coins. 
 launch other malicious activities that undermine the security and integrity of the blockchain. 
 
 Spamming and Reputation Manipulation 
<p>In online platforms that rely on reputation systems, such as e-commerce or review websites, an attacker can create multiple Sybil accounts to spam or manipulate ratings and reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the aid of numerous, fake identities, the attacker can artificially inflate or deflate the reputation of products, services, or individuals. And, this way, they can mislead other users and affect their decision-making.</p>
 Influence in Online Voting Systems 
<p>In online voting systems or opinion polls, attackers may create multiple Sybil identities to sway the results by casting multiple votes or skewing the perception of public opinion. In doing so, the perpetrators can distort the outcome and compromise the integrity of the voting process.</p>
<p>These examples shed a light on how Sybil attacks can be used to manipulate, disrupt, or deceive various digital systems. Preventing and minimizing these attacks often requires implementing strong security measures, such as:</p>
 
 identity verification protocols. 
 reputation systems. 
 consensus mechanisms that can differentiate between genuine users and Sybil nodes. 
 
 Sybil Attacks against Decentralized Systems 
 A brief introduction to Decentralized Systems 
<p>Decentralized systems are computing or network architectures in which authority, control, and decision-making are distributed among multiple nodes or participants. This comes in stark contrast to centralized systems, in which a single entity or central server has authority.</p>
<p>In decentralized systems, no single entity has complete control or ownership over the entire system, and participants collaborate to achieve shared goals.</p>
 Why do Sybil attacks target decentralized systems? 
<p>Sybil attacks specifically target decentralized systems because these systems rely on the assumption that each node or participant represents a unique and independent entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By creating multiple fake identities, or Sybil nodes, malicious players can exploit the inherent trust and consensus mechanisms of decentralized systems. And this, in turn, could lead to various malicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us discuss a few reasons why Sybil attacks are particularly effective against decentralized systems.</p>
 1. Exploiting Consensus Mechanisms 
<p>Decentralized systems often employ consensus mechanisms to achieve agreement among participants. Sybil attacks can undermine these mechanisms by creating a large number of fake identities that skew the consensus process. This way, attackers can manipulate voting, decision-making, or transaction verification, compromising the integrity and security of the system.</p>
 2. Gaining Disproportionate Influence 
<p>What’s commonly known about decentralized systems is that they strive to give equal power and influence to each participant. However, in a Sybil attack, a perpetrator can create numerous Sybil nodes, effectively giving them disproportionate influence over the system. This can enable the attacker to exert control, manipulate perceptions, or disrupt the normal operation of the network.</p>
 3. Exploiting Trust and Pseudonymity 
<p>Many decentralized systems rely on pseudonymous identities to protect user privacy. Unfortunately, this anonymity also creates opportunities for Sybil attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malicious individuals can create multiple fake identities that are almost indistinguishable from legitimate ones. And using these, they can deceive others into trusting them and granting them privileges or access they shouldn't have.</p>
 4. Undermining Network Resilience 
<p>Decentralized systems often emphasize resilience and fault tolerance. But, a Sybil attack can compromise these attributes by flooding the network with fake identities.</p>
<p>An attacker can overwhelm resources, disrupt communication, or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, undermining the stability and availability of the system.</p>
<p>Due to these factors, Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems. In turn, this highlights the importance of implementing strong security measures, to prevent and reduce the risks associated with Sybil attacks.</p>
 SelfKey’s Defense against Sybil Attacks and Malicious AI 
<p>The significance of digital security is amplified in decentralized systems, given the distinct challenges and vulnerabilities they entail. Some crucial aspects that require strong security measures in decentralized environments include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 preserving data integrity. 
 upholding consensus integrity. 
 mitigating network threats. 
 safeguarding digital assets. 
 fostering trust among participants. 
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks in decentralized systems can be challenging, but there are several measures that can help mitigate the risk. Let us discuss some strategies which may prevent Sybil attacks.</p>
 Identity Verification 
<p>The first step is implementing strong identity verification mechanisms to ensure that participants in the decentralized system are unique and authentic individuals. This can include verification through trusted third parties, KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, or reputation systems that assess the trustworthiness of participants based on their past behavior.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a possible solution to combat identity theft and digital duplicates. SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) to detect fake, AI-generated digital identities and identity thieves, which could considerably lower the risks associated with Sybil attacks.</p>
 Sybil Resistance Mechanisms 
<p>Another important step is to design the decentralized system with built-in Sybil resistance mechanisms. These mechanisms aim to make it difficult or costly for attackers to create and control a large number of fake identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of Sybil resistance mechanisms include proof-of-work or proof-of-stake protocols, where participants must provide computational resources or stake tokens to participate in the system.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a>, members may mint SELF tokens as a part of the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-id-poi-locking/">proof-of-individuality locking</a> protocol. Again, this is developed utilizing the power of AI to gain more accurate and quick results, as AI can read and analyze patterns which may be impossible for the naked human eye to detect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this process, SelfKey aims to prevent duplicate accounts, malicious bots, or identity thieves from accessing private accounts or systems. Locking, in this context, is done solely with the purpose of increasing digital security.</p>
 Reputation Systems 
<p>Implementing reputation systems that track and evaluate the behavior of participants in the decentralized system is another crucial step. Reputation systems can help identify suspicious or malicious activities, making it harder for attackers to blend in and gain influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants with positive reputations may be given more privileges, while those with negative reputations may be subject to additional scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this purpose, SelfKey has developed an <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">engagement system</a> which offers active members the opportunity to mint SELF tokens for their contribution to the DAO.</p>
 Consensus Algorithms 
<p>Consensus mechanisms like <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">Proof of Stake</a> (PoS) or <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practical-byzantine-fault-tolerancepbft/">Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance</a> (PBFT) can require participants to prove ownership of a significant stake. Additionally, they may require them to demonstrate a high level of computational resources. This may make it more challenging for attackers to create a large number of identities and control the network.</p>
 Randomized Node Selection 
<p>Another method which may be efficient in preventing Sybil attacks is to incorporate randomized node selection in the network's protocols and algorithms. By randomly selecting nodes for tasks, such as voting or validation, the likelihood of multiple fake identities controlled by the same attacker being chosen is reduced, making Sybil attacks less effective.</p>
 Network Monitoring and Analysis 
<p>Analyzing network traffic, node behavior, and communication patterns can help identify patterns that are indicative of Sybil attacks. Therefore, employing network monitoring tools and techniques to detect unusual or suspicious activities is crucial.</p>
 Community Engagement and Auditing 
<p>Lastly, encouraging active participation from the community in detecting and reporting potential Sybil attacks is vital. It’s also important to conduct regular audits and security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and address them promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engaging the community can create a collaborative effort to identify and mitigate the risk of Sybil attacks.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that preventing Sybil attacks entirely is challenging, and a combination of preventive measures is often necessary. The specific prevention techniques employed will depend on the nature of the decentralized system, its objectives, and the potential threat landscape.</p>
<p>What’s vital is for the community to work together and for members of a DAO to be consistently active. Not only to keep the DAO alive, but also to protect their common goals and the security and balance of the system they are a part of.</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO aims to become a digital environment which may offer both security and convenience. By utilizing the amazing potential of AI, and with the contribution of its participants, SelfKey strives to prevent cyber attacks that threaten the security and balance of our digital future.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and POI (proof of individuality), or proof of humanity locking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and POI locking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches, or 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers POI locking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and POI Locking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>POI (Proof of Individuality), or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, POI locking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a POI credential that can be locked with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By locking KEY on their POI credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's POI locking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By locking their POI credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have locked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, locking POI credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens&nbsp;as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POI locking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By locking their POI credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD POI Locking  
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's POI locking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information to ensure the security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD POI locking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By locking their POI credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

<p></p><p>I wanted to learn more about how Web5 (and SSI in general) works and the benefits it could offer. To do this I created a simple project to create and store DIDs, and use them to read and write to a DWN using a protocol.</p><p>I used the <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-sdk-js">DWN SDK</a> to create a standalone DWN, which I called a HomeNode. To create DIDs I looked at the different methods available and chose ION as I could use the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a> repo to do all the hard work. With ION Tools and the DWN SDK I then made a separate repo for interacting with the DWN, which I called a HomeNode Manager.</p><p>To test things out I created two ION-anchored DIDs (anchoring takes some time to complete) and set one of them as the tenant of the DWN. This meant only messages created by and sent to the tenant DID would be accepted by the DWN, even if the other DID was also a tenant. </p><p>To grant the second DID permission to send a message to the tenant DID, I installed a straightforward protocol to allow this. The protocol allowed a plain text message to be sent to the tenant DID by stipulating the protocol path and schema needed. If the protocol was deleted or reconfigured to stop further messages being written then the existing messages could still be accessed by the tenant. Note, there are other ways to achieve this result such as granting permission directly or perhaps using another DWN to receive messages and syncing them to other personal DWNs. </p><p>My reflections are that Web5 isn't at all how I thought it would be. It does not involve having to learn a whole new framework and you have an awful lot of freedom to build exactly what you need with your preferred tools. You could even create your own DWN SDK if you really wanted to as it's based on a DIF specification. For me, the main concern is storage and usage of keys for signing and encrypting messages. There are so many aspects to consider and seemingly lots of ways to really mess it up. </p><p>The people in the <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">TBD Discord</a> patiently put up with a lot of questions I had making this project, they really know their stuff. There is a channel called <a href="https://discord.com/channels/937858703112155166/1098207585661878402">share-what-you-do-✨</a> where you can post your own projects. I definitely recommend having a go as it really helps pin down exactly what this technology can do for you.</p><p>My project is available on <a href="https://github.com/nearlyjuly/HomeNode-Manager">GitHub</a> if you would like to try it out for yourself (and no doubt code a much better version).</p>

Crypto regulations vary significantly across the US states, leading to different compliance requirements for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), such as exchanges.  Compared to the UK, EU, Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, the US lacks a comprehensive and unified regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.  <p>It is summer, it is hot, and the crypto regulatory sentiments in the USA are increasing with the temperature.</p><p>At this present moment, the USA crypto climate is rather multi-layered. Multiple agencies and acts pose plausible scenarios and their outcomes.</p><p>The agencies are the likes of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Among the laws and regulations are the Bank Secrecy Act (including the amendments offered by the US patriot act and AMLA), the Commodity Exchange Act, the Securities Exchange Act, as well as new laws such as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act.</p><p>To survive in such a crypto climate and stay compliant with the industry-specific laws of the land, digital asset companies are expected to adhere to the Bank Secrecy Act requirements and register with the FinCEN, SEC, or&nbsp;CFTC.</p><p>The US crypto regulations may appear overwhelming, but to grasp them, one needs to look into their intricacies and nuanced wording and definitions due to their intricate construct.</p> Historical Context and Evolution <p>Since the inception of cryptocurrencies, the regulatory climate in the United States has gone through several ups and downs. Some of the major moves&nbsp;are:</p><p>2013 — <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf">FinCEN classified crypto exchanges and administrators</a> as money service businesses.</p><p>2014 — the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) <a href="https://www.irs.gov/irb/2014-16_IRB#NOT-2014-21">categorized cryptocurrencies</a> as property for tax purposes.</p><p>2015 — the Commodity Futures Trading Commission took a different stance, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/bitcoin-is-officially-a-commodity-according-to-u-s-regulator#xj4y7vzkg">designating Bitcoin as a commodity</a>.</p><p>2017 — the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131">declared that Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)</a> should fall under the purview of securities regulations.</p><p>As the US crypto regulations kept evolving, the objective behind these regulations remained more or less the same: protecting investors, preventing fraud, and ensuring compliance with AML/KYC regulations.</p><p>This regulatory intent underpins the responsibilities and actions of the various regulatory bodies.</p> Who Regulates What? <p>The complex nature of digital assets often raises the question of which regulatory body should oversee which&nbsp;asset.</p><p>Depending on whether an asset acts as a money transmitter, security, or commodity/derivative, it could fall respectively under the jurisdiction of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p><p>FinCEN works tirelessly to prevent digital assets from being utilized in money laundering or terrorist financing. The SEC oversees the issuance and resale of digital assets that bear a resemblance to securities — meanwhile, the CFTC steps in when digital assets qualify as commodities or derivatives.</p><p>Yet, a clear-cut categorization has proved elusive so far, leading to potential overlaps in jurisdiction. As such, a financial institution dealing with digital asset futures might find itself under the scrutiny of both FinCEN and&nbsp;CFTC.</p> The Battle for Cryptocurrency Jurisdiction <p>The murky lines dividing these regulatory territories gave rise to an inter-agency struggle in 2021. This battle emerged between the CFTC and the SEC, both vying to expand their regulatory control over the crypto industry.</p><p>At one point, CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz stoked the fires with a decisive statement on&nbsp;Twitter.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/CFTCquintenz/status/1422912721637580803?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>His words had more than just rhetorical weight, as <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7820-18">a Massachusetts District Court had ruled</a> in October 2018 that digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, were commodities. This ruling effectively declared that the CFTC held jurisdiction over crypto-related fraud.</p><p>It became heated. Was this a stone against SEC for overstepping its jurisdiction frame? The answer could be found most probably in the Federal Legislation.</p> Federal Legislation and Cryptocurrency <p>The Bank Secrecy Act is the most powerful piece of US federal legislation concerning cryptocurrencies. Amendments also play a role — the US Patriot Act and Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA), the Commodity Exchange Act, and the Security Exchange&nbsp;Act.</p><p>The Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, and AMLA amendments cover the anti-money laundering aspect, while the Commodity Exchange Act and Security Exchange Act — the registration of digital assets as securities and commodities.</p> The Bank Secrecy&nbsp;Act <p>Those creating digital currencies, or using them to buy goods and services, are not considered money transmitters. Hence, they are <a href="https://davitianlaw.com/cryptocurrency-defense/bank-secrecy-act/">not governed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</a>. The law also exempts individuals or businesses that utilize digital currencies, like Bitcoin, for various purposes, including mining activities and investment trading for their own accounts.</p><p>The BSA’s scope extends to certain operations within the digital currency ecosystem. Those who serve as intermediaries in cryptocurrency transactions — accepting cryptocurrencies from one party and transferring them to another in return for additional cryptocurrencies, monetary funds, or physical currency — fall under the act’s regulations.</p><p>In addition, platforms that facilitate the matching of cryptocurrency purchase and sale offers, essentially operating as trading platforms, are required to comply with the BSA. The law also applies to payment systems that act as money transmitters, orchestrating the transfer of digital money from one party to&nbsp;another.</p><p>Thus, while certain participants in the digital currency landscape are exempt from the BSA, others must ensure compliance, affirming the law’s influence within the world of virtual currencies.</p> Commodity Exchange Act and Securities Exchange&nbsp;Act <p>The Commodity Exchange Act and Securities Exchange Act apply to cryptocurrencies depending on whether they are seen as commodities or securities.</p><p>If a cryptocurrency is considered a security, the issuers and exchanges must obtain necessary licenses from the securities regulators. However, the regulatory agency CFTC has long argued that BTC and ETH are commodities and, therefore, must come under the Commodity Exchange&nbsp;Act.</p><p>The recent outcome from one of the most heated US crypto legal battles, SEC vs. Ripple Labs, significantly contributed to the ongoing cryptocurrency discourse of whether they fit into the US legal framework.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/stephenchip/status/1679535816253624320?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The ruling of the case showcased the nuanced climate of digital asset regulation. The court ruled that Ripple’s native token XRP sales on public exchanges did not violate the law. Yet, the company’s dealings with institutional investors, such as sophisticated hedge funds, fell afoul of securities laws.</p><p>This verdict showcases the urgent need for clear and precise crypto regulation.</p> Zooming in: State-by-State Look <p>Predictably, regulations across the US states vary and, in a way, reflect the crypto climate in each of&nbsp;them.</p><p>In California, the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation remains uncertain about the regulation of digital currency transmission. It is yet to decide whether it falls under California’s Money Transmission Act.</p><p>In contrast, the Department of Financial Services adopts a different approach in New York, offering a unique BitLicense for virtual currency businesses. This requires a license for nearly any commercial transfer, sale, purchase, or issuance of virtual currency.</p><p>The state of Washington defines virtual currency as money transmission. Nevertheless, the storage of virtual currency without the unilateral power to transmit is not considered money transmission.</p><p>The District of Columbia treats dealing in digital currency as a form of money transmission, requiring a license under D.C.&nbsp;law.</p><p>For the crypto exchanges, these multiple legislative frameworks mean being compliant with all of them, obtaining licenses in each State, and jumping through all other documentation loopholes.</p> Is SEC Omnipotent? <p>The SEC is asserting itself as the ultimate authority when it comes to cryptocurrency in the USA. To stand by its claims, SEC lately undertook multiple legal actions against major crypto exchanges (e.g., Gemini, Coinbase, Binance) and high-profile figures such as ex-NBA star Paul&nbsp;Pierce.</p><p>The Ripple Labs win cast a serious blow on the SEC’s unilateral decision power and its claim that 99% of cryptocurrencies are securities.</p><p>Nevertheless, the storm is far from over. Crypto juggernauts, such as Coinbase and Binance, are engaged in ongoing legal tussles with the SEC, and the outcomes of these court battles could critically shape the future trajectory of the crypto industry.</p> Measuring the Regulatory Temperatures from the US through Europe to&nbsp;Asia <p>The major difference between the US and the UK &amp; EU crypto climate is the level of conclusiveness achieved by the UK and EU in regulating the industry.</p> Europe <p>In the United Kingdom, the Financial Services and Markets Act received <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-regulations-in-the-united-kingdom-a-comprehensive-analysis">royal assent from King Charles</a> on June 29th, 2023. The law turns crypto trading in the UK into a regulated financial activity. The legislation proceeds with the vision of encouraging a transparent, thriving, sustainable, and technologically advanced financial services industry of which cryptocurrencies would be a&nbsp;part.</p><p>The same applies to the EU, where the European Parliament’s approval of the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">Markets in Crypto Assets regulations</a> will introduce structural governance practices to crypto assets. Apart from looking at crypto assets from an AML/CFT perspective, the MICA also wants to become a proactive deterrent to stop people from selling crypto assets in&nbsp;panic.</p> Asia <p>In Asia, Hong Kong has stood out with its forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency regulation.</p><p>On June 1, the city’s financial regulator rolled out <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-the-regulated-road-ahead">new rules for digital currencies</a>. With this, exchanges hoping to operate in Hong Kong now have to follow strict Anti-Money Laundering guidelines and laws that protect investors. This includes letting retail investors trade virtual assets, something that was previously limited to professional investors and traders with big bank balances.</p><p>Not far from Hong Kong, Japan is also making its mark in the crypto regulatory space. The Financial Services Agency there works hand-in-hand with two industry associations to oversee cryptocurrency regulations. Together, they have fine-tuned rules around things like derivatives trading.</p><p>Japan’s Payment Services Act even recognizes cryptocurrencies as a valid form of payment, and there are no rules stopping Japanese people from owning or investing in&nbsp;them.</p><p>Moving further southeast, Singapore has carved out its niche in the crypto regulatory domain. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has managed to navigate the tricky balance between overseeing the risks associated with crypto transactions and encouraging tech innovation.</p><p>With the launch of the Payment Services Act (PSA) in January 2020, MAS established singular legislation that governs both traditional and crypto exchanges. This Act not only brings clarity to licensing requirements but also tightens the compliance rules for crypto businesses to prevent money laundering.</p><p>Singapore further sets itself apart by referring to digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether as “digital payment tokens” under the PSA, effectively granting approved cryptocurrencies legal status and treating them similarly to other asset&nbsp;classes.</p><p>Compared to the UK, EU, and leading crypto-friendly countries in Asia like Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, the US still lacks a comprehensive and unified regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This stark contrast underscores the significant strides the US needs to make in order to match the regulatory clarity and support for digital assets seen in these jurisdictions.</p> Becoming and Staying Complaint <p>Crypto businesses already operating or planning to do so in the United States need to become and stay compliant with multiple agencies and regulations. Depending on the types of service they provide, they would have to register with the FinCEN, SEC, or CFTC. If the businesses qualify as money transmission, adhering to the BSA is also a&nbsp;must.</p><p>The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires financial institutions active within the country to help the government detect and prevent money laundering. It has to be done within the AML program framework. The businesses have to carry out risk assessment activities to ascertain their exposure to money laundering activities.</p><p>The AML program requires crypto businesses in the United States to have policies, procedures, and internal controls commensurate with the BSA and its regulations.</p><p>There should be independent testing for compliance, where individuals shall be responsible for implementing and overseeing the efficiency of the control measures. The appointment of such supervisory individuals must be complemented with ongoing training, keeping them updated on changing regulations.</p> Future Outlook <p>As heated as this summer is, the United States keeps working towards making its crypto regulations well-augmented, effective, and more extensive and&nbsp;precise.</p><p>The recent Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act to the Senate was a decisive step in this direction. If approved, the legislation promises to provide a clear framework for digital asset regulation. This includes delineating the jurisdictions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Moreover, the bill paves the way for depository institutions to issue payment stablecoins. To ensure stability, the proposed legislation mandates that institutions hold 100% of the value of all outstanding stablecoins in reserve. It also guarantees stablecoin holders the ability to redeem their assets one-to-one.</p><p>The bill would also create an outline for the tax treatment of digital assets. It advocates for an exemption from income tax for purchases using digital assets that result in a gain or loss of US$200 or&nbsp;less.</p><p>Overall, the bill is also expected to enhance the consumer protection standards.</p> Concluding Summer&nbsp;Thoughts <p>The US crypto climate remains rather fluctuating when it comes to regulations. Yet, the need for such is undoubted. Moreover, the interest shown by major financial entities, such as BlackRock, in entering the crypto industry underscores the urgency of establishing these regulations.</p><p>The crypto market is considerably large-sized in the United States. Revenue in the cryptocurrency market is about to reach US$18 Bn in 2023. Experts predict it to nearly double and become close to US$32 Bn in&nbsp;2027.</p><p>Regulating such a high-growth market poses different challenges. One of the core challenges remains how to strike a balance between the rate of innovation and the security of the&nbsp;law.</p><p>Whatever the next steps are, technology keeps thriving, demanding a thriving jurisdiction.</p><p>Happy summer!</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 Verus Protocol lead developer Mike Toutonghi explains the differences between Verus smart transactions and smart contracts. <p>The following was written by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer on the Verus Protocol, on <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discord</a>👇</p> Application Programming Model <p>The way to understand smart transactions vs. smart contracts is to think about the application programming model, and how each of them work in&nbsp;context.</p><p>There is no 1:1 correlation, but smart transactions are much easier to use in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, in a decentralized fashion.</p> Smart Contracts <p>Basically, the current model on Ethereum&nbsp;is:</p>  You run on a blockchain where the only currency where accounting is enforced by the blockchain protocol is ETH. To launch, or materialize a token, an account abstraction, or any other form of currency or identity-like structure (NFTs, liquidity pools, etc), you write an executable program/contract, according to accepted conventions, but with no actual checks that you follow any form of math accuracy, interface adherence, or accounting rules whatsoever.  The differentiation of these contracts, which are akin to stored procedures in a database, but carry with them the DB schema as well as the interface, is in the way they enable differences of implementation of those accepted conventions.  Consensus across all of Ethereum is applied to ensuring that the shared, serialized, worldwide computer that is the EVM executes its low level instructions accurately, with no accounting of currencies, exchanges, enablement of efficient, actual IDs, zk-privacy, etc. The currencies that run above the single native security currency, run by arbitrary rules, often opaque or containing unexpected behaviors, and everyone must create their version of these contracts to build a&nbsp;dApp.   Verus Smart Transactions <p>In Verus, it’s a new model as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Your dApp can run on a client or on a broad range of resource types, and it communicates via the same RPC API as the CLI commands (optionally without wallet or control functions) with a fully functional, decentralized backend, which is the Internet of Value, including all its unlimited scale, connected systems and&nbsp;chains.  Unlike a single currency blockchain, Verus smart transactions natively support an unlimited number of friendly name currencies directly via protocol and an unlimited number of blockchains for currency launches, simple sends, currency conversions, or cross-chain operations. All inputs, outputs, cross-chain imports, and even conversions are validated and in/out values of all currencies accounted for by consensus, just as native currency ins and outs are on single-currency blockchains.  Identities are a first class concept in the primitives available for dApps. They all support fully available, open, decentralized, user controlled authentication and authorization protocols, enabled by QR code or deep links and supportive of permission granting, ID provisioning/sale by the dApp, private/attested KYC and other services. These protocols can easily be bridged to OAuth or OpenID Connect via servers like Hydra, but used natively, they require no service provider between the service actually authenticating the user and the user themselves.  Every identity is multisig and has revocation and recovery capabilities. They are also transferable and can have rights bound into them in a provable manner via the contentmultimap. All of this is supported as primitives in the core RPC/CLI api/command line and in the core protocol.  IDs enable their holders to launch like-named currencies, blockchains, and single NFT-like tokens that have a super power over the ID, which is very useful for an ID that may live across multiple&nbsp;chains.  IDs and currencies may be created and launched on one chain, leveraging all of that chains capabilities (Verus includes many variations in currency, including conditional crowdfunding, liquidity pools, blockchains, etc.), and exported to other chains to be used everywhere across the network. For example, if you launch a currency on Verus or any PBaaS chain, including the native PBaaS chain’s currency. All of those currency definitions can be exported to Ethereum, and they will emerge on Ethereum as an automatically created and functional ERC20 contract, enabling the currency to be sent back and forth via protocol from then&nbsp;on.  All identities and currencies are resolvable worldwide, meaning that you can determine a network path to the nodes of the blockchain where they were defined via their friendly name, or usually via their i-address, if they have been exported cross-chain. This enables apps to scale over any number of decentralized blockchains worldwide and leave the management of user databases and user data, as well as settings, signals, endpoints, etc. to the users themselves and the client apps they use to help them&nbsp;manage.  Because the currency and liquidity pool support is in the L1 protocol, we have been able to actually solve for and provide MEV-resistant (both intra and inter-block) AMMs as a primitive, available to all applications and&nbsp;users.  <p>People don’t have to write basic liquidity and conversion protocols, which are just primitives, not apps. Real apps can use all of these primitives to deliver the next level of function. Payments, currency conversions, earning systems, polls, voting, multi-chain world scale social networks using provable streams in provable IDs, crowdfunding, independent economies. All primitives, such as IDs, currencies, blockchains, and liquidity baskets have very rich capabilities from launch to continued operation.</p> Extending Verus Smart Transactions <p>If someone wants to extend smart transactions, that is an option, but they either don’t have to, or if they really have a reason to do so, they can do it on their PBaaS chain, share or not share back (lots of reasons to do so), and now that we have the core primitive framework as a foundation, we can certainly collaborate on a kind of protocol extension that is likely to include forms of VM and/or ZKVM extension points in the current protocol, to work within the framework of the core primitives that are fundamental to Verus and that we believe are crucial for safe financial infrastructure, yet generally missing in other&nbsp;systems.</p> Try Yourself! ✅ <p>Look up <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a> to use many API commands (e.g. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">launching currencies, tokens &amp; liquidity pools</a>).</p><p>Or look up the <a href="https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md">complete command list&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Join the community.

<p>“Identity fabric” isn’t a solution in and of itself, but rather represents a comprehensive and holistic approach to managing digital identities and security. This approach prioritizes flexible, scalable, and adaptable <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/digital-identity-101/identity-management/identity-management/">identity management</a> schemes that allow administrators to manage various requirements across an entire digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>By adopting an identity fabric approach, organizations can create an <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/digital-identity-101/identity-management/what-is-iam/">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> framework that is flexible enough to adapt to emerging technologies, scalable to handle increasing volumes of identities, and robust enough to provide the security necessary for modern digital environments.</p>
<p>This is particularly crucial in the era of digital transformation, where cloud services, mobile devices, IoT devices, and new regulations are constantly changing the IAM landscape.</p>
<p>The concept of an identity fabric is designed to cover all aspects of Identity and Access Management, including:</p>
 
 Identity Lifecycle Management: Lifecycle management includes the creation, management, and removal of identities for individuals, systems, and services in an organization–a critical component of authentication- and access-based security. 
 Authentication: The backbone of perimeter security, authentication focuses on using the identities of users, devices, systems, and services to control system access. This could range from simple username-password authentication to more complex multi-factor authentication. 
 Authorization: The counterpart to authentication standards, authorization determines who can access system resources based on privileges, roles, and responsibilities. 
 Governance: Governance covers identity management’s policies, processes, and oversight to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements. 
 Federation: Federated identity management handles system identities across different infrastructures, platforms, or organizations. This includes Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities. 
 Privacy and Consent Management: Managing personal data in compliance with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and others, including gathering and managing user consent for data processing. 
 
<p>The ‘fabric’ analogy implies a level of abstraction that can unify disparate IAM tools and systems under one architecture.</p>
 What Are the Technologies Included in an Identity Fabric System? 
<p>An identity fabric solution represents a holistic approach to managing digital identities. Hence it typically employs a range of technologies and protocols, many associated with IAM and cybersecurity. Here are some of the key technologies commonly used in an identity fabric solution:</p>
 
 Identity Protocols: Protocols like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and WS-Federation are often used to standardize the communication of identity and authorization data between different systems and services. 
 Multi-Factor Authentication: Technologies that support MFA, including hardware tokens, SMS-based verification, biometric authentication, etc., are a crucial part of most identity fabric solutions to enhance security. 
 Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO technologies enable users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems and services without needing to authenticate separately for each one. 
 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): APIs are crucial for enabling interoperability between different systems and services, allowing them to exchange identity data and other information. 
 Directory Services: Technologies like LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and Active Directory provide repositories for storing user and group information, which can be used as part of an identity fabric solution. 
 Risk-based Authentication: Technologies that analyze various risk factors (e.g., user behavior, device information, location, etc.) to dynamically adjust authentication requirements. 
 Identity Governance and Administration (IGA): IGA technologies provide the ability to manage digital identities, access permissions, and security entitlements comprehensively. 
 Privileged Access Management (PAM): PAM technologies help manage and secure access to critical systems and data by privileged users (such as administrators). 
 Consent and Privacy Management: Technologies for managing user consent and personal data in compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. 
 Federation Technologies: Technologies that enable the sharing of identity information across different trust domains. 
 
<p>Remember, the specific mix of technologies used in an identity fabric solution can depend on various factors, including the organization’s particular requirements, existing IT infrastructure, compliance requirements, and more.</p>
 What Problems Does Identity Fabric Solve? 
<p>The concept of identity fabric is designed to solve several challenges modern organizations face with Identity and Access Management. These problems stem from increasingly complex IT environments characterized by the growing number of users (both inside and outside the organization), the proliferation of devices, the use of cloud and hybrid environments, and ever-evolving compliance and security requirements.</p>
<p>Some problems that identity fabric addresses include:</p>
 
 Complexity: Modern organizations often have to manage many different IAM tools and systems, each with their features, interfaces, and capabilities. An identity fabric can provide a unified, abstracted layer that simplifies the management of these diverse systems. 
 Scalability: As organizations grow and change, they need IAM systems that can scale to accommodate more users, more devices, more applications, and more data. An identity fabric is designed to be scalable, capable of growing and adapting with the organization. 
 Fragmented User Experiences: In the absence of a unified IAM strategy, users (employees, customers, partners) may have disjointed experiences when it comes to authentication, with varying requirements across different services. Identity fabric provides a seamless and consistent user experience across multiple applications and services. 
 Security: Security is a crucial concern for IAM, with a need to protect against threats like identity theft, unauthorized access, and data breaches. An identity fabric can enhance security by enabling multi-factor authentication, risk-based authentication, anomaly detection, and more across the entire digital ecosystem. 
 Compliance: Compliance with various data protection and privacy regulations is another significant challenge. An identity fabric can help manage compliance by providing features like consent management, access reviews, and auditing capabilities. 
 Interoperability: With diverse systems (on-premises applications, cloud services, mobile apps, IoT devices, etc.), ensuring they can communicate and interact effectively is a significant challenge. By its very design, identity fabric supports interoperability between these various systems. 
 Future-Proofing: The IT landscape is continually changing, with new technologies, standards, and threats always emerging. An identity fabric can help “future-proof” an organization’s IAM strategy by providing a flexible, adaptable framework that can evolve. 
 
<p>By addressing these challenges, an identity fabric can help organizations manage their identities more effectively, enhancing security, improving user experience, and driving operational efficiency.</p>
 What Is the Relationship Between Identity Fabric and Identity Orchestration? 
<p>The idea of an identity fabric refers to a comprehensive, flexible, and adaptable framework for managing digital identities across an organization’s entire IT environment, encompassing all aspects of IAM like authentication, authorization, identity lifecycle management, governance, privacy and consent management, and federation.</p>
<p>Identity fabric, being the combination of processes and technologies used to control identity management across platforms, will almost inevitably feed into the process of orchestrating identity management. In some ways, orchestration is the control of identity management–the existence of a control system that manages policies, procedures, and large-scale schemas that an organization must implement for their particular identity management needs.</p>
<p>Fabric, like the metaphor suggests, would be the “material” on which that orchestration effort is built from. The tools and technologies in that fabric (federated identity or SSO, authentication and authorization systems, decentralized identity management systems, compliant identity verification or liveness proofing, etc.) are how orchestration is managed.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the fabric will help define how orchestration efforts automate these processes. Automation is a critical aspect of identity orchestration, and as such the underlying technologies in the identity fabric (which may even include advanced systems like machine learning and AI) will help the effectiveness of broader orchestration systems.</p>
 How Does Identity Fabric Relate to Zero-Trust Architecture? 
<p>Identity fabric solutions and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/zero-trust-identity/">zero trust</a> are concepts that play a significant role in modern cybersecurity strategies. They are different but complementary, and their relationship is often essential in ensuring comprehensive security for organizations.</p>
<p>Zero trust architecture is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside their perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to their systems before granting access. This means that every user, device, and network flow is authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before being granted the minimum necessary access.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an identity fabric solution is a holistic and integrated approach to IAM that covers all aspects, including but not limited to authentication, authorization, identity lifecycle management, governance, and privacy. Identity fabric is the infrastructure that handles the diverse identity and access needs across an entire digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>The principles of zero trust heavily rely on robust identity verification and management – the user’s or device’s identity must be authenticated, and their access must be appropriately authorized based on least privilege access principles. This is where an identity fabric solution comes in. An identity fabric solution essentially forms the backbone of a zero trust architecture by providing a comprehensive framework for managing digital identities.</p>
<p>In a zero trust architecture, an identity fabric solution could provide essential functionality, such as:</p>
 
 Continuous Authentication: Authenticating users and devices whenever they attempt to access resources, regardless of their location or network. 
 Least Privilege Access: Assigning users and devices the minimum levels of access they need to perform their functions. 
 Micro-Segmentation: Segmenting the network to limit lateral movement. 
 Real-time Adaptive Policies: Dynamically adjusting access policies based on real-time risk assessment. 
 
<p>Thus, identity fabric and zero trust architecture are intimately connected. While the identity fabric provides the mechanisms for managing identities and access, zero trust utilizes these mechanisms to ensure that each access request is properly authenticated and authorized, thus enhancing an organization’s overall security posture.</p>

Participants can verify and <a href="https://unisot.com/digital-product-passport/">trace the origin</a>, movement and authenticity of goods, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain.</p>
       Decentralization 
<p>This technology, based on public blockchain and decentralized protocols, offers a trustless and transparent infrastructure. UNISOT utilizes Web3 to provide customers with a decentralized ecosystem, where data and transactions are recorded on a distributed network, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of manipulation or fraud.</p>
       Cost Efficiency 
<p>Web3 enables more efficient and cost-effective operations for customers. By leveraging decentralized networks, UNISOT can reduce the overhead costs associated with intermediaries, streamline processes, and eliminate the need for trust-based relationships. This ultimately leads to cost savings for customers utilizing our Web3 solutions.</p>
       Security and Trust 
<p>It introduces robust security mechanisms that protect customer data and transactions. UNISOT leverages cryptographic encryption and consensus algorithms inherent in Web3 to ensure the integrity and immutability of the data. By using Web3, we can offer customers an enhanced level of security, mitigating the risks associated with centralized systems.</p>
       Interoperability 
<p>Web3 technologies aim to create a more interconnected and interoperable internet. UNISOT recognizes the importance of seamless data exchange and integration across different systems and platforms. By leveraging Web3 protocols and standards, such as decentralized identifiers (DIDs), smart contracts, and decentralized data protocols, UNISOT enables interoperability between various supply chain systems, enabling efficient data sharing and collaboration.</p>
       Tokenization and Incentives 
<p>It introduces the concept of tokenization, which represents digital assets or utility within a network. UNISOT utilizes tokens to incentivize supply chain participants, rewarding them for contributing valuable data, verifying transactions or performing specific actions that benefit the ecosystem. This incentivization model promotes collaboration, participation and the sharing of accurate data, ultimately improving the overall efficiency and integrity of the supply chain.</p>
      <p>UNISOT adopts Web3 technology to leverage the benefits of transparency, decentralization, security, interoperability, and incentivization. By embracing these principles, UNISOT aims to revolutionize supply chain management and create a trusted and efficient global network for businesses to interact and transact with each other.</p>

The OOBI protocol acts as a service endpoint that associates a URI or URL with either an AID or a&nbsp;SAID.</p><p>The OOBI protocol allows KERI to leverage the existing IP and DNS infrastructure for discovery. Hence, KERI does not need its own dedicated discovery network.</p><blockquote>The OOBI protocol is “out-of-band” as it enables any internet and web search infrastructure to act as an “out-of-band” infrastructure to discover information that is verified using the “in-band” KERI protocol.</blockquote><p>Common usages of the OOBI protocol&nbsp;include:</p>  Discovery of a Key Event Log (KEL) of an&nbsp;AID,  Discovery of a Key Event Receipt Log (KERL) of an AID from one of its witnesses, and  Discovery of a Self-Addressing Data (SAD) of a&nbsp;SAID.   Basic OOBI <p>The basic form of an OOBI is a tuple that contains both a KERI AID (or a SAID) and a URL (or&nbsp;URI).</p> (url, aid) <p>The URL typically includes the word “oobi” in its path to indicate that that URL is to be used as an OOBI. For example, an OOBI may associate a URL http://93:184:216:34:8080/oobi or <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>with an AID EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM as&nbsp;follows:</p> ("http://93.184.216.34:8080/oobi", "EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM")  ("http://example.com/oobi", "EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM") <p>In this example, the OOBI’s URL may be used to discover the AID’s key event&nbsp;log.</p> OOBI as a&nbsp;URL <p>A URL and an AID can be combined into one namespaced URL where the AID’s prefix is in the path component of the URL. This makes the URL self-describing. For example, the above example may be represented as one URL, as&nbsp;follows:</p> # http://{ipaddress}:{port}/oobi/{controller_aid}<br>http://8.8.5.6:8080/oobi/EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM <p>A role of the AID may also be added at the end of the URL such as controller, witness, andwatcher.</p> http://8.8.5.6:8080/oobi/EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM/controller <p>Another example of a URL OOBI is to include both a controller’s AID and its witness’s AID, as&nbsp;follows:</p> # http://{ipaddress}:{port}/oobi/{controller_aid}/witness/{witness_aid}<br>http://8.8.5.6:8080/oobi/EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM/witness/BrHLayDN-mXKv62DAjFLX1_Y5yEUe0vA9YPe_ihiKYHE <p>where EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM is the AID of the controller whereas BrHLayDN-mXKv62DAjFLX1_Y5yEUe0vA9YPe_ihiKYHE is the AID of the controller’s witness.</p><blockquote>Note: In the KERI community, the word “OOBI” is often used as a countable noun. “An OOBI” often refers to a URL that points to a resource related to an AID or a SAID whereas “OOBIs” refer to a collection of such&nbsp;URLs.</blockquote> Security Implication <blockquote>“An OOBI by itself is considered insecure with respect to&nbsp;KERI.”</blockquote><p>IP infrastructure is not trusted by KERI, and a KERI OOBI by itself is considered insecure with respect to KERI. Hence, any information discovered by the OOBI must be verified by other means. For&nbsp;example,</p>  A KEL or a KERL discovered from an OOBI of an AID must be verified with the KERI protocol. That is to verify that all key events are consistent, all signatures from the controller are valid, and no duplicity is detected.  A SAD discovered from an OOBI of a SAID must be verified with the SAID protocol. That is to verify that the SAID is really defined from the obtained&nbsp;SAD.  <p>The policy for verifying and accepting the information discovered by the OOBI protocol is called BADA (Best-Available-Data-Acceptance), which is discussed in the following section.</p><blockquote>Note 1: Everything in KERI or that depends on KERI is end-verifiable, therefore it has no security dependency nor does it rely on security provided by web or internet infrastructure.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: KERI AIDs are derived in a completely decentralized manner, and the root-of-trust of a KERI AID is completely independent of internet and DNS addressing infrastructure. Thus an IP address or URL could be considered a type of Out-Of-Band Infrastructure (OOBI) for KERI. We call this a KERI OOBI (Out-Of-Band-Introduction) and is a special case of Out-Of-Band-Infrastructure (OOBI) with a shared&nbsp;acronym.</blockquote> IPEX (Issuance and Presentation Exchange Protocol) <p>The Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) Protocol is a secure mechanism for the issuance and presentation of Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs).</p><p>Unlike <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, where two different protocols are required for issuance and presentation, IPEX works for both. While W3C VCs are exchanged between three parties—namely an issuer, a holder, and a verifier—IPEX simplifies the exchange protocol by modeling it as disclosure of information by a Discloser to a Disclosee. This approach has two advantages:</p>  Enhanced security: A simpler protocol can be designed and analyzed to minimize and mitigate&nbsp;attacks.  Convenience: A simpler protocol is easier to implement, support, update, understand, and&nbsp;adopt.  <p>The IPEX protocol leverages properties of KERI and ACDCs, including ancillary protocols such as CESR, SAIDs, and CESR-Proofs. Through its support for Ricardian contracts and graduated disclosure, IPEX allows the disclosure of an ACDC to achieve contractually protected disclosure—including chain-link confidentiality.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e#17e4">Graduated disclosure</a> reveals the content of an ACDC compactly, partially, or selectively. More content of the ACDC may be gradually revealed in a series of interactions, i.e., in a graduated manner.</blockquote><blockquote>Contractually protected disclosure leverages graduated disclosure to contractually protect the discloser. The disclosure minimally reveals the content of the ACDC to the disclosee using, e.g., partial disclosure. The discloser may reveal more content only after the disclosee agrees to the contractual terms provided in the prior disclosure.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e#d327">Chain-link confidentiality</a> contractually links the terms and obligations agreed by the initial recipient of the ACDC to subsequent recipients. That is, subsequent recipients of the ACDC must, at the very least, agree to the same contractual terms.</blockquote><p>Given a discloser and a disclosee who wish to exchange an ACDC, IPEX has the following 5-step exchange protocol:</p>IPEX (Issuance and Presentation Exchange Protocol) Protocol (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-ipex">IPEX IETF&nbsp;Draft</a>) Step 1: Apply [Disclosee] <p>The disclosee sends an ‘Apply’ message to the discloser to request for a disclosure of an ACDC. The message’s content includes:</p>  a schema (or its SAID) of the requested ACDC,  an optional list of requested attribute fields for selective disclosure,  a signature on the ‘Apply’ message (or its&nbsp;SAID).  <blockquote>Note: If a graduated disclosure is not required in the exchange, the IPEX protocol may skip to Step 4 to fully disclose the&nbsp;ACDC.</blockquote> Step 2A: Spurn [Discloser] <p>If the discloser does not wish to disclose the requested ACDC, the discloser may reject the Apply message and terminate the exchange interaction.</p> Step 2B: Offer [Discloser] <p>If the discloser wishes to disclose the ACDC but does not yet wish to disclose the whole content of the ACDC, the discloser may send an ‘Offer’ message that includes:</p>  a schema (or its SAID) of the offered&nbsp;ACDC,  a metadata ACDC (or its SAID) that includes partial or selective disclosure of the content of the actual&nbsp;ACDC,  a signature on the ‘Offer’ message (or its&nbsp;SAID).  <p>The metadata ACDC is used to initiate a contractually-protected exchange without leaking correlation to the actual ACDC. The metadata ACDC may also contain contractual terms (as Ricardian contracts) in the "r" section, of which the disclosee must agree to further the graduated interaction.</p><blockquote>Note 1: A metadata ACDC is an ACDC with an empty top-level UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) field, "u": "". The purpose of a metadata ACDC is to provide a mechanism for a discloser to make cryptographic commitments to the metadata of a yet-to-be-disclosed ACDC without providing any correlation to that yet-to-be-disclosed ACDC.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2 Since all the variants of an ACDC are various degrees of expansion of the compact variant, a signature on any variant of the ACDC (compact, full, partial, etc.) makes a cryptographic commitment to all variants of that ACDC. Therefore, a signature on any variant may be used to verify the Issuer’s commitment to any other variant either directly or indirectly. In other words, any variant may be used in a graduated disclosure even if it is not the variant that the issuer signs. This property even applies to the metadata&nbsp;variant.</blockquote> Step 3A: Spurn [Disclosee] <p>If the disclosee is not satisfied by the revealed information or does not agree to the contractual terms provided in the metadata ACDC, the disclosee may reject the ‘Offer’ message. Consequently, the exchange interaction may be terminated, or the discloser and the disclosee may negotiate for a new ‘Offer’ message, i.e., going back to Step&nbsp;2.</p> Step 3B: Agree [Disclosee] <p>If the disclosee is satisfied by the revealed information and agrees to the contractual terms provided in the metadata ACDC, the disclosee may sign the Offer message (or its SAID). The disclosee then returns an ‘Agree’ message that contains the signed ‘Offer’ message to the discloser.</p><p>The discloser can retain the ‘Agree’ message as digital proof that the disclosee has non-repudiably signed and agreed to the contractual terms. In the event of a breach of the contractual terms, the discloser can use this digital proof to hold the disclosee legally accountable.</p> Step 4A: Spurn [Discloser] <p>The discloser may reject the ‘Agree’ message and refuse to disclose more content of the&nbsp;ACDC.</p> Step 4B: Grant [Discloser] <p>If the discloser decides to further the graduated interaction with the disclosee, the discloser may send a ‘Grant’ message to the disclosee that discloses more or the full content of the ACDC. The ‘Grant’ message includes:</p>  full disclosure of the ACDC or partial/selective disclosure that discloses more of its&nbsp;content,  a signature on the ‘Grant’ message (or its&nbsp;SAID).   Step 5: Admit [Disclosee] <p>The disclosee signs the ‘Grant’ message (or its SAID) and return it as an ‘Admit’ message to the discloser.</p><p>Again, the discloser can retain the ‘Admit’ message as non-repudiable digital proof that the disclosee has admitted the disclosure of the&nbsp;ACDC.</p><blockquote>Note: The exchange interaction may be repeated so that the discloser may progressively reveal more content of the ACDC as the disclosee agrees to more contractual terms.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-3-oobi-and-ipex-2e6b222f4b87">KERI jargon in a nutshell.

<p>Have you ever tried to sell something online? While building community through online marketplace connections is a wonderful goal, it can often get derailed by scammers. Typically, the goal of these scammers is to defraud you for either money or merchandise, but in some situations, the outcome can be much worse.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In May 2022, police in the Bronx, New York, <a href="https://longisland.news12.com/police-issue-warning-safety-tips-after-dangerous-facebook-marketplace-transactions">issued a warning</a> to local residents after a 21-year-old man was robbed at gunpoint by two people pretending to be interested in purchasing a car he had put up for sale on Facebook Marketplace. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While most of us know to be wary of strangers, the vast network of social media makes many of us feel more comfortable, which can lead to a dangerous reduction of inhibitions. It doesn’t take much for us to find ourselves in uncomfortable or even dangerous situations, either physically, financially, or emotionally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Most Common Online Marketplace Scams</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Fortunately, the more you know about the types of scams you’re likely to see in online marketplaces, the easier it will be to avoid them. While many situations involving online marketplaces have led to real-life violence, others seek to defraud you in more insidious ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Let us walk you through the types of scams you may see online and how you can protect your identity, physical safety, and wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Counterfeit goods 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s incredibly easy to post something for sale on an online marketplace. All you need to do is type the listing and put it online. Buyers should be very wary of listings that only use stock photos or are priced much lower than retail. In most cases, a deal that’s too good to be true is a scam. The buyer is counting on the seller to send either full payment or a deposit, at which point they’ll disappear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Fake rental property 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>One scam that’s been frustrating house hunters for decades now is the <a href="https://sellbuymdhomes.com/real-estate-blog/craigslist-rental-scams/">fake rental property scam</a>. Typically, a ‘landlord’ will post pictures of a house or apartment for rent, accompanied by a price that’s just a little bit lower than the average. From there, they’ll either ask for your personal details or require a deposit to secure a visit. Once they have your details or your money, the listing – along with the scammer – will vanish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Overpayment 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another common scam perpetrated on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and many other online marketplaces is <a href="https://www.doj.nh.gov/consumer/dont-cash-that-check/check-overpayment.htm">overpayment</a>. If you’re selling an item, you may be surprised when the buyer sends you more than the agreed-upon price. They’ll often say it was an accident and ask you to transfer the balance back to them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>However, this scam reveals itself when you discover that the payment was either fraudulent or canceled by the buyer. This means that you’ll lose the original balance paid to you, as well as the amount you sent to the scammer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Best Ways to Avoid Getting Scammed on Online Marketplaces</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While there will always be scammers online, there are many steps you can take to protect your physical and financial safety online. Here are some safety measures we recommend when operating in online marketplaces.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Use caution when meeting up with someone in person. It goes without saying to never, ever invite someone you met online to your home. It’s best to meet them in a neutral, public place like a coffee shop or shopping mall and bring a friend. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 If someone overpays for an item you’re selling, invite them to file a dispute with their bank. Never send them money back, even if they really put pressure on you. If it was a legitimate mistake, tell them you’ll cooperate once they file a formal refund request. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Don’t give in to high-pressure situations. If someone makes you feel pressured to buy or sell something, take a step back. This common tactic is used to create a sense of urgency that can easily cloud your judgment. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Ask for a demonstration of the product you’re purchasing. It’s easy to pretend that something works when you’re meeting the seller quickly in a parking lot. Take the time to plug it in and check it thoroughly to ensure it’s a legitimate product. &nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Verify that you’re meeting up with someone real using Dentity. Using an ID verification service like Dentity allows you to send a request and immediately get back information that can verify whether the person you’re dealing with has provided their real identity. This gives peace of mind that can help ensure you’re not getting scammed. 
 
 
 
 &nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Dentity Provides Additional Security in Online Marketplaces 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While Dentity can help offer peace of mind when you’re using an online marketplace, it cannot prevent you from getting into a potentially unsafe situation, even if you know who you’re meeting.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s essential to exercise caution when buying and selling online by employing tools like Dentity as well as common-sense measures like meeting in public and bringing a friend along. &nbsp;</p>

   What Is Federated Identity? Federated identity refers to linking a person’s electronic identity and attributes stored across multiple identity management systems.

 What Is Federated Identity? 
<p>Federated identity refers to linking a person’s electronic identity and attributes stored across multiple identity management systems. These systems use common protocols and communication standards to securely link identity to a user across several platforms and accounts without increasing threats to security.  The user’s identity is trusted across these networks–that is, “federated.”</p>
 How Does Federated Identity Work? 
<p>Federated identity works by creating agreements between different systems or domains (or federations), where each trusts the others to authenticate users and vouch for their identities. These “agreements” come in the form of token-based and secure communications between computers.</p>
<p><a>A basic SSO or federated identity authentication</a> process may look like the following:</p>
 
 Authentication Request: The service provider determines that the user is not authenticated and redirects the user to an identity provider. 
 User Authentication: The identity provider prompts the user for credentials–whether a username/password, biometric scan, or token. 
 Identity Assertion: The identity provider creates an authentication assertion, a package of information that includes the user’s identity and other relevant information, such as role or group membership. The assertion is encoded into a security token, such as a SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) token or a JWT (JSON Web Token) for OpenID Connect. 
 Response to Service Provider: The identity provider returns the security token to the service provider. This may be done by redirecting the user’s browser to the service provider, with the token included in the redirection information. 
 Service Provider Trusts the Assertion: The service provider, having a trust relationship established with the identity provider, accepts the token, validates it, and extracts the user’s information. 
 
<p>Once the provider authenticates the user, it notifies the application or platform that the user is authentic.</p>
 Federated Identity and Federal Government Work 
<p>Because of the streamlined authentication, security features, and added security when managing cloud and SaaS systems, <a>federated identity management</a> is a major part of digital technology in federal contexts. However, the security and compliance standards are different, with diverse program requirements.</p>
<p>For example, one of the primary goals of the Privacy-Enhanced Identity Federation (PEIF) Project is to develop and promote security in federated systems, especially those related to PII.  By implementing privacy-enhanced measures, the project aims to minimize the risks associated with data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access to personal information.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Federated Identity? 
<p>Federated identity systems offer several advantages for both users and organizations. These include:</p>
 
 Increased Security: With federated identity, user credentials are not stored or transmitted across multiple systems, which reduces the potential for hacking or intercepting passwords. Fewer databases and connections means a smaller attack surface. 
 Improved Privacy: Federated systems minimize the amount of data needed to authenticate, meaning that providers can better prevent loss of privacy in routine authentication or identity verification scenarios. 
 Enhanced Interoperability: Federated identity enables seamless integration and collaboration between different systems, applications, and organizations, making it easier to provide unified services to users. 
 Better User Experience: The user experience isn’t just about a pleasant interface. A better experience means that users won’t fall into the trap of using bad passwords, or reusing them across platforms. 
 
<p>Remember, while there are many benefits to federated identity, it’s also critical to managing these systems carefully, as issues in the identity provider or federation relationships can impact many systems and users.</p>
 What Are the Drawbacks of Federated Identity Systems? 
<p>While federated identity systems or <a>SSO solutions</a> offer numerous advantages, they also come with certain challenges or drawbacks, including:</p>
 
 Single Point of Failure: If the identity provider goes down, users may lose access to all connected services. This can result in significant disruption, particularly in a business context. This also applies to attacks–while these systems minimize attack surface, a single database breach can threaten an entire system. 
 Increased Complexity: Setting up and managing federated identity systems can be complex, especially when integrating systems that use different protocols. It requires participation from several providers using the same standard across all systems. 
 Dependence on Third-Party Providers: Federated identity management requires a provider, meaning that an organization would need to work with such a provider to maintain their security. This can become a drawback if that provider is untrustworthy or suffers significant failure. 
 Interoperability Issues: While federated identity is intended to increase interoperability, differences between various protocols and implementations can still cause issues in practice. For example, not all systems might support the same version of SAML or other protocols. 
 
<p>Despite these challenges, many organizations find that the benefits of federated identity outweigh the drawbacks. However, it’s essential to understand and address these issues to ensure a successful federated identity implementation.</p>
 What Technologies Make Up Federated Identity Systems? 
<p>A federated or <a>SSO</a> system isn’t a single solution, but a collection of technologies supporting authentication. Therefore, some (or most) of these technologies will communicate through specific protocols.</p>
<p>Some of these protocols and technologies include:</p>
 
 Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML): This XML-based standard facilitates exchanging authentication data between providers and other platforms.  
 OAuth 2.0: OAuth, as a protocol used to communicate authorization for different systems, is often used with other technologies to create federated identity solutions that include both authentication and authorization requirements.  
 OpenID Connect (OIDC): Used in conjunction with OAuth 2.0, this approach adds identity claims to augment the specific authorizations granted by an authorization server to authenticated users. This identity information allows organizations to verify user identity across different internal platforms and services. 
 JSON Web Token (JWT): This tech uses compact and URL-safe JSON-based tokens to convey the identity and authorization grabs of authenticated users between an identity provider and a service provider.

   Identity threat detection and response (IDTR) equips enterprises to protect digital identities along with the identity systems that manage them. 

<p>Digital identity data is a cybercriminal's favorite target. The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">2023 ForgeRock Identity Breach Report</a> revealed a 233% increase in U.S. data breaches exposing user credentials compared to the year before. The reason is simple: if stolen, user credentials enable criminals to break into entire networks. From there, they can find high-value data to steal, hold for ransom, expose, or sell.</p>
	
<p>This is why it's critical to secure your user identities and passwords and the IAM services that manage them. And it's why identity threat detection and response (ITDR) should be part of every enterprise's security strategy.</p>

<p>Last year, after a series of high-profile incidents in which IAM vendors and their infrastructure were targeted by attackers, Gartner proposed the need for an identity threat detection and response (IDTR) strategy. ITDR isn't a single solution you can buy from a vendor. It's a process for preventing, detecting, and responding to identity-based threats.</p>

<p>The firm recommends ITDR because it can detect when IAM systems are compromised, enable rapid investigations, and offer remediation suggestions to restore affected systems. ITDR can expose security misconfigurations in the IAM infrastructure and analyze identity activity in real time to detect cyberattacks.</p>

<p>Visibility is critical, and ITDR can illuminate how an attacker might compromise credentials, privileges, and entitlements to move between systems and into cloud infrastructure. By providing visibility into attack paths, it helps to mitigate these risks.</p>

 Prevention, detection, and response: the IAM and ITDR trifecta 

<p>ITDR is a multi-faceted approach to protecting identity data and the IAM infrastructure around it. It comprises technologies and best practices to protect against unauthorized access, account takeover, credential misuse, privilege escalation, and other malicious activities that target user accounts and credentials. There are three essential elements of an ITDR strategy, starting with prevention.</p>
	
   Prevention  
 <p>Prevention starts with some basic security hygiene of your IAM infrastructure, like ensuring that your users always use <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) for any systems that need passwords, go passwordless for all modern applications that can support it, and leverage continuous authorization to ensure IAM infrastructure security. You can layer in strong configuration controls to ensure no one can simply change security configuration, and add AI/ML-based behavior analytics solutions to understand user behavior better and prevent any suspicious activity.</p>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA): MFA requires users to provide more than one form of identification to access a system or application. For example, after entering a username and password or SSO credentials, a user may be required to accept a push notification from an authenticator app or enter a PIN sent to a personal device. Depending on the organization, MFA may include<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication"> passwordless authentication</a> as a factor, in which the user provides a fingerprint or facial scan.</p>
	
<p>Passwordless: Passwords are typically the weakest link in any organization's security apparatus. Removing passwords will mitigate many password-based cyberattacks, such as phishing, brute-force, and credential stuffing. However, many organizations may not be able to deliver complete passwordless authentication due to the complexity of IT systems. In these situations, delivering a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/passwordless-demystified">passwordless experience</a> while hiding the passwords is possible – passwords still exist for the legacy systems that need them, but users never see or interact with them.</p>
	
<p>Authorization: Continuous authorization involves capturing users roles, identity attributes, and contextual information, and evaluating the user's overall risk posture during every transaction, not just once during authentication. This capability combines <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-rbac-vs-abac">role-based access control</a> (RBAC) with attribute-based access control (ABAC), which assigns levels of access to users based on their authority level, responsibility, job title, status (employee vs. contractor), or department, as well as task-specific needs, such as viewing vs. editing rights. ABAC, along with risk-based access control, offers nuanced controls, such as allowing an accountant to access data while on a secure network and managed device, but not while outside the office or using a personal device.</p>
	
<p>Enterprise-wide visibility with AI/ML: IAM systems should continuously monitor login requests in real time, blocking malicious attempts and adding authentication steps when anomalous behavior is detected. Using device identification, user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), biometrics, and location intelligence, IAM tools can detect anomalies at the point of login.</p>
	
<p>Configuration security: Misconfiguration is common, and, while malicious changes in configuration to reduce security may be less frequent, either can be a huge threat to your IAM infrastructure. Your IAM platform should have tight controls to prevent changes to policies around MFA, passwords, authorization, and others. The IAM platform should also detect and alert you when any change in configuration reduces your overall security posture so that you can detect and respond to these changes appropriately.</p>
	
   Detection  
 <p>Integrated with a modern IAM system, ITDR provides centralized visibility and control over all assigned identities and privileges, continuously monitoring user activity, detecting unusual behavior, and alerting security teams. Some of its detection techniques include:</p>
	
  Configuration monitoring: Ensuring IAM systems are properly configured by continuously monitoring the system for suspicious changes. These changes may include the creation of unusual accounts or registering new authentication devices. 
   Identity monitoring: ITDR monitors login events, system logs, network traffic, user behavior analytics, and other sources of information. It continuously tracks user activities, access attempts, and changes in identity-related data. 
   Anomaly detection: ITDR relies on advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to establish patterns of user behavior and to identify deviations from those patterns. Unusual activities, such as multiple login attempts from different geographic locations, indicate potential threats. 
   Risk scoring: Based on the detected anomalies, ITDR assigns risk scores or profiles to individuals or events. These scores help prioritize and allocate resources for further investigation and response. Higher risk scores indicate a greater likelihood of identity-related threats. 
   Real-time alerts: When suspicious activities or anomalies are detected, the system generates real-time alerts to notify security teams or administrators. These alerts provide relevant details about the detected threat, enabling quick response and mitigation measures.

 <p>During response, ITDR requires interoperability with the IAM system to identify and contain the threat. If the IAM infrastructure or its data have been compromised, Gartner recommends taking a variety of actions, including (but not limited to) those that follow.</p>
	
  Contain and eradicate: Isolate the threat and disable syncing between directories, on-prem targets, and cloud user repositories. 
   Investigate: Gather additional information and assess the severity of the threat. This may involve analyzing log files, interviewing users, or using forensic to gather evidence. 
   Mitigate: Reset compromised credentials, block suspicious accounts or IP addresses, and implement additional security controls. Mitigation may also include freezing automated provisioning, quarantining certain users at risk, and stopping all account changes in IGA, IAM, and PAM. 
   Recover: Restore data from backups and collect logs from access management and governance. 
   Report: Notify executives, legal staff, and response teams early to maintain a posture of transparency and accountability. 
   Remediate: Reset affected credentials, remove rogue accounts and excessive permissions, patch systems, and rotate security keys.

<p>After the inaugural <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands Conference</a> we considered ways to keep the conversation going between events. We wanted to continue engaging with our existing Discord community and decided on a monthly Discord Stage chat that we could turn into a podcast.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">Causal Islands Podcast</a> will feature thought-provoking interviews with leading experts in distributed systems, AI, computing, local-first software, and more. We'll explore the intricate connections between tech + society and how these emerging technologies will profoundly shape our future.</p><p>For our first episode, we invited several speakers from the 2023 conference to chat about their takeaways from the event.</p>     EP01: Causal Islands 2023 Recap  0:00 /56:51 1×   <p>You'll hear:</p>  How our speakers felt about the unconventional conference, and why it's important to have more holistic conversations about emerging technologies  The talks that inspired them the most and what they learned  How we're thinking about next year's conference, including ways to make the hybrid aspect more engaging, and where we should consider hosting it  The new projects that our speakers are working on today &nbsp;  <p>Here's a glance at the episode...</p>  [2:39] Chia introduced herself as an Internet Artist and Product Designer at Figma. Chia's talk explored authorship, identity, power, and our role as mythmakers and technologists.  [3:38] Envisioning the future of computing involves looking at the political, cultural, and social implications of it. This isn't discussed at many tech conferences, but at Causal Islands, it was at the forefront.  [6:24] &nbsp;Michael R. Bernstein is a marketing, sales, and business strategy consultant for high-tech startups. He's an engineer turned marketer, and his experience serves him well as co-founder of Reify, a tech marketing agency.  [9:04] Michael used his art background to approach the problem of communicating technical ideas clearly to less technical audiences.  [11:20] One of the goals of Causal Islands is movement-building. It's a long game, and you must educate first and then sell.  [12:09] Michael tackles the adoption of new technologies by not pretending to be something you're not, adapting quickly based on feedback, and focusing on how the product solves the problem.   [13:54] Quinn is an Applied Researcher at Fission. She's building Rhizome, a decentralized database. Her Causal Islands talk was about the philosophy underpinning Rhizome. In it, she explored local-first and individual computing in contrast to a model that takes globally collapsed context and understanding into one least common denominator.   [15:07] Before we can give folks these new tools, we need to explain why thinking about computing in this way is valuable and why the tradeoffs that come with building systems in that way make more sense than they may appear at first glance.   [17:20] The talks at the conference pushed back against colonial narratives of computing and explored how technology and ideology go hand-in-hand. This made Quinn feel more comfortable going deeper into these ideas in her talk.  [23:52] Quinn felt that there was a current of optimism and our ability to build a better world using technology as long as we're thoughtful and careful about how we're building it and its implications.  [27:00] Chia walked away from the conference with a reinforced belief that to realize the future, we need to look at the layer of people, relationships, governance, ownership, and decision-making. We can't just look at infrastructure, data, or protocols. This is often missed when building autonomous and pluriversal decentralized worlds.  [27:48] Jon Corbett's talk on Indigenous Computing Theory offers so many excellent ideas and a framework that we can use to help achieve this.  [32:20] There is a consensus that we would like to host the next conference in a place that is accessible and maybe a bit off the traditional path (vs going to SoCal for a tech conference). We should consider the conference in the context of the place that we're in, and we should endeavor to bring in an audience that isn't already entrenched in the technical space - for example, community organizers and nonprofit organizations.  [39:10] We might do remote watch parties in the future. We're exploring ways to provide a better hybrid conference experience.  [43:19] Causal Islands can be like a CRDT, where we can split off and work on our projects and then meet up at a larger event. This is the blueprint that Papers We Love used.  [46:47] What's next for our speakers? Chia's involved in a remote residency - Welcome to My Homepage - at the Museum of Human Achievement. She is exploring the question, "If a website is a world, how will we attend to it as we do land?" She's also working at the Phillippine Internet Archive, documenting Filipino internet culture.  [49:40] Michael is working with clients and, in particular, exploring working with AI and safe AI attribution.  [50:22} Quinn continues to work on Rhizome. She'll also be giving a talk at CodeBEAM Europe called The Tamagotchi in my Hands: Anarcho-transhumanist Biohacking with Nerves, where she'll explore expanding her own agency by building tech that is designed only for her purposes.  [53:03] The last Strange Loop conference is coming up, and Zeeshan's Papers We Love will curate a track with eight speakers.  [54:32] Boris helped organize TrainJam, a trip from Seattle to St. Louis on the Empire Amtrak train. for folks traveling to Strange Loop. The day after StrangeLoop is a Local-First Software Unconference, that Fission is co-hosting with Ink + Switch. Tickets for the Unconference are still available.  <p>Listen to the podcast embedded above, or head to our <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">podcast landing page</a> to subscribe to the podcast on your preferred platform.</p> Episode Links and Shoutouts: <p><br>Co-Host: Boris Mann - CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Organizer of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a></p><p>Co-Host: Zeeshan Lakhani - Staff Research Engineer at <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Member of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> Programming Committee</p><p>Causal Islands Theme Song by <a href="http://depatchedmode.xyz/">depatchedmode</a></p><p>Editing by Becky Vazquez</p><p>Guest: Chia Amisola - Product Designer at <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a></p>  Chia’s Causal Islands 2023 Talk: <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/speakers/chia-amisola">The Creation Myths of Computing</a>  Chia’s Residency at the <a href="https://www.welcometomyhomepage.net/">Museum of Human Achievement</a>  <a href="https://philippineinternetarchive.com/">Philippine Internet Archive</a>  <p>Guest: Michael R.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>Deepfakes and Disinformation in Cyberspace</p>
<p>Cyberspace greatly enhances an actor's ability to engage in activities that can yield geopolitical and economic gains without resorting to the use of force. With the advent of cyberspace, various actors, including both state and non-state entities, have taken advantage of its vast interconnectedness to partake in a wide range of activities, including malicious behavior.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals and state-sponsored adversaries are always looking for new ways to exploit vulnerabilities and use new tools to target individuals and organizations. For example, in recent years, there has been an increase in the use of deepfake technology to boost the execution of advanced disinformation campaigns.</p>
<p>The manipulation of visual media is enabled by the availability of sophisticated image and video editing applications and automated manipulation algorithms that create content that can be difficult to distinguish from real footage. While deepfake technology can be used for fun or for artistic value, some actors could use it for malicious purposes, such as spreading propaganda or disinformation.</p>
<p>Advanced disinformation campaigns are one of the most sophisticated and persistent cybersecurity threats. Disinformation is defined as the dissemination of false, erroneous, or misleading information designed to deliberately cause public harm. The integration of deepfake technology in these campaigns allows adversaries to target the very fabric of society.</p>
<p>Future trends and challenges</p>
<p>(Geo)political objectives constitute the primary driving force behind disinformation campaigns that utilize deepfakes, frequently carried out by state actors and other politically motivated groups. While governments and intelligence agencies have historically used deception and media manipulation, the accessibility to create realistic images, videos, or audio has now extended to almost any actor.</p>
<p>Deepfakes require a wide dataset containing images, videos, or voice recordings of the targeted person. The data is fed into a program that learns the victim's key features and uses the learned information to modify an existing photo or video. Essentially, deepfake technology can create a synthetic video or image that realistically represents anyone in the world.</p>
<p>Deepfakes can be used to create false content of political figures, candidates, or public figures engaging in controversial or damaging behavior. As a result, this can lead to the spread of false information, conspiracy theories, or sensationalized stories that undermine trust, sow division, and evade accountability.</p>
<p>In addition, advanced disinformation campaigns can use deepfakes to rewrite history or manipulate cultural narratives. For example, tampering with historical footage or altering famous speeches can distort the public's understanding of significant events, leading to confusion, denial, or the promotion of alternative narratives.</p>
<p>Advanced disinformation campaigns can also use deepfakes to create sophisticated financial scams or fraud schemes. Fraudsters and cyber criminals could use voice manipulation techniques to impersonate someone in a phone call, tricking individuals or organizations into providing sensitive information or authorizing financial transactions.</p>
<p>How to move forward?</p>
<p>Detecting and countering deepfakes, along with promoting media literacy and critical thinking, are essential to mitigating the impact of advanced disinformation tactics. Countermeasures against deepfakes have been developed to help identify and alleviate their impact. Here are some common approaches:</p>
 
 Advanced detection technology: Implementing sophisticated detection algorithms and AI-driven tools can help identify altered content. 
 Source verification: Encouraging users to verify the sources of information they share and promoting credible news outlets can help reduce the spread of false information. 
 Digital watermarking: Embedding digital watermarks in original content can enhance traceability and accountability. 
 Public awareness and education: Promoting media literacy and critical thinking skills among the public can empower individuals to question the authenticity of information they encounter. 
 Collaboration with social media platforms: Establishing trust between tech companies and the public sector is essential to combat deepfakes and disinformation campaigns. 
 Government Regulations: Creating new regulations and legal frameworks can act as a deterrent and provide consequences for malicious actors. 
 
<p>As rogue nations continue to foster an environment for cybercriminals to thrive, individuals and organizations need to be prepared and build a strong cybersecurity foundation. It's important to note that the field of deepfakes is evolving rapidly, and countermeasures need to continually adapt to new techniques and advancements. Therefore, a multi-faceted approach that combines technical solutions, user education, and policy development is necessary to mitigate the risks associated with deepfakes.</p>
<p>Deepfakes and disinformation campaigns are in the focus of KuppingerCole’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a>&nbsp;event in Frankfurt from 14-16 November which will look at tackling future cybersecurity threats. Presentations will focus on a range of topics, including how AI enables cyber attackers and defenders, securing the autonomous world and the cloud, advancements in quantum computing, detecting deepfakes, securing IoT devices, securing business communication channels and supply chains, protecting digital identities, and the security challenges of Web3 and the metaverse.</p>

   Like anything, AI can be used maliciously. But when used for good, AI can be a game changer. 
	
<p>In May of this year, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) agreed to adopt a blanket ban on the use of remote biometric identification (facial recognition) in public spaces along with predictive policing tools as part of the EU's <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/">AI Act</a>. The ban is a departure from the original proposal and the position backed in Council by EU member countries.</p>

<p>I believe the ban is a mistake that's being fueled by fears about AI.</p>

<p>Government and industry must work together to educate the public about the benefits of AI and its ability to detect and fend off threats in cybersecurity and beyond. People's distrust in AI underscores the need for education, not halting the use of AI. At ForgeRock, we believe that AI is a powerful tool in fraud prevention and the protection of sensitive data. But we also believe that people deserve to know how AI works, and that starts with transparency – made possible through explainable AI.</p>

<p>Explainable AI provides citizens and consumers with the reasons why the AI made a particular choice and enables organizations to understand AI decisioning and make corrections as needed.</p>

 AI's role in cybersecurity 

<p>In an increasingly digital world, AI can help companies combat <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/enterprises-are-getting-better-breach-prevention-attackers-are-getting-better-too">cybercrime</a>. In our industry, identity and access management (IAM), AI is especially valuable, because it can help to prevent identity-based attacks, which are the leading cause of data breaches.</p>

<p>With AI's ability to analyze large quantities of data and recognize patterns, it can quickly and automatically block known threats and bot activity. AI can be used to monitor user behavior and make real-time decisions about whether to grant access or add step-up authentication if there is anything anomalous about the request (such as a login from an unusual timezone).</p>

<p>This application of AI is known as risk decisioning, and it's what fuels our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">ForgeRock Autonomous Access</a> threat protection product. Autonomous Access takes in a range of signals about who is trying to do what, and then determines what they can or cannot do next. If it detects a threat or anomalous behavior, its dashboard explains the decision in human-readable form. Admins get a detailed view of access events along with an explanation of the risky authentication attempt – this makes it easier to explain to legitimate users why they were asked for further proof of their identity. Perhaps they got a new device or were connecting from an unfamiliar network.</p>

<p>Organizations with AI-powered identity and access management can detect unexpected activity, stopping intruders in real time as they try to authenticate. They can also automate the process of eliminating over-provisioned access that enables attackers to use one compromised account to move laterally to higher-value targets.</p>
	
 The benefits of AI in cybersecurity 
	
<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) can boost the speed and effectiveness of cybersecurity.</p>

  Recognizing suspicious activity: AI excels in pattern recognition and can quickly analyze access attempts and user activity to identify suspicious behavior and potentially malicious activity. Plus, it continuously gets smarter at identifying the difference between normal behaviors and emerging threat patterns. 
   Speed and scalability: AI can process and analyze large sets of data far more quickly than humans. 
   Managing digital identity: The use of AI can help with managing digital identities and access permissions more efficiently, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">restricting access to systems and files</a> based on a user's role, behavior, or risk score, along with the sensitivity of the data being accessed. 
   Assisting analytics efforts: By analyzing historical data, AI can help to predict future cybersecurity threats. It can also analyze user behavior to identify unusual activity that humans could miss. 
   Improving authentication options: By analyzing contextual factors, such as location, device, and behavior, AI can calculate the risk level of an action or request and issue the appropriate authentication response. Trusted users can sail through authentication with choices like <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>, while suspicious or high-risk requests are prompted for further authentication or stopped and held for remediation. 
  Attackers are using AI. We should, too. 

<p>The fear of AI is understandable – its future is unknown and its potential for misuse is high. It also raises serious privacy concerns when facial recognition technology is involved, which undoubtedly led to the EU's recent ban.</p>

<p>But it's important to remember that AI is already playing an essential role in keeping us safe from sophisticated attacks, including those that are themselves fueled by AI. The advent of generative AI makes it far easier to impersonate others, and there's been an increase in attackers exploiting AI to develop new malware, create synthetic identities, and generate more targeted and authentic-looking phishing campaigns. Organizations that resist the use of AI in cybersecurity will be hamstrung in their efforts to defend against these attacks.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>In today’s online world, the importance of robust cybersecurity measures cannot be overstated. Cyber threats continue to evolve, and organizations, both public and private, face a constant battle to protect sensitive data from malicious actors. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/07/18/readout-of-white-house-multifactor-authentication-modernization-symposium/">a significant event</a>, the Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Modernization Symposium, was jointly hosted by the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of the National Cyber Director, the National Security Council, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. This symposium brought together industry and government leaders to discuss the urgent need for advancing <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant authentication</a>. As organizations contemplate how to best protect their organization, the symposium's insights serve as a powerful driving factor to adopt passwordless MFA now.</p> 
 The Time for Modern Authentication Is Now  
<p>Federal Chief Information Officer Clare Martorana captured the essence of the symposium's purpose — to deliver a positive, intuitive and trusted digital experience for users. Modernizing authentication methods is a key aspect of achieving this goal. The traditional reliance on passwords has proven inadequate in deterring cyber threats. Cybercriminals have become adept at <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/overview-different-types-of-password-attacks">exploiting password vulnerabilities</a> through phishing attacks, social engineering, and data breaches. As a result, adopting passwordless MFA is crucial in creating a resilient cybersecurity framework.</p> 
 Simplicity and Security Should Not Be Mutually Exclusive  
<p>Federal CISO and Deputy National Cyber Director Chris DeRusha highlighted that security doesn’t have to be complex to be effective. In fact, passwordless MFA, including passkeys, offers a simple yet strong methodology to protect organizations. By requiring multiple factors for user verification, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">passwordless MFA</a> significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p> 
<p>Implementing MFA not only strengthens security but also aligns with the President's Executive Order on cybersecurity. This alignment reinforces the notion that securing the authentication process, data and systems is a collective responsibility that extends to both public and private sectors.</p> 
 Collaborative Technology Strategies  
<p>The symposium showcased the importance of collaboration between public and private sectors to develop an interoperable and user-friendly MFA ecosystem. By combining efforts, organizations can learn from each other's best practices and collectively address shared security goals. Doing so enables in-depth discussions about contemporary MFA technologies and their potential impact.</p> 
 The Vision for a Safer Future  
<p>Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger called for identifying and addressing barriers to MFA adoption indicates the government's determination to support organizations in their quest for enhanced cybersecurity. As organizations embrace MFA, they not only protect their interests but also contribute to the nation's overall cyber defense strategy.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>In light of the recent Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Modernization Symposium and the resounding calls for embracing MFA, the time is now for organizations to adopt passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA. The prevailing cyber threats demand a shift away from reliance on passwords and towards stronger, multi-factor authentication methods. As the public and private sectors collaborate to develop interoperable and user-friendly MFA ecosystems, organizations can better safeguard their digital assets and provide users with a seamless and secure online experience.</p> 
<p>By aligning their technology strategies with <a href="https://www.hypr.com/">contemporary MFA technologies</a> and policies, organizations contribute not only to their own security but also to the overall cybersecurity landscape of the nation. Through collective efforts, we can build a more resilient and secure digital future.</p>

<p>It’s tough to recap my experience of DWeb Camp 2023. It was an intense, invigorating, and innovative event, as was the work leading up to it. Maybe the best thing I can do is try to tell the story of the Emergence app and provide my perspective on Holochain’s involvement and learning throughout this process. So, here goes:</p> Intent <p>In March 2023 Holochain began conversations with DWeb Camp about sponsorship and offered to create a simple application for note taking and community connection (via a tag cloud and shared space for documentation). This was intended to increase the collective intelligence of the camp and to help document the conference sessions. As a local-first, peer-to-peer application it would run directly on participants' laptops and connect over the mesh network LAN that the wonderful DWeb network team sets up each year, thus not needing to connect to central servers or the rest of the internet. </p><p>At the 2022 DWeb Camp many of us experienced challenges with the scheduling app Sched. Because everyone at camp was connecting to their servers over the same low bandwidth connection, camp participants had ongoing issues loading and accessing the schedule. These conditions are exactly where distributed applications shine, and we saw this as an opportunity to give people a strong experience of a local-first application.</p> Tomorrow <p>After some conversations with DWeb’s organizing team, this initial idea grew into a plan to have our app act as a decentralized Sched and to actually facilitate a day of “open-space” style sessions, coordinating the schedule as an emergent process amongst all of the camp participants. This day became known as “Tomorrow” — a day for stepping into and embodying the technologies and social patterns that the distributed web is building towards. On that day, access to the wider Internet would be shut off so as to give all of us distributed web tool builders a real opportunity to put our tools where our mouths are! Furthermore, to double down on decentralization, during this day all the participants would be using our app for proposing sessions and coordinating in which spaces they would go.</p><p>This felt like a really exciting opportunity that we couldn’t pass up, but it came with some significant challenges. The main one being that the app would have to work on cell phones because it just wasn’t going to be feasible to have 400 people toting their laptops around the forests of Camp Navaro just to add in their sessions and browse the schedule. But therein lay the rub: Holochain is not yet cell phone ready. So, to do this, we would actually need to either get it ready for phones, or come up with a work-around that was more like Holo-hosting, where cell phone users could just use a browser to access a Holochain instance through a proxy. But of course we couldn’t use actual Holo-hosting itself because this was all supposed to work on a day where access to the wider internet was off!</p>Introducing Tomorrow. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>. The Plan <p>We decided to go for both options: As Plan A, we would move forward on our “zero-arc” solution for running Holochain on cell phones directly. This solution disables gossip (and thus gets around the cell phone OS penchant of killing apps that use too much CPU/Memory/Networking), but still allows each person’s source-chain to live on the phone. As a backup, in case we couldn’t get plan A to work in time (we only had a few months), we would also develop a multiplexer, a kind of “Holo-hosting-light,” that would allow browser access to a pool of Holochain conductors that we would run on a cluster of small boxes on-site. The irony was not lost on us that to get things working in this setting we would have to do a kind of micro-re-centralization of a fully distributed tool, but this is still a useful configuration of the tech to explore!</p><p>So, I did some project planning, initial app prototyping, and smoke testing for our Plan B just to make sure that Holochain could handle the load of 500 people creating sessions and doing all kinds of activities on the 3 conductors in the multiplexer which we thought would be sufficient for our little cluster. The results looked great, no load problems. We also had a nice project plan with the various aspects of all the work and our participation in the conference, spreading out the labor and ensuring buy-in across all the stakeholders, and so we gave the green light to go ahead.</p><p>The fantastic <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/starpause/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Jordan Gray</a> took the initial design requirements and created the basic UX layout for the app. From Jordan’s designs, I built out the DNA for the app and Svelte-based single-page-app front-end. We then invested significant time in building this into a reasonably polished user experience with many, many rounds of UX/UI testing and improvements so that the app would really work well for the event and provide a powerful experience both of a distributed app, but also of the distributed coordination of a conference event. We really wanted to deliver on the ethos of the D in DWeb both at the technical and social levels.</p>Emergence app sessions page with example data. The Details <p>But it turns out that there are also a couple of other challenging Ds: those of the Devil in the Details.</p><p>For a number of complex reasons, we realized about six weeks before the event that Plan A for mobile wasn’t going to land in time for DWeb. There were too many development steps with too much risk to be able to be sure it would work. Though we had the conductor compiling and working on iOS and Android, some aspects of networking were being blocked, and we realized that there just wasn’t enough time to test, debug, and get the app through the Apple/Google App/Play-Store deployment process. So we switched completely to Plan B which appeared to be working very well. I was able to build the multiplexer in a weekend, which was what we expected because it's a fairly low complexity solution. It’s just a simple Node web app sitting behind a reverse-proxy which does 3 things: 1) installs app instances using people’s keys and passwords as a seed for generating their key-pair, 2) creates a UI credential that gets stored in people’s browser as a cookie, and 3) accepts zome calls from the UI signed using that credential and forwards it to the appropriate conductor.</p><p>But then things started to get hairy: as we ran our testing sessions with more and more people, we started to get zome-call timeouts and other symptoms that looked like conductor overload. This was quite surprising as it was happening at levels of interaction well below those we subjected the conductor to in our initial smoke-testing. We soon discovered that this was because users were often just reloading their web-browsers which was dropping in-progress websocket connections to the conductor. Holochain was designed under the assumption of a single user connecting over a few websockets to a local conductor, here we were creating hundreds of unexpected websocket connections. To fix this, we added web-socket connection multiplexing into our multiplexer setup! This improved things, but still, after a while, things stopped working again. Grrrr. </p><p>So then, as we continued to debug these issues, we really started seeing the rise of additional contextual complexity. Example: our plan for deploying to our cluster using our internal nix infrastructure (based on hydra), was implemented, but incomplete because we discovered that we wouldn’t be able to serve our multiplexer service over plain http because cell phone browsers get grumpy about that and basically require https for decent user experience. So we had to include adding and provisioning ssl certificates to reverse-proxy web-servers. And well, it just snowballed from there…</p> What Happened Tomorrow Browser based key registration for the Emergence app at DWeb Camp 2023<p>At this point I’m going to stop the blow-by-blow of all of the failure modes we encountered in processes, like converting and uploading data from Sched (which we wanted to do so people could take notes on the sessions all week long), or our development machines mysteriously taking forever to deploy data to the cluster because they were actually connected to a very slow Wifi when the Ubuntu UI showed that they were on the Ethernet, etc. Each one of these issues was fixable. Each one took minutes or hours to address. Time and again, we had successful test-runs followed by complete failures.</p><p>When we got to DWeb Camp it looked like the app was finally ready, but then this saga continued all throughout the build days, and even into the two days leading up to Saturday’s Tomorrow day of emergent sessions. We did, finally, get it working. Bugs at all levels, from the UI to the network configurations, to Holochain itself, were squashed. However, by this point, the DWeb conference team had already made the call to use the backup analog process for conference scheduling (which was a more than reasonable decision given the challenges up to that point), but we were still going to use the app for its initial purpose of note-taking and sensemaking. So, there we are with the whole cluster provisioned and hundreds of people starting to use the app when suddenly the power went out to the whole valley. This meant that though peoples’ phones were operating, there was no local LAN to connect to because the Wifi access points were down. It was a perfect example of an unending series of cascading failure modes, and an ideal embodiment of exactly what the Tomorrow day was supposed to be a test of: how fully decentralized can our tech stack be? Not just as we talk about it, but in actual practice, in the middle of a camp in the redwood forest.</p><p>On the flip-side, this led to a beautiful experience in further emergence. We had planned to do a get-your-hands-on-it session for people to experience running various Holochan apps. Well, that actually worked! Because even though the Wifi access points were down, we had the idea of turning on a cell-phone’s hot-spot functionality which, even without cell service, made it an ad-hoc Wifi router for Holochain nodes on laptops to connect in the middle of the woods with no power! This felt like a significant real-life demo of the power of local-first distributed computing architecture.</p> Lessons in Complexity and Teamwork Just a few of the Holochain team at DWeb Camp 2023. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2023?tab=collection">Brad Shirakawa</a>.<p>So in the end, what did we learn? Well, there were many lessons, small and large, which we are integrating back into our work, process, and code. Part of the difficulty of expanding contextual complexity comes precisely from the fact that it is invisible at the outset, even when you account for invisible additional complexity, which we did. We certainly detected and fixed a bunch of subtle performance bugs in Holochain. And we greatly increased our in-house capacity to build out apps with decent user-experience.</p><p>One of the most powerful lessons for me, however, was the lived experience of what an amazing team we have assembled. As each one of the problems we encountered arose, someone jumped forward to help figure it out, or work on it until we moved through to the next challenge. I find that our team’s collaboration isn’t just about solving the problem, but the grace and joy of working together in doing so. </p><p>I also want to personally (and on behalf of Holochain), thank the DWeb community and especially the on-site network team. Your tireless work was inspirational as well as being essential to everything we did. It was a pleasure to work with you. </p><p>The invitation of DWeb’s “Tomorrow” to take risks and bring technologies to use rather then just talking about them was answered by Holochain and others. It served as a forcing function to put our tooling and teamwork to the test in a setting where the contextual complexity was quite high. With Holochain in beta, this experience allowed us to squash some very difficult to find bugs. We will continue to prioritize partnerships and projects that put Holochain to the test. And if anybody is interested in using a very cool app for helping run open-space/unconference style gatherings, please get in touch with us!</p><p>Special thanks to Eric Bear (process design, testing, holding the relationship with DWeb), Jordan Gray (initial spec), Aaron Brodeur (UX/UI), David Braden (multiplexer &amp; app stress testing, tooling, and Holochain debugging), Jost Schulte (testing across all levels), Stefan Junker (network infrastructure and nix deployment), Gregory Jensen (Holochain testing and debugging), and the many others who put time and labor into this project. Similarly, thank you to everyone in the Holochain team and community who showed up to the repeated test sessions both before and at DWeb Camp.</p>
