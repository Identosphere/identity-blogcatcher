<p>2024 goes down in history as the year with the largest and most destructive <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>.</p>



<p>The non-profit <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/latest-alerts/">Identity Theft Resource Centre</a> says in the first half of 2024, the number of data breach victims surpassed 1 billion—a 490 per cent increase from the same time last year.</p>



<p>In 2024, masses of personal information from tens of millions of people—and sensitive medical data from roughly one-third of all Americans—was stolen and posted online. Other countries had similar large-scale breaches, such as the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/05/cybersecurity-news-lockbit-scattered-spider/">UK military data breach</a> and Australia’s <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/medisecure-hit-by-cyber-security-breach-607992">MediSecure data breach</a> which affected <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/medisecure-hit-by-cyber-security-breach-607992">around 12.9 million people</a> or roughly half of the country’s population.</p>



<p>Here’s a recap of the largest data breaches in the U.S. in 2024:</p>



 “Mother of all data breaches” 



<p>The year kicked off early as a record-breaking year for data breaches, with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/01/23/massive-26-billion-record-leak-dropbox-linkedin-twitterx-all-named/">“mother of all data breaches”</a>—a 12-terabyte database containing 26 billion leaked data records—discovered in January.</p>



<p>The data came from users of Chinese messaging giant Tencent; social media platform Weibo; platforms and services such as Twitter, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Adobe, Canva and Telegram; and various U.S. and other government organizations. In the hands of threat actors, the data could be used for a vast variety of attacks, including identity theft, sophisticated phishing schemes, targeted cyberattacks, and unauthorized access to personal and sensitive accounts.</p>



<p>Authorities say some of the data isn’t new and is probably more likely compiled records from thousands of previous breaches and data leaks, but combinations of passwords and usernames in the data still present significant risk for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing#:~:text=Credential%20stuffing%20is%20a%20type,user%20accounts%20on%20other%20systems">credential stuffing</a> attacks.</p>



 National Public Data data breach 



<p>More shocking because it is newly breached data is the National Public Data data breach in August 2024, which exposed <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/national-public-data-breach-what-you-need-to-know-843686f7-06e2-4e91-8a3f-ae30b7213535">2.9 billion records</a> (full names, social security numbers, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers) of up to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/national-public-data-breach-what-you-need-to-know-843686f7-06e2-4e91-8a3f-ae30b7213535">170 million people in the U.S., Canada and the UK</a>.</p>



<p>The breach occurred because the NPD, an online background check and fraud prevention service (data broker), website had inadvertently published a zip file with the back-end passwords for the database. The stolen data included American social security numbers, and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/08/national-public-data-published-its-own-passwords/">experts</a> say it’s pretty likely that all social security numbers have been compromised.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already done so, follow the <a href="https://hr.berkeley.edu/news/national-public-data-breach-what-you-can-do">advice</a> to freeze your credit file at each of the major consumer reporting bureaus, and closely monitor your accounts for suspicious activity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, National Public Data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/national-public-data-the-hacked-data-broker-that-lost-millions-of-social-security-numbers-and-more-files-for-bankruptcy/">filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>



 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/28/100-million-americans-medical-records-exposed-in-massive-data-breach/">Change Healthcare</a> 



<p>Considered <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/28/100-million-americans-medical-records-exposed-in-massive-data-breach/">“the largest healthcare data exposure in U.S. history”</a>, the Change Healthcare data breach exposed the personal, medical and billing information of 100 million customers, or roughly one-third of all Americans¾a number that is likely to rise.</p>



<p>In February 2024 the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group breached UnitedHealth’s Change Healthcare platform, a widely used payment processing system in the healthcare industry, stealing the data, disrupting billing and payment processing, and delaying patient care. And since the payment processing system is integral to healthcare infrastructure in the US, the impact went well beyond UnitedHealth to also impact <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/28/100-million-americans-medical-records-exposed-in-massive-data-breach/">innumerable</a> hospitals, clinics, and medical practices.</p>



<p>For more, see this <a href="https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/ns/health-data-breach.html">support page</a>.</p>



 <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/ATT-data-breach-Whats-next-for-affected-customers">AT&amp;T</a> (two data breaches) 



<p>In July the telecomms giant announcedcybercriminals had stolen&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/">the phone numbers and call records of “nearly all” of its customers, or around 110 million people</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/2024-in-data-breaches-1-billion-stolen-records-and-rising/">TechCrunch</a> says while the records don’t contain contents of texts and phone calls, the “metadata” still reveals who called who and when, and in some cases the data can be used to infer approximate locations.</p>



<p>This breach followed a data breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/2024-in-data-breaches-1-billion-stolen-records-and-rising/">73 million</a> AT&amp;T customer records in March.</p>



 <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epam-snowflake-ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters/">Ticketmaster</a> (Snowflake) 



<p>Ticketmaster was caught up in the much larger series of data thefts from cloud data giant Snowflake’s corporate customers this year, losing an alleged 560 million records. Read the hackers’ account of how they breached Ticketmaster, as told to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epam-snowflake-ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters/">WIRED</a>.</p>



 How to stay safe in 2025 



<p>The year 2024 was clearly a bad year for data breaches, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/11/21/top-cyber-threats-to-protect-your-organization-from-in-2025/#:~:text=Expect%202025%20to%20be%20an,compliance%20and%20maintain%20operational%20integrity.">experts</a> say there’s no end in sight.</p>



<p>As a consumer, there’s never been a better time to proactively protect your personal information. If you discover your personal information was exposed in a data breach, quickly change your passwords, add a fraud alert to your credit reports, and place a freeze on your credit reports. More helpful advice is available at the non-profit<a> </a><a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Identity Theft Resource Centre</a>.</p>

 Last thoughts 



<p>Data breaches aren’t going away. They’re getting more sophisticated and the increase in ransomware attacks means even criminals with little computer skill can pull them off. If you consider that the number of data breaches in the U.S. was <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/">447 in 2012</a> and more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/">3,200 in 2023</a>, and that the cost of cybercrime is increasing <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/">15 per cent</a> year over year, the future for data privacy will likely be bleaker not better—unless you take steps to protect yourself.<br><br>Download <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a>.<br>Download <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a>.<br>Discover other <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals">MySudo apps</a>.</p>

			 What is a VPN (Virtual Private Network) and what is it for? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>In recent years, increasing focus on online privacy and security has led many people to discover tools such as VPNs. With the increase in cyber threats and risks associated with surfing online, protecting one’s personal data has become a priority for many users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most effective solutions to guarantee security and privacy when accessing the Internet is to use a VPN, a service that protects data transmission on public networks and preserves one’s identity by detecting and rejecting malware, phishing and fraud attempts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This tool allows you to surf the Internet anonymously, protecting your information from eavesdropping and malicious attacks. But what is a VPN and what makes it so useful?</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is a VPN and why is it important? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It is a technology that creates a private connection between your own device and the Internet. In practice, a VPN connection allows you to surf online more securely by masking your IP address and encrypting your data in transit. This means that your information is more difficult to intercept by third parties, such as hackers or individuals trying to monitor your online activity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using this type of connection is essential to ensure security and privacy, especially in situations where the risk of personal data exposure is high. For instance, when you connect to public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in bars, restaurants or airports, your data can easily be intercepted by malicious attackers who could connect to your device. By encrypting your connection, a Virtual Private Network prevents information from being stolen or monitored even on these public networks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, many organisations, including marketing agencies, try to monitor your behaviour as you browse in order to collect personal information, such as history and sensitive data. To protect your privacy and prevent your data from being used without your consent, it is essential to use a private network. In fact, using a VPN makes it almost impossible for anyone to monitor your online activities, ensuring that your information remains protected and out of reach of prying eyes.</p>   						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Are VPNs legal? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>One of the most frequently asked questions concerns the legality of this tool: are VPNs legal? The answer depends on the country you are in. In general, the use of a VPN is legal in most countries, including the UK and Italy, but there are some exceptions. The key lies in the way the technology is used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While using this type of connection to protect privacy and surf safely is perfectly legal, in some countries the use of a private network to circumvent certain government controls or to access prohibited content may be restricted.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is a VPN for? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							As mentioned above, a Virtual Private Network is an indispensable tool for protecting data and privacy online. By using it, you can surf more safely and defend yourself against potential threats.

&nbsp;

Here are the main functions of a VPN connection:

&nbsp;
 
 	 Personal Data protection. A private network encrypts your Internet connection, making data, such as passwords and banking information, invisible to anyone trying to intercept them, especially on public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks. 
 	 Online anonymity. By hiding your IP address, it allows you to surf without being tracked. This means that websites cannot collect information on your location or surfing habits, guaranteeing completely private surfing. 
 	 Increased security. A VPN service protects online traffic from external attacks, such as hackers, and reduces the risk of unauthorised access. In addition, some private networks offer advanced features to protect against web threats, such as blocking suspicious applications in case of abnormal activity, malware and intrusive advertisements. 
 						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How does a VPN work? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>A virtual private network protects your Internet connection by creating a channel through which data travels encrypted, preventing anyone from intercepting or monitoring it.</p><p>Here is how a VPN works in greater detail:</p>  User and server authentication. When you connect to a Virtual Private Network, your device is first authenticated by the server. This ensures that only authorised users can access the private network.  Data encryption. Once authenticated, the server applies an encryption protocol to the data you send and receive. Encryption makes your data unintelligible to anyone attempting to intercept it, protecting your personal information during transmission. This creates a secure data exchange ‘tunnel’ that makes it impossible for third parties, hackers and even your service provider (ISP), to view the content passing over your connection.  Encapsulation of data packets. Data is wrapped in an external packet, which is also encrypted. This encapsulation process makes it even more difficult for anyone to access the data, keeping it safe during transfer.  Data decryption. Once data arrives at the destination server, the external packet is removed via a decryption process, allowing the data to be read securely.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, a VPN works by creating a private and confidential connection between your device and the destination server, ensuring that your data can be transmitted encrypted and protected. Using an encrypted tunnel prevents data from being intercepted or used without your consent.</p>

<p>Thales has signed a contract with Luchtverkeersleiding Nederland (LVNL), the Dutch Air Navigation Services Provider for the delivery of the RSM NG digital Secondary Surveillance Radar with increased performance and reliability for safer air traffic management. Thales’s RSM NG radar will replace Schiphol airport’s current secondary radar with no interruption of service, reinforcing Air Traffic Control at one of the Europe’s busiest airports. </p>
<p>As air traffic increases, air passengers’ safety&nbsp;does not start in the sky, it starts as soon as the airplane is on the ground and air traffic controllers need to know an&nbsp;airplane’s position at all times to ensure security and passenger safety. </p>
<p>The RSM NG is the newest generation of Secondary Surveillance Radars from Thales. Secondary radars are responsible for providing data for the proper management of air traffic by sending interrogations to the transponder of the aircraft, which then responds to the radar with their identification information, position, speed, and other characteristics. This allows ground controllers to have even more accurate information about the aircraft's location in the airspace.</p>
<p>Thales’s RSM NG secondary surveillance radar goes beyond Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar&nbsp;(MSSR) architecture&nbsp;by including&nbsp;Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast&nbsp;(ADS-B) technologies within the same sensor. Because the ADS-B&nbsp;receives the information&nbsp;emitted by aircraft once per second (e.g. Identification, altitude, speed, velocity, projected path, etc), it provides air traffic controllers with accurate aircraft information. The result is a&nbsp;state-of-the-art meta-sensor&nbsp;that merges&nbsp;different levels of data&nbsp;(up to 2, 000 aircrafts and 64 simultaneous data outputs), in order to provide&nbsp;accurate and continuous information&nbsp;that contributes to meeting the aircrafts’ 3 NM separation. </p>
<p>In a highly competitive market, Thales was selected for its capability to provide a cutting-edge radar, high detection performances and a trustworthy replacement plan with fast installation of the secondary radar, involving no interruption of service in a complex high traffic dense environment. </p>
<p>To be delivered and installed at Schiphol airport in less than a year, the RSM NG radar contract includes training to LVNL personnel, spare parts, and maintenance of the radar for a duration of 15 to 25 years. </p>
<p>Thales has been working with LVNL for more than 30 years contributing to Air Traffic Control and securing the airspace with Air Traffic Management solutions, radar equipment and navigation aids.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are proud to continue to contribute to strengthening air traffic control surveillance detection for our long standing-customer and we thank them for their continued trust in our technology. With high technological expectations from LVNL, the RSM NG, represents a solid performance and no less than 10 patents, with a track record of 40 RSM NG sold since the launch in 2021. ​ With more than 1100 ATC radars in the world, our ATC ensure critical air safety and air surveillance with a solid reputation for performance and reliability”, Lionel de Castellane, VP Civil Radars Segment, Thales</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“For LVNL, safety in the airspace is the top priority. Our air traffic controllers must be able to rely on the air traffic situation picture they see to safely guide aircraft and passengers through Dutch airspace. Reliable, robust and modern systems are crucial for this. The new radar at Schiphol Airport, which Thales will implement in collaboration with LVNL, will contribute to ensuring that we can continue to manage air traffic safely, efficiently, and responsibly in the coming decades”, Edward Schaap, Manager of Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance for LVNL</p></blockquote>
<p>1 ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) is a co-operative surveillance system for real-time air traffic control. </p>
<p>2 Mode S - Mode S is a Selective interrogation Mode allowing receiving precise information from the aircraft such as Aircraft ID, speed, altitude or flight status.</p>

 A potential breakthrough on personal data&nbsp;… and productivity <p>As far as Government announcements go, this one hardly seems the most exciting: there’s not many people who will see this title — “Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework Gamma (0.4) Pre-release” — and think “Oh wow! I must stop everything and read&nbsp;that!”</p><p>Yet, amidst a welter of other announcements and initiatives coming from the new Government, this could be the most important thing it does in its entire term of office. We’ll come to why in a minute. But first, what’s it all&nbsp;about?</p> Why identity&nbsp;matters <p>In a digital world, identity verification matters. If you are transacting online you need to be confident that the person at the other end of that transaction is who they say they are. If they’re not, all sorts of horrible things could happen, including damaging errors and fraud. Without some way of building this confidence, online commerce and service provision either grinds to a halt or entails all sorts of potential risks and associated costs.</p><p>Not surprisingly the potential benefits of cracking this identity problem could be huge. <a href="https://medium.com/@mckinsey_mgi/five-key-takeaways-on-the-value-of-digital-id-71f6026932e9">According to McKinsey</a> for example, getting digital identity right “could unlock economic value equivalent to 3 to 13 percent of GDP in 2030”. One example: it could reduce organisations’ costs of onboarding new staff and customers by up to&nbsp;90%.</p><p>But that’s just organisations. McKinsey also estimated that “just over half of the potential economic value of digital ID could accrue to individuals, making it a powerful key to inclusive growth”.</p><p>“Beyond quantifiable economic benefits,” their research continued, “digital ID can offer noneconomic value to individuals through social and political inclusion, rights protection, and transparency. For example, robust identity programs could help guard against child marriage, slavery, and human trafficking.”</p><p>So, as we said, it&nbsp;matters.</p><p>Yet finding a way to verify these identities has proved to be a very difficult task. We know because we’ve been involved in trying to find a workable solution for many years. For example, we were one of just five companies chosen by the UK Government to pioneer its first big attempt to crack this problem way back in 2011 with its Gov.UK <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOV.UK_Verify">Verify programme</a>.</p> Three hard won&nbsp;lessons <p>Verify didn’t work and the lessons from its failure are extremely important.</p><p>When the UK Government first tackled the identity problem with its Verify programme, its underlying assumption was that ‘digital identity’ would become a new ‘market’ like another, where specialist producers called ‘identity service providers’ would produce a specialist product called ‘an identity’ which they would sell to buyers in a competitive marketplace.</p><p>There were three things wrong with this assumption and the lessons learned about them are key to where we are&nbsp;today.</p><p>First, there is (and never can be) one, single ‘thing’ called an ‘identity’. People often think of ‘identities’ in terms of a single document like a passport or driving licence. But while these documents are very useful in many cases, they don’t always work. What happens if a person doesn’t have a driving licence or passport, for example? For an identity system to work, it needs to work for everybody, all the time, and ‘identity’ is too fluid and complex a concept to be nailed down by a single identity ‘product’.</p><p>Second, identity verification is first and foremost a process, not a product. Driving licences and passports are not official identity documents, for example. They are documents that provide people with certain entitlements. But the information they contain is widely trusted because of the stringent processes that went into creating&nbsp;them.</p><p>Crucially, these so-called identity documents are examples of ‘composite’ data points: one piece of data — entitlement to a driving licence — made up of a series of other, separate data points — such as name, date of birth, address and so on — each of which have been separately checked. Each one of these data points being a separate attribute.</p><p>That’s what really goes into verifying someone’s identity — the ability to verify different details about them, with these details varying according to the situation. For example, if a person does not have a driving licence or passport, or happens to be homeless, then other ‘verified attributes’ will be needed to verify them. Ultimately, it’s the attributes and the processes for verifying these attributes that&nbsp;matter.</p><p>Recognising this is a crucial step forward. For a system of identity assurance and verification to work it needs to be based on the ability to share and access a wide range of ‘verified attributes’ which may vary from one person and situation to another. Identity verification is a by-product of the ability to assemble enough such verified attributes for a person to be confident enough in their reliability for them to act on the information provided. This is why it was hugely important that the Government’s programme was renamed to say ‘Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework’.</p><p>The third key lesson has been to realise that ‘digital identity’ isn’t a single-purpose product. It covers many different purposes each of which may require different bits of information — different verified attributes. For example, being able to prove you are over 18 so that you can buy an alcoholic drink is very different to being able to prove you are a qualified pilot and really able to fly an aeroplane or that you are not a sex offender seeking to work with children (which is one of the functions of the Disclosure and Barring Service).</p><p>For an identity and attributes verification system to really work well, in other words, it needs to be flexible enough to share and assemble a very wide range of different verified attributes for a wide range of different use-cases.</p><p>This is what that exciting sounding document called “Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework Gamma (0.4) Pre-release” represents: the fact that these lessons have been learned and that, for the first time, after decades of trying, the UK Government has actually worked its way through to creating an approach that can actually work, efficiently and effectively, at&nbsp;scale.</p> Lifting the productivity logjam <p>“Yes,” you might say, “That’s great. But does that really make this the most important announcement that a Government could make in its entire time in&nbsp;office?”</p><p>Well, here’s why it could&nbsp;be.</p><p>Our entire economy — and society — is in the midst of a gut-wrenching, disconcerting and often bewildering economic shift. For hundreds of years it was organised around one, single basic model of wealth creation: deploying energy derived from fossil fuels to drive machines that turbocharged the transformation and movement of physical things. That is what ‘industry’ was about: the production of ever more physical items at ever lower&nbsp;cost.</p><p>It was an incredible driver of wealth creation, but now that model is reaching its sell-by date and our entire economy is in transition. It is beginning to pivot around the deployment of an entirely different type of resource — data — that enables us to do a different set of things that provide new value along different dimensions: make new discoveries; make better, more informed decisions; organise and coordinate the detailed actions needed to implement these decisions.</p><p>In other words, we are moving from a ‘thing’ driven economy to become a data driven economy and with that, we are opening up opportunities for improved productivity (and quality, and innovation) that the industrial age couldn’t&nbsp;reach.</p><p>Here is the point most people miss: Data in the form of verified attributes lies at the epicentre of every step of every service that deals with an identified individual. As well as identity assurance, these activities include onboarding and recognising service users when they return, deciding on eligibilities, configuring service details according to the specific needs and requirements of the individual and the circumstances in which the service is being provided, planning coordinating and executing the many necessary details of service delivery, and undertaking associated record keeping and customer services. Data is how services are provided.</p><p>If at any point, the data needed to drive these activities is wrong or unreliable the whole process either grinds to a halt or starts producing the wrong outcomes. In this sense, verified attributes are the new oil of an efficient, productive economy - not the ‘new oil’ that people talk about, as in Big Money and Big Power struggles, but the easily overlooked but ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL oil that lubricates the machinery of the entire economy. This is true of every citizen-facing service you may think of, from central and local government services, through health and care to education, financial services, retailing, travel and so on — across every sector (public, private and&nbsp;third).</p><p>It is precisely because we do not have reliable operational processes for the sharing of verified attributes that productivity in this country is flatlining. By opening the door to these reliable, trustworthy processes the new Digital Identity AND ATTRIBUTES Trust Framework is opening the door to a new, economy wide productivity revolution.</p><p>As part of this, the new Framework has identified the core functions that lie at the heart of this new data-driven economy. They&nbsp;are:</p>  ‘Attribute Providers’ that collect, create, check or share pieces of information that describe something about a&nbsp;person,  ‘Relying Parties’ that use this information to undertake a service,&nbsp;and  ‘Holder Services’ which provide individuals with the ability to securely “collect, store, view, manage or share identity and/or attribute information”, and which enable these individuals to “control what information their holder service stores, when it can be shared, and who it is shared with”. (A personal data store is one form of Holder Service.)  <p>The Trust Framework identifies other categories and functions too. They include identity service providers which “verify a user’s identity for one-off use at a single point in time”; orchestration service providers that “make sure data can be securely shared between participants through the provision of their technology infrastructure” but are not user-facing; and component service providers who provide specialist information (such as biometric data) that can be used in an identity verification process.</p><p>But it is the first three that really count in terms of understanding how the emerging data-driven economy will work. It will be driven by organisations which produce information (particularly verified attributes), organisations that use this information to provide specific services, and Holder Services that connect the two, including and embedding individuals as active parties in the collection and sharing of their own information.</p><p>This is the logical structure and architecture of a data sharing economy that has grown up inside an industrial age. Modern service providers don’t only produce services. They also produce and use data (e.g. verified attributes). Holder Services provide the glue that brings them together safely and efficiently — as the hub and clearing house for data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>This is what makes the Trust Framework so important. The concepts and processes it is laying out have the potential to last long into the future, becoming embedded into how our economy works in 20 years time and beyond, with transformational impact on how this economy works. Remember McKinsey talking about 90% reductions in the costs of onboarding new staff and customers? With the approach identified by DIATF, similar productivity breakthroughs become possible with every step of every service that needs verified information about people in order to serve&nbsp;them.</p> Ensuring trust <p>But the Trust Framework does a lot more than just identify the shape of things to come. It is also helping to ensure that these things happen on the ground, and that they happen safely. It doesn’t allow any old chancer to come along and say “I am an attribute provider” or ‘Holder Service”. It creates processes for their independent certification, so that people can trust their operations.</p><p>It also creates room for supplementary schemes that apply the Framework’s core principles and processes to specific situations where more detail is required. It is creating what it says — a framework — by which this system can actually&nbsp;work.</p><p>One key question remains. Will the public ‘buy’&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here, research undertaken as part of the development of the new Framework is crucial. Below we include some quotes from this research. We quote them in detail because they speak so strongly to the work we at Mydex CIC have been doing all these years on this&nbsp;front.</p><p>Please note: in what follows we are quoting from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-dialogue-on-trust-in-digital-identity-services/public-dialogue-on-trust-in-digital-identity-services-a-findings-report">the research report</a>. These are not our own&nbsp;words.</p><p>A human rights&nbsp;issue</p><p>“Participants’ attitudes towards identification and digital identity services shifted during the course of the dialogue. Many participants began the dialogue believing that having identity documents is purely practical. As participants’ discussions developed, many began to think of identity documentation as a basic human&nbsp;right.</p><p>“Participants perceive it to be an articulation of being human and a demonstration that they have a recognised role in society. Participants believe the importance of identity data is not simply practical but also instrumental in people having control over their lives and life&nbsp;chances.</p><p>“This has ethical implications. It means participants want to know that service providers will look after them and their data and protect and support the vulnerable and disadvantaged in society. This is important so that everyone can accrue benefits from digital identity services.</p><p>Human centred</p><p>“This human-centred approach is requested throughout the&nbsp;system…</p><p>“This points to a broader, more philosophical point that is a thread throughout the dialogue. Participants are concerned that digital identity service providers will be more focused on the technical aspects of the service than they are with developing a service that will take care of users and provide them with the support they need to use the service, and to ensure their data is safe and secure. Participants believe their confidence and trust in services will develop and increase if they see evidence, through the trust framework and in the actions of service providers, that they support people and put user needs and experiences at the centre of service design and delivery.</p><p>A public service &amp; trustworthiness</p><p>“Participants want to know that digital identity service providers are motivated by more than generating income. They call for the trust framework to make it clear that public benefit is a core value for those being certified to deliver digital identity services, and the government and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-digital-identities-and-attributes">OfDIA</a> [Office for Digital Identity and Attributes] as overseers of the programme.</p><p>“Participants articulated a ‘trust tension’: whilst they do not trust the government, they feel that a public sector organisation, a non-profit organisation or a research consortium might be more trustworthy than private sector organisations. This is seen as more trustworthy as it would operate without vested interests or the need to satisfy company shareholders&nbsp;… whilst trust in government is low, trust in government sponsored bodies is higher and perceived as more trustworthy than private sector organisations.</p><p>Benefits to&nbsp;society</p><p>“This leads to the second key factor. Participants want to know that digital identity service providers are motivated by more than generating income. They call for the trust framework to make it clear that public benefit is a core value for those being certified to deliver digital identity services, and the government and OfDIA as overseers of the programme. In this context, convenience on its own is not seen as a strong enough benefit. Delivering services which provide a trusted resource which can be used interchangeably across services and in a range of contexts is more powerful.</p><p>Inclusion</p>  “Participants do not see convenience on its own as a compelling enough reason for increased use of digital identities. They want to know how digital identity services are going to benefit society by making proving identity more inclusive.  “Participants want to know that these services are accessible to those that want and need to use them. Having options that work for everyone is seen as part of an inclusive system, one which enables people to verify their identity or attributes in the way which works for them, whatever their background, level of skills and experience.  “They want to know that service providers will look after them and their data; protect and support the vulnerable and disadvantaged in society so that they too can accrue benefits from digital identity services.  <p>Control</p><p>“Participants believe the trust framework should provide a clear statement on how users ‘own’ and ‘control’ their&nbsp;data.</p><p>“Having control over their data is important to participants. They want assurances within the digital identity services trust framework that they have choice about who they share data with and&nbsp;why.</p><p>“Participants believe the trust framework should provide a clear statement on how users ‘own’ and ‘control’ their data, including being able to update it and protect personal data they do not wish to&nbsp;share.</p><p>Personal utility and&nbsp;agency</p><p>“Participants see identification for consequential transactions such as renting or buying a property; proving you have the right to work in the UK or to get or renew a passport or driving license as more complex. It moves identification beyond the practical to instrumental in achieving life shifts such as demonstrating something significant and personal to them, including gender transition.</p><p>“The more participants thought about identification, the more they considered it a route to demonstrating that they are part of and contribute to society. Many participants feel that not being able to demonstrate something about themselves could have a significant impact on their lives, including having a meaningful role in&nbsp;society.</p> Conclusion <p>In trying to find an answer to the pressing question of digital identity, the UK Government has been on a long and steep learning curve. It might have taken nearly a decade and a half, but it has now arrived at a way forward that works — a way forward that could prove transformational for our economy and society as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>A key part of this is recognising the role of individuals and their Holder Services: the right and need for individuals to participate in an identity and attribute data sharing ecosystem with all the qualities identified by the programme’s public engagement research: human rights, human centredness, public service and trustworthiness, benefits to society, inclusion, control, personal utility and agency. That is what we are about as a Community Interest&nbsp;Company.</p><p>DIATF encapsulates a formula for the treatment of personal data in a data-driven age. It transcends the limitations of the organisation-centric database by enabling data sharing via Holder Services. By embedding human rights into how it works operationally, it also transcends the trade-offs between data protection and innovative uses of data. This trade-off has bedevilled the growth of this economy in its early years. In doing these things, it enables the data sharing that is needed to unleash personal data’s full social and economic potential.</p><p>Of course there is many a slip between cup and lip. Everything depends on how this Framework is interpreted and implemented. But for now it represents a strategically crucial beginning.</p><p>At Mydex, we have been involved in this journey from its beginnings with the Verify programme of 2011. We look forward to contributing further as it&nbsp;unfolds.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-potential-breakthrough-on-personal-data-and-productivity-96ab1e16eecc">A potential breakthrough on personal data&nbsp;… and productivity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We recently proposed the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/how-personal-data-licenses-can-keep-digital-identity-private-part-1/">Personal Data License</a> (PDL): a system that leverages Verifiable Digital Credentials to give individuals control over the sharing of their sensitive data, including the ability to enforceably limit, revoke, or receive disclosures about that access. As part of this system, the person sharing data will issue a PDL using their digital wallet, establishing a clear record of the terms for data sharing. The PDL will then be countersigned by the recipient, signifying their acceptance of the user's conditions and creating a mutual agreement that protects both parties.</p><p>Combined with legislative enforcement, a Personal Data License system would allow individuals to share data for a limited time, requiring recipients to delete it after the agreed period or report its continued existence as required. This enhanced level of control greatly increases the power that individuals have over their data. The ability to revoke data, ensure its removal, or receive notifications about its existence would have a profound impact in a landscape where personal data is increasingly used for commercial purposes and massive repositories of outdated data remain vulnerable to a growing number of security breaches.</p><p>Personal Data Licensing (PDL) would also have a third important benefit: increasing user trust in the digital systems handling their data. The public is increasingly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">confused and worried</a> about how their data are used, by both private companies and governments. That anxiety could be a serious obstacle to the adoption of digital identity systems like the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">mobile driver’s licenses (mDL)</a>, which offer <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">significant improvements</a> to the current privacy and security status quo.</p><p>But how exactly would Personal Data Licensing work? Let’s dive in.</p> Forget Me Now <p>Enforceable data control is important, both practically and for public perception because the public has come to associate digital tools with sacrificing their privacy. There’s the ambient experience of surveillance-driven advertising, but also much more scary examples, such as when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Target’s algorithm detected and exposed a customer’s pregnancy</a> or the current uncertainty about what 23andMe will do with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/g-s1-25795/23andme-data-genetic-dna-privacy?ref=blog.spruceid.com">all the individual genetic information it owns</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The 23andMe situation illustrates how trackable data licensing would improve on the current status quo. In retrospect, 23andMe’s customers would probably have preferred to let the company handle their genetic data temporarily, not store it in perpetuity. Personal data licensing makes data more like a digital book out for a temporary loan. Notably, the goal is not to create a more nuanced commercial license to let users monetize data, a concept many experts believe would be <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-data-ownership-is-the-wrong-approach-to-protecting-privacy/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">exploitative and bad for privacy</a>. Instead, PDL is intended as a privacy tool for particularly sensitive data, such as medical records, allowing users to automatically and auditably request the deletion of their data from their smartphones. If a user revoked their PDL and then published this action to a public blockchain, there would be solid evidence that they requested their data deletion at a certain point in history, accessible to anyone with shared data records and an internet connection.</p><p>Personal Data Licensing would use the same mix of digital wallets and secure signatures that verify digital IDs like California’s mobile driver’s license. When data are shared from a document or record in a digital wallet, a PDL system could require the recipient to digitally countersign a data license indicating acceptance of terms. This is aligned with building blocks like <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kantara-Consent-Receipt-Presentation.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Katara’s verifiable “receipt”</a> for the data, which is based on standards outlined by groups, <a href="https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27560.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">including ISO</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>These licenses would be readable by both humans and machines, outline the purpose of the sharing, and have clear expiration dates. They might also define any rights for third-party sharing or provisions for the sharer’s right to revoke data access. They may also encapsulate reporting requirements, such as how to notify the user if further data sharing is needed. Data wallets would automatically retain copies of these licenses, with verifiable signatures from the data recipients. With legislation backing, such as an updated version of Europe’s GDPR, this paper trail would make data deletion auditable and enforceable.</p><p>These capabilities and interactions are not currently part of dominant digital ID standards, such as the ISO’s Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) or the W3C’s Verifiable Credentials standard. We believe the system can be designed externally to such standards in the “white space” left open—though ideally, data licensing would eventually be integrated with base standards.</p> Data Control and a Fairer Digital Economy <p>A system of digitally signed receipts for data sharing would create a verifiable record of what data we share, with which counterparties, and under which conditions. However, legislation would be needed to ensure compliance by imposing penalties on data recipients who didn’t comply with the conditions of a license. Analogs to such legislation already exist, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA), and the&nbsp; <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/right-to-be-forgotten/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">European GDPR’s “Right to Be Forgotten.”</a> Governments worldwide have been implementing policies to give people more control over their data.</p><p>Notably, Utah enacted the <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0491.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Government Data Privacy Act (GDPA) in May 2024</a>, which gives Utahns discretion over how their own government should manage their personal data. At SpruceID, we are generally aligned with actions that increase individual autonomy while avoiding the centralization of power.</p><p>However, the current enforcement state for these laws tends to favor large-scale data collectors, such as Google and Facebook, who can afford the staff and other overhead to comply. Compliance costs have even led <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/online-privacy/closing-shop-or-closing-off-companies-respond-to-gdpr?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=Blocking%20out%20Europe&amp;text=The%20GDPR%20was%20a%20contributing,on%20business%20in%20other%20regions.">some smaller digital businesses to leave the EU</a> or even shut down entirely.</p><p>A standardized and open system of Personal Data Licensing, including verifiable “receipts,” would make both enforcement and compliance simpler, reducing the unfair burden that data policies have tended to have on smaller digital businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Public policy would need to support PDL systems with enforcement. Imagine, for instance, that months after releasing your blood test data to a medical provider, you start receiving health marketing messages that seem guided by that data. This evidence of data misuse could be directly correlated with a digitally signed receipt showing exactly who received the data, and when, and submitted to a data enforcement body.&nbsp;</p> From “Papers, Please” to “Why—and for How Long?” <p>Making the Personal Data License a reality will take work and time, but we believe it’s a compelling path forward. One very practical upside of personal data licensing is that it will make privacy frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA much more implementable. A record-keeping standard simplifying policy enforcement gives individuals more control over their data while also reducing the compliance burden on firms that collect data for valid purposes.</p><p>More fundamentally, Personal Data Licensing would be a major step forward in digital identity’s overarching mission to improve privacy, security, and user control of data. Personal Data Licenses, paired with monitoring and enforcement, can reverse the power dynamic in data sharing. Instead of a presumption that users must hand over data on request, government agencies and data-hungry enterprises will be required to convincingly justify their data collection and how long it will be stored.</p><p>The data hoards built up by unrestricted data collection have become huge risks to global privacy, security, and democracy. They have been used for surveillance and mass manipulation. It’s time for a change in control.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

				  With a focused, achievable goal, you can quickly deploy your Verifiable Credential ecosystem and gain an edge over your competitors  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>If you’re looking to transform costly, inefficient, or user-unfriendly authentication and data sharing systems, our motto at Indicio is: “Start today, start small, scale smart.” This means beginning with a focused, manageable use case to build understanding of the technology, achieve results, and let these results create momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve helped customers implement Verifiable Credentials to solve a myriad of business issues: interoperability between partners and governments when privacy is a concern or when direct integration is too complicated and expensive; inefficient, error-prone, and repetitive processes based on manual, paper-based form-filling verification, and simplifying, securing, and speeding up access to systems and software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, rather than aiming to solve every challenge at once, we encourage customers to start with a small deployment that fixes one problem. This approach builds understanding and trust, drives stakeholder buy-in, and sets the foundation for long-term success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are a new digital authentication method that uses cryptographic proofs to verify identity or attributes without exposing unnecessary personal information or requiring the verifier to check in with the original source of the information or a third-party identity provider.</p>
<p>Here’s how they work:</p>
 
 Issuer: A trusted entity (e.g., a bank, government agency, or employer) issues a credential to a user (e.g., proof of identity, business license). 
 Holder: The user stores this credential securely in a digital wallet on their mobile device. 
 Verifier: When logging in or accessing a service, the user presents a cryptographically verifiable proof of the credential and, depending on the use case, information in the credential to the verifier. Importantly, only the necessary data is shared, and the verifier can confirm its authenticity without contacting the issuer. 
 
<p>This decentralized model for data ecosystems means that users hold their own data and that the data issued in a credential is completely under the user’s control. This decentralization eliminates the need to store personal data in a centralized database in order to cross check and verify it. It also removes the privacy concerns over how third-parties can use personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at the simplest decentralized identity ecosystem we can create, one where the issuer and verifier is the same entity —&nbsp;for example, an employer issuing an employee credential for seamless login to company systems and applications. This structure, often referred to as a closed ecosystem, provides a simple, controlled environment for implementing, testing, and understanding the solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a team experiences how easy it is to implement such a system, the path is much easier to adding outside verifiers (say a company’s benefits partners) or other issuers (say, government-issued credentials) to create new ecosystems for sharing verifiable data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in this way allows for iterative development and continuous improvement, ensuring smoother rollouts and minimizing risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our CTO, Ken Ebert calls this stage of development, a three-legged stool. While decentralized identity often seems like a purely technological solution, success relies on making important choices to balance the needs of three critical elements:&nbsp;</p>
<p> Business: What problem are you trying to solve with decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials? Who are the users, and how will they benefit? What funding model supports the initiative? We’ve seen the customers who are quick to answer these questions get the budget and speed to deployment the fastest.</p>
<p> Governance: Governance defines how users obtain the credentials, who uses them, who the other parties in the ecosystem are, as well as how the deployment adheres to emerging global data regulations. Ensuring compliance and clarity builds trust among stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Technology: This involves the foundational tools: the software for issuing credentials, holding credentials (in a digital wallet) and verifying credentials; the ability to write to and retrieve cryptographic material; and decisions over protocols and standards.</p>
<p>Our team at Indicio is active and lead many different communities where technologies and standards are being developed. From OpenID to DIDComm, W3C and IETF, chances are if you are interested in a specific protocol, credential type, or specification– we’ve got you covered.</p>
<p>An example of how these three elements work together: A company call center could issue credentials to customers, enabling quicker authentication. If this reduces verification time from 30 seconds to 5, with data to prove efficiency and customer satisfaction, the team can now ask for further funding for adoption. Here, the technology solves a business problem, and the governance is rooted in the trusted relationship between the company and its customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As new applications and improvements emerge during an initial rollout, the temptation to scale quickly can be strong. However, the key to sustainable growth is incremental expansion. Using the call center example, this might mean gradually adding new verifiers, issuers, or credential holders to improve routine transactions while maintaining a stable and secure system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is transformative. A key factor in the success of any decentralized identity project is effective communication of this — both internally and externally. Teams must articulate the value proposition to users, addressing the pain points that decentralized identity alleviates. This requires a combination of education, documentation, and messaging that engages stakeholders at every level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we help organizations take their first steps with decentralized identity and support their success as they grow into larger deployments. By providing enterprise-grade tools built on open-source technologies, a variety of hosting options, and customizable training programs, we provide businesses the flexibility to create a variety of scalable solutions to fit their needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you’re just starting out in testing or ready to deploy, our expertise helps you confidently navigate the path to a successful decentralized identity ecosystem.</p>

<p>The latest <a href="https://quarkid.org" title="">QuarkID</a> update, implemented using the <a href="https://extrimian.io/products" title="">SSI API and ID Connect </a>by Extrimian, introduces a critical feature for decentralized information management: VC Attachments. This functionality allows the inclusion of files, such as PDFs, images, and other formats, in verifiable credentials, providing additional context or evidence to support the information contained within the credentials.</p>



<p></p>



 



 What Are VC Attachments? 



<p>VC Attachments enhance the handling, storage, and linking of attachments to verifiable credentials. Issued under the Verifiable Credentials (VC) standard, these are cryptographically signed digital documents containing verifiable data.</p>



<p>The inclusion of attachments ensures that any relevant supplementary information is securely available and managed, preserving the integrity and reliability of shared or stored documents.</p>

<p></p>



 



 Rapid Implementation 



 What is the @quarkid/vc-attachments-agent-plugin? 



<p>The @quarkid/vc-attachments-agent-plugin is a plugin designed to expand the functionality of SSI agents, enabling secure management of file attachments in verifiable credentials. This plugin is essential for users who need to attach additional documents to their credentials, broadening their utility across various contexts.</p>



 



 Installation 



<p>The plugin can be installed using npm as the package manager:</p>



<p>npm install @quarkid/vc-attachments-agent-plugin</p>



 



 Usage in Mobile Agents 



<p>To integrate the plugin into a mobile agent:</p>



 
 Import the plugin into your project. 



 Configure appropriate storage for file attachments. 



 Add the plugin to the agent’s list of plugins to streamline the attachment management process during credential interactions. 
 



<p>For detailed instructions, refer to the step-by-step <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u22X4act70pXNZUR-26hE3WZqUYOWiM8/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=107802103968958148603&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">guide</a> in the documentation.</p>



 



 Interaction with ID Connect SSI API 



 API Integration Service 



<p>The SSI API provides two main endpoints for managing attachments:</p>



 
 PUT /attachment/filepath<br>Returns the file storage URL, allowing access to previously saved files. 



 POST /attachment/upload<br>Facilitates the upload of new files to the API, offering a secure and direct method for storing additional information related to a credential. 
 



 



<p></p>



 Use Cases 



 Retrieving Attachments 



<p>To retrieve attachments linked to a specific credential, use the getFileAttachments method, which fetches associated files.</p>



 Uploading Attachments 



<p>Uploading involves sending the file via a multipart form, along with detailed metadata, including a hash to ensure authenticity.</p>

  <p>In an era where cyber threats are constant, organizations must prepare not for if a breach will happen but when. The urgency to identify, address, and bounce back from security incidents has never been greater. Privileged Access Management (PAM) plays a vital role in bolstering defenses and streamlining responses to these incidents. However, many organizations still struggle to unlock its full benefits, leaving critical vulnerabilities exposed.</p>
<p>Modern PAM solutions offer a range of capabilities that extend far beyond traditional access control. By integrating PAM into incident response strategies, organizations can significantly improve their ability to identify threats, contain breaches, and streamline recovery processes. Join us as we explore how PAM can be leveraged to transform human risk into human assets, providing full visibility and control over internal risks.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at the state of PAM and compare common versus emerging capability areas. He will discuss to which extent these capabilities can support not only protective requirements but support in the analysis of incidents and thus streamline incident reporting.</p>
<p>Aleksandr Dymov, Product Manager at Syteca, will showcase the Syteca platform, a comprehensive cybersecurity solution designed to meet the diverse needs of modern organizations. He will present a case study and provide a live demo, illustrating how Syteca's customizable security toolkit enables granular PAM and advanced user activity monitoring to secure organizations against insider threats.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-your-secret-weapon"></a>

				  Our success in developing OpenID for Verifiable Credentials is paving the way for new use cases and quicker adoption.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Gareau</p>
<p>Our mission at Indicio is to make decentralized identity accessible and practical for real-world adoption. A key to this is our active involvement in developing and supporting OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC) and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP). Part of the emerging <a href="https://www.european-digital-identity-regulation.com/">European eIDAS 2.0 identity standards</a>, these protocols specify how Verifiable Credentials can be used, building on OpenID Connect (OIDC), a widely used framework for authenticating user access to applications and websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OID4VC</a>: Streamlines the issuance of Verifiable Credentials using familiar web technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html">OID4VP</a>: Facilitates the presentation of these credentials, ensuring interoperability with existing OpenID-based systems.</p>
<p>These protocols make the transition to decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials easy for many organizations, as they are familiar with the underlying authentication technology and don’t have to replace their identity and access management systems. This means companies and organizations can quickly implement seamless operations and services that deliver immediate value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Gartner Research notes in its <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5560195">2024 Market Guide to Decentralized Identity</a>, the technology “represents magnitudes of improvement in terms of efficiency, cost and assurance” for authentication, account security, fraud, privacy, and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio’s OID4VC in action</p>
<p>An example of Indicio’s work with these protocols is the<a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/"> IATA One ID Proof of Concept (POC)</a>. This was developed with our strategic partner SITA, along with Delta Airlines and the Government of Aruba, and showcased at the joint<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/events/all/wfs--wps/"> IATA World Financial Symposium (WFS) and IATA World Passenger Symposium (WPS) </a>in October 2024.</p>
<p>The POC showed how two different Verifiable Credentials, a <a href="https://www.icao.int/Meetings/TRIP-Symposium-2021/PublishingImages/Pages/Presentations/Digital%20Travel%20Credential%20%28DTC%29%20Policy%20and%20Guiding%20Principles.pdf">Digital Travel Credential</a> using the DIDComm protocol and a <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/one-id/">One ID</a> credential using OID4VC, can work seamlessly together to facilitate seamless check in, baggage management, lounge access, and international border crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POC showed just how easy it is for a person to enroll in both at the same time with a passport and mobile phone, and then use them for instant, seamless authentication through each step of the passenger journey from home to destination. This was the first ever One ID implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://youtu.be/StRH7uOqxQA?feature=shared">a demonstration</a> from a recent <a href="https://indicio.tech/how-decentralized-digital-identity-is-creating-simpler-more-streamlined-air-travel/">meeting of the Indicio Identity Community Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>At Indicio, we see the future as a multi-credential, protocol, and standard world, and our goal is to provide the best implementation of each to meet our customer needs and to ensure that all work together so that our customers can seize every opportunity.</p>
<p>Our success in implementing&nbsp; OID4VC and in combining and bridging different credentials and protocols has made Indicio a trusted partner for global organizations looking to implement cutting-edge identity solutions.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to explore how OID4VC can revolutionize your identity ecosystem, or to explore our solutions in education, finance, health, agriculture, the public sector, and travel and tourism, we’re here to help you every step of the way. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Reach out to Indicio today!</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> A&nbsp;Game-Changer in Data Backup and&nbsp;Cyber Resilience&nbsp; 
<p>On December 10th, 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cohesity.com/press/cohesity-becomes-worlds-largest-data-protection-provider-after-completing-combination-with-veritas-enterprise-data-protection-business/">Cohesity and Veritas&nbsp;announced</a>&nbsp;that they have finalized their union. This is a major development as it will create the largest player in the rapidly growing market for cyber resilience and data protection. Data is not only fundamental to all organizations’ business processes but now also defines the very infrastructure upon which these processes depend.&nbsp; Cyber-attacks and ransomware are an existential threat to this data and data protection solutions are essential for cyber resilience.&nbsp; This union represents a pivotal moment in the worldwide marketplace for these solutions.&nbsp;</p>
 Why This Merger is Important&nbsp; 
<p>Digitalization of business processes has increased the potential impact of cyber threats.&nbsp; This, taken together with increased regulation on cyber resilience, makes the market for these solutions strong. Based on our current research the Cloud Backup market size was last estimated at over $5.75B with an annual growth rate of 18.7%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The merger of Cohesity and Veritas underscores the importance of dependable, scalable, and innovative data protection solutions for cyber resilience. Both these vendors are recognized as leaders in our recent Leadership Compass report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80868/cloud-backup-for-ai-enabled-cyber-resilience">Cloud Backup for AI Enabled Cyber Resilience</a>&nbsp;with each bringing their own complementary strengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Complementary Strengths&nbsp; 
<p>Cohesity brings its modern, cloud-native approach to data management and Veritas brings its long-standing expertise in enterprise-grade data protection. By combining their strengths, the new entity is well placed to address the full spectrum of data protection and cyber resilience needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cohesity offers the Cohesity Data Cloud (CDC), built on SpanFS, an immutable filesystem ensuring data integrity and security plus instant file serving of backed-up NAS data, and using SnapTree chain-free metadata such that essentially each point-in-time backup can be accessed as rapidly and efficiently as if it had been originally made via a full backup.  Veritas products include Veritas Alta™ Data Protection, NetBackup – an enterprise backup and recovery solution, and Backup Exec - designed for backup and recovery for small to mid-sized businesses. Together these combine modern architecture with a wide range of capabilities and coverage.&nbsp;</p>
 The Importance of&nbsp;ML and&nbsp;GenAI&nbsp; 
<p>An important market trend is the evolution of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in particular generative AI (GenAI).&nbsp; ML and GenAI provide capabilities that can be helpful to enhance cyber resilience, and we expect cyber resilience solutions to exploit these technologies where appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both vendors have recognized the importance of ML and GenAI both in terms of the opportunities they provide as well as the data protection needs, they introduce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Veritas uses GenAI/ML with the AI-powered Operational Assistant, Veritas Alta™ Copilot. Alta Copilot brings the power of GenAI to Alta View, making it more intuitive and accessible for all users to detect suspicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cohesity’s AI framework, including the patent-pending Cohesity Gaia, leverages GenAI throughout the platform to offer operational insights, anomaly detection, information insights, and predictive analytics. Gaia enables users to search based on meaning rather than search based on characters, and converse with their data using natural language. The platform also includes AI-driven data classification and threat detection, utilizing machine learning to enhance security and compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our view, in future an organization should be able to give a GenAI based backup and disaster recovery solution a set of resilience objectives, compliance requirements and cost constraints for the system to build, evaluate, and implement the technology elements and support the manual processes needed to meet these.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Impact on Customers&nbsp; 
<p>Not all marriages last and customers may be anxious about what this union may mean for them.&nbsp; Both companies recognized that it is easier to lose customers than to gain them. In February 2024, when they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cohesity.com/press/cohesity-and-veritas-data-protection-business-to-combine-forming-a-new-leader-in-ai-powered-data-security-and-management/">announced</a> their intention to combine, the announcement included a “no customer left behind” <a href="https://www.cohesity.com/product-roadmap-strategy/">product roadmap</a> in which “...all products will be supported for many years. Customers can migrate when and if they want, on their own schedule.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what we expect the new entity to provide:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transitional Arrangements&nbsp;– to ensure that all capabilities from the existing products remain available with the opportunity to mix and match between the two product ranges.&nbsp; No enforced customer migration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced Capabilities:&nbsp;a unified portfolio that combines the best of both companies' technologies. These will likely be based around the Cohesity Data Cloud (CDC), to provide a unified interface and exploit the wide range of data connectors from Veritas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Global Reach and Support:&nbsp;With their combined resources, the new entity will be better positioned to provide support and expertise across regions and industries. This is particularly important for enterprises operating in highly regulated sectors such as healthcare, finance, and government.&nbsp;</p>
 Technology Advances to Watch For&nbsp; 
<p>The Cohesity-Veritas merger is not just a consolidation of market share but a bold move to accelerate technological advancements in data backup and recovery. Key innovations we anticipate include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI and Machine Learning for Data Resilience:&nbsp;Leveraging Cohesity’s AI-driven analytics and Veritas’s deep integration capabilities, the new entity is likely to push the boundaries of predictive and autonomous data recovery. This could minimize downtime and enhance ransomware recovery strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seamless Multi-Cloud Integration:&nbsp;As businesses increasingly adopt hybrid and multi-cloud environments, the combined expertise of Cohesity and Veritas will result in more robust and seamless cloud-native solutions, protecting data and data defined infrastructure in a common way across diverse environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comprehensive Data Governance and Compliance:&nbsp;With increasing regulations on data protection and cyber resilience worldwide, the union offers an opportunity to deliver solutions to help organizations to meet and exceed their regulatory obligations.&nbsp;</p>
 Our Opinion&nbsp; 
<p>The union of Cohesity and Veritas is a transformative moment for the data protection and cyber resilience market. As the largest player in the market, the combined company has the power to set new standards, influence industry trends, and drive the next wave of innovation. For customers, this means access to unparalleled technology and expertise, though the path forward may ultimately require customers to adapt and align with new offerings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As dust settles on this announcement, one thing is clear: the data protection and cyber resilience market has forever changed, and we are just beginning to understand the full impact of this historic combination.&nbsp; Stay tuned and book now for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2025">EIC</a>&nbsp;in May 2025 to hear the latest news.&nbsp;</p>

             December 2024   
	 
		 
			 Bitcoin Hits $100K: The Tokenization Tipping Point? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Last week, Bitcoin hits $100k!</p>
<p>This milestone, fueled by institutional adoption and a promising regulatory shift under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, sets the stage for a transformative 2025 in onchain finance and tokenization. It is clear that institutional capital is going onchain, it is crucial to start bringing assets onchain now. The tokenization trend is inevitable.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>But to reach that tipping point, we must overcome a few critical challenges.</p>
 Challenge 1: Lack of Actionable Data 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Private assets often lack actionable data that allow all ecosystems to easily read the data of the tokens, such as Net Asset Value (NAV). Without this, other applications like data aggregators, distributors, and other service providers, can not provide accurate data to their audience.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
ERC-3643 is designed to solve this. With its built-in AssetID smart contracts, tokenized assets gain a unique onchain identity. Asset data (Asset type, NAV, ISIN, LEI, ESG ratings…) can be verified and directly linked to AssetID. This allows the ecosystem service providers to access verified asset information.</p>
 Challenge 2: Limited Accessibility 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Despite the promise of tokenized RWAs, they remain out of reach for most investors. Take BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, as an example. Its $454 million market cap in Ethereum is held by just 23 investors, with 40% owned by a single Web3 company. High minimum investments exclude smaller investors from participating. Many institutions are still hesitating to open their onchain products to retail investors. They are afraid of losing control and fail to enforce compliance.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
The ERC-3643 token standard enables issuers to tokenize more accessible financial products while maintaining full control and automated compliance. ERC-3643 tokens are permissioned tokens. They ensure issuers decide who can participate, and under what conditions, and even allow for token freezing or recovery. Issuers can scale by using this token standard and open onchain assets to smaller investors. The protocol has already been used many times to tokenize securities available to retail investors, such as open-ended public funds, or even with prospectus exemptions in Europe.</p>
 Challenge 3: Fragmented Liquidity 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Secondary markets for RWAs remain siloed. Distributors can only offer assets within their isolated order books, leaving unmatched trades, inactive markets, and frustrated investors.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
Shared liquidity. Imagine all distributors leveraging a shared order book while retaining full control of their platforms and investor relationships. In the new era of tokenized assets, trading offers are universal. Investors publish a trading offer on one platform, and it is instantly visible across all others. Smart contracts ensure compliance by design: Onchain identity checks confirm the buyer’s eligibility, enforce transfer restrictions, and verify wallet balances. Unauthorized transactions are denied instantly. The best part is delivery vs payment enabling instant settlements. Trades are completed in seconds without counterparty risk or intermediaries, creating a seamless and risk-free experience.</p>
<p>This vision is no longer theoretical. ERC-3643 tokens, combined with the open liquidity protocol DINO, make it a reality. By sharing an onchain catalog of offers, blockchain has been turned into a giant marketplace.</p>
<p>But unlocking this potential requires collective action.</p>
 
 For asset issuers: Adopting the open source ERC-3643 standard ensures compliance and future interoperability. 
 For asset administrators: Defining their operating models to support seamless onchain operations. 
 For distributors: Connecting to the ERC-3643 catalog of tokens and starting managing onchain transactions. 
 
<p>At Tokeny, our mission is to provide the best in class tokenized assets orchestration platform and expertise for all stakeholders to thrive in this financial revolution, empowering institutions to upgrade finance, onchain.</p>
<p>Change is no longer optional, it’s an opportunity, let’s make 2025 a bull market for RWAs!</p>

With the newest release of the Identity Fabric, KuppingerCole Analysts provides an updated framework that not only reflects the evolution of IAM with respect to supported identity types and technologies, but also provides additional perspectives and layers to help organizations shape their own Identity Fabric for human and non-human identities. The Reference Architecture as second major framework of KuppingerCole Analysts adds more detail to the Identity fabric by going more into detail on IAM.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) has long been the backbone of enterprise security. As digital transformation accelerates and compliance requirements grow more stringent, the need for a flexible, scalable, and future-proof IAM framework has never been more critical. This is where the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric comes into play - a holistic framework expertly designed to tackle these challenges head-on.</p>
<p>But why is a comprehensive IAM blueprint so crucial? According to recent data, only 40% of companies currently have a complete IAM blueprint in place, while 26.8% are in the process of developing one, and a concerning 33.1% have no blueprint at all. This gap highlights a significant vulnerability for many organizations, leaving them exposed to risks that could be mitigated with a well-defined IAM strategy. The Identity Fabric addresses this very issue by providing a structured, adaptable approach to IAM, ensuring that organizations not only close this gap but also stay ahead of future challenges.</p>
<p>Building on its successful design and widespread adoption, KuppingerCole analysts and advisors are currently finalizing the updated revision of the Identity Fabric for 2025, scheduled for release soon. This new version is not just a routine update; it is a carefully crafted evolution that leverages valuable feedback from the industry, incorporates insights and experiences from end-user organizations, and integrates the latest market and technology trends.</p>
 Understanding the basics: What is the Identity Fabric? 
<p>At its core, the Identity Fabric is a comprehensive, holistic framework for architecting, evolving, and modernizing IAM systems. It is essential for organizations looking to keep pace with the demands of their future challenges, ensure compliance, and address evolving business requirements. Identities are the cornerstone of cybersecurity frameworks, and the Identity Fabric offers a structured approach to managing them effectively.</p>
<p>The benefits of the Identity Fabric are multifaceted. It not only provides a robust high-level model for IAM but also ensures that systems are adaptable to future challenges. This adaptability is crucial as the digital landscape continues to evolve, bringing with it new threats and opportunities. The business value of the Identity Fabric lies in its ability to streamline IAM processes, reduce operational costs, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
 Applying the Identity Fabric: Why is it so useful? 
<p>The Identity Fabric is not just a theoretical framework; it is a practical tool that can be applied across various IAM scenarios. Whether you are designing a new IAM platform or evolving an existing one, the Identity Fabric provides the entry point for a clear roadmap. Areas of application include:</p>
 
 Strategy Definition for New IAM Platforms: Implementing new IAM platforms requires more than just technical know-how - it demands a strategic vision. The Identity Fabric helps define long-term goals and ensures that the platform is built with future scalability in mind. 
 Strategy Definition for Evolving IAM Platforms: Just as new platforms need a strategic direction, so do existing systems undergoing transformation. The Identity Fabric guides the modernization process, ensuring that legacy platforms meet both current and future business requirements. 
 Architecture Design for New IAM Platforms: When building new IAM platforms, the Identity Fabric framework ensures a robust, scalable, and flexible architecture. This architecture can adapt to changing business needs and technological advancements, making it future proof. 
 Architecture Design for Evolving IAM Platforms: For organizations with existing IAM systems, the Identity Fabric offers a pathway to modernization. By aligning legacy systems with the framework, businesses can enhance functionality and improve scalability without the need for a complete overhaul. 
 Review and Analysis of Existing IAM Service Platforms: To fully leverage the Identity Fabric, organizations must first understand their current state. Thorough reviews and analyses help identify gaps, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement, allowing the Identity Fabric to guide the necessary changes. 
 Portfolio Management: Effective IAM is not just about managing individual systems - it’s about managing a portfolio of services and solutions. The Identity Fabric ensures that all elements are aligned with business objectives and that resources are allocated efficiently. 
 
 Evolving the Identity Fabric for 2025: A Sneak Peek 
<p>The upcoming 2025 update to the Identity Fabric brings several exciting enhancements, each aimed at ensuring that the framework remains relevant in the face of both technological and business changes.</p>
 
 A Revision of the Conceptual Design: The new Identity Fabric will feature a slightly updated conceptual design that encapsulates all relevant themes. The structure of the Fabric will be more refined, looking at all types of identities, with all relevant IAM capabilities consolidated into IAM services and mapped to tools and market segments. 
 Integration with the IAM Reference Architecture: One of the key enhancements in the 2025 update is the integration of the Identity Fabric with the existing IAM Reference Architecture. This ensures that the Reference Architecture is aligned within the Fabric context. 
 Development of Detailed Blueprints: The 2025 update will also enable new applications of the Identity Fabric through deriving detailed, bespoke, and individualized detail identity fabrics. Crucial will be a new model of a two-tiered refinement of the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric (IF), which aims to provide a structured framework for managing identity and access within different organizational contexts. 
 
<p>The Identity Fabric can be adjusted two levels of abstraction:</p>
 
 Level 1: Master Identity Fabric (IF) - This is the core framework designed to manage functions and services across various identity and access management (IAM) requirements. It acts as the central IAM blueprint applicable to a broad range of organizations. 
 Level 2: Tailored Identity Fabrics per Business Model and/or Maturity Level&nbsp;- At this level, the Master Identity Fabric is refined into more specific models to serve different organizational needs and maturity levels. These refined models serve as role models for other organizations and are designed to meet the distinct challenges and requirements of various industries. 
 
<p>This hierarchical approach allows for greater flexibility, ensuring that the Identity Fabric can be adapted to fit specific organizational contexts while maintaining a standard core framework.</p>
 Looking Ahead: The Future of IAM 
<p>The KuppingerCole Identity Fabric 2025 is more than just an update - it’s a strategic evolution that prepares organizations for the future of IAM. By adopting this enhanced framework, businesses can ensure that their IAM systems are not only capable of meeting today’s challenges but are also ready for the unknowns of tomorrow. As identities continue to be at the core of cybersecurity, the Identity Fabric offers a clear path to resilience, adaptability, and long-term success.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the official release of the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric 2025, where these enhancements and more will be fully detailed, providing a cutting-edge framework for the next generation of IAM.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a critical pillar in cybersecurity frameworks, safeguarding sensitive systems and data from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Privileged credentials—such as those used by administrators, developers, or automation scripts—are often the target of cyberattacks due to the expansive access they provide. As such, organizations require robust PAM solutions that go beyond traditional boundaries to address emerging challenges such as shadow IT, insider threats, and secure remote access.</p>
<p>The demand for PAM solutions is driven by the growing complexity of IT environments, which now encompass hybrid infrastructures, multi-cloud ecosystems, and remote work arrangements. However, deploying and managing PAM solutions comes with its own set of operational challenges. Organizations must navigate the integration of these tools into existing systems, ensuring seamless functionality while managing privileged identities across distributed environments.</p>
<p>Effective PAM solutions today are more than just vaults for storing passwords—they enable organizations to enforce dynamic, time-limited access controls, continuously monitor user activity, and generate comprehensive audit trails. These capabilities are not only essential for security but also for meeting regulatory requirements. Syteca, formerly Ekran System, has redefined its offerings to meet these evolving demands, placing functionality, usability, and real-world applicability at the core of its approach.</p>
 The Growing Competition in the PAM Market 
<p>The PAM market has evolved rapidly over the past decade, with established players and new entrants competing for a share of this critical space. This growth reflects a broader trend in cybersecurity, as organizations increasingly prioritize the protection of privileged credentials. However, the shift toward hybrid and multi-cloud environments has added new dimensions to the challenge.</p>
<p>Organizations are no longer looking solely for tools that secure credentials; they need PAM solutions that provide agility, scalability, and ease of use without compromising security. Features like Just-in-Time (JIT) access, seamless integration with Zero Trust architectures, and compliance with ever-changing regulatory landscapes have become standard expectations.</p>
<p>Vendors are responding to this demand with diverse offerings, from feature-rich enterprise solutions to specialized tools tailored to specific industries. In this crowded market, differentiation is key. Solutions that adapt to unique business needs while addressing broader challenges, such as securing remote access and monitoring insider activities, are more likely to succeed. Syteca’s recent transformation and expanded capabilities position it as a strong contender in this competitive landscape.</p>
 Why Ekran System Became Syteca 
<p>In May 2024, Ekran System rebranded as Syteca, a strategic decision that signifies the company’s evolution and commitment to addressing the challenges of modern cybersecurity. The new name reflects Syteca’s expanded focus on delivering innovative system security and technology management solutions.</p>
<p>This transformation is more than a rebranding exercise; it marks a shift in how the company approaches Privileged Access Management. Syteca aims to align its tools with the practical needs of organizations, emphasizing usability and efficiency. Enhanced features, such as real-time threat detection, advanced session recording, and streamlined workflows, underline the company’s goal to offer comprehensive yet intuitive solutions.</p>
<p>By rebranding, Syteca positions itself as a forward-thinking player in the PAM market. The company is not only addressing the challenges organizations face today but also anticipating the needs of tomorrow, ensuring its solutions remain relevant in an ever-changing landscape.</p>
 Key Use Cases Highlighting Syteca’s Capabilities 
<p>Syteca’s approach to PAM is best understood through its real-world applications. These use cases demonstrate how the solution addresses critical security challenges across various industries and scenarios.</p>
<p>1. Detecting and Securing Shadow Accounts</p>
<p>Shadow IT accounts—those created without authorization or outside central control—pose significant security risks. These accounts are often overlooked, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. Syteca automates the discovery of shadow accounts across Windows servers and Active Directory, onboarding them securely into its secrets management system. Once onboarded, passwords are rotated, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance. Security teams can then evaluate and either disable or remove unauthorized accounts, reducing exposure to potential threats.</p>
<p>2. Mitigating Insider Threats with Privileged Account Monitoring</p>
<p>Insider threats remain a major concern for organizations, particularly when dealing with privileged accounts. Syteca addresses this challenge by continuously monitoring Active Directory for new privileged accounts. Discovered accounts are secured with two-factor authentication (2FA), session recording, and role-based access control (RBAC). These measures ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive systems, with all activities logged and auditable. This proactive approach helps organizations detect suspicious behaviour early and mitigate risks effectively.</p>
<p>3. Securing Sleeping Accounts</p>
<p>Inactive or dormant accounts often go unnoticed, becoming an attractive target for attackers. For example, the account of a former employee may still be active and exploitable. Syteca’s automated discovery tools identify these sleeping accounts, onboard them into the secrets management system, and rotate credentials to cut off unauthorized access. In real-world scenarios, this capability has helped organizations close security gaps caused by oversight, ensuring that no dormant accounts remain vulnerable.</p>
<p>4. Managing Third-Party Database Administrators (DBAs)</p>
<p>Organizations often rely on external contractors, such as third-party DBAs, to maintain critical systems. These contractors require temporary yet secure access to isolated networks. Syteca facilitates this through a combination of Jump servers, ticketing system integrations, and controlled access mechanisms. Contractors can only access specific resources via pre-approved workflows, with passwords rotated after each use. Session recording ensures that all activities are logged, providing full accountability.</p>
<p>5. Enhancing Security in Healthcare</p>
<p>In healthcare settings, securing access to electronic health records (EHRs) is paramount. Hospitals and clinics use Syteca to enforce strict access controls, such as 2FA and time-based restrictions, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access patient data during working hours. Additionally, audit capabilities allow administrators to monitor and review all activities involving sensitive data, helping organizations maintain compliance with industry regulations like HIPAA.</p>
<p>6. Enabling Secure File Transfers for Marketing Agencies</p>
<p>Collaborating with external vendors often requires temporary access to sensitive systems. For a marketing agency, Syteca facilitates secure file transfers via an FTP server. Access is granted only through secrets management, with manual approval workflows ensuring that each request is vetted. Passwords are rotated after use, and sessions are recorded for auditing. This approach allows agencies to collaborate confidently without exposing sensitive client data to unnecessary risk.</p>
 The Future of PAM 
<p>The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, and Privileged Access Management is at the forefront of this change. Organizations face mounting pressure to secure their privileged credentials while navigating complex IT ecosystems and regulatory requirements. Syteca’s transformation and its ability to address diverse use cases illustrate its commitment to meeting these challenges.</p>
<p>By focusing on usability, scalability, and real-world applicability, Syteca provides organizations with tools to address critical security gaps. Whether detecting shadow IT accounts, mitigating insider threats, or securing third-party access, Syteca demonstrates how PAM solutions can evolve to meet the needs of today’s security-conscious organizations.</p>
<p>As competition in the PAM market intensifies, solutions like Syteca will be instrumental in helping organizations achieve their security goals. With its comprehensive feature set and forward-thinking approach, Syteca is well-positioned to redefine what it means to manage privileged access effectively in the 21st century.</p>

			 What the electronic seal is and what it is for 		 
				 
				 
				 
			 What the electronic seal is and how it works 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>The electronic seal is a digital technology that guarantees the authenticity, integrity and origin of the digital documents to which it is applied. It was introduced by EU Regulation 910/2014 (eIDAS), which defines it as a set of data in electronic form “which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form” with the aim of guaranteeing the origin and integrity of the document.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This tool can be considered as a kind of digital stamp, used predominantly by legal entities (companies, organisations) to certify the origin and integrity of digital documents. Unlike an electronic signature, which identifies a natural person, an electronic seal associates the document with an organisational entity, protecting it from unauthorised modification and guaranteeing its authenticity.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 The qualified electronic seal (QeSeal) 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>The qualified electronic seal is created using a device that contains a qualified certificate, which guarantees the highest level of security and reliability for the authentication of digital documents. This is an advanced version of the electronic seal, which offers additional legal guarantees thanks to its compliance with strict European standards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Unlike the advanced electronic seal (AdESeal), a qualified electronic seal is created by means of a device containing a certificate issued in compliance with the requirements laid down by EU legislation. It can, therefore, be defined as the equivalent of a qualified electronic signature, the only difference being that it does not refer to a natural person, but to a legal entity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So while, through a digital signature, the data of the natural person who applied it can be traced, a qualified electronic seal makes it possible to trace the name of the legal entity. For this reason, it can be used for myriad activities, even by numerous parties belonging to the same company or organisation. It can, for example, be used to prove ownership of business documents, to protect intellectual works, for certificates of incorporation, for the management of medical records and medical reports as well as for many other purposes.</p>   						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How to Obtain It 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>To obtain it, a legal entity must go through an even more stringent verification process, conducted by a Certification Authority authorised by a government agency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>InfoCert was among the first Qualified Trust Service Providers to be certified for the Qualified Electronic Seal, gaining recognition for its qualified validation services. This allows InfoCert to issue electronic seals for multiple uses, such as the <a href="https://infocert.digital/consumer/eprel/">eSeal for EPREL</a>, the European Product Registry for Energy Labelling, with which companies wishing to apply for the energy classification of their products must register.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Find out more about the <a href="https://infocert.digital/consumer/eseal/">Electronic Seal</a>.</p>

tas

Fri, 12/06/2024 - 07:34


            <p>Sentinel-1C will supply vital radar imagery for understanding climate change and preserving our planet</p>
<p>Kourou, December 6, 2024 – The Copernicus Sentinel-1C Earth observation satellite, built by prime contractor Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), was successfully launched by a Vega C rocket operated by Arianespace from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.</p>

<p>Sentinel-1C is part of Copernicus, the Earth Observation component of the European Union’s Space Programme. This programme is managed by the European Commission and funded by the EU with a partial contribution of the European Space Agency (ESA), the organisation responsible for the development and launches of dedicated Sentinel satellites. ESA also operates some of the missions and ensures the availability of data.</p>
<p>Sentinel-1C will join the Sentinel-1A satellite in orbit, providing images of the Earth’s surface, day and night and in all weather conditions, for a broad array of science applications designed to protect our planet.</p>
<p>This crucial data will be used to monitor landslides, earthquake zones, volcanic activity and variations in polar ice cover. They will also provide valuable insights for monitoring deforestation, the use of water resources and supporting emergency responders and search and rescue teams in the event of natural disasters. In addition, Sentinel-1C is the first satellite of the Sentinel-1 mission to be equipped with an&nbsp; Automatic Identification System payload, enabling it to play a vital role in maritime safety by improving traffic management, avoiding collisions and monitoring ships in critical areas.</p>
 
    
 
<p>Sentinel-1C preparation for fit check ©Thales Alenia Space_ImaginE</p>
<p>The Sentinel-1 mission comprises two satellites in Sun-synchronous orbit operating in tandem to provide optimal global coverage with a 12-day repeat cycle. Their pre-tasking capability means that data can be acquired consistently over long periods, which is essential for analyzing environmental trends. &nbsp;This data is accessible to public authorities, companies and citizens around the world on a free, full and open basis.</p>
<p>As prime contractor for the Sentinel-1 mission on behalf of ESA, Thales Alenia Space is responsible for satellite design, development, integration and testing. Each Sentinel-1 satellite is built on the PRIMA spacecraft bus developed by Thales Alenia Space for the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and carries a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument developed by Airbus Defence &amp; Space. This SAR instrument enables precise mapping at resolutions up to 5 meters and coverage out to 400 kilometers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m delighted with the successful launch of the Sentinel-1C satellite, which will supply vital radar imagery for a broad array of science applications to help preserve our planet,” said Giampiero Di Paolo, Deputy CEO, Senior Vice President Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space. “The teams at Thales Alenia Space, who are contributing to 11 of the 12 missions in the Copernicus programme, can be proud of this success, which marks a new phase in our collaboration with the European Commission and the European Space Agency.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a launch mass of around 2.2 metric tons, Sentinel-1C will operate in low-Earth orbit at an altitude of 700 km and has a design life of 7.25 years. It will be joined in orbit by its twin Sentinel-1D, currently undergoing cleanroom tests at Thales Alenia Space’s facility in Cannes. These latest Sentinel-1 satellites feature an innovative world first: a patented mechanism to separate the radar antenna from the spacecraft bus on re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere at the end of their lifetime, thus helping mitigate orbital debris.</p>
<p>Leonardo contributed to the development of the Sentinel-1C and 1D satellites by supplying the attitude sensors (Autonomous Star Tracker) and the power units that feed the radar, ensuring continuous availability of images.</p>
<p>Data from the Sentinel-1C satellite will be collected by several European centers, including the ground station of the e-GEOS space center, a joint venture between Telespazio (80%) and the Italian space agency (20%), located in Matera, Italy.</p>
<p>About Copernicus </p>
<p>Copernicus is the Earth observation component of the European Union’s Space Programme, looking at our planet and its environment to benefit all European citizens. It provides accurate, timely and easily accessible information to improve the management of the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure civil security. The world’s most advanced Earth Observation system, Copernicus provides continuous, free, and reliable Earth observation data and services to public authorities, companies and citizens around the globe.</p>
<p>Copernicus comprises several families of satellites and a series of monitoring networks (e.g. ground based weather stations, ocean buoys and air quality monitoring networks) to provide robust integrated information and to calibrate and validate the data from satellites.</p>
<p>The satellites are built by European prime contractors for ESA. A program of this scale enables Europe to better anticipate the consequences of global warming so that we can safeguard our planet.</p>
<p>The programme is managed by the European Commission and is co-funded by the European Union and ESA. The European Space Agency is responsible for the coordination, implementation and evolution of the programme, as well as the operations of some spacecrafts.</p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space, a key Copernicus partner</p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space is a major contributor to 11 of the Copernicus programme’s 12 missions. Sentinel-1 monitors land and sea in all weather conditions, day and night, thanks to its radar capabilities. Sentinel-2 and -3 acquire high-resolution optical imagery over land and coastal waters. Sentinel-4 and -5 are dedicated to meteorology and climatology missions. Sentinel-6 monitors the planet’s oceans. As well as being prime contractor for the Sentinel-1 and -3 satellite families, Thales Alenia Space also supplied the Sentinel-2 image ground segment and helped build the imaging spectrometer on Sentinel-5P and the Poseidon-4 radar altimeter on Sentinel-6. In 2020, Thales Alenia Space was awarded five contracts for the six new Copernicus Expansion missions, as prime contractor for the CIMR, ROSE-L and CHIME satellites and supplier of the CRISTAL and CO2M mission payloads. These new satellites will measure human-induced atmospheric carbon dioxide, survey sea ice and snow cover, support new optimized services for sustainable farming and biodiversity, observe sea-surface temperature and salinity as well as sea ice density and strengthen land monitoring and emergency management services.</p>

				 <p>By Helen Gareau</p>
<p>Interoperability is the cornerstone of decentralized identity, ensuring that diverse ecosystems can seamlessly interact&nbsp; with each other. At Indicio, we are constantly working to advance&nbsp; interoperability so that customer solutions will be able to work with all the emerging standards and protocols and effortlessly scale to meet opportunities. This is why we are excited to participate in the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/join-the-didcomm-interop-a-thon/">upcoming DIDComm Interop-a-thon, organized by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://didcomm.org/">DIDComm</a> is short for Decentralized Identifier Communication, an open standard for secure, private, peer-to-peer communication between Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). It’s one of the least-well understood aspects of decentralized identity and one of the most powerful —&nbsp;especially for business. DIDComm enables each party in a decentralized identity ecosystem to seamlessly authenticate the other over a secure channel before sharing data. But it also enables a mobile device to function with the capacity of an API, enabling anyone with a mobile phone and digital wallet to become their own, highly available, easily permissioned, data platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many people think about decentralized identity as an “identity verification” solution — not surprising given the scale of current identity fraud —&nbsp;DIDComm enables decentralized identity to go beyond that and create trust networks for much richer digital relationships and data sharing.</p>
<p>For the upcoming Interop-a-thon, Indicio is providing our <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-public-mediator-2/">robust mediator</a>. Mediators play a critical role in the DIDComm protocol, enabling message routing between mobile devices, ensuring smooth and secure communication. Developers will be able to access the Indicio Mediator to test routing and communication scenarios in a secure, reliable environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we are committed to supporting the decentralized identity community. By supporting events like the DIDComm DIF Interop-a-thon, we’re not only contributing infrastructure but also championing the values of collaboration and innovation that drive this space forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can’t wait to see the incredible advancements that emerge from this event. If you’re attending, be sure to test with our mediator and share your experiences with us. Together, we’ll continue to build a decentralized future that works for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to learn more about the DIDComm DIF Interop-a-thon or our work with mediators? <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Contact us</a>. Let’s build the future of interoperability together!</p>

  Name: Juliano C. C. Tavares<br>Team: Engineering<br>Based in:&nbsp;Paraná, Brazil   About Juliano <p>I always knew I wanted to work in computing, and my journey began with university projects. My focus then was distributed systems and wireless networks, so I started specializing in those. I worked for a few years with wireless networks and embedded systems, completing a master's degree in IoT during that time. After a few years of working in the field, I realized that I liked working with web development much more and started to follow that path.</p><p>SpruceID came into my life years later as a professional challenge. It is very exciting to develop ambitious projects and open-source libraries that contribute to the digital future.</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>I'm currently a senior software engineer at SpruceID, working mainly with front-ends and occasionally touching some wild Rust code. I believe my biggest contributions here were in the SSX project, which is a wrapper for our other library SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum), and also this year in the project with Utah. I had the opportunity to work here on some things I was very interested in learning about (e.g., WebAssembly and mobile development) and things I had never imagined working with (Rust front-end). We definitely have a lot of challenges and opportunities to learn and apply new tools and technologies.</p> What do you find most rewarding about your role? <p>I am very happy when we finish a project, and it starts to be used by customers. At SpruceID, in addition to the projects that the end user will use, we also have libraries that other developers can build with. There is a huge potential for people who will be reached by our work.</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Curiosity and persistence. We work with technologies that are still evolving, and our decisions will shape many of the paths forward. With no established playbook to guide us, we rely on our own exploration and determination to define the way.</p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>I have a web development background and am venturing into mobile. I'm still trying to improve my skills and knowledge in this area.</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>In addition to what I said earlier about the projects, I couldn't leave out our team meetings. We had many incredible moments in Japan, Ireland, and Portugal, and I can't forget to mention everyone's visit to Brazil, where I was able to show a little more about my culture.</p> What's the best piece of advice you've received since starting here? <p>Have confidence in your work—it’s genuinely excellent, and we all recognize and appreciate that.</p> What is some advice that you’d give to someone in your role who is early in their career? <p>Challenge yourself to solve problems that you look at and say, "I have no idea where to start."</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>Deliver on time, few without bugs, and with good code.</p> Fun Facts <p>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?:&nbsp;cooking, watching movies, playing volleyball and camping with friends.</p><p>What is your favorite coding language (and why?):&nbsp;JavaScript/TypeScript, because it's what I've used the most and feel most comfortable coding with.</p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: I would be a Trumpet Tree. It is a Brazilian tree, and here we call it Ipê, which is a name originating from Tupi and means "rough-barked tree." This tree is very common here and always colors our springs.</p><p>Interested in joining our team? Check out our open roles and apply online!</p> <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/sprucesystems?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Apply to Join Us</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

            <p>Thales has been approved as a silver support partner of SOC-CMM, highlighting our commitment to help organisations enhance their security operations. Through this accreditation and partnership, we’re trusted to deliver Security Operations Centre (SOC) Maturity Assessments that meet what’s widely recognised as the global standard.</p>
 The Importance of Independent Assessments 
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, independent and objective assessments like SOC-CMM are vital. They provide an unbiased evaluation of an organisation's security operations, identifying strengths and areas for improvement to help ensure the SOC is developing in the right direction or operating at peak efficiency and effectiveness. An external review can bring fresh perspectives and insights that internal teams might overlook, helping to uncover hidden vulnerabilities and optimise security processes.</p>
 Why SOC-CMM Assessments Matter 
<p>SOC-CMM assessments provide a structured framework for evaluating the maturity of a SOC. This includes assessing business drivers, governance, capabilities, processes, and overall effectiveness in managing security operations. By following the SOC-CMM framework, organisations can benchmark their SOC against industry standards and best practices, ensuring they meet or exceed these benchmarks.</p>
<p>The assessment covers key pillars such as business alignment, people, processes, technology, services and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>SOC-CMM assessments help companies identify gaps in their security operations and provide a clear road map for improving SOC capabilities. This allows them to prioritise improvements and allocate resources more effectively, leading to more robust and resilient security operations.</p>
<p>Demonstrating a commitment to high standards in cybersecurity can also build trust with customers, partners, and stakeholders, ultimately enhancing an organisation's reputation.</p>
<p>Michael Cormack, Managing SOC Consultant at Thales, said: “One of the common frustrations we hear from our customers is that the return on investment is not always understood by the business. By identifying inefficiencies and areas where resources are not effective, we’ve helped our customers to streamline their security operations, strengthening their business case and continued investment and growth towards SOC so they can stay ahead of the developing threat landscape.”</p>

<p>This article is the sixth and final article in a series about our <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking product</a>, Track &amp; Trust. Our previous articles described how the system works. Now, we dive into the results of our pilot operations. TLDR – We successfully tracked all the goods to their final delivery locations despite serious challenges!</p>
 The Track &amp; Trust Mission in Southern Lebanon 
<p></p>
<p>We chose to track shipments of solar equipment for the Track &amp; Trust Pilot. Destined for clinics and schools serving refugees in Beqaa Valley, Lebanon, these shipments were critical to the region. The area is home to over 300,000 Syrian refugees, according to <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/lb/bekaa-zahle#:~:text=As%20of%2001%20January%202023,total%20number%20of%20registered%20refugees.">UNHCR</a>, and they all need medical care. Our partners, <a href="https://aidpioneers.com/home">Aid Pioneers</a>, <a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/about-us/">Multi Aid Programs</a>, and <a href="https://al-manhaj-lb.org/home/">Al-Manhaj</a>, collaborate to provide logistics, education, and medical care on the ground.</p>
<p>The clinics and schools require continuous a continuous electrical power supply. Due to Lebanon’s severe energy crisis, the public grid provides only about two hours of electricity per day, making the delivery of efficient healthcare services an immense challenge. In absence of a stable grid, most of the region’s essential services rely on generators, leaving the financial stability of operations at the whim of the ever-increasing price of diesel. Typical health clinics have thousands of dollars in monthly operating costs due to the need to purchase this fuel. To address this, Aid Pioneers is replacing diesel power systems with clean, abundant solar energy, one clinic at a time. By reliably shipping the equipment from Tripoli to Beqaa Valley, they achieve this goal with our help. Specifically the shipments we’ve tracked during the pilot contained all the equipment needed to outfit two clinics with enough solar power to cover all their needs. Aid Pioneers partner, <a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/about-us/">Multi Aid Programs</a><a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/">&nbsp;</a>runs the clinics which received the solar and medical equipment we tracked.</p>
 Tracking Impact 
<p></p>
<p>Using Track &amp; Trust, Aid Pioneers and their partners gained a clear view of what was happening to the parts in their shipment. As a result, they avoided extra trips, saving work and potential exposure to danger. Our team planned this deployment long before the recent conflict broke out, and our system performed well in the midst of a very difficult situation. Effective management of the challenges that arose was crucial to the success of the project.</p>
<p>During the shipments, ground personnel encountered outages of critical infrastructure, losing power and 4G connectivity several times. Fortunately, our Track &amp; Trust mesh node infrastructure filled the gap, and our battery backup system enabled the system to run despite the power grid being down. The system’s design allowed it to handle such outages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When 4G connectivity was lost, our mesh nodes cached delivery data until it could be passed between nodes. Utilizing technologies developed with our partner, <a href="https://www.weaverlabs.io/">Weaver Labs</a>, we ensured the data was secure. Next, we used a satellite-enabled mesh node to post data that would have otherwise been lost via Iridium satellite uplink, developed by our partner <a href="https://ororatech.com/">Ororatech</a>.</p>
<p>Aid Pioneers received hundreds of updates about the status of the goods from us. To ensure the integrity of the data, we cryptographically signed and anchored these updates to the ASI Alliance blockchain, making them highly trustworthy. This extra step was crucial to the project’s success. Together the result is highly trustable <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking</a>.</p>
 Energy Independence One Clinic at a Time 
<p></p>
<p>Two major sets of shipments were completed under the watchful eye of Track &amp; Trust, and a third set is currently being shipped to Lebanon. With 110 kWp of power, the solar systems make two entire clinics energy independent for the next twenty years. Additionally, we tracked a container of medical goods, which <a href="https://al-manhaj-lb.org/home/">Al-Manhaj</a> and <a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/about-us/">Multi Aid Programs</a> are using to save lives and provide medical treatment in Tripoli and the Beqaa Valley.</p>
 Track &amp; Trust Proof of Resilience 
<p>The design of Track &amp; Trust allows it to work in various contexts, providing resilience and <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking</a>. Adaptable to different scenarios, our system is highly versatile. As we continue to develop and refine our system, we will meet the changing needs of our partners.</p>
 Next Steps 
<p>Following this piloting success, we will examine plans to make the system more user-friendly. Logistics organizations that could use more resilience in their field operations are also being contacted. If this series of blog posts has piqued your interest, please <a href="mailto:rebecca.johnson@datarella.com">reach out</a>, and we will schedule a call or demo.</p>

 Digitalization ‘for all’? An Update on Germany’s Public Sector from the 2024 Smart Country Convention <p>As governments around the world step up to regulate artificial intelligence and biometrics, a different class of technology aims to disrupt digital identity: digital wallets. Caribou is leading a research project that aims to advance migrants’ identification needs in digital identity wallet policy and technology design. <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/identity-and-migration/">Explore the&nbsp;project</a>.</p><p>Since 2018, the Smart Country Convention has set out to bring together Germany’s digital economy and political decision-makers, as well as other stakeholders in the ever-growing field of public sector digital transformation.</p><p>The event is hosted by Messe Berlin, the Berlin Expo Center, and bitkom e.V., one of Germany’s largest industry associations for the digital economy. According to <a href="https://www.smartcountry.berlin/en/concept/facts-and-figures/">its website</a>, the Smart Country Convention — or SCCON for short — has become “the biggest event for smart cities, smart regions and e-government” in Germany. Indeed, with more than 18,000 attendees, over 17,000 square meters of exhibition space and a conference program featuring more than 650 speakers on 7 stages, the event is a large-scale, upbeat demonstration of what the future of the German public sector might look like — or at least what technology vendors, policymakers and other professionals in this field imagine it&nbsp;will.</p><p>In between ping-pong matches, live podcast recordings, and free frozen yoghurt, keynote speakers and panelists discussed the current state of digital transformation in the German public sector. They shed light on challenges, best practices and how to work towards Germany’s policy priorities for digital transformation, as outlined in the <a href="https://digitalstrategie-deutschland.de/static/eb25ff71f36b8cf2d01418ded8ae3dc2/Digitalstrategie_EN.pdf">2022 Digital Strategy</a> of the now defunct <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v3r046pzzo">Traffic Light Coalition</a>. These insights also revealed the stark discrepancy between the image projected by SCCON and where the country actually stands. Take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRtjBQ5YSaQ">opening keynote by Kai Wegner</a>, the governing mayor of Berlin, on the second day of SCCON. He announced that Berliners can now register/change their address online — if they have downloaded the AusweisApp, opened a BundID account, have an NFC-enabled smartphone or special card reader, and either the German national ID card, the eID card for citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area, or an electronic residence card with an active eID function (and remember the PIN code they need for all of this to&nbsp;work).</p>October 16, 2024, Day 2 Opening&nbsp;Keynote.<p>The excitement and sense of digital awakening evoked by Wegner’s keynote, set against a backdrop of flashing lights and cinema-size screens, illustrates the immense undertaking Germany has ahead of it. So far, the country <a href="https://www.bundesrechnungshof.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Berichte/2023/onlinezugangsgesetz-volltext.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2">has fallen far short of its stated goal of digitizing access to nearly 600 public services by 2022.</a> On the day of the deadline, only 19% of these services were available online. <a href="https://insm.de/aktuelles/publikationen/digitale-transformation-deutschland-scheitert-beim-e-government">By the beginning of 2024, only 153 services had gone online nationwide.</a> In terms of the overall target, this represents an implementation rate of just 26.6% — a full year after the original deadline. Germany’s sluggish pace makes the city-state of Hamburg,<a href="https://dashboard.digitale-verwaltung.de/"> where 284 public services are available online</a>, the (literal) North Star of this ongoing restructuring process.</p><p>At the heart of this public administration overhaul is the issue of digital identity management and how governments, whether at the federal, regional or local level, enable access to services. It’s against this backdrop that another name has emerged in the competition for the most innovative city: Wiesbaden. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSLpFpihvSg&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=24">Maral Koohestanian, Deputy Mayor of Wiesbaden, was one of four panelists who discussed the state of digital identity in Germany at this year’s SCCON, moderated by Clemens Schleupner of bitkom.</a> Koohestanian, <a href="https://voltdeutschland.org/neuigkeiten/maral-koohestanian-fuehrt-volt-in-die-bundestagswahl-2025">who is now leading the Bundestag election campaign for Volt</a>, emphasized Wiesbaden’s pragmatic approach. <a href="https://webid-solutions.com/de/ressourcen/presse/egovernment-wiesbadens-politik-beschliesst-videoidentifikation-stadtweit/">Working with WebID and ekom, the city has adopted VideoID to provide access to public services.</a></p><p>According to Koohestanian, Wiesbaden’s approach is unique in Germany. Many people have already been introduced to VideoID, for example when opening a bank account. So the process is known and accepted. In comparison, the identity verification approach taken by Berlin and other cities is based on the national eID infrastructure, as mentioned above. While Germany’s national eID infrastructure covers three types of documents (i.e. the national identity card [Personalausweis], the eID card for EU/EAA citizens, the electronic residence permit), VideoID can be used to verify around 200 international identity documents. VideoID therefore is open to more users, also because it requires less specific equipment.</p><p>During the panel discussion, Koohestanian underlined the advantage that VideoID offers in terms of the inclusiveness of the approach and its overall user acceptance. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSLpFpihvSg&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=24">The numbers she presented</a> seem to speak for themselves: When registering a wedding date at the Wiesbaden registry office, 98% opted to do so online, compared to 2% of people who preferred to register in person (in all cases, the ceremony itself takes place in person). Of the online users, 92.5% chose VideoID, compared to 7.5% who preferred the eID option. If people want to register/change their address online, <a href="https://www.wiesbaden.de/medien/rathausnachrichten/PM_Zielseite.php?showpm=true&amp;pmurl=https://www.wiesbaden.de/guiapplications/newsdesk/publications/Landeshauptstadt_Wiesbaden/141010100000474138.php">in Wiesbaden this service is for now carried out exclusively via&nbsp;VideoID.</a></p><p>Koohestanian’s emphasis foreshadowed the theme of the next day’s opening keynote by Federal Minister Lisa Paus (Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth). “Some people today are afraid that the digitalization train could leave without them,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU6Prs2rOdo&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa-wn8ynMFrNZCEFGBL60Pga&amp;index=57">Paus said in her speech</a>, stressing the need to strengthen inclusion, participation and accessibility of the digital transformation in Germany. While focusing on the inclusion of the elderly, Paus raised the question of how to ensure that digitalization is for all. As important as this question is, it however first requires a definition of what ‘for all’&nbsp;means.</p><p>Looking at the emerging digital identity ecosystem in Germany, ‘all’ currently seems to include only those who have access to the country’s existing eID infrastructure, i.e. people with German citizenship, EU citizens living in Germany, and non-EU citizens who have successfully applied for a residence permit. This may sound like Germany has all its citizens and residents covered. But the situation is more complicated than it might seem at first glance. Take, for example, non-EU citizens who come to Germany to take up a job offer. <a href="https://www.bamf.de/EN/Themen/MigrationAufenthalt/ZuwandererDrittstaaten/Migrathek/Einreisebestimmungen/einreisebestimmungen-node.html">If they enter on a work visa, this title is usually valid for up to 12 months.</a> During this time, they will have to deal with the German bureaucracy, especially the immigration authorities at their place of residence to apply for and receive their electronic residence permit.</p><p>At present, this interaction can be a largely paper-based, face-to-face process, depending on the local authority, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIE-jsSUZ3g&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=54">a topic that was the subject of another panel discussion at SCCON.</a> During this panel discussion, Engelhard Mazanke, head of the Berlin Landesamt für Einwanderung, the city-state’s immigration authority, explained that practices vary widely across Germany. Not every immigration authority allows things to be sent to them as PDFs. Often documents have to be submitted in the original, perhaps even with an apostille. Mazanke criticized the fact that migration-related procedures are always dealt with on the assumption of potential misuse, even when processing applications for what he described as the ‘Rolls-Royce’ category of all residence permits, the EU Blue Card. Opportunities for digitizing processes and simplifying bureaucracy are limited if this is the default attitude towards non-Germans, he explained.</p><p><a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/wiesbaden-und-koeln-bedenkliches-videoident-verfahren-soll-gang-aufs-amt-sparen/">Concerns about misuse are also a reason for criticism of the use of VideoID in Wiesbaden.</a> The German eID infrastructure, on the other hand, is regarded as highly secure. In the context of eIDAS 2.0, it provides the only means of identification suitable for verifying the identity of Germany-based EUDI wallet users in accordance with LoA high requirements. At the SCCON panel on digital identity, the representative of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior raised the issue of the reliability of identity systems outside Europe when asked how people in Germany who are outside the national eID infrastructure could be integrated into the country’s emerging wallet ecosystem. About an hour later, on another stage, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIE-jsSUZ3g&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=54">Tobias Lindner, Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office, emphasized the need for attractive migration processes and for Germany to present itself as welcoming and service-oriented to new residents and citizens.</a></p><p>As such, SCCON brought to the fore another challenge for Germany’s digital transformation efforts. Not only is there a tension between inclusion and security concerns. The messages from government officials and policymakers tell different stories, illustrating the fragmentation of political decision-making and implementation processes. Given the centrality of digital identity to Germany’s vision of modern statehood, it would certainly be a good topic for the country to start speaking with one&nbsp;voice.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digitalization-for-all-fb86e03ad679">Digitalization ‘for all’?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>How can we ensure that the person presenting a credential is truly the same person who received the credential? This is a crucial question, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Our approach is to have the biometric provider issue a short-lived credential attesting to a recent biometric check whenever the issuer or verifier needs to confirm the physical presence of a credential holder. This biometric check credential can be used by the issuer to embed biometric-binding attributes into the primary credential of interest (the credential issued by a standard issuer, such as a bank or government authority), and then it can be used by the verifier to check that it is the same person presenting the primary credential. Let's break down the process:</p>  Enrollment: The first step involves the user providing a biometric sample, such as a thumbprint or face scan, which the biometric provider can use to generate a biometric enrollment credential. The key advantage here is that the biometric data remains on the user's device—there's no need for the biometric provider to maintain a large, potentially vulnerable database. This credential, signed by the biometric provider, is secure and tamper-proof.  Issuance: The biometric provider can use the enrollment credential from the previous step to derive a separate biometric check credential that is shared with the issuer of the primary credential. The biometric check credential does not contain the biometric data, but is evidence that the biometric provider was able to successfully check a biometric that matches a specific privacy-preserving biometric ID. The issuer embeds into the primary credential some attributes identifying the issuer of the biometric check credential and the biometric ID that was used. These are known as biometric-binding attributes.  Verification: When verifying the primary credential, relying parties will also request a fresh biometric check credential. The user’s wallet will enable the biometric provider to perform a new biometric check and issue the associated credential containing the same biometric ID that was recorded in the enrollment credential. The verifier can then confirm that the biometric ID in the primary credential matches the biometric ID in the biometric check credential, proving that it is the same physical person who was issued the primary credential.  <p>As an example, let’s look at how a bank can tie a customer identity credential to an individual’s biometric. Before issuing the credential, the bank would request that the customer shares a fresh biometric check credential. This will trigger the wallet to enroll the customer’s biometric as part of issuing the biometric check credential. The bank can then embed the biometric-binding attributes into the customer identity credential that they issue. When the customer wants to prove their identity to a verifier, the verifier can require a recent biometric check credential along with the bank-issued identity credential. This will trigger the wallet to have the biometric provider run a biometric check and issue a new biometric check credential which will then be used to confirm that the person presenting the bank identity credential is indeed the same person who originally received it.</p><p>By making the biometric provider a recognized issuer within the credentialing ecosystem, we streamline the process. All necessary integrations happen on the user's device, ensuring data security while allowing for robust biometric proofing and credential binding. This method eliminates the need for each participant in the ecosystem to integrate directly with the biometric provider, reducing complexity and cost. Additionally, the biometric provider can monetize their services as these credentials are utilized throughout the ecosystem.</p><p>You can learn more by reading our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/solutions/biometric-bound-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">documentation on biometric-bound credentials</a> and the <a href="https://docs.dock.io/developer-documentation/wallet-sdk/biometric-plugin?ref=blog.dock.io">biometric service provider plugin for wallets</a>.</p>

            <p>What if we solve society's problems by looking at nature's toolbox? We continue our series with a focus on superhydrophobicity, and investigate how it can help keep optical equipment functioning in an optimum manner in the harshest conditions.</p>
 What is superhydrophobicity? 
<p></p> 
 
  
     
               © Thales 
       
   
 
<p>“Picture a lotus leaf” encourages Julie Cholet, Research Engineer at Thales. “When water lands on the surface it adopts a spherical configuration and is repelled. This is superhydrophobicity. For an object like a lotus leaf, it enables the surface to minimise its contact with water.”</p>
<p>This property is widely seen in nature, where certain plants and animals have evolved to repel water for survival. This so called "lotus effect" refers to the leaf's ability to self-clean due to its ultra-water-repellent surface. When a water droplet lands on the leaf, it simply beads up and rolls off, carrying dirt and debris with it—much like how wax resists water. This ability to reject water is not just limited to the lotus; many plants have evolved similar strategies to protect themselves from excess water, dirt, and pathogens, each with its unique biological purpose.</p>
<p>“Almost all plants and animals are hydrophobic because no living organism wants to get completely soaked,” points out Edwin Plokker, Curator at Museumfabriek (“Museum factory”), a natural history museum in Enschede in the Netherlands. “In the animal kingdom, superhydrophobicity is crucial to improve the chances of survival.”</p>
<p></p> 

   
      
   
 

 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many animals, particularly insects, amphibians, and aquatic species, have developed ways to repel water. For example, water striders use superhydrophobic legs to "walk" on water, and certain frogs have water-resistant skin to prevent drowning. Birds, like penguins, have tightly packed feathers coated with oils that create a superhydrophobic surface, allowing them to stay dry in freezing waters and maintain their body heat.</p>
 Replicating natural phenomena 
<p>Such properties have inspired researchers at Thales to study how to replicate these natural phenomena. At the Group’s <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/global/innovation-by-thales">Research &amp; Technology</a> centre in Palaiseau, just south of Paris, Julie Cholet and her team focus on multifunctional surfaces that combine superhydrophobic properties with other functionalities, such as antireflective surfaces, inspired by insects like the Greta oto butterfly, which has transparent wings that naturally minimise reflection and glare.</p>
<p></p> 
 
  
     
               © Thales 
       
   
 
<p>“We take this inspiration into our clean rooms where we study micro- and nanofabrications. The possible uses for such surfaces are very wide, particularly in optical systems used in vehicles,” explains Julie Cholet. “For these Thales systems, often featuring high-performance video cameras, it offers a durable solution because you don’t need maintenance.”</p>
<p>Through these naturally inspired advances, the team aims to enhance performance, durability, and safety. One example where these technologies have been tested is the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/defence-and-security/naval-forces/above-water-warfare/gatekeeper">Gatekeeper</a>, an electro-optic security system with cameras that need to provide ships with a continuous 360° panoramic visual overview in harsh environmental conditions. Having high-performance, durable surfaces that can withstand extreme humidity while maintaining optimal functionality can provide a key operational advantage.</p>
<p>“Nature developed these properties through evolution,” points out Julie. “Our research in superhydrophobicity goes back a decade, but we are already seeing great results – and it’s only just the beginning!”<br>

<p>Virtualization continues to have challenges. Directories and databases continue to increase in complexity and diversity. As the cost of owning a virtual directory has increased so has the required features to compensate for the complexity and diversity.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The increasing popularity of the term “Identity Security”, coupled with the explosive growth in the number of&nbsp; identity security vendors, bears testament to the fact that security starts and often ends with identity. But with so many tools, so many processes moving part making up the modern identity fabric, do you really know what is really happening behind the curtain and inside all that IAM infrastructure?&nbsp; Accounts are created, entitlements are assigned, users authenticate, access is authorized and data is accessed.&nbsp; This process not only happens for the standard users coming in through a nicely federated, passwordless authentication solution, but also for your admins, your agents and the service accounts they leverage. The very process of IAM is happening across all of your infrastructure, from legacy applications to cloud services and beyond into IaaS and the SaaS services you subscribe to. But when something changes in that flow, the configuration for an IdP or a relying system changes, or an update is made to profile configuration, orchestration flow or group assignment - will you identify the change, understand its meaning and forecast its overall risk to your identity security posture?&nbsp; Are you instrumented for the future state of IAM?</p>
<p>In his talk, KuppingerCole Fellow Analyst Darran Rolls, former CISO and CTO at SailPoint, will outline how Identity instrumentation and orchestration technology can help reverse-engineer the authentication and authorization flow of applications and provide key insights into configuration and usage.&nbsp; He will explain how the future state of IGA, ITDR, and overall Identity Security must deliver instrumentation to allow visibility, configuration and usage information for all applications and will highlight how emerging technologies can help fill this gap.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/looking-behind-the-curtain-cre24"></a>

<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-ai-deepfakes-and-scams-are-changing-the-way-we-shop-online/">McAfee’s 2024 Global Holiday Shopping Scams Study</a> pinpoints AI-generated deepfake texts, emails and web sites promoting fake products, deals and giveaways as the main concern for holiday shoppers this year, with <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-ai-deepfakes-and-scams-are-changing-the-way-we-shop-online/">70 per cent</a> of American shoppers saying AI-driven scams are changing the way they shop online, and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241115918692/en/McAfee%E2%80%99s-2024-Global-Holiday-Shopping-Scams-Study-Highlights-Growing-Concerns-Over-AI-Powered-Scams-Including-Deepfakes-Impacting-Holiday-Shoppers">59 per cent</a> saying they’re more concerned by scams this year than they were last year.</p>



<p>Deepfake technology uses AI to create fabricated content such as video or photo impersonations, fake or cloned voices, images, or email. It makes content look like the real thing, within the proper context, and sounds or reads like&nbsp;a legitimate message. Behind the fake site or message is a bad actor waiting to pounce.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/11/07/new-chrome-safari-edge-firefox-warning-do-not-use-these-websites/">Forbes</a> and other outlets recently warned the billions of users of the most popular web browsers Chrome, Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox about bad actors who had infected 1,000+ web sites to create and promote fake product listings that landed high in search listings and were backed by 121 fake web stores. Estimated losses ran into the tens of millions over the past five years, and affected hundreds of thousands of consumers—and that was just from one scam campaign under investigation.</p>



<p>Leading into the holiday season and massive sales days like Black Friday, <a href="https://home.barclays/news/press-releases/2024/11/deal-or-steal--black-friday-shoppers-at-risk--as-only-half-carry/">Barclays</a> is warning shoppers not to be lax about scam checking, particularly those that come via email—the most reported type of shopping scam. Barclays is urging customers to check email alerts of sales that claim to be from a legitimate retailer like Amazon or Costco advertising their Black Friday deals before making a purchase.</p>



<p>In fact, being hypervigilant about checking the authenticity of holiday sales <a href="https://www.choice.com.au/consumers-and-data/protecting-your-data/data-privacy-and-safety/articles/how-to-check-if-email-or-text-is-scam">messages and email</a>s and the <a href="https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/education/basics/how-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit">URL</a>s they point you to, is key to beating the scammers.</p>



<p>Here’s our best advice:</p>



 Be suspicious of messages with: 



 
 Unsolicited offers or deals that seem too good to be true 



 Poor grammar or odd phrasing (but don’t rely on this being the case, as scammers and their AI-generated solicitations are getting more sophisticated) 



 A sense of urgency, such as “limited time offers” or “act now or miss out” messages 



 Links to unfamiliar websites. 
 



 Use secure payment methods 



<p>Use only reputable payment systems like credit cards or PayPal, which offer buyer protection. Avoid wire transfers or sending money via gift cards. <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">Or use a MySudo virtual card</a>.</p>



 Before purchasing, look for reviews of the online store or product you’re interested in 



<p>But remember: AI-generated fake reviews are now commonplace, so be cautious if the reviews seem overly positive or generic.</p>



 Be alert to fake holiday giveaways and contests, and fake social media profiles 



<p>Giveaways and contests that ask for personal information or require you to click a link are almost certainly scams. Always check the authenticity of any giveaway and don’t share your personal information unless you’re sure it’s with a legitimate source.</p>



<p>Scammers use AI to create fake social media profiles that look like real people, offering fake promotions or asking for donations. Look for verification badges or use reverse image search to confirm the person or brand is legitimate.</p>



 Be careful of pop-ups and banner ads that offer discounts, prizes or exclusive deals 



<p>Understand that these could redirect you to fake websites or lead to malware downloads.</p>



 Only click on links from trusted sources 



<p>If you see a link in an email or message that seems too good to be true, manually type the URL into your browser. Or, if it’s a merchant you have used before, use your bookmark for the site if you have one.</p>



 Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) 



<p>Adding an extra layer of security to your accounts on shopping sites, email accounts, and banks, can protect you from scams that want your login credentials. Don’t share or reuse passwords across different sites, especially for sensitive accounts.</p>



 Warn family and friends 



<p>Tell your people about the risks of AI-driven scams, especially older adults who may be less tech-savvy. You can also avoid deepfake scams involving loved ones, particularly the common <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-to-use-mysudo-to-save-loved-ones-from-voice-deep-fake-scams/">grandparent scam</a>, by using MySudo:</p>



<p>1.&nbsp;Set up a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;and assign it a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-6-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;that you&nbsp;only ever give out to your closest family and friends.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp;Be diligent about only giving out the number to your loved ones so that you build and protect a&nbsp;trusted communication channel with your inner circle.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;Tell your loved ones they can trust the safe Sudo number. If that number rings, the call recipient will know it’s a legitimate communication and it’s you on the end of the phone line. If you’ve been diligent in protecting your safe Sudo number, it is very unlikely a criminal would have it.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/easy-invite-a-friend-function-is-now-in-mysudo/">Invite your family and friends</a>&nbsp;to use MySudo and use the app’s&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/securely-chat-with-your-friends-with-free-sudo-handles/">handle</a>-based&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">end-to-end encrypted</a>&nbsp;calling to communicate with each other.</p>



<p>Share scam alerts, and follow organizations like the <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/scams">Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a> and <a href="https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker">Better Business Bureau (BBB)</a> to learn about and report scams.</p>



 Check the website’s URL 



<p>Always double check the website’s URL starts with “https://” and includes a secure padlock symbol in the address bar. <a href="https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/education/basics/how-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit">Learn more</a>.</p>



 Keep software updated 



<p>Regularly update your devices, browsers, and security software to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p>



 Keep up with AI trends 



<p>Get familiar with common AI scam tactics so you can spot them early and easily.</p>



 Fight AI with AI 



<p>Some antivirus and security software now includes AI-powered features that help detect phishing attempts, malicious links, and other scam activities. Use these tools for added protection.</p>

This approach allows them to test various strategies in diverse contexts, and identify what works best and for whom. However, this comes with a challenge for portfolio managers, how can they make confident decisions when presented with fundamentally different types of evidence?</p><p>Take two digital upskilling programs for entrepreneurs. One has gathered a selection of insights that shows high participant satisfaction scores and a series of uplifting stories. The other has modest results from a well-implemented randomized evaluation. Which one should get continued investment? This question reveals an often frustrating challenge in portfolio management: while demonstrating impact is key to scaling successful interventions, an end-to-end approach to measurement isn’t always feasible. This requires a framework to join disparate kinds of evidence.</p><p>This challenge emerges from the nature of portfolio work itself. Programs may be at different implementation stages, involve distinct initiatives, or offer different opportunities for measuring change based on their design and context. These differences naturally lead to varied impact measurement approaches. A startup testing a new financial inclusion solution requires different evaluation metrics than an established program preparing for national expansion.</p> Descriptive studies give an indication of immediate outcomes but may overstate long-term impact <p>Caribou’s analysis of 143 studies in our recently updated <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">Small Business Evidence Map</a> shows that different evaluation approaches tell different parts of an impact story. Initial assessments, like ex-post surveys or interviews, often present a positive view of a program. By capturing immediate reactions and experiences, they help programs adapt to local contexts and highlight key components that drive&nbsp;success.</p><p>This aligns with Bertrand and Mullainathan’s (2001) insights into <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=260131">subjective survey data reliability</a>. Data often captures immediate reactions and intentions rather than long-term behaviors. Participants, especially young entrepreneurs, may express optimism about their future, influenced more by personality and outlook than by any tangible support they received. McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/cbf23c46-7c97-5a20-b403-a5fe1f0ffe5f/content">document similar patterns</a> in business training evaluations, where participants’ stated intentions often diverged from actual implementation when faced with day-to-day time and resource constraints.</p><p>One of Caribou’s partners recently conducted a survey on the impact of a digital upskilling platform for entrepreneurs in a middle-income country. They asked about entrepreneurs’ perception of their business’ growth over the previous three&nbsp;months:</p><p>The data alone might be encouraging — over half of surveyed entrepreneurs reported business growth. This aligns with what we often see in entrepreneurship programs: participants tend to express optimism about their business trajectory. However, in this case their optimism has nothing to do with any support they received. Additional data reveals a fuller&nbsp;picture:</p><p>Comparing the control group to entrepreneurs who were actually invited to participate in the program shows almost identical levels of perceived growth. What initially looked like evidence of program success — high rates of perceived business growth among participants — was simply capturing the natural optimism of entrepreneurs and perhaps broader economic conditions. Without this comparison group, this positive outlook might have been mistakenly attributed to the&nbsp;program.</p><p>This example illustrates a broader point: the validity of findings depends heavily on study design and the potential for biases. <a href="https://catalogofbias.org/biases/selection-bias/">Selection bias</a>, <a href="https://catalogofbias.org/biases/recall-bias/">recall bias</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_bias">attribution bias</a> are common challenges. Without proper comparison, positive outcomes may be incorrectly attributed to a program’s influence. Yet understanding underwhelming or null results often requires looking beyond the numbers. Qualitative insights and implementation analysis can reveal more about the mechanisms behind underperformance.</p> Causal studies provide more reliable, and (usually) more modest, estimates of effectiveness <p>Causal studies, including <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/introduction-randomized-evaluations">Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)</a>, attempt to address these challenges by measuring actual behaviors rather than intentions. Their strict design and focus on specific pathways make it easier to attribute change to a program, though often they can only test limited pathways at a time. Between purely observational studies and RCTs lie other methods — like qualitative comparative analysis and process tracing — that can help establish causal relationships while accommodating complexity.</p><p>While causal studies excel at establishing causality, they often do so at the cost of generalizability. They are costly and may miss subtle mechanisms or long-term effects shaped by cultural, institutional, or local contexts. The trade-off between internal validity (precision in measurement) and external validity (ability to generalize) can be significant in portfolio evaluation, yet often lies beyond the scope of experimental designs (see Ravallion 2001 for an <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/410881468180273314/pdf/773500JRN02001000Vanishing0Benefits.pdf">entertaining and insightful discussion</a> of such methodological tensions).</p> Why not both? Strategically matching impact evidence&nbsp;types <p>Effective portfolio facilitation requires matching evidence approaches to specific needs. A mixed methods approach can strengthen causal claims by combining qualitative insights with quantitative rigor. Qualitative methods can reveal underlying mechanisms, while descriptive quantitative analysis helps identify patterns that need further&nbsp;testing.</p><p>This matching process requires careful judgment. For instance, an upskilling intervention might seem ready for scaling based on participant support, but portfolio managers need to understand if it actually improves business outcomes and under what conditions. Meanwhile, a program showing modest impacts in an RCT may offer key implementation lessons that could boost impact in different iterations through a careful analysis of its components.</p> Four practical ways to achieve a nuanced understanding of portfolio impact <p>Understanding impact requires both rigor and context. As development practitioners, we need to appreciate the value and limitations of both observational and causal studies to develop a nuanced understanding of intervention outcomes. At Caribou, we employ four specific strategies to effectively navigate the challenges of diverse impact approaches within a portfolio:</p>  We strategically mix impact approaches within projects and portfolios. A mixed methods approach can be used either within specific projects or across a portfolio of projects to get a fuller picture of impact. Within a single project, combining descriptive with causal studies can provide both qualitative insights and rigorous validation. However, using both methods for every project is rarely feasible due to resource or time constraints. At the portfolio level, employing a mix of study types across different projects can balance depth and rigor — using observational methods where exploratory insights are needed and causal studies where robust validation is possible. This strategic use of mixed methods gives us a more comprehensive understanding of impact across varied contexts. However, resource-intensive causal studies may not be needed for every scenario, especially if strong evidence is already available.  We exercise caution in interpretation. In practical terms, this means recognizing the limitations of each study type and not overrelying on any one method. For instance, when descriptive studies indicate a positive outcome,we consider whether biases might influence these findings. If causal evidence is lacking, we use the insights cautiously and look for additional validation before making major decisions or scaling interventions.  We adapt evaluation methods by program phase. In early stages, we use descriptive methods to gather insights and inform design. As programs mature, we incorporate causal methods to validate impact and ensure robustness.  We communicate findings transparently. We communicate clearly about the type of evidence used and its limitations, helping decision-makers make well-considered choices.  <p>By strategically combining and understanding the strengths and limitations of observational and causal studies, portfolio managers can overcome the challenges of using diverse impact approaches and instead, embrace their contributions. This helps achieve a balanced understanding of what works, for whom, and in what&nbsp;context.</p><p>If you are interested in discussing our approach, please contact us at <a href="mailto:marius@cariboudigital.net">Marius Karabaczek</a> or <a href="mailto:niamh@cariboudigital.net">Niamh&nbsp;Barry</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/blending-impact-evidence-types-across-portfolios-a-strategic-approach-to-decision-making-b001b73f756c">Blending impact evidence types across portfolios: A strategic approach to decision-making</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A look at <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a> in response to&nbsp;Vitalik <p>Vitalik Buterin’s recent <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/12/03/wallets.html">reflections on the future of wallets</a> underscore some of the most critical challenges facing the Web3 ecosystem today. Usability, security, and cross-chain interoperability are more than technical hurdles — they’re the foundation for making decentralized technologies truly accessible. At Ontology, these are the very issues we’ve been tackling as we build the infrastructure for self-sovereign identity and secure asset management in the Web3&nbsp;age.</p> The Wallet as the Gateway to&nbsp;Web3 <p>Vitalik aptly describes wallets as a user’s primary gateway to the decentralized world. Yet, for many, that gateway is still intimidating. Complex interfaces, fragmented support across chains, and opaque recovery mechanisms create barriers for all but the most technically savvy&nbsp;users.</p><p>We believe the future lies in wallets that seamlessly integrate usability with the robust principles of decentralization. To that end, we’re working on solutions that simplify multi-chain access while ensuring that users always remain in control of their assets and identities. The goal is clear: make wallets as intuitive as Web2 applications, but without sacrificing the self-sovereignty that makes Web3&nbsp;unique.</p> Redefining Security for Decentralized Systems <p>One of the blog’s most important points is the need for improved wallet security, particularly through social recovery and multisig options. These mechanisms offer a path to eliminate the vulnerabilities of single points of failure without reintroducing centralization.</p><p>At Ontology, our work in decentralized identity (DID) aligns perfectly here. DIDs enable users to control access to their own data and assets, with features like verifiable credentials and decentralized recovery mechanisms providing an additional layer of security. These innovations ensure that users can safeguard their wallets without relying on centralized platforms or entities.</p> Cross-Chain Interoperability and the Modular&nbsp;Wallet <p>As Vitalik points out, wallets must evolve to become modular, interoperable hubs for managing assets, identities, and decentralized applications (dApps). In this vision, a wallet isn’t just a tool for storing tokens — it’s a dynamic platform for accessing the entire Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>This shift mirrors our approach at Ontology. Through integrations with major blockchains and dApps, we’re enabling users to manage assets, interact with services, and control their identities seamlessly. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), play-to-earn games, and reputation systems demands a wallet infrastructure that isn’t tied to one chain but instead functions as a bridge across ecosystems.</p> Decentralized Identity as the Missing&nbsp;Link <p>Vitalik touches on a critical element of future wallets: identity. Wallets that incorporate decentralized identity and reputation can transform how users interact with Web3. At Ontology, we’ve long recognized this need. Decentralized identity (via our ONT ID framework) allows users to prove who they are, manage credentials, and build a reputation across platforms — all without compromising their privacy or&nbsp;control.</p><p>Imagine a world where users can log into dApps with a DID, conduct transactions using zero-knowledge proofs, and access services based on verifiable credentials — all from a single wallet. That’s the future we’re working&nbsp;toward.</p> The Path&nbsp;Forward <p>Vitalik’s vision for wallets is both an inspiration and a validation of the work many in the decentralized space are undertaking. At Ontology, we’re excited to contribute to this evolution by delivering the tools and infrastructure needed to make wallets more than just a utility — they should be the foundation of a user’s entire Web3 experience.</p><p>As we collectively tackle these challenges, the ultimate goal remains clear: to make Web3 usable, secure, and accessible to everyone, empowering individuals with the tools they need to truly own their digital&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Interested in trying out a wallet that provides a gateway into Web3, complete with the ability to control your identity? Head over to <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>&nbsp;today!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/web3-wallets-and-identity-fd87ec8f9b42">Web3 Wallets and Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/en-gb">Thales</a> today announced the launch of Data Risk Intelligence, a groundbreaking Imperva Data Security Fabric (DSF) solution that proactively addresses the risks to data wherever it resides. This is the first solution uniting the risk and threat identification capabilities of the Imperva Data Security Fabric with the data protection capabilities of the Thales CipherTrust Data Security Platform, following Thales’s strategic acquisition of Imperva in December 2023.</p>
<p>In today’s modern digital landscape, organisations face challenges in managing security across an ever-growing attack surface while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards. With data and operations spread across cloud, on-premises and hybrid systems, security teams require constant, comprehensive visibility into where their data is, the types of data they have, and the potential risks to that data. In fact, according to the <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/data-threat-report">2024 Thales Data Threat Report</a>, 93% of enterprises reported an increase in threats compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Empowering Security Teams and SOCs with Enhanced Visibility and Control</p>
<p>The combined intelligence and contextual insights from Data Risk Intelligence provide a unified visibility of risks to critical data with a unique view of the strength of encryption for data across an organisation’s entire data estate. With this enhanced visibility, Data Risk Intelligence empowers CIOs, CISOs, and data risk specialists to accurately identify the most critical data that are at risk by severity and likelihood, enabling them to effectively prioritise risk mitigation with clear recommendations for corrective action.</p>
<p>Data Risk Intelligence delivers a highly confident risk score and clear recommendations for corrective action that are based on a wide-ranging set of data risk indicators through advanced analytics, built upon user permissions, data source vulnerabilities, use of encryption following NIST standards, monitoring of suspicious activities, and other customisable inputs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Todd Moore, Vice President, Data Security products at Thales: “The ability to view data risk in key dimensions across organisational risk, asset risk, and regulatory risk in one place is extremely impactful. Data Risk Intelligence is the first of many integrations between the Thales and Imperva platforms that empower our customers to protect their data and all the paths to it. ​ Through our combined platforms, Thales has all ​ the tools to help our customers understand their data security risks and provide a clear set of actions to mitigate these risks.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“The risks to enterprise data are multi-dimensional and organisations are struggling to address the volume and breadth of these risks while still maintaining optimal business operations,” said Jennifer Glenn, Research Director, Data and Information Security at IDC Security and Trust Group. “Centralising data risk visibility and management offers valuable context about the data – and its vulnerabilities – enabling organisations to prioritise protection where it’s needed most.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Key Benefits of Data Risk Intelligence:</p>
 
 Enhanced Risk Prioritisation: Combines risk-related intelligence from Data Security Fabric and CipherTrust Data Security Platform to deliver precise risk scores that drive confident decisions. 
 Comprehensive Visibility: Provides a unified view of data risks across the entire data estate, reducing complexity, delivering risk indicators, and recommending protective measures. 
 Customisable Risk Indicators: Allows organisations to tailor risk indicators to their specific environment, highlighting the most critical threats. 
 Encryption Integration: Leverages the encryption capabilities of the CipherTrust Data Security Platform to ensure data protection at all levels. 
 Advanced Analytics: Utilises posture-based and machine-learning behavioural risk indicators to identify and prioritise the highest-risk data. 
 
<p>DSF Data Risk Intelligence is available to customers who have a current Data Security Fabric Data 360 license.<br>​</p>

<p>In the second release of 2024 we have improved OAuth 2.0 flow support to include URL encoded client credentials, made numerous improvements and corrections. Often the key element of any update is security. Within IDS 2024.2 release we’ve made available the very latest Tomcat patch as well as tested support for RedHat 8 and 9. We would like to point out that Redhat 7 / Centos 7 is no longer being supported by the open-source community, therefore support of this operating system has been removed from our System Recommendations pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our long-standing customers, we are working to release updates to a number of SSO service modules. &nbsp;These are external elements which ease configuration or use of SSO within Identity Platform. Our IDaaS service naturally receives these updates as they are available, however, if you have a premises-based installation, we would ask you to open a Service Desk ticket to request the updated code for these external to SSO modules. We would also like to point out that the modules&nbsp;have only been tested on SSO 9.5.0 found within this IDS 2024.2 release of Identity Platform, so would encourage you to update your Identity Platform prior to updating the modules. If you have any questions, Operations is happy to help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your Identity Platform in a timely manner. Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility, security, and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For full details over the IDS 2024.2 release, please review the&nbsp;<a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20242/pages/9276030977/Identity+Server+2024.2+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20242/pages/9276096513/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms">System Recommendations</a>&nbsp;pages found on our Developer Portal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’ve been meaning to write a response to the report that came out this summer from the National Security Agency on standards development. With many of my clients taking a break for turkey and pie, I’m finally catching up on some writing. Let’s talk standards!</p>



<p>Standards development isn’t just an abstract exercise for senior engineers or academic theorists. It’s the foundation upon which modern technology is built and evolves, influencing everything from cybersecurity frameworks to consumer electronics. Every time you use the Internet, you’re benefiting from the collective brainpower that built the capabilities to get you there. A recent report from the NSA and CISA, “<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3854885/nsa-publishes-enduring-security-framework-document-providing-recommendations-fo/">Recommendations for Increasing U.S. Participation &amp; Leadership in Standards Development</a>“, underscores the importance of standards development and provides a roadmap for bolstering U.S. involvement in shaping the future of critical technologies.</p>



<p>I’ll be honest: I’m not as anxious about U.S. leadership in the standards space, though I agree that the U.S. has, as a nation, lost some of its influence. That said, I think the content of this article applies to every single organization out there that relies on the Internet to conduct business. If you want to influence the digital world, you have to participate in defining how that world works.</p>



 Why Standards Matter to Organizations 



<p>Organizations (by which I mean companies, governments, educational institutions, etc etc etc) that participate in standards development often find themselves in a position of influence. They drive innovation while ensuring their needs and perspectives are addressed. Standards participation provides a direct channel to discuss regulatory challenges, improve interoperability, and gain early insights into technological trends. Despite these benefits, many organizations hesitate to get involved, perceiving the process as costly, time-consuming, or overly complex. OK, granted, they aren’t entirely wrong in that perception, but I think the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>



<p>From my experience working with standards bodies and related NGOs since 2010, it’s clear that active participation is the key to meaningful impact. The organizations that dedicate time and resources to this effort are the ones that shape the dialogue, influence regulations, and, ultimately, improve the functionality of the Internet and related technologies.</p>



 Early Engagement: A Competitive Advantage 



<p>One point from the NSA/CISA report that I keep coming back to is the emphasis on early engagement in standards development. Getting involved early in emerging technologies lets organizations take the lead, shaping standards to fit their goals. Whether it’s contributing to the development of cryptographic standards to counter the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/05/25/preparing-for-the-quantum-shift-in-cybersecurity/">looming quantum threat</a> or collaborating on protocols to enhance digital identity, early involvement ensures organizations are not just reacting to changes but actively shaping them.</p>



 The Consequences of Sitting on the Sidelines 



<p>The report highlights a harsh reality: failing to engage early risks allowing other players—potentially with competing interests—to dominate the conversation. This isn’t just a hypothetical concern; history is full of examples where delayed participation led to standards that didn’t account for the needs of key stakeholders, creating hurdles for businesses and end-users alike. (I’m going to point to RFC 8471, “The Token Binding Protocol” as one example some of my readers will be familiar with.&nbsp;That specification was pretty much abandoned because it <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/OkdLUyYmY1E/m/w2ESAeshBgAJ">didn’t meet the need</a>.)</p>



<p>A particularly compelling example lies in the realm of cybersecurity. Standards for multi-factor authentication and passwordless systems, for instance, have been driven by those actively participating in groups like the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>. Organizations that joined these efforts early have seen the benefits of enhanced security measures that align with their operational realities.</p>



 The Role of Academia and Workforce Development 



<p>The report also rightly emphasizes the importance of fostering a standards-savvy workforce. Academic institutions should play a critical role here, but they can’t do it alone. Organizations must invest in training their employees, encouraging mentorship, and prioritizing standards participation as part of professional development. This investment isn’t just about building internal expertise—it’s about ensuring the longevity and relevance of the organization in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>



 A Call to Action 



<p>If you’re wondering whether your organization should get involved, my answer is absolutely yes. The barriers to entry in standards development may seem high, but the rewards are higher. By participating, you gain influence, credibility, and a seat at the table where decisions that shape the future of technology are made. If you need advice on how to get there from here, reach out. The working group chairs of whatever space you’re interested are eager to help (ask me how I know!) </p>



<p>It’s not just about staying competitive; it’s about leading the way. Whether you’re in cybersecurity, telecom, or any field where innovation and interoperability matter, your voice can make a difference. Let’s make sure it’s heard!</p>



<p></p>



<p>And of course, I can help in other ways, though I’ll be the first to say you can do this on your own! I can, however, make your learning and engagement more efficient. Reach out if you want to learn more about navigating this process or <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/07/07/introducing-digital-identity-standards-development-service-for-executives/">need support</a> with standards development. With my experience across various SDOs, I’m here to help guide you through the complexities of Internet standards development.</p>

 This Month in Digital Identity — December&nbsp;Edition <p>Welcome to the December edition of our monthly digital identity series! This month, we explore how digital identity technology is safeguarding academic integrity, ensuring the credibility of research in an era of rising identity fraud. Dive into the GAO’s call for robust civil rights protections as federal agencies increasingly rely on AI and facial recognition. Discover the transformative potential of Digital Travel Credentials and decentralized identity in revolutionizing international travel. Lastly, we’ll examine the urgent need for unified frameworks to align emerging technologies with civil liberties.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at what you’ll find in this month’s insights:</p> Protecting Academic Integrity with Digital Identity Technology <p>The scholarly publishing industry is grappling with an alarming rise in identity fraud and unethical practices like paper mills and author impersonation, undermining trust in academic research. To counteract these challenges, STM Solutions has unveiled a comprehensive report titled “Trusted Identity in Academic Publishing: The Central Role of Digital Identity in Research Integrity.” Developed in collaboration with a Researcher Identity Task and Finish Group, this initiative aims to provide practical guidelines for the effective use of digital identity technology.</p><p>The report calls for stronger identity verification mechanisms while respecting inclusivity and privacy. It emphasizes how digital identity solutions can authenticate researchers while maintaining their autonomy, thus preserving the credibility of academic contributions. A crucial aspect of this framework is its scalability, which accommodates the diverse range of research disciplines and global contexts without being intrusive.</p><p>This strategic document also advocates an industry-wide approach, urging publishers, institutions, and researchers to unite for seamless integration of identity verification systems. By doing so, the academic community can address fraud more effectively, sustain open collaboration, and enhance trust in published findings.</p> GAO Highlights Need for Civil Rights Protections Amid Federal Data&nbsp;Use <p>As federal agencies increasingly rely on advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and facial recognition, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about their impact on civil rights. Despite the growing adoption of these tools, a recent GAO report reveals that existing federal guidelines fall short in protecting against biases, inequities, and potential abuses of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>While some agencies, such as Homeland Security, have begun creating frameworks to address ethical concerns, the overall response remains fragmented. For instance, the Privacy Act of 1974 governs data handling but does not encompass safeguards for emerging technologies. This leaves significant gaps in accountability, allowing for inadvertent discrimination and systemic inequities.</p><p>GAO recommends that Congress establish robust, government-wide civil rights guidelines tailored to emerging technologies. These should include privacy safeguards, risk assessments, and ethical oversight to prevent misuse. Furthermore, the report stresses the importance of bridging workforce skills gaps by investing in specialized training, enabling public agencies to navigate the complexities of these evolving&nbsp;tools.</p><p>This call to action underscores a need for comprehensive policy reform, ensuring that technological advancements align with societal values and protect citizens’ fundamental rights.</p> Revolutionizing International Travel: Digital Identity Innovation <p>Imagine arriving at your tropical destination just 30 minutes after stepping off the plane. This seamless travel experience is now a reality, thanks to a groundbreaking trial conducted by SITA, Indicio, and Delta Air Lines, in collaboration with Aruba’s government. Using Digital Travel Credentials (DTC) and IATA’s OneID, the initiative has redefined how travelers journey from Atlanta to&nbsp;Aruba.</p><p>The process begins with the DTC, a cryptographically secure digital version of a passport, allowing travelers to preauthorize their journey. At Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta, IATA’s OneID streamlines check-ins, baggage handling, and boarding processes. Upon landing in Aruba, passengers cross the border within seconds, holding the data required for verification securely on their mobile&nbsp;devices.</p><p>The initiative demonstrates the potential of decentralized digital identity technology, merging efficiency, security, and privacy. By combining the DTC and OneID workflows, travelers experienced reduced wait times and an overall enhanced travel experience. This innovation highlights a significant leap toward a unified, interoperable digital travel&nbsp;system.</p><p>The success of this trial is more than a technological milestone—it is a glimpse into the future of international travel. During the IATA World Passenger Symposium in Bangkok, SITA’s Michael Zureik will present the findings, signaling a major shift toward global adoption of decentralized identity solutions.</p> Emerging Technologies and the Call for Unified Civil Liberties Frameworks <p>The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified alarming gaps in the way federal agencies handle civil rights issues associated with emerging technologies. AI and facial recognition tools, while enabling efficiencies, have also amplified biases and raised concerns about discriminatory practices. Existing laws, such as the Privacy Act of 1974, focus on privacy but fail to address the civil liberties challenges posed by modern&nbsp;tools.</p><p>GAO’s analysis of 24 federal agencies revealed inconsistent approaches to mitigating these risks. While some, such as the Department of Homeland Security, have developed initial risk assessment tools, these efforts lack uniformity and coordination across agencies. Moreover, workforce shortages and outdated regulatory frameworks hinder the effective adoption of ethical practices.</p><p>To close these gaps, GAO urges Congress to create a government-wide framework addressing ethical data use, transparency, and accountability. The report also highlights the need for investments in workforce training and infrastructure, enabling agencies to better respond to technological advancements while protecting civil liberties.</p><p>This recommendation seeks to balance the promise of innovation with the need to uphold social justice, ensuring that government operations remain fair, inclusive, and trustworthy.</p><p>We look forward to bringing you more insightful updates as we continue to explore the latest trends and innovations in the field of digital identity. Together, we can contribute to a more secure and inclusive digital&nbsp;future.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/this-month-in-digital-identity-december-edition-d7c4fd503c87">This Month in Digital Identity — December Edition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Bank fraud continues to rise sharply worldwide, driven by an increasing proliferation of AI-driven impersonation, deepfake attacks, and the rapid emergence of <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/insights/understanding-fraud-as-a-service/#:~:text=Fraud%2Das%2Da%2DService%20(FaaS)%20represents%20an,fraud%20more%20easily%20and%20efficiently.">fraud-as-a-service (FaaS)</a> cybercrime. The risks of bank fraud are further compounded by the increasing worldwide adoption of digital banking and <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/embedded-finance.html">embedded finance</a>, creating new opportunities for malicious actors. While banks continue to invest heavily in developing their fraud detection, response, and prevention capabilities in line with rapid developments in the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/industry/financial-services/global-financial-services-regulations.html">regulatory landscape</a>, many are left with highly fragmented strategies that struggle to meet the evolving threat landscape. One of the key reasons behind this is the lack of holistic thinking about how “upstream” fraud prevention works in concert with “downstream” fraud prevention to drive real-time access decisioning at all stages of the customer journey. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog will explore how converged identity and access management (IAM) can help to integrate fraud detection, response, and prevention in the banking industry.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Hi, everybody. My name is Mike Engle, co-founder and head of strategy here at 1Kosmos. I’m joined today by Jens Hinrichsen. Say hello, Jens.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Hello, everybody.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Jens is our head of sales here at 1Kosmos, spends a lot of time in the trenches. And today we’re here to talk about remote caller verification. We have an acronym for that, RCV. But Jens, would you mind giving your quick pitch on what RCV is for the folks out there?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah, I would love to. And I think certainly also, Mike, with all the conversations that we’re both fortunate to have with a variety of organizations globally, please chime in with some of your own perspective as well. But I think remote caller verification, whether it is IT service desk for employees, contractors, other third parties that are interacting with an organization and have access to the inner sanctum, if you will, of an organization versus, say, contact center or call center. Where for years the industry has been working on solutions to mitigate fraud from a customer or outside facing standpoint, this is really about these emerging threat actor groups. Not even so much emerging, but Scattered Spider certainly has taken the cake recently in terms of being in the press most from MGM, Caesers, a host of other organizations where they have as a group socially engineered their way through the IT service desk of an organization.</p>
<p>So in the case of 1Kosmos, hi, I’m Mike Engle, I’m a co-founder. Service desk agent’s like, “Oh, my gosh, I got a co-founder on the call.” And if it’s not Mike and it’s a threat actor group, very charming, you name it, they can socially engineer their way in, get the credential reset, and then have Mike’s access to the company. So it is a big area of threat. It’s a big area of inefficiency also that organizations are trying to get better shored up. Mike, any other thoughts you have on that?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, so a lot of friends in the industry, I talk to them about this and they don’t have the right tools typically. So they’re using old, tired methods or no methods. They just turn it off because they can’t trust it. And an example would be secrets. What’s your employee ID? What was your date of hire? What was the amount of your last payroll deposits? Which I wouldn’t know that. So sometimes those are too hard and don’t work or they’re too easy to guess and anybody can use them. So social engineering has been around forever, but they’ve gotten really good at finding the information, the legacy ways that people have been using over time. What are some of the ways that they’re using now to get into help desks?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Well, it’s interesting, too. I think back to the point we made earlier from a fraud standpoint, I mean, there’s been social engineering going on for ages. Whatever that chain looks like, phishing, malware, getting information, and then pretending to be a customer of an organization, malicious actors are looking for economic gain and other impact for a variety of reasons. But where you can have big impact is when you’re able to infiltrate an organization. It’s one thing to steal $50,000 from a customer of an organization. It’s a big deal. You want to mitigate that, but as far as being able to get into the inner bowels of an organization’s IT stack moving laterally, whatever the case is, that is a huge area of focus these days.</p>
<p>So a lot of the, call it, the social engineering talent, the charms, I mean, Mike, you and I have even through different circles heard some of these calls and they’re … Wow, if I’m the service desk agent, yeah, I’m believing this person. You don’t have an ID for what reason or you don’t know this for whatever reason? Sure, of course. So I think it’s really been the same playbook focused on this avenue now. And again, it is really, really easy for these sophisticated threat actors to sound very believable, have core information that’s needed that would get a service desk agent to say, “Mr. Engle, co-founder of 1Kosmos, that’s fine that you don’t have this and this, but I’m going to issue a new credential to you right away. I want to make sure you’re happy.”</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right, and they may create a sense of urgency. I’m a doctor, I got a patient here at a table and I can’t unlock my stethoscope, whatever it is. So yeah, that’s a common tactic as well that we’ve seen them use. And then once they get that initial credential, they’re typically 50% of the way of getting into the core network and things go downhill from there. And so yeah, the traditional KBA, which you would think stands for knowledge based authentication.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Knowledge based authentication. Right.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
We actually refer to it as known by anybody, KBA. So it really is close to useless. And whenever I opened a new financial services account and they pop up those five questions, what was the type of car you had when you were five years old or whatever, I run for the hills if I can. So what can we do about it? How does 1Kosmos, for example, mitigate this threat?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. And even, Mike, before we go there, and I think one of the examples, what’s one of the KBA examples you’ve used before? It’s like your grandmother’s shoe size when she was nine or something. Well, whatever the iteration is, before we even get into solution, I think some of the really interesting parts that we’ve gotten more intimate with is even the other ways that organizations are trying to address this. So KBA, sure, that’s one. Known by anybody, as you said. OTP. Hey, I’m going to push you an OTP. Well, we still don’t know it’s Mike. And then we’re also seeing a lot of organizations, not even necessarily just at the highest level of privilege, but even more broadly where it’s an escalation to the manager. And you do the math on that in terms of just sheer productivity loss and in some cases you might not still be actually verifying it’s that genuine user.</p>
<p>So there’s these kind of clunky ways and tools that we as an industry have been trying to address this. And so to your question, Mike, it’s like, well, gosh, what is a way that an organization can do this where it’s effectively automated? So somebody is still calling into the service desk, but you’re removing the onus of verification from the service desk agent because the reality is service desk agents are being asked to do so many things already and they’re always do it in this amount of time, get it faster, faster. So you don’t want to forsake quality, but how do you have a very easy process for both agent and user, whether genuine or a malicious actor, to undertake that then gives the credence that, yes, this is actually Mr. Engle calling in? And so there are a few ways to do it. One that really gives, I’ll say, the minimum viable baseline would be a one-time identity verification or identity proofing event where I call into the service desk and I’m pretending to be you.</p>
<p>And the service desk agent says, “Okay, Mr. Engle, I’m going to send you a link either to your phone, to your email address.” There are a variety of things that you have to take into consideration obviously in terms of companies that might not have employees be able to have phones or are they company owned, et cetera. Those are all things that you see and we navigate accordingly, but the very simple process of opening up a link, scanning the front and back of a driver’s license, a passport, some other government issued document, and then doing a matching selfie against the image that’s on that document. And what we can do with very high assurance is give a thumbs up or thumbs down. And all we would do is simply say the agent, “Yep, this is Mr. Engle,” or in my case, pretending to be you, “No, this is not.” And so that’s a really simple initial way to do it. The really exciting part, and this is what permeates the next generation, which is actually here now and gaining steam, is the user control.</p>
<p>That reusable identity of, hey, once I have verified myself, once I essentially have an identity wallet that I can then present wherever it’s needed that proves that I am like Engle and I don’t have to go back through the whole process of scanning something, selfie, et cetera. So the elegance is there. You get high assurance, quick and easy, reduces call center times. And then again, you’re removing that, again, onus on the service desk agent of having to be the one. And there are other companies, too, Mike, where it’s, “Hey, can you hold your ID up to the camera?” It’s hard enough to tell that they’re real when you’re holding them, much less over a camera.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. And when I hold my license up to a camera, now what’s the other person doing with that information? First of all, they can’t verify it. It’s too hard. You can’t see the little security features and then now I’ve just showed you my driver’s license number. That’s something you don’t want floating out there on a video call. So yeah, the privacy preserving aspects are really key. If you can assure the help desk and your remote callers, your remote employees, or customers that it’s safe, then they’ll trust it and feel good about using it as well. That’s a great point. Yeah, so I think we’ve about done it. I guess one last thing is how hard is it to implement a tool like identity-based biometric verification for a service desk?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. What’s the usual answer? Well, we could have had it in yesterday, so you got a couple of flavors. And I think the great thing for us as an industry is you can literally start as fast as you can start with, call it, a touchless integration where you’re simply calling out to an API. That link that we talked about earlier that gets sent to the user, that’s essentially a service. It’s a hosted service and you’re not having to replumb or do anything on day one within your organization. You can address the threat, make it a simpler process literally within a couple of weeks. And then the subsequent steps that I know we’ve observed with our customers is there are things that you can do to tighten some of the workflows, whether it’s ServiceNow or whatever the service desk system or backend might be.</p>
<p>But then that next step, and it can come pretty quickly, is the organization’s adoption and use of that reusable identity. And it’s a pretty powerful thing when we think about especially at the point of, say, onboarding. Whether it’s say HR onboarding, contract, or third-party onboarding, you’re doing that verification once. The user now owns it. You made a great point about privacy preservation. I mean, that’s what we’re all in the space for, right? It’s one thing to have a point in time, but you have to make sure it’s privacy preserving. But then also, let’s make it efficient for everybody. Do the verification once and then all you’re doing is you’re essentially authenticating into systems or doing high-risk transactions or whatever the case is after that.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right, right. And you can’t implement something like this without uttering the words ROI, right?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
You have the obvious security benefits, stop bad guys, but the user experience is actually better. And then an organization can have 100,000 calls into a help desk a year. It’s an average of 30% to 50% are password reset or identity related, so why not remove that and save those calls from even coming in? You can automate this, you can do it in a self-service password reset manner as well, SSPR. So yeah, a lot of reasons to do it.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. Well, no, and you’re right. And it’s fun to build these business cases alongside organizations because it’s not just a security risk mitigation. There are very direct, like you said, Mike, very direct savings, overall operating efficiencies. Even to the point where as an organization lifts its security posture, they’re getting better policy. Their cyber insurance policies are coming down or at least not going up as quickly as they might go, depending on what most of us are feeling in the industry. So that’s a great point, that this is a really a multi-pronged business case. And I think we’ve observed 10, 20, 30X return on an investment in even just the first year.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. Yeah, it’s a no brainer. So hopefully we’ll get the phone calls before the bad guys get in and not after, but either way …</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Mike’s personal number is…</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
That’s right. Well, cool. Thanks so much for joining. It’s been fun chatting with you about this. Hopefully somebody out there will see it and will spark some ideas to make a difference in the world of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Brilliant. Great chat, Mike.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>Colorado Expands Digital ID Options with Samsung Wallet Integration</p>



<p>Colorado residents can now add their driver’s license or state ID to Samsung Wallet, allowing for digital use in certain situations, such as at select TSA checkpoints like Denver International Airport. Users can verify their identity by unlocking their phone and using a QR code or digital ID, ensuring only necessary information is shared securely. Colorado has previously made digital IDs available through Apple and Google Wallets, as well as the state’s myColorado app. While digital IDs are gaining acceptance, they are intended to supplement, not replace, physical IDs, which residents should continue to carry. The Colorado DMV highlights this initiative as part of the state’s commitment to innovation, convenience, and enhanced security for its citizens. <a href="https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/2024/11/22/colorado-adds-samsung-wallet-to-digital-id-drivers-license-options/76483946007/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kXzlNb8msbCku-S2pHaZ6AWHtyjo9zaxOvr7XPOWmIMw5nU4bmZWzU8WasrHBz-6I14A4">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>UK Releases DIATF 0.4: Paving the Way for Digital Identity Certification in 2025</p>



<p>The UK government has pre-released version 0.4 of its Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF), providing clarity on forthcoming standards ahead of certification opportunities expected in early 2025. This iteration, shaped by stakeholder feedback since the 2022 beta, introduces new certification roles for digital wallets and facial authentication services, stricter user support requirements, and guidance on data protection and promoting certified status. Key updates include inclusion monitoring, fairness in biometric systems, and a revamped structure for better navigation and auditability. Building on prior versions, DIATF 0.4 aligns with international standards, mandates certification for certain use cases, and emphasizes inclusivity through alternative identity verification methods. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/in-comes-diatf-0-4-uk-pre-releases-updated-digital-id-framework?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8SXFJuLxXOhkT_jnH2JSooqwsScJ5O7_BepGTLl3Ns4Fqx63gYd1dLmvU2M058Y02-6atI">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>North Korean Hackers Exploit AI and Remote Work to Fund Weapons Program with Stolen Crypto</p>



<p>Security researchers at Cyberwarcon revealed that North Korean hackers have stolen billions in cryptocurrency over the past decade by posing as venture capitalists, recruiters, and IT workers to fund the country’s weapons program. These campaigns involve creating false identities using AI and infiltrating multinational corporations, often with the help of U.S.-based facilitators to bypass sanctions. Key tactics include phishing, malware-laden downloads disguised as meeting tools or skills tests, and fraudulent employment schemes that exploit remote working trends. Despite sanctions and investigative efforts, experts warn that North Korean hacking operations remain a persistent and evolving threat to global cybersecurity. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-billions-in-crypto-by-posing-as-vcs-recruiters-and-it-workers/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--HooWu2ULJc5fzd6WYvpzhfz2ncc8Brxp0GzrbYS-gfeNGRga8R8n89W4L7mpB9nHijUDa">(Source)</a></p>

<p>DOJ Pushes for Google Chrome Sale in Landmark Antitrust Battle</p>



<p>Australia has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media platforms like Instagram, Snap Inc., and TikTok, effective in late 2025. The legislation, backed by 77% of Australians, aims to tackle youth mental health issues but raises concerns about privacy and digital surveillance. Critics argue it could lead to excessive data collection and limit access to support networks, while supporters, including parent groups, view it as a necessary move against cyberbullying. Tech companies are pushing back, claiming the law lacks clear implementation guidelines. This decision is a political win for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese but may complicate Australia’s relations with U.S. tech firms. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-passes-social-media-ban-children-under-16-2024-11-28/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--HooWu2ULJc5fzd6WYvpzhfz2ncc8Brxp0GzrbYS-gfeNGRga8R8n89W4L7mpB9nHijUDa">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Pornhub has controversially claimed it is a social media platform, not a pornography website, to argue it is not subject to age verification requirements under the UK’s Online Safety Act until July. The company has previously blocked access in U.S. states requiring age checks and may implement options like facial age estimation or ID uploads. Meanwhile, Spain-based TechPump has partnered with Gataca to launch an age verification system using a free self-sovereign digital identity (SSI) wallet that protects user anonymity while verifying age.

<p>Australia’s Fast-Tracked Age Verification Bill Sparks Privacy and Democracy Concerns</p>



<p>The Australian government is moving to fast-track legislation for age verification on social media and pornography sites, despite limited public consultation. Critics argue this rushed process undermines democratic decision-making and raises privacy concerns, especially as the law requires collecting personal or biometric data, which could lead to data misuse and push minors to less regulated platforms. Digital rights advocates are divided on its effectiveness, with some suggesting a broader digital duty of care instead of targeted restrictions.

Despite a nearly 300% increase to 3.5 million daily users after Musk’s controversial endorsement of Donald Trump, Bluesky has not complied with the Digital Services Act (DSA). The Commission has not yet contacted Bluesky directly and is seeking member states’ help to find an EU representative. Although it doesn’t meet the 45 million EU monthly user threshold for very large online platforms under the DSA, continued non-compliance could result in penalties of up to 6% of global annual revenues. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9083d7f8-d2e6-4e08-a324-8def68258efd?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-nLLgwsdo5K8GNDG2dUVSVmuM--1vaSORTtA363uShnTvmFORf-5Wkx0y28RCPkZLo-JF">(Source)</a></p>

      Redefining Sustainability: The End of Greenwashing 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In their insightful articles (<a href="https://www.sciencenorway.no/economy-greenhouse-gas-emissions-greenwashing/how-blockchain-technology-can-effectively-combat-greenwashing/2421574?utm_source=chatgpt.com">here</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bse.3338">here</a>), Professors Arne Nygaard and Ragnhild Silkoset highlight the pervasive issue of greenwashing, where companies falsely present products as environmentally friendly, thereby eroding consumer trust and undermining genuine sustainability efforts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>They eloquently argue that blockchain technology is the key to tackling greenwashing by ensuring that sustainability claims are traceable, transparent and verifiable. At UNISOT, we see blockchain not just as a technical solution but as a foundational element in redefining trust in global supply chains. Our <a href="https://unisot.com/digital-product-passport/">Digital Product Passports (DPP)</a>, powered by Enterprise Blockchain technology, provide an immutable and transparent record of a product’s entire lifecycle. This aligns with Nygaard and Silkoset’s emphasis on the need for reliable, traceable, and tamper-proof product information to mitigate greenwashing.</p>
   UNISOT’s Solutions in Action&nbsp; 
       
  Full Transparency Across the Supply Chain 
 
<p>Nygaard and Silkoset stress the importance of transparency, emphasizing that consumers and regulators demand trustworthy documentation of environmental claims. UNISOT’s blockchain-based platform ensures that data entered at every step of the supply chain -whether it’s sourcing raw materials, manufacturing or distribution – is immutably stored and easily accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:<br>
A clothing manufacturer can prove its fabrics are made from 100% recycled materials, with verifiable data on sourcing, energy use and CO₂ emissions. This aligns with the authors’ call for “proof, not promises.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Trust Through Decentralized Verification 
 
<p>The authors criticize the traditional reliance on centralized certification bodies, which can be susceptible to errors, biases or even corruption. Blockchain decentralizes this process, enabling all participants in the supply chain to input, audit and access data independently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UNISOT’s Impact:<br>
Smart Digital Twins provide a decentralized, interactive record of each product, ensuring that sustainability claims are verified by multiple stakeholders – not just the company making the claim.&nbsp;</p>
       
 Consumer Empowerment Through Digital Product Passports 
 
<p>Nygaard and Silkoset highlight how blockchain can empower consumers by giving them easy access to verified product data. UNISOT’s DPPs make this a reality. By scanning a QR code or NFC tag, consumers can instantly access a product’s history, including:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Carbon footprint&nbsp; 
 
 
 Ethical Sourcing Certifications&nbsp; 
 
 
 Compliance with environmental standards&nbsp; 
 
<p>Example:<br>
A customer buying sustainable seafood can verify that the fish was ethically farmed, transported with minimal emissions, and complies with regulatory standards like the EU Digital Product Passport mandate.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Combating Greenwashing with Immutable Data 
 
<p>A key point raised by Nygaard and Silkoset is the role of blockchain in preventing greenwashing by ensuring data integrity. Companies can no longer alter or selectively report data to present a false image of sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UNISOT’s Solution:<br>
Our Enterprise Blockchain backbone ensures that every claim – whether about emissions, sourcing or recycling – is recorded in a tamper-proof manner. Any discrepancy between what is claimed and what the data shows is immediately apparent.&nbsp;</p>
       
  Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting 
 
<p>Nygaard and Silkoset emphasize the importance of real-time tracking to provide accurate and up-to-date information. UNISOT’s integration with IoT devices ensures that real-time data on energy use, emissions and material flows is continuously recorded and accessible.&nbsp;</p>
         <blockquote>
<p>“Blockchain technology offers a more robust solution against the risk of greenwashing than traditional trademarks and certification systems.” – Professors Arne Nygaard and Ragnhild Silkoset</p>
</blockquote>
          Why This Matters&nbsp; 
<p>Nygaard and Silkoset argue that trust is the cornerstone of a sustainable economy and that companies who invest in transparency and verifiability stand to gain a competitive advantage. With upcoming regulatory changes, such as the EU’s Digital Product Passport and increasing consumer demands for transparency, companies that fail to act risk not only fines but also irreparable damage to their reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 UNISOT: Turning Vision Into Reality&nbsp; 
<p>By adopting UNISOT’s solutions, companies can move beyond vague sustainability claims and embrace a future where every claim is backed by immutable data, every product has a story, and every consumer has the power to make informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battle against greenwashing isn’t just about avoiding bad press; it’s about building a better, more sustainable world. As Professors Nygaard and Silkoset highlight, blockchain technology is the solution to unethical practices, and UNISOT is here to lead the way.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">John Tolbert</a></p> The Rapid Digitalization of OT, ICS, and IoT: Opportunities and Security Risks 
<p>In many enterprises, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) systems were kept isolated from IT environments, both logically and physically. ICS is generally considered a subset of OT. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, however, were designed to be networked, enabling real-time or latent data transmissions to applications to generate insights and to provide remote control capabilities. The connectivity of OT, ICS, and IoT systems to the cloud or corporate networks has increased across many industries, from manufacturing and pharmaceuticals to oil and gas and aerospace.</p>
<p>While this sea change in network connectivity and access policies offers benefits such as predictive maintenance, asset optimization, and enhanced productivity, it also dramatically expands the attack surface. Cyber attacks targeting OT, ICS, and IoT systems are no longer hypothetical. Attacks can have direct and severe consequences, from halting production lines to causing environmental damage or even endangering lives. Cybersecurity in OT and ICS needs to address unique constraints, including:</p>
 
 Reliability requirements: OT systems often operate on very strict schedules and have uptime requirements that cannot be violated without severe safety and financial consequences. Security updates or patches need to be carefully planned to avoid disrupting critical processes. Allowing real-time patch updates directly from vendors is most often prohibited. 
 Legacy systems: Many OT systems run on outdated hardware and software that lack the capacity or compatibility for modern security solutions. This means performing timely security updates may be practically impossible. Other measures may be needed to protect and contain such legacy systems. 
 Physical access: In industrial environments, devices and sensors may be spread across large areas or even in distant, isolated locations, which makies physical security, network segmentation, and secure remote access imperative. 
 
<p>To address these limitations, security strategies must be adapted to meet the unique requirements of OT/ICS/IoT, with specific attention paid to the differences from standard IT infrastructure.</p>
 Key Differences in Securing OT, ICS, and IoT Environments 
<p>Despite the overlap between IT and OT, the two are distinct in their technological requirements, operational demands, and security challenges.</p>
 
 IT Security: IT security solutions rely on a variety of well-established tool types like firewalls, EPDR, SIEM, SOAR, and IAM to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality. IT environments tend to prioritize agility, which allows more frequent software updates and rapid deployment of new security measures without significant downtime. IT tools use common protocols like HTTPS, SMTP, SMB, LDAP, etc., and for which many security solutions already exist. 
 IoT Security: IoT devices can be found in a wide range of environments, from smart homes to warehouses to industrial facilities. They are often resource-constrained, with limited processing power and memory, which can restrict the type and complexity of security protocols they can support. Many IoT devices were simply not designed with security in mind. IoT devices use protocols such as CoAP, MQTT, and XMPP, which are less common in traditional IT and thus, IT security tools are less likely to have out-of-the-box support for. Vendor-provided or third-party IoT security solutions generally focus on ensuring data integrity, communication confidentiality over IoT protocols, protecting against device spoofing, and managing device identities and access. 
 OT/ICS Security: OT/ICS systems are generally custom-engineered for specific applications, often running on special or proprietary protocols like ModBus, DNP3, OPC-UA, and S7. Security in OT/ICS environments focuses on maintaining uptime, integrity, and safe operations, with stringent requirements to avoid disruptions. Certain OT protocols lack built-in support for encryption or authentication, requiring additional protective measures. In most ICS and Critical Infrastructure Systems (CIS), safety of workers and the surroundings takes precedence over even computing security. 
 
<p>Security strategies for IT and OT therefore need to account for these differences. IT security focuses more on malware prevention via endpoint protection detection and response (EPDR), identity and access management (IAM), and network segmentation, while OT security demands robust intrusion detection, continuous monitoring, and a deep understanding of OT/ICS/IoT protocols to detect anomalous or malicious behavior.</p>
 Navigating the Divide Between OT Engineering and IT Software Engineering 
<p>Another difficulty in securing OT, ICS, and IoT environments is the difference in worldviews between OT engineers and IT software engineers. OT engineers prioritize reliability and safety, because failures in OT environments can have immediate and severe consequences. Conversely, software developers tend to prioritize rapid innovation and adding functionality, which can be a higher priority for their IT customers.</p>
<p>This culture clash can lead to friction in implementing security measures for IT and OT systems. Some challenges include:</p>
 
 Risk tolerance: OT engineers have a low tolerance for change and untested solutions, while IT software developers are accustomed to coding and testing new technologies frequently to keep up with IT customers’ demands. 
 Update and patch schedules: Software vendors may push regular software updates to deploy new features and security patches, whereas OT engineers have to schedule patches and updates comparatively infrequently, perhaps just one or two times per year, and see these as potential disruptions to uptime or performance. 
 
<p>Organizations can take two different approaches here. The first is to leverage IT security systems where they make sense: deploying EPDR agents where permitted by OT vendors, using OT/ICS/IoT-aware Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions to find and stop malicious actors, using SIEM and SOAR systems for collection and analysis of all telemetry and additional response actions. The other approach is to implement dedicated OT/ICS security solutions. These OT/ICS security solutions can cover additional functions such as asset discovery and classification, scanning of USB devices (used for updating firmware) for malware, as well as monitoring and anomaly detection, and are designed to work in these environments with HMIs, PLCs, SCADA, and IoT devices.</p>
 Keeping Pace with Digitalization: Adaptive Security Strategies 
<p>As OT digitalization accelerates, security measures need to be agile, capable of adapting to emerging threats, and proactive in addressing potential vulnerabilities. Key strategies include:</p>
 
 Zero Trust Architecture: Zero Trust models work on the principle of “never trust, always verify,” ensuring that every request for access is authenticated and authorized. This approach reduces lateral movement in networks, limiting the scope of damage if a device is compromised. Zero Trust Network Access is particularly important for securing remote access by vendors and contractors into OT/ICS networks. 
 Network Segmentation: Network segmentation divides the network into isolated segments or zones. In OT, this means separating different parts of the production floor or critical control systems from non-critical zones, thus limiting the exposure of sensitive systems to potential threats. OT centric security solutions are often designed to enforce separation in accordance with the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture. 
 Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection: IT and OT systems can benefit from anomaly detection tools that learn regular patterns of behavior and trigger alerts when unusual activity occurs. Since some OT components lack basic security features like authentication, monitoring for deviations in traffic and user behavior can help detect and contain potential threats before they escalate. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>Securing OT/ICS/IoT environments in the current era of rapid digitalization is a multifaceted challenge that requires a tailored approach for each organization.

 Introduction <p>The Formula 1 Prediction Challenge: 2024 Mexican Grand Prix brought together data scientists to tackle one of the most dynamic aspects of racing — pit stop strategies. Participants used historical data from past Mexican Grand Prix events and insights from the 2024 F1 season to create machine-learning models capable of predicting key race elements. With every second on the track critical, the challenge showcased how data can shape decisions that define race outcomes.</p><p>The challenge focused on predicting four essential components of pit stop strategies: the number of stints, tire compound choices, laps per stint, and average lap times. Using innovative approaches and advanced algorithms, participants modeled scenarios accounting for starting grid positions, driver performance, and unpredictable race conditions like weather changes or mid-race interruptions. The goal was to provide actionable insights for teams navigating the complexities of modern Formula 1 strategy.</p><p>The challenge demonstrated the intersection of sports and data science by combining real-world datasets with predictive modeling. It highlighted the importance of adaptability and precision as models needed to handle variations in track conditions, driver strategies, and car performance. This competition emphasized leveraging analytics in one of the world’s fastest and most data-intensive sports.</p>2024 Mexico GP Prediction Challenge — Top&nbsp;10 Podium  1st Place: Aleksandr Lazutin&nbsp;[Poland] <p>Aleks used three Random Forest Regression models to predict stints, tire life, average lap time, and a Random Forest Classifier to predict tire compounds. The model incorporated predictions for individual drivers and the entire grid, offering flexibility in application for race strategy. By organizing predictions into a modular structure, Aleksandr ensured each component could function independently while supporting the broader&nbsp;model.</p><p>He accounted for driver and team variability by including performance metrics, historical data, and team-specific strategies. The model incorporated external factors like weather and mid-race incidents, ensuring it adapted to dynamic race conditions. Outputs provided detailed stint breakdowns and timelines to support decision-making.</p><p>Aleks ensured the model could be implemented without complications by delivering structured outputs and comprehensive documentation. This design enabled the evaluation team to apply the model efficiently, ensuring its top ranking in the challenge.</p> 2nd Place: Yuichiro “Firepig” [Japan] <p>Firepig created a three-step model that used decision trees, linear regression, and random forests to predict tire strategies, laps per stint, and average lap times. The model started with tire compound predictions, followed by stint and lap estimates, and ended with lap time calculations. Firepig’s approach allowed it to adapt to changing race conditions, such as weather or race interruptions.</p><p>The model integrated data like grid position, tire compounds, and driver performance to align predictions with real-world racing strategies. Firepig included options for mid-race updates by allowing inputs like current laps, stint numbers, and weather conditions. This structure ensured the model could adjust to unpredictable scenarios during the&nbsp;race.</p><p>Firepig refined predictions using detailed feature engineering and cross-validation. The model secured second place in the competition by designing a tool that handled race variability and provided practical outputs.</p> 3rd Place: Yunus Gümüşsoy [Türkiye] <p>Yunus’ model combined XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost to predict stints, tire compounds, laps per stint, and average lap times. Yunus focused on building a robust data pipeline, merging historical and current-season data to create a comprehensive dataset. The model incorporated track-specific factors like altitude and straights to align predictions with the unique demands of the Mexican Grand&nbsp;Prix.</p><p>He integrated weather data, driver inputs, and car performance metrics to handle dynamic race scenarios. This adaptability allowed the model to remain effective under varying conditions. The implementation included clear input guidelines and outputs designed for practical use in race-day strategy planning.</p><p>Yunus secured third place by delivering a flexible, well-documented solution that bridged data science and Formula 1 strategy. His focus on track-specific insights and comprehensive data preparation set the model&nbsp;apart.</p> 2024 Championship <p>Our challenges offer prize pools from $10,000 to $20,000, distributed among the top 10 participants.

				  The inexorable growth in passenger numbers has driven the travel industry to an overwhelming conclusion: the only way forward is decentralized identity, digital wallets, and Verifiable Credentials. In the first trial of its kind, with Delta Airlines and the Government of Aruba, SITA and Indicio showed how well they work and how easy they are to implement.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>With yearly passenger numbers expected to grow from a little over four billion this year to eight billion by 2040 — or sooner — “the travel industry has decided that the future of identity is digital wallets and verifiable credentials,” said Michael Zureik, Head of Digital Travel Strategy and Innovation at SITA, at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm7Vm_6B70">recent Indicio Meetup.</a></p>
<p>To handle this demand and make travel less stressful and more streamlined, <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a> — a global supplier of IT to airlines and airports — has worked with Indicio to develop trusted, authenticated, digital travel documents that can be seamlessly authenticated.</p>
<p>First implemented in <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/transformative-innovation-arrives-at-arubas-queen-beatrix-international-airport/">Aruba</a>, these digital credentials take the data embedded in a passport, combine it with liveness check, authenticate both, and then return the data to the passenger in the form of a <a href="https://www.sita.aero/resources/videos/digital-travel-credential/">Digital Travel Credential</a> or DTC, a specification for deriving a digital passport from a physical passport’s embedded chip, established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a global body that regulates travel documents.</p>
<p>The Government of Aruba is the first sovereign government to accept a DTC, which means a passenger can present their DTC from home, get preauthorization for travel, and then cross the border simply by looking at a camera.</p>
<p>The focus of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/">Meetup</a> was on the next steps in this digital journey, which were successfully completed with a recent trial combining an ICAO-compatible DTC with <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/one-id/">One ID</a>, a digital credential standard created by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for seamless airport and travel services (but which doesn’t include border crossing).</p>
<p>Working with <a href="http://delta">Delta Airlines</a> and the <a href="https://www.arubahop.com/">Government of Aruba</a>, SITA and Indicio built a system to first create and issue the DTC and One ID then combined both credentials to add check-in, bag drop, lounge access, and boarding to booking, travel authorization, security, and immigration.</p>
<p>One of the key goals of the trial, said Zureik, was to show how different credentials can easily work together and complement each other to streamline the traveler experience on an international flight.</p>
<p>The trial showed just how easy it is to enroll in both at the same time with a passport and mobile phone, and then use them for instant, seamless authentication through each step of the passenger journey from home to destination.</p>
<p>What we learned, said Zureik, is that these technologies are ready. IATA’s One ID fits easily into the DTC ecosystem, and both were able to be implemented into airport, airline, and border gate processes quickly — six weeks — and without requiring any party to adopt new hardware or systems.</p>
<p>It was, said Zureik, “paramount” that Verifiable Credentials can be easily integrated and interoperate with existing airport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Mike Ebert, Indicio’s Director of Software Engineering, described how this was made possible by combining two types of Verifiable Credential formats — AnonCreds and SD-JWTs — and two types of communication protocols — DIDComm and OpenID4VC. This meant that the credentials were compatible with emerging European eIDAS identity standards but that they also provide strong privacy-preservation.</p>
<p>One key aspect of the Indicio-SITA implementation is that it is fully decentralized. Relying parties do not need to subscribe to or access a centralized database to verify traveler information. This unique architecture is not shared by other travel technology providers, but it is critical for the safe and secure management of people’s biometric data.</p>
<p>With a Verifiable Credential, biometric data doesn’t need to be centrally stored so that there’s something to check when a passenger looks into a camera. Instead, the passenger stores their biometric data securely on their phone and they can elect to share it in a way that can be verified without pinging stored data in a central repository.</p>
<p>As Ebert noted, this reduces the risk of a single point of failure (the database of biometric data goes offline), identity theft (if you don’t have to store people’s biometric data, it can’t be stolen), and it also eliminates the possibility of centralized tracking and provides the privacy protection that people and regulators now demand.</p>
<p>Acuity Market Intelligence described Indicio’s implementation of biometrics in Verifiable Credentials as “masterful” in its 2024 Prism Project Report.</p>
<p>To watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StRH7uOqxQA">demonstration of the DTC and One ID</a> and learn more about the benefits of managing biometric data with Verifiable Credentials, and the wider use cases for “government-grade” digital identities in tourism, watch this fascinating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm7Vm_6B70">episode</a> of the Indicio Meetup.</p>

Wed, 11/27/2024 - 14:31


            <p>Cannes, November 27, 2024 – Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), is pleased to unveil the Carb-Chaser project. This innovative program is based on a constellation of new-generation satellites specially designed to detect and measure human-induced carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, in particular from industrial sites.</p>
<p>Carb-Chaser’s compact architecture will combine efficiency and cost control to meet the needs of carbon monitoring markets.</p>
<p>The project is funded by the French government as part of the France 2030 stimulus plan and will allow the company to mature the payload, finalize constellation sizing and define the precursor satellite.</p>

<p>Optical technology at the cutting edge of innovation</p>
<p>Each Carb-Chaser satellite will carry a hyper-compact multispectral interferometer. These highly innovative instruments are made possible by miniaturizing key technologies used in major programs such as the Meteosat geostationary weather satellites and Copernicus, with its 12 European environmental monitoring missions. They will offer the capability to locate individual CO₂ plumes and attribute their source to a specific industrial facility, even in complex atmospheric conditions (wind, aerosols, water vapor, etc.).</p>
<p>Based on a Thales Alenia Space proprietary patented technology, this multispectral interferometry approach marks a breakthrough in terms of dependability and performance, further enhancing the ability of these satellites to offer reliable operational data with shorter revisit cycles to establish an overview of industrial sites on a global scale.</p>
<p>Certified data for strategic applications</p>
<p>The future Carb-Chaser constellation will provide independent, verifiable and certified CO₂ measurements spanning the entire value chain, including carbon services markets. Thanks to its high-precision geolocation capability, emissions will be accurately attributed to specific industrial facilities. These data will then be verified by in-situ surveys performed directly at the sites concerned.</p>
<p>Measurements will also be certified by the French Space Agency (CNES), the European Space Agency (ESA) and scientific experts specializing in atmospheric studies. This official validation will ensure these data can be included in regulatory frameworks, especially for carbon quota systems and carbon border adjustment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Complementary fit with major European space missions for environmental monitoring</p>
<p>Carb-Chaser will operate in synergy with existing European programs dedicated to measuring carbon emissions, such as MicroCarb and CO2M. While MicroCarb is a scientific mission to assess CO₂ fluxes on a global scale, and CO2M will measure human-induced CO₂ on a regional scale, Carb-Chaser will monitor local-scale emissions. Carb-Chaser data will also be used in conjunction with data from the CO2M program to compile atmospheric inventories and track progress toward climate goals.</p>
<p>These three missions, while distinct, will complement and feed into each other to provide a global, integrated picture of carbon emissions and support international efforts to reduce the impact of human activities on the climate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A French consortium at the heart of industrial innovation</p>
<p>Led by Thales Alenia Space, the Carb-Chaser project brings together a consortium of dynamic French SMEs such as U-Space, WaltR, Everimpact, SPASCIA and QAIrbon, as well as the IRT Saint Exupéry technological research institute. Together, the partners will combine their expertise to accelerate the ecological transition while strengthening Europe’s technological sovereignty. In addition to the scientific advances it will deliver, Carb-Chaser will have a direct economic impact on key regions of the French space industry, including Occitania, Brittany and the PACA region (Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur).</p>
<p>As part of the ambitious France 2030 strategy, Carb-Chaser reflects France and Europe’s determination to become world leaders in carbon emissions monitoring. This pioneering program marks a decisive step forward in efforts to combat climate change and opens the way to new markets for space technologies.</p>
<p>About France 2030 </p>
<p>Devised in consultation with local and European business and academic partners, France 2030 offers the country exceptional resources to meet the ecological, demographic, economic, industrial and social challenges of today’s changing world. This unprecedented plan for innovation and industry reflects a dual ambition. First, sustainably transform key sectors of our economy — such as energy, automotive, aerospace, digital and space — through innovation and industrial investment. And second, position France not just as a player, but as a leader in the economy of the future.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, members of the SpruceID team attended the 39th installment of the Internet Identity Workshop, or IIW. The biannual conference is on the cusp of its third decade, and one reason we love it is that it still embodies the collaborative, grassroots spirit of its 2005 founding era. This ethos still guides the open, standards-based world of identity, making IIW an ideal place to check in on important developments and ideas.</p><p>Held at the Computer History Museum near Google’s campus in Mountain View, California, each installment of IIW begins with an iconic opening circle to introduce all attendees and solicit session proposals on the fly. This “unconference” structure means you never know quite what you’ll see at IIW until it starts – and input was on hand from every corner, from Microsoft and Google to solo entrepreneurs and the government administrators bringing the next wave of identity to life.</p><p>Over 3 days and 177 discussion sessions, the breadth of topics at IIW was huge, but a few key themes came into focus for us: Collaboration and convergence across groups of stakeholders; the new concept of “personhood credentials”; and the cryptographic innovation known as Zero Knowledge Proofs.</p> Personhood Credentials <p>SpruceID may be a bit biased, since Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO was part of the team that rolled out the idea in a whitepaper earlier this year, but it was gratifying to see a lot of discussion of<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-joins-harvard-and-microsoft-researchers-for-new-personhood-credential-proposal/"> “personhood credentials”</a> at IIW. Broadly, a personhood credential is a kind of verifiable digital credential that shows its holder is a natural person, without revealing other personal information. The broad goal is to help combat disinformation and spam online by making it easy to identify content posted by a real human.</p><p>Various breakouts delved into technical details of implementing personhood credentials and potential applications, such as in “know your customer” procedures for financial services. But the discussion also turned to deeper quandaries, including a challenge to the premise of the personhood credential: Why is the burden of proof on humans? One panel on “approved AI agents” explored how digital credentials could be used to identify autonomous agents online, sparking a lively debate about trust and accountability in the digital age.</p> Zero Knowledge Proofs <p>Finally, there was both a wealth of discussion and a significant piece of news about Zero Knowledge Proofs, a recent innovation in privacy-enhancing cryptography. ZKPs remain largely theoretical, but would make it possible to do something wildly interesting with digital information: prove the truth of a claim, without revealing the underlying details. For example, a ZKP-based digital credential could be presented at a bar to prove you’re old enough to buy a drink, without revealing your specific date of birth.</p><p>There were sessions presenting things like digital wallets built to handle ZKPs in verifiable credentials, and software libraries that will make the technology easier to implement. But probably most exciting was the announcement that Google is hard at work on building ZKPs that work on the mDoc credential standard, using existing hardware. The search giant announced that it plans to make their techniques open-source in early 2025, which could spark a flurry of further technical advances and even real-world implementations.</p> Collaboration in Overdrive <p>The most interesting part of IIW 39 may not have been a technical topic at all, but the powerful mixing and collaboration on display everywhere you looked. That’s particularly notable because attendees represented a cross-section of the identity world in every sense. Founders of the first IIW 20 years ago rubbed elbows with young engineers bringing those pioneers’ ideas to life.&nbsp; Government staffers leading the charge on mobile drivers’ licenses shared their issues with vendors building the tools they need.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, representatives of key standards came together to share insights and reconcile approaches. Teams developing mDocs/mDL, OpenID, European identity groups, the Open Wallets Foundation, and the Decentralized Identity Foundation kibitzed and compared notes with an eye towards getting these systems to work together better. With everyone in the same room, there were significant breakthroughs in finding shared solutions to sticky problems.</p><p>With digital identity gaining real-world traction in recent years, it's exciting to see the spectrum for digital credentials shifting from being discussions of theory, to competing standards, to now who wins/how we all win by moving into the marketplace of implementation.</p> From Theory to Practice <p>This new work on ZKPs embodies perhaps the single overarching theme of IIW 39: a lot of things that the identity world has spent years talking about and refining are now actually becoming reality. For example, we saw intense interest in our work on California’s mobile driver’s license (though again, we’re biased) and discussion of strong privacy requirements that would be considered for Utah’s state digital ID. Utah appears to be truly committed to protecting the privacy of users, a gratifying payoff to decades of commitment to safety-centric design in digital ID.</p><p>The passage from ideas to reality even capped off this year’s IIW: many attendees went from Mountain View straight to Sacramento, where the California DMV was hosting<a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/mdl-for-technology-developers/hackathons-2024/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> an mDL hackathon</a>. After days focused on aligning the principles and architecture of digital identity, developers were able to get their hands dirty building real-world tools and exploring ways digital identity can fulfill its promise of better security, privacy, and trust in the digital age.</p> Turning Conversations into Solutions <p>Wrapping up these recent discussions, we're energized by the progress and collaboration happening in the world of digital identity. The transition from theory to implementation is becoming more tangible, with advancements like personhood credentials and Zero-Knowledge Proofs paving the way for privacy-first solutions. As we continue to tackle challenges and refine standards, we’re excited to contribute to a future where secure, user-controlled digital interactions are the norm.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>“We’re not even halfway there,” appeared to be the general feeling during the webinar. However, according to participants, there are signs that the relationship between banks and regulators is trending in the right direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/aml-compliance-2024-amld6/">Anti-Money Laundering Authority in Frankfurt (AMLA)</a> is likely to make a significant impact, offering a more unilateral and consistent regulatory perspective. Having an open environment where banks can discuss what is failing; what is working well; and how learnings can be exchanged will only improve the relationship between banks and regulators regarding anti-money laundering and other fraud risks.</p>



 2. Change is inevitable. Is your culture ready to adapt accordingly? 



<p>As one of the biggest challenges of entering new markets is complying with different regulations and requirements, banks need to have a culture that is willing to innovate quickly and adapt accordingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Onboarding customers the old way – via traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) processes like photocopying and stamping documents – is no longer acceptable; banks need to embrace new identity verification methods and onboarding procedures to fight fraud and cut costs in the modern age.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>For some reason, in financial services, compliance and fraud are always treated separately, with separate teams etc, but they’re actually inextricably linked, especially during the onboarding stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>Head of Product Marketing and Customer Communications, Ellie Burns</blockquote>



<p>“So, how can banks ensure compliance teams and fraud teams are collaborating to make processes and onboarding flows as secure, trusted and seamless as possible for the customer?” asked Ellie.</p>



 3. The importance of balancing fraud and compliance. 



<p>Balancing effective fraud prevention with an onboarding process that works for all, regardless of risk level, is no easy task. The reality is that some customers are just not tech savvy or literate enough to use certain solutions, so banks need to be prepared to still ‘handhold’ the more vulnerable customers and offer more traditional onboarding options too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s also important to remember that when doing so, banks need to be prepared for the repercussions of these ‘old-fashioned’ approaches, such as increased fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Communication is key, especially between different departments with different goals. However, despite appearances, there are many common goals that should demand alignment between compliance teams and fraud teams. As such, these departments need to work together to find solutions that are both compliant and prevent fraud. It should never be an either/ or.</p>



 4. Technology has a major part to play. But so too do humans! 



<p>There is no such thing as the ‘perfect onboarding solution’, not only due to different regulatory requirements but also customer preferences. Even across the European region there are different approaches to customer onboarding. For example, in the UK there are data checks and document checks, while in Germany, there is video verification and of course eID.&nbsp; It’s also worth bearing in mind that as people tend to be multi-bankers, they’re often faced with multiple ‘perfect solutions’ following different standards and steps. Plus, of course, what is perfect for one person may not be for another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While a lot of solutions focus on things like multi-factor authentication to make onboarding smoother, faster and more automated, there are other solutions that use live facial detection, which requires in-person assistance and face-to-face interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Webinar participants agreed that there is still a danger in relying too heavily on fully automated processes as artificial intelligence is still not to be 100% trusted yet, especially with social engineering like APP scams. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/video-identity-verification-fraud-prevention/">value that video verification can provide</a> should not be underestimated.</p>



 5. Is fraud prevention just a game of Whac-A-Mole? 



<p>Of course, the aim of banks is to stop fraud dead in its tracks – but the reality is that fraud is a constant, never-ending game of cat and mouse, with fraudsters evolving and developing ever-sophisticated attacks to penetrate defenses and vulnerabilities. So, if the banks can’t stop 100% of fraud, then the aim of the game is to make it as difficult as possible&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, how exactly can banks make it difficult for fraudsters? As bad actors often work around the clock using increasingly sophisticated fraud attacks, it can be difficult for banks to fight back. As such, there needs to be a more connected approach where banks are incentivized and feel willing to share information and learnings with one another. A multi-layered approach to fraud prevention is necessary as fraudsters work in a similar way!</p>

<p>Full disclosure: this post is all about encouraging you to become a member of <a href="https://idpro.org">IDPro</a>®. They didn’t ask me to write it, but they’re a client, and I’ve been a fan long before we started working together.</p>



<p>If your company has a digital presence, at some level, you’re a technology company. That might not seem obvious if you’re running a retail chain or a healthcare clinic, but it’s true. The systems that underpin your operations—whether they’re managing customer logins, ensuring secure employee access, or verifying partner identities—are deeply rooted in the principles of digital identity.</p>



<p>And yet, for many organizations, the people working on these systems may not even realize they’re part of a larger field called “identity management.” They’re solving complex problems in access control, authentication, and identity proofing—often in isolation, without the benefit of shared best practices or peer guidance. That inefficiency? It makes me sad—especially because there’s a better way.</p>



<p>That’s where professional organizations like IDPro come in. I’ve been an IDPro member since long before I started contracting with them, and their value to practitioners and companies alike is impressive.</p>



 Why IDPro? 



<p>What is IDPro? It’s a professional association dedicated to fostering ethics and excellence in digital identity management. It provides tools, resources, and a vibrant community for anyone working in this space, whether they’re seasoned veterans or just discovering that identity is part of their job.</p>



<p>IDPro offers a lot:</p>



 1. A Vendor-Neutral Body of Knowledge 



<p>IDPro’s freely available <a href="https://idpro.org/body-of-knowledge/">Body of Knowledge</a> (BoK) is a Big Deal. It’s a Creative Commons-licensed, vendor-neutral resource designed to help identity practitioners level up their expertise. Whether you’re trying to understand the basics of multi-factor authentication or grappling with complex federation protocols, the BoK offers practical, accessible guidance. I helped design the publication process, ensuring the BoK includes only the best, peer-reviewed material in the field. </p>



 2. CIDPRO® Certification 



<p>For companies that want to invest in their staff’s professional development, the <a href="https://idpro.org/cidpro/">CIDPRO</a> certification is an excellent foundation-level credential. It’s built by practitioners, for practitioners, and is designed to validate a broad understanding of identity management concepts. Certified employees bring enhanced credibility and capability to their organizations. There are great resources on the website that walks you through what the exam is like and the material it covers. You can even sign up to take a test exam!</p>



 3. A Thriving Community 



<p>IDPro’s member-only virtual discussions are some of the most valuable professional conversations I’ve had. The organization fosters a community where identity practitioners can exchange ideas, troubleshoot challenges, and share best practices in a thoughtful and respectful environment. This sense of connection is invaluable, especially in a field as fast-changing and complex as identity management. From authentication and IGA to identipets (because what’s a community without pet photos?), the channels are where some of the best identity conversations—and laughs—happen.</p>



 4. Advocacy and Networking 



<p>IDPro isn’t just about individual growth—it’s about lifting the entire field of identity management. From advocating for the industry with policymakers to hosting facilitated gatherings at major conferences like Identiverse, IDPro helps promote the conversation around identity while providing meaningful networking opportunities. Whether it’s a hallway chat at a conference or a casual meetup at the pub, the networking opportunities here are second to none.</p>



 Why Companies Should Care 



<p>When companies invest in organizations like IDPro, they’re not just supporting their employees—they’re ensuring their own success. Digital identity is foundational to security, compliance, and customer trust. By giving your teams access to IDPro’s resources, certification programs, and community, you’re equipping them to solve identity challenges more effectively. Go, team!</p>



<p>And let’s not forget: investing in professional development helps attract and retain top talent. Identity professionals who feel supported and connected are more likely to stay with your organization and bring their best to the table. </p>



 A Call to Action 



<p>If you’re reading this and wondering if IDPro membership is right for your organization, of COURSE it is. I would go so far as to say that if you’re not ready to dive into the deep end of <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/09/20/more-on-standards-development/">standards development</a>, this is a great way to start engaging with the smartest people in the identity world. Every company with a digital presence has a stake in the future of identity management; IDPro is the best partner I can imagine to help you navigate that future. Membership offers value at every level, from individual practitioners to corporate teams.</p>



<p>Seriously, get your company an IDPro membership—you won’t regret it. And when you do, tell the team at <a>membership@idpro.org</a> that I sent you!</p>

<p>A <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">digital wallet</a> co-developed by Anonyome Labs and Indico which will transform trusted data sharing in the agriculture industry has won a prestigious <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2024">Constellation Research SuperNova Award</a>.</p>



<p>The Trust Alliance New Zealand (TANZ) Digital Farm Wallet took out the award in the “Digital Safety, Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity” category of the long-running awards program which recognizes disruptive and transformative solutions for end users.</p>



<p>TANZ’s Digital Farm Wallet uses <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/reusable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> to create a secure data-sharing ecosystem in which farmers, growers, and other parties in the value chain (such as food producers, processors, retailers and exporters) can easily capture and share data across the sector while keeping it secure, protected and controllable.</p>



<p>The wallet allows farmers to securely hold critical data for their farms, such as their farm ID, greenhouse gas emissions, and farm boundaries, and share it directly and securely with reliant parties. Using the wallet eliminates the need for large third party databases and repetitive and time-consuming manual information sharing and prevents farmers’ data from being shared without their consent and to the detriment of their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the TANZ Digital Farm Wallet is set to transform New Zealand’s agriculture industry. The project trial proved that directly sharing authenticated information between farmers and distributors in a secure, privacy-preserving way has significant cost benefits. Farmers in the trial spent less time filling out forms and managing data and more time farming. Going forward, the data-sharing ecosystem will also achieve a more streamlined, transparent supply chain, in which farmers can prove their promises about their produce (such as organic status) and consumers can verify the claims for themselves at the time of purchase.</p>

<p>TANZ <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/node/33436/vote/application/view/1050">says</a> the Digital Farm Wallet has already won buy-in from important players in the industry, including banks, regional councils, and meat packagers.</p>



<p>The TANZ Digital Farm Wallet project was prompted by the recognition that trusted data sharing is vital to maintaining and growing New Zealand’s primary sector. It is an excellent case study for the agriculture sectors of other countries and for other industries that rely on trusted data sharing.

<p>Here are the main industry highlights of this week.</p>



 



 🪄Innovation and New Technology Developments 



 



<p>Maryland Launches Mobile ID App for Secure Age Verification and Digital ID Adoption</p>



<p>Maryland has launched the Mobile ID Check by MD app, allowing businesses to verify mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and digital IDs for age verification without extra hardware. Compliant with ISO/IEC standards, the app promotes secure data sharing and supports Maryland’s mDL initiatives that started in 2018. Businesses, including those at BWI Airport, are using the app for alcohol age checks. Collaborations with organizations like the TSA and DHS position Maryland as a leader in mDL standards and infrastructure, including the Digital Trust Service for efficient authentication. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-app-for-marylanders-enables-businesses-to-check-mdls-digital-id?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--GsxhfLWhRNgcbPZVwmIqJAHh5U-x29JXDWWHpQb7wk6PDr9LJ7brOugw_9PX-81bMKNrv">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>China Launches Biometric Fast Lanes for Seamless Travel in Greater Bay Area</p>



<p>China is testing document-free fast lanes at Shenzhen Bay Port and Gongbei Port for travelers between Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macao, using facial and fingerprint biometrics for verification. Eligible users include Mainland Chinese residents aged 14 and older with valid multi-entry visas and residents of Hong Kong and Macao with Mainland travel permits. While the system aims to streamline border crossings, travelers must still carry physical documents. This initiative supports the Greater Bay Area strategy to enhance regional connectivity and follows similar biometric advancements in Myanmar, Malaysia, and Indonesia. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/china-pilots-biometric-border-lane-in-shenzhen-and-zhuhai?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_qupBS6nj1Hc9rY6cOF_joX5O9bs0Usal_bfDW4XOq35rdpjkexPyBfe3CeS83mrvzh6JC">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>New Zealand Launches Digital Identity Framework for Secure, User-Controlled Data Sharing</p>



<p>The New Zealand government has finalized its Digital Identity Services Trust Framework, promoting secure and privacy-focused digital identity services.

<p>Attackers continually refine their methods to compromise user identities and gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems. One particularly insidious threat is <a href="https://help.evilginx.com/">Evilginx</a>, a phishing framework designed to bypass traditional multi-factor authentication (MFA) by operating as an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) — sometimes known as man-in-the-middle (MitM) — proxy. Evilginx intercepts and manipulates communication between users and legitimate sites, enabling attackers to steal credentials, session cookies, and other sensitive data. It’s a favorite tool of threat groups such as the Russian-based Star Blizzard, as <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-341a">warned in a joint advisory</a> from CISA, the UK National Cyber Security Centre, the Australian Cyber Security Centre, and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, among other governmental security bodies.</p>  
<p>Threat researchers and incident response teams have reported a noticeable surge in phishing campaigns utilizing Evilginx, exploiting MFA’s reliance on session validation. Even with MFA in place, Evilginx captures session cookies after authentication is complete, granting attackers unauthorized access to accounts. In many cases, it can also bypass Windows Hello for Business. This makes it a particularly effective tool for targeting Microsoft Entra ID environments. This article peels back the layers on Evilginx, looking at how it&nbsp; operates, why it’s effective, and the best defenses to help keep your organization secure.</p> 
 The Evolution of Evilginx  
<p>Originally developed as a pentesting tool to demonstrate the vulnerabilities of traditional MFA, Evilginx has evolved to become a cornerstone of sophisticated phishing campaigns. Using a modified version of the open-source nginx web server software, early versions focused on basic credential harvesting. Newer iterations, however, incorporate advanced features like session cookie interception and real-time proxying to bypass MFA entirely. Now named Evilginx 3 and written in Go, the framework is stable, adaptable and set up to target platforms like Microsoft Entra ID. It comes with built-in “phishlets” to easily configure identical login experiences for Microsoft 365, Citrix, Okta, and other sites.</p> 
 Understanding Reverse Proxies  
<p>Reverse proxies are a legitimate, widely-used technique where a proxy server handles requests and responses on behalf of the origin server. It sits between an endpoint, such as a user’s desktop, and public facing traffic and websites. Requests from the endpoint are intercepted by the reverse proxy server, which then sends the requests on to the origin server. This helps organizations manage incoming traffic, distribute loads across servers, and strengthen security by shielding the internal server structure. It also allows organizations to cache content that may be commonly used by their users, saving loading time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Reverse Proxy Flow  
<p></p> 
 How Evilginx Works  
<p>Evilginx leverages the concept of a reverse proxy, but configured specifically to capture a user’s credentials and session cookies once they are tricked into accessing the Evilginx URL instead of the legitimate target server.</p> 
<p>The process goes something like this.</p> 
<p>1. Phishing lure: The attacker lures the victim into clicking on a phishing link sent by email or SMS, which takes them to the Evilginx-created phishing site:</p> 
<p></p> 
2. Fraudulent site: The phishing site consists of a fake login page that looks and behaves exactly like the legitimate site, complete with a valid TLS certificate and lock icon. When the user tries to log in, Evilginx forwards the request to the real service:
<br> 
<p></p> 
<p>3. Credential harvesting: The user enters their username and password on the fake page, which Evilginx captures and sends to the genuine site. Evilginx also collects and passes back second factor authentication factors, such as OTPs and out-of-band authentication (eg. push notification to the MS Authenticator app).</p> 
<p>4. Session hijacking: If successfully authenticated, the legitimate service will return session credentials (tokens, session cookie), which Evilginx intercepts. The attacker uses the captured credentials and session cookies to directly access the user’s account.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>5. Account takeover: Once the attacker has control of the session, they can change the user’s password and other information, locking the victim out.</p> 
 Handling Federation Redirects  
<p>But what if Entra ID is configured to redirect to a different IdP (like ADFS) to perform federated authentication?</p> 
<p>The flow is very similar to the simpler flow above, except Entra is going to return a 302 redirect to the downstream IdP. As long as Evilginx is configured to be aware of the redirect host, it will spin up a new “host” under its subdomain, and proxy the redirect to the browser to go there instead:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So even if the user enters their credentials in the downstream IdP, the result is the same. The downstream IdP issues a federation token (eg. SAML or OIDC) which Evilginx uses to get the final session tokens from Entra ID:</p> 
<p></p> 
 How Attackers Use Evilginx  
<p>Attackers leveraging Evilginx often start by targeting the weakest link: unprotected personal devices. A common scenario involves a phishing email sent to an employee’s personal email address, which is less likely to be secured by corporate defenses. For example, if you work for Acme.com, you might receive a spear-phishing email that appears relevant to your role or recent activities. Once you click the link, expecting to authenticate, the attacker’s Evilginx server intercepts the login process as described above, capturing credentials and session cookies, and eventually locking you out of your account entirely.</p> 
<p>Generative AI has made these attacks easier and far more effective. By mining public data about employees — such as their social media profiles, published work, and LinkedIn connections — attackers can craft highly convincing, customized phishing campaigns (aka “spear phishing”) within minutes. Moreover, Evilginx makes it easy to set up the phishing site, providing exact replicas of login pages for Microsoft Entra ID, Okta and other popular services.</p> 
 Inside an Evilginx Attack on Entra ID  
<p>In this attack demo, you can see how easy it is to hack into and take over an Entra ID account using Evilginx, even with “stronger” MFA with number matching turned on.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Defending Against Evilginx  
<p>Protecting against Evilginx attacks starts with basic, foundational defenses like two-factor authentication (2FA). While not immune to compromise — attackers can still steal session cookies — 2FA adds a layer of difficulty that may deter some threats. Another critical measure is network traffic inspection, particularly for enterprises. Monitoring where traffic is directed can help identify phishing URLs and flag malicious activity, though detection often occurs after users have already clicked on links.</p> 
<p>Employee phishing awareness training can also reduce the risk of falling for phishing attempts, although it’s unrealistic to expect perfect vigilance. Mistakes are inevitable, especially as attackers craft increasingly targeted, convincing lures.</p> 
<p>The most effective strategy lies in adopting FIDO passkeys for authentication. Passkeys use domain binding, which ensures that authentication attempts will only succeed if the domain matches the one the passkey was registered with. This effectively renders reverse proxy tools like Evilginx useless, as they cannot impersonate the bound domain.</p> 
<p></p> 
 What About Windows Hello for Business?  
<p>Although Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) is a FIDO2 compliant authenticator, the way it is usually configured makes it vulnerable to Evilginx attacks. Most organizations set up WHfB to be the primary authentication method, with a more insecure fallback option, such as password plus an SMS OTP or Microsoft Authenticator. To make this worse, there are <a href="https://github.com/yudasm/WHfB-o365-Phishlet">Evilginx phishlets</a> available that specifically bypass WHfB&nbsp; authentication (in case it was used last time by the user) by forcibly downgrading the flow to use the more vulnerable fallback methods.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The key is to enable policies in Conditional Access that don’t allow a less-secure (non-phishing-resistant) fallback option. If you do, the attackers will exploit it, making it pointless for deploying WHfB in the first place.</p> 
 How HYPR Thwarts Evilginx Attacks  
<p>HYPR is designed to outsmart the most sophisticated AitM tactics, including Evilginx attacks. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">HYPR Enterprise Passkeys</a> leverage FIDO passkey standards, binding the domain to the key so that only login attempts on the correct domain can succeed. This effectively shuts down reverse proxy tools that rely on intercepting session cookies or credentials. HYPR only uses phishing-resistant, FIDO Certified <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> methods — it never falls back to a shared secret that can be phished or intercepted. It can be used as the primary authentication method or a phishing-resistant fallback for Windows Hello for Business.</p>

  <p>In the modern digital landscape, organizations are confronted with growing cybersecurity challenges that demand stronger authentication methods. Zero Trust frameworks have become essential for bolstering security postures, placing a significant emphasis on identity verification. As traditional passwords become more vulnerable, passkeys are gaining traction for their phishing-resistant capabilities and their potential to transform authentication within Zero Trust environments.</p>
<p>Implementing passkeys, however, is not without its hurdles. Organizations must navigate evolving software ecosystems, inconsistent user experiences, and complex recovery processes. Balancing security requirements with user convenience remains a key challenge. This webinar will explore the various types of passkeys, their benefits, and the trade-offs between security and usability in achieving passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>Alejandro Leal, Research Analyst at KuppingerCole, will discuss the shift towards identity-centric security measures and the role of passkeys in building resilient digital environments. He will provide insights into how passkeys contribute to minimizing attack surfaces and enhancing overall security postures within Zero Trust frameworks.</p>
<p>Andre Priebe, Chief Technology Officer at iC Consult, will offer a high-level explanation of Zero Trust benefits from passkey adoption. He will explain passkey technologies, current implementation challenges, and best practices for adopting and scaling passkeys within organizations, focusing on improving security without compromising user experience.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-world"></a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>As technology continues to evolve at a breakneck pace, so do the risks lurking in the shadows of digital transformation. The cybersecurity landscape is no longer just about firewalls and antivirus software—it’s a high-stakes chess game with increasingly cunning adversaries. To stay ahead, we must not only understand these next-generation threats but also embrace smarter, more adaptive strategies.</p>
 The New Face of Cyber Threats 
<p>AI-Driven Cyberattacks: Smarter, Faster, and More Dangerous</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a tool for innovation—it’s becoming a weapon in the hands of cybercriminals. AI automates attacks, identifies vulnerabilities at lightning speed, and creates malware that learns to outsmart detection systems. Defenders can’t afford to play catch-up. Staying proactive with AI-powered countermeasures is the only way to level the playing field.</p>
<p>Deepfakes: Trust Eroded in the Digital Age</p>
<p>What if you could no longer trust what you see or hear online? Deepfake technology has weaponized deception, enabling attackers to impersonate executives, manipulate public opinion, and execute devastating social engineering attacks. The fallout includes financial fraud, reputation damage, and a society questioning the authenticity of all digital content.</p>
<p>IoT: Billions of Devices, Billions of Risks</p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized our lives, connecting everything from home appliances to critical infrastructure. But this connectivity comes at a price. Many IoT devices are built with weak—or nonexistent—security measures, making them easy targets. Worse, these devices can serve as backdoors to larger networks, amplifying the threat.</p>
<p>Ransomware: Evolving and Escalating</p>
<p>Ransomware has shifted gears, becoming more calculated and destructive. Attackers now employ double extortion tactics—encrypting data while also threatening to leak it unless hefty ransoms are paid. This evolution demands more robust defenses, including smarter recovery plans and airtight data backups.</p>
 Strategies to Outpace the Threats 
<p>Leveraging AI to Fight AI</p>
<p>If attackers are arming themselves with AI, so must defenders. AI-powered security tools can sift through massive data sets, detect anomalies, and react to threats faster than any human team ever could. Machine learning ensures systems grow smarter with every attack, turning past threats into future advantages.</p>
<p>Zero Trust: A Security Framework Built for Complexity</p>
<p>Zero Trust flips the traditional security model on its head: trust no one and verify everyone. By constantly authenticating users and devices, this model minimizes risks like unauthorized access and lateral movement. Yet, it’s no magic wand—Zero Trust is complex to implement at scale, which explains its slow adoption rate.</p>
<p>Behavioral Analytics: The Power of Predictive Insight</p>
<p>In cybersecurity, behavior often reveals intent. Analyzing user actions—like irregular login patterns or unusual data transfers—can flag potential threats before they escalate. Behavioral analytics provides the critical early warnings organizations need to respond swiftly and decisively.</p>
<p>Setting the Bar Higher for IoT Security</p>
<p>The IoT ecosystem needs more than innovation; it needs standards. Industry collaboration is essential to enforce stricter measures like device authentication, end-to-end encryption, and regular firmware updates. Securing billions of connected devices isn’t just desirable—it’s non-negotiable.</p>
<p>Ransomware Resilience: A Comprehensive Playbook</p>
<p>To stay resilient against ransomware, preparation is key. Think regular backups, segmented networks, and well-trained employees. Add a strong incident response plan, and you’ve got the foundation for bouncing back without caving to criminal demands.</p>
<p>Building Resilience for an Unpredictable Future</p>
<p>The battle between cybersecurity professionals and threat actors isn’t going anywhere—it’s only intensifying. Agility, collaboration, and innovation are non-negotiable in this fight. By adopting advanced technologies and forward-thinking strategies, we can fortify our systems and stay one step ahead of the adversaries shaping tomorrow’s threats.</p>
<p>Join us in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024">December in Frankfurt at our cyberevolution conference</a>, where we will continue to discuss the cyber threat landscape and its future.</p>

<p>A bad actor isn’t only a poorly skilled thespian (ha ha). It’s also a person (or group) who intentionally acts to cause harm to a person or organization via computers, devices,&nbsp;systems or&nbsp;networks.</p>



<p>This type of bad actor most commonly affects individuals when they steal their <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a>, such as name, address and credit card details in a <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a> (though not all data breaches are malicious).</p>



<p>To date, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/privacy/state-of-digital-privacy-americans">more than 60%</a> of Americans have been the victim of a <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>. In 2023, data breaches in the US increased by a massive <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ITRC_2023-Annual-Data-Breach-Report.pdf">78% </a>over 2022, and impacted an estimated <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ITRC_2023-Annual-Data-Breach-Report.pdf">353,027,892 people</a>.</p>



<p>Breaches don’t discriminate by industry. In fact, no industry is safe, with public administration, finance and healthcare the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307426/number-of-data-breaches-worldwide/">most at-risk industries</a> for data compromise.</p>



<p>What’s more, data breaches don’t only happen on the internet. <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">Personal information</a> can be exposed via Bluetooth, text message, and the good old-fashioned stolen wallet or phone, too.</p>



<p>So, once a bad actor has your <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a>, what do they do with it? Here are the top 10 things going on right now:</p>



 
 Identity theft: Using your stolen information to impersonate you for financial gain or to commit crimes 



 Financial fraud: Accessing your bank accounts, credit card information, or other financial accounts to make unauthorized transactions 



 Phishing: Sending fraudulent emails or messages pretending to be from legitimate organizations to trick you into revealing more information or clicking on malicious links 



 Social engineering: Manipulating you into divulging confidential information, often by posing as someone you trust or using your stolen information to build credibility 



 Account takeover: Gaining unauthorized access to your online accounts (email, social media, etc.) using your stolen usernames and passwords 



 Tax fraud: Using stolen personal information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds 



 Medical identity theft: Using your stolen information to get medical services and prescriptions, or to fraudulently file insurance claims 



 Employment fraud: Using your stolen information to illegally gain employment or benefits 



 Blackmail or extortion: Threatening to expose your sensitive information unless you pay a ransom 



 Creating fake identities: Using your stolen information to create new identities for various fraudulent purposes.

   Academia is facing challenges in managing non-human identities (NHIs), which are essential for modern research systems but often treated like human users. As NHIs grow in complexity, issues like token sprawl, access management misalignments, and compliance difficulties arise, especially in collaborative environments like high-performance computing. Traditional directories fail to manage these iden

<p>Academia has always been about pushing boundaries—whether in knowledge, technology, or collaboration. But as research grows more complex and reliant on technology, so too does the need to address a hidden layer of identity management. I’m talking about non-human identities (NHIs): those workloads, APIs, batch jobs, and software systems that work tirelessly behind the scenes. This is more than service accounts and bots. This is the underlying infrastructure for modern IT systems. </p>



<p>NHIs aren’t a new concept, but how we manage them today isn’t just outdated—it’s risky. Let’s dig in.</p>



 What Are NHIs? 



<p>Think about the processes that underpin research in a university. Automated data collection? That’s an NHI. Research simulations running on high-performance computing (HPC) systems? Also NHIs. APIs that manage sensitive student and research data? You guessed it—NHIs. These identities are everywhere, yet we still treat them like human users in many cases, with joiner/mover/leaver workflows and directory mappings.</p>



<p>And while this “fit them into the human box” approach might work on a small scale, it doesn’t secure the infrastructure they’re tied to. That’s a problem.</p>



 Why NHIs Are a Challenge 



<p>NHIs often inherit the same challenges as their human counterparts, only amplified by scale and complexity. Here’s a snapshot of the issues:</p>



 
 Token Sprawl: OAuth account tokens being passed around like candy at Halloween. (I feel like I need to make an analogy about cavities and decay, but I’ll just leave that here because iew.) 



 Access Management: Misaligned permissions, often shared across workloads, create opportunities for breaches. 



 Auditing and Compliance: Many HPC environments and collaborative research projects struggle to track what access NHIs have, much less prove compliance with regulations. 



 Security Gaps: Relying on directories and manual processes doesn’t cut it when workloads operate across different systems and organizations. 
 



<p>A common example? Research collaboration in HPC environments. These systems often involve shared resources accessed by NHIs with wildly varying permissions. Without precise controls, compliance becomes a nightmare, and auditing feels like playing whack-a-mole with invisible targets.</p>



 Directories: The Bottleneck We Can’t Ignore 



<p>But wait! We have directories to keep everything organized! Won’t that help? (All my enterprise IAM friends just did a full-body cringe reading that.)</p>



<p>Here’s the thing about directories: they’re fantastic for managing human identities in traditional environments. But when it comes to NHIs, directories quickly become a bottleneck. Why? Because they assume every identity—human or non-human—can be neatly slotted into a joiner-mover-leaver model.</p>



<p>For NHIs, this model is fundamentally flawed:</p>



 
 No Natural Lifecycle: Workloads, APIs, and batch jobs don’t “move” or “leave” in the same way people do. They’re created and destroyed based on operational needs, often spinning up and down in milliseconds. A directory simply can’t keep pace with this churn. 



 Token Dependency: OAuth tokens are often used as a workaround, passed around to grant temporary access. But this approach doesn’t scale—it’s prone to sprawl, lacks visibility, and creates security risks when tokens are misused or stolen. 



 Lack of Context: Directories were designed for human-centric workflows, meaning they lack the context required to manage the nuanced relationships NHIs have with systems, resources, and data. 
 



<p>The result? Academic IAM systems often end up overburdened and unable to scale to the demands of modern, complex environments. Imagine trying to cram a sprawling HPC infrastructure into a directory originally built to manage faculty and students—it’s like forcing a square peg into a round hole.</p>



 The Role of DevOps, IT, and IAM Teams 



<p>Managing NHIs isn’t a one-team job—it’s a cross-functional effort. DevOps and IT teams usually own the operational infrastructure, while IAM teams handle policy enforcement. But these groups often speak different “languages,” making collaboration tricky.</p>



<p>That’s where standards and architecture frameworks come in. Efforts like the IETF’s WIMSE draft aim to create a shared understanding of how to secure NHIs in multi-system environments. It’s a step in the right direction, but adoption isn’t straightforward.</p>



 Building Better NHI Management 



<p>So, how can academia start tackling the NHI problem more effectively?</p>



 
 Establish Clear Ownership: Decide who is responsible for managing NHIs, from provisioning to decommissioning. 



 Adopt Standards: Leverage frameworks like <a href="https://spiffe.io">SPIFFE</a> and <a href="https://ietf-wg-wimse.github.io/">WIMSE</a> to create consistent, scalable trust models. Learn how to use the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals Framework</a> and the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-specification-1_0.html">Continuous Access Evaluation Profile</a> (CAEP).  



 Invest in Automation: Automate the boring stuff, like token issuance and revocation, to reduce human error. (Hot take: CAEP can help here, too.) 



 Foster Collaboration: Create spaces for DevOps, IT, and IAM teams to align on priorities and processes. 
 



 Looking Ahead 



<p>The future of NHIs in academia isn’t just about solving today’s problems—it’s about enabling the next generation of research. Imagine a world where workload identities are as dynamic as the systems they operate in, seamlessly supporting complex collaborations across institutions. Standards and open-source tools will be key to making that vision a reality.</p>



<p>But here’s the catch: it’s not just a technical challenge. NHIs require governance, funding, and attention from leadership to ensure they’re managed sustainably. Without these, even the best tools won’t fix the problem.</p>

  <p>Organizations are confronted with unprecedented challenges in managing and securing identities across hybrid environments due to the growing complexity of the digital landscape.</p>
<p>While Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) solutions provide a foundation, the increasing complexity of identity ecosystems demands a more comprehensive approach to maintain visibility, security and control.</p>
<p>Modern identity management requires solutions that can bridge the gap between IGA and directory management. Advanced tools can consolidate visibility across hybrid environments, provide fine-grained control, and enhance delegation capabilities. These solutions complement IGA by addressing the limitations of native directory management and improving overall security posture.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at the challenges of breadth vs. depth in managing target systems, but also the common scenario of different teams being responsible for different parts of the infrastructure such as the IGA solution vs. Microsoft Active Directory. He will provide insights not only when to use multiple solutions, but also discuss approaches on a TOM (Target Operating Model) that leads to consistent management of diverse environments.</p>
<p>Robert Kraczek, Global Strategist at One Identity will showcase how solutions like Active Roles can serve as connectors to various directories, providing a single pane of glass for hybrid environments. He will demonstrate how these tools enhance security, improve efficiency, and complement existing IGA solutions to address the complexities of modern identity ecosystems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enhancing-identity-ecosystem"></a>

			 Satjapong Meeklai is Senior DevSecOps Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>Hi guys. My name is Satjapong Meeklai. I’m Thai, born and live in Bangkok. I’ve always been passionate about technology since I was young so I spent most of my time using computers and the internet to learn new things. After finishing high school, I decided to study computer science at a university in Thailand. And fortunately after graduating, I got a Japanese government scholarship to continue my higher education in Tokyo. After obtaining a master degree, I came back to Thailand and devoted myself as a technician because I love doing hands-on works, trying various types of roles in this field and eventually, decided to focus on becoming a DevSecOps engineer who work in Fintech and Web3 startups because I believe in the industries so I’m trying to make some contributions to this major shift to happen which hopefully will create positive impacts to other people around the world.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>After completing my master’s degree, I was drawn to data science and AI, so I pursued a role as a data scientist. I joined an early-stage startup focused on sentiment analysis, where I wore many hats due to the small team. Besides building machine learning models, I handled data cleaning, preprocessing, backend development, and DevOps. Through this experience, I discovered a passion for DevOps, leading me to shift my career in that direction.</p>
<p>I continued working in startups, valuing their fast-paced, impactful environments. For four years, I was the lead DevOps engineer at Opn, a Thai fintech company that became a unicorn. Managing a team of nine, I contributed meaningfully to the company’s success, which remains one of my proudest achievements.</p>
<p>While at Opn, I became interested in Blockchain and Web3, eventually leaving to join a small Web3 startup in digital asset custody. Although the company closed due to market challenges, my interest in Web3 grew. This led me to Tokeny, a platform for tokenizing traditional assets, which I see as a bridge to open finance in the Web3 era. I’m excited to help drive this transformation.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>So far it has been very pleasant for me. People here are kind, nice, but work hard. They’re good at what they do. I can feel the determination of what we want to build and deliver to the community. We are here to create changes. That is what I can tell after working here for several months.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I think not dying in vain would probably be something I’m passionate about the most. I want the existence of myself to have a positive impact and influence on people around me. I no longer dream of changing the world myself but I’d like to support, contribute, and be a part of that something together with others to create positive results for the community, society, country, and/or the world instead. In the end, what I care about the most is myself being in a position where I’m proud and happy about myself, the decisions I made, the things I do, and do not regret how I live and what I’ve done to people around me.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Be one of the early employees of an incredibly successful tech company while being a good, caring leader to my family.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>First you should believe in your own vision. Then try to align that vision with the company. Then you will find that whatever you do, either for yourself or the company, is meaningful by themselves.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>I’m excited about our mission to build the world of open finance and how this will change the world of traditional finance. It’s pretty interesting to see what will change in 5 to 10 years from now with the power of the Web3 industry and Tokeny.</p>

 A Need for Verifiable Digital Credentials in Government <p>Government agencies face significant challenges in delivering secure, reliable identity credentialing and verification processes that are built for today’s digital world. Protecting residents' data from unauthorized access is essential, as is providing secure, accessible ways for residents to easily verify their identities across digital and physical channels as they go about their day-to-day.</p><p>The outdated, paper-based systems that exist today slow down government processes and introduce vulnerabilities, such as fraud, inefficiencies, and elevated administrative costs. These challenges not only affect the security and privacy of residents’ data, but also put a strain on government resources. We believe that to meet the demands of a digital-first society, agencies must transition away from paper-based credentials, which are vulnerable to tampering, to secure, verifiable digital credentials. Read on to learn more about the top 10 real world applications in government today, and how SpruceID is helping partner with agencies for digital transformation.</p> Today’s Top 10 Real-World Applications <p>When it comes to verifiable digital credentials in government, 10 use cases is just barely scratching the surface. However, the list below outlines several in-demand applications today where digital credentials bring significant advantages, greatly benefiting both government entities and the people they serve:</p>  Mobile Driver’s License (mDL): Physical IDs may be the norm, but they are easily lost, stolen, or damaged, making residents vulnerable to identity theft and fraud. Law enforcement, businesses, and government agencies spend valuable time verifying IDs, and the reliance on physical cards slows down services and increases errors. With high-assurance verifiable digital credentials (VDCs), verification becomes faster, more secure, and far less vulnerable to tampering with. The added convenience and security offered by a mobile driver’s license creates a streamlined, fraud-resistant environment where residents don’t have to rely on easily compromised physical cards. Read more about <a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/california-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com">how SpruceID helped the State of California implement their mobile driver’s license program</a>, and the benefits they’ve seen so far.  Outdoor Licenses and Permits: Today’s outdoor licenses and permits (such as boating or fishing licenses) are largely paper-based, which are easy to lose or counterfeit, and enforcing them can be difficult. Conservation officers lack real-time verification tools, making enforcement difficult and allowing illegal activities to go unchecked. Digital permits with VDCs provide instant, reliable proof with an easy way to verify the credentials, supporting conservation efforts and reducing illegal activities—all while protecting public lands and waters. Learn about <a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/utah-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com">how SpruceID worked with Utah to launch digital off-road vehicle permits</a> and how they’ve benefitted.  Incarcerated Individuals and Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement: Today, approximately 27% of formerly incarcerated individuals are unemployed. This statistic highlights the significant barriers to employment these individuals face, particularly in accessing proper identification. The criminal justice system’s reliance on outdated, paper-based records not only creates vulnerabilities in identity management and record accuracy but also complicates access to essential rehabilitative services. These inefficiencies lead to security risks, identity errors, and hindered re-entry support. Verifiable digital credentials can help facilitate access to job applications, housing, and social services, while removing barriers to re-enter society and rebuild their lives.  Marriage and Birth Certificates: Paper marriage certificates, birth certificates, and even social security cards are essential but vulnerable to loss, damage, and forgery, which complicates access to legal rights and government services. Verifying these documents can also be a slow process, creating roadblocks for individuals needing to prove familial status for health benefits, citizenship, and legal matters. VDCs ensure secure, instant access to these vital records, protecting individuals’ identities and preventing fraudulent claims. They can also help streamline processes such as enrolling your new baby onto your health insurance — as discussed in <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/new-baby-new-headache-how-verifiable-digital-credentials-could-simplify-insurance-enrollment/">our recent blog post</a>.  Social Services Access (SNAP/Medicaid): Accessing social services with paper-based documentation is cumbersome and prone to errors. Individuals who qualify may face delays or rejections, while ineligible recipients can exploit the system, diverting funds from those in need. By using VDCs, agencies can improve efficiency and reduce fraud by allowing for real-time verification of eligibility, ensuring benefits reach the right individuals faster and reducing strain on the social services infrastructure.  Civic Participation: Fraud and manipulation risks increase, threatening the integrity of civic participation such as responding to RFCs (requests for comments) or submitting feedback to political representatives. Verifiable digital credentials create a secure, accessible way to ensure that for example, someone is a resident and not a bot, without oversharing information. This approach has also been considered for simultaneously improving our voting systems’ security and engagement with the new generation.  Land and Property Records: Paper-based land records can be misplaced, tampered with, or falsified, leading to property disputes, unclear ownership, and legal issues that impact families and businesses. To mitigate these issues and more, VDCs provide a secure way to manage property records, ensure property rights are protected, and enhance transparency in property ownership.  Disaster Relief: In times of disaster, quickly verifying the identity and eligibility of individuals seeking relief is crucial but challenging with traditional paper documents. When someone loses their paper documents, aid can be delayed, misallocated, or vulnerable to fraud, hindering the response and leaving affected people without timely support. VDCs allow for quick, secure verification of those in need, ensuring relief reaches the right people and enable response teams to act efficiently during critical moments. Our credentials are accessible even in remote areas, without wifi or cell service.  Government Employee Access and Verification: Current reliance on physical IDs for government employees and veterans can lead to unauthorized access, fraud, and security breaches. Verifiable digital credentials provide a secure way to verify identity of government employees such as military or veterans, protecting restricted spaces and sensitive information, while allowing instant access to necessary services and benefits that are exclusive to military and veterans, among other government employees.  Cross-Border Travel Credentials: Physical cross-border travel documents such as customs clearance forms, visas, and health certificates and more are vulnerable to forgery and theft, creating security risks and causing delays at border crossings. VDCs offer a way to consolidate identity, customs, and health credentials into one streamlined verification process. This speeds up clearance, improves safety, and enhances global security and health compliance, delivering a more efficient experience for travelers and border authorities alike.  <p></p> SpruceID’s Solution <p>SpruceID works with a variety of public sector agencies to issue verifiable digital credentials, creating a system of trust, security, and convenience that can be applied across numerous government applications. Our Credible platform supports issuing a range of digital credentials, from mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) to professional certifications. These credentials use cryptographic digital signatures, ensuring that they cannot be falsified, shared through screenshots, or recreated by AI-generated deepfakes.</p><p>Our solutions prioritize minimal disclosure of personal data, enabling residents to verify credentials with only essential information (for example, only needing to show your age to enter a bar while keeping your personal address hidden). This keeps personal data secure and compliant with privacy regulations, all while eliminating government tracking or surveillance. In addition, Credible helps to drive increased efficiency, as digital processes streamline verifications and reduce administrative bottlenecks, ultimately saving time for both agencies and residents. By minimizing reliance on paper, agencies significantly lower overhead costs related to printing, mailing, and administrative handling, creating a cost-effective, privacy-centric solution.</p> Shaping the Future of Digital Identity in Government <p>We envision a future where government agencies fully leverage verifiable digital credential solutions that align with standards and advance alongside open-source industry collaborations.&nbsp;</p><p>Through partnerships with agencies such as the California DMV, we demonstrate our commitment to creating scalable, interoperable solutions. By embracing VDCs, government agencies can protect citizens, enhance services, and reduce administrative burdens, empowering everyone securely and efficiently.
