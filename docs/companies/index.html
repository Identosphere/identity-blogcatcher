<p>FindBiometrics readers want to hear from leaders in the biometrics industry. That’s certainly one takeaway from this week’s roundup of our most popular stories.</p>



<p>As a case in point, one of the most popular items from the week was Thursday’s live webinar, “10 Reasons to Switch to Frictionless Access Control“, now available on demand. The webinar was presented by FindBiometrics and Oosto, an industry leader in face biometrics and access control, and delved into the compelling benefits of using facial recognition to enable contactless access and high level of security:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/live-webinar-10-reasons-to-switch-to-frictionless-access-control-712169/">On-Demand: “10 Reasons to Switch to Frictionless Access Control”</a> 



<p>And FindBiometrics readers also wanted to hear from another global leader in biometrics, NEC Corporation of America. In this case, the company was represented by Jason Van Sice, its Vice President of Aviation, who talked to FindBiometrics Editor in Chief Peter Counter about his company’s I:Delight platform and the transformative benefits of facial recognition in air travel, among other timely topics:</p>



 <a>INTERVIEW: NEC’s Jason Van Sice on Airport Biometrics in the Late Pandemic</a> 



<p>Another pair of face biometrics leaders stayed in the spotlight this week for very different reasons. FaceTec generated a lot of buzz at the start of the year with its announcement of a patent infringement lawsuit against iProov last week, and the story continued to draw attention from FindBiometrics readers this week. It’s surely going to be one of the ongoing items to watch in the months ahead:</p>

<p>But it wasn’t just face biometrics technology stoking reader interest this week. Smart lighting specialist Sengled attracted a lot of attention with its unveiling of a smart light bulb that it says is capable of reading health metrics like temperature and heart rate without the need for physical contact. It’s a passive health monitoring system for the IoT:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sengled-unveils-smart-light-bulb-with-health-tracking-capabilities-010603/">Sengled Unveils Smart Light Bulb With Health Tracking Capabilities</a> 



<p>And finally, FindBiometrics readers continued to show interest in filling out our annual Year in Review survey this week. The survey is designed to tackle a broad range of important topics, opportunities, and challenges facing the biometrics industry, and is pitched at professionals who work in it or in adjacent areas. By soliciting feedback from those who know the space best, our Year in Review surveys let the biometrics industry get a good look in the mirror:</p>

  “The signing of this agreement represents an excellent opportunity to reinforce our position within the sports events industry, working hand in hand with one of the biggest teams in Spanish football, and making clear that the application of our solutions improves the user experience in any industry – even in big sporting events.” – Javier Mira, CEO, FacePhi 



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/speakers-announced-the-findbiometrics-year-in-review-virtual-event/"></a><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/speakers-announced-the-findbiometrics-year-in-review-virtual-event/">Register for our upcoming virtual event!</a> 



<p><a href="https://en.facephi.com/">FacePhi</a> and the Valencia CF soccer club are deepening their partnership. The organizations have announced a new agreement through which the latter will act as “a global ambassador” for FacePhi’s technology.</p>



<p>It’s the latest sign of friendly ties between the firms after Valencia CF provided FacePhi an entryway into the sports sector last year, thanks to a project in which FacePhi’s biometric onboarding technology was used to enroll Valencia CF fans into an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-pivots-to-e-football-technology-with-venue-access-project-706031/">automated access control system</a> that allowed them to get into the Valencia CF stadium using a QR code via the football club’s mobile app.</p>



<p>Going forward, Valencia CF could prove to be an important ally in helping to promote FacePhi’s biometric tech to a wider audience in the sporting world, with the organizations suggesting in a statement that the soccer organization will promote FacePhi tech at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, as well as more broadly.</p>



<p>In return, FacePhi has agreed to become a Valencia CF sponsor and a member of the VCF Business Club, the professional networking arm of the European football organization.</p>



<p>“Thanks to this collaboration with Valencia CF, our technology will be able to be present within any sporting entity worldwide, beyond the scope of Spanish football clubs,” explained FacePhi CEO Javier Mira. “The signing of this agreement represents an excellent opportunity to reinforce our position within the sports events industry, working hand in hand with one of the biggest teams in Spanish football, and making clear that the application of our solutions improves the user experience in any industry – even in big sporting events.”</p>



<p>A love of soccer appears to run deep for the Spain-based identity tech company. Shortly after announcing its partnership with Valencia CF last year, in the summer FacePhi revealed that its board chairman, Salvador Martí, was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-reports-60-sales-increase-for-h1-as-ceo-takes-board-chair-707261/">stepping down from his position</a> to focus his energies on the growth of CF Intercity, a soccer team that he co-founded. Mira, who took Martí’s place on the board, commented at the time that Martí’s decision was “brave and understandable from the point of view of an engaged entrepreneur.”</p>



<p>The new Valencia CF agreement’s announcement comes soon after the news that SoYou, a financial services startup, had become <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/soyou-turns-facephi-remote-customer-onboarding-010604/">the latest client</a> to embrace FacePhi’s selfie-based onboarding solution.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/">HID Global</a> is turning an eye to the future with <a>seven predictions for the security and identity industry</a> in 2022. Generally speaking, the trends point to the increased digitization of the security sector, for a combination of practical and ideological reasons.</p>



  



<p>First and foremost, HID Global warns that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/rank-one-warns-about-cyberthreats-us-supply-chain-100704/">supply chain issues</a> will continue to be a problem in the coming year. There are still not enough semiconductors to meet the demand for devices like access readers and control panels, and that (coupled with more standard logistics bottlenecks) will make security hardware more expensive moving forward.</p>



<p>At the same time, the industry is embracing digital solutions to modern security challenges. Some of that shift is ethical, in the sense that sustainability is an increasingly important priority for businesses and consumers alike. HID Global expects that trend to become more pronounced in 2022, and that more companies will implement <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/hid-global-provides-mobile-access-commercial-tower-mexico-city-071502/">mobile and app-based solutions</a> to try to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>



<p>HID Global’s other predictions highlight some of the technologies that will gain traction as a result of that shift. For example, the company expects Software-as-a-Service identity solutions to become more popular as businesses move more assets and management procedures to the cloud. Many of those solutions will <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/covid-will-help-fuel-28-83b-contactless-biometrics-market-report-020202/">leverage contactless biometrics</a> for authentication, since the technology is both more hygienic and more secure than legacy alternatives like passwords. Digital technologies are also well suited to a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/entrust-survey-shows-growing-support-hybrid-work-model-wake-covid-19-090107/">hybrid work environment</a>. Contactless tech makes access safer for people on-site, while <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biden-seeks-establish-clear-cybersecurity-standards-with-executive-order-051807/">multi-factor authentication</a> improves security for remote employees in a zero-trust authentication model.</p>



<p>Digital IDs are similarly expected to become more prevalent as <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-delays-mobile-id-rollout-hints-at-retail-venue-access-features/">mobile developers add new wallet utilities</a> and enterprises and governments start to offer <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-confirms-tsa-state-participation-in-mobile-id-initiative-809011/">more support for the technology</a>. HID Global suggested that adoption rates for digital IDs could start to outstrip those of physical IDs in 2022.</p>



<p>Finally, organizations will try to take advantage of the data that is generated with modern devices. Most notably, businesses will analyze data to automate their risk management procedures, and to <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/innominds-brings-predictive-analytics-hid-safe-access-control-platform-121707/">take preventive action</a> to thwart cyberthreats before they become a more serious concern.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.daon.com/">Daon</a> has been helping to keep airline executives safe at this week’s <a href="https://aaae.org/hai">Aviation Issues Conference</a> in Hawaii. The event took place at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Kauai, where all conference attendees were asked to use Daon’s VeriFLY app to share their COVID-19 health credentials.</p>



  



<p>The VeriFLY app <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/daon-and-american-airlines-testing-new-travel-credential-app/">debuted in late 2020</a>, and was developed to speed up health screening processes that were introduced in response to COVID-19. Travelers can use the app to upload <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/verifly-lets-users-upload-vaccine-credentials/">vaccination records</a>, COVID-19 test results, and questionnaire responses, and then share those documents with staff when they pass through a security checkpoint or board a plane. The app is geared toward the air travel industry, though it has also gained traction in the hospitality sector as a way to screen people in hotels and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/pennsylvania-convention-center-uses-daons-verifly-app-monitor-employee-health-020402/">convention centers</a>. In that regard, Daon <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/hyatt-brings-verifly-app-hospitality-industry-031103/">partnered with Hyatt Hotels</a> (which is hosting the conference) in March of 2021.</p>



<p>The Aviation Issues Conference is now in its 36th year, and is organized by the American Association of Airline Executives (AAAE). The event gives high-level air travel executives the opportunity to come together to discuss some of the major issues that are affecting the air travel industry at large, and to try to set a policy agenda to guide their lobbying efforts in Washington, DC.</p>



<p>The fact that VeriFLY was chosen as the Conference’s exclusive mobile health app partner likely speaks to its popularity with air travel stakeholders. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/american-airlines-lets-customers-use-air-miles-pay-covid-test-030108/">American Airlines</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/british-airways-extends-verifly-service-all-international-flights-uk-021909/">British Airways</a> were some of the earliest adopters of the app, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/alaska-airlines-offers-verifly-screening-international-travelers-020803/">Alaska Airlines</a> has also been using it to screen international travelers.</p>



<p>This year’s Aviation Issues Conference ran from January 9-13. Daon’s Vice President of Sales, Nick Hallas, discussed the company’s experiences with VeriFLY on a Facilitating Travel and Commerce Through Pandemic panel on January 13.</p>

<p>A pair of US Senators are asking Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to be more transparent about their use of facial recognition technology. The organization’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbp-uses-simplified-arrival-tech-photograph-people-cars-092303/">Simplified Arrival program uses facial recognition</a> to match travelers to their identity documents at <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbp-brings-biometric-screening-kansas-city-airport-080607/">air</a>, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idemia-cbp-biometric-screening-sea-port-411144/">sea</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbp-brings-simplified-arrival-trio-land-borders-maine-120802/">land borders</a> all over the country.</p>



  



<p>The problem, according to Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Roy Blunt (R-MO), is that US citizens have not been adequately informed of their rights at those border checkpoints. While the biometric screening process is mandatory for foreign nationals, US citizens are able to opt out of the facial recognition process. Those who do will be asked to present their passports and other travel documents for a more traditional manual inspection with a CBP agent.</p>



<p>Merkley and Blunt want to make sure that US citizens are aware of that right while they are trying to re-enter the country. As it stands, CBP has detailed its biometric and data storage policies in its press releases about the Simplified Arrival program. However, most people don’t read press releases, which is why Merkley and Blunt want CBP to do a better job of informing people at the actual point of contact.</p>



<p>To that end, the two senators have sent a letter to CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus to ask for more information about the agency’s biometric program. In that regard, they specifically want Magnus to detail the steps that CBP will take to educate the public about its screening and data protection policies, and how it will ensure that those who exercise their right to opt out do not experience more delays or face additional scrutiny as a result of that decision.</p>



<p>“While it is now common for American citizens to be told their photo will be taken in order to proceed through the customs process, countless Americans are not adequately informed about their ability to opt out of this step,” write Merkley and Blunt. “Every U.S. citizen should have the opportunity to make an informed decision whether to have their passport photo manually verified by a CBP officer instead of having their biometric data collected and stored in a manner with which they are not familiar.”</p>



<p>The ACLU has filed a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-aclu-sues-government-agencies-over-use-facial-recognition-airports-031603/">Freedom of Information request</a> to try to find out more about CBP’s biometric screening program. The Biden administration also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biden-administration-abandons-dhs-biometric-policy-proposal-051108/">abandoned a Trump-era policy proposal</a> that would have given DHS more authority to collect biometric data from US citizens.</p>

<p>A new rumor suggests that Apple is finally getting ready to ditch the bezel in its flagship smartphones. The rumor specifically applies to the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, both of which will reportedly come with a screen with a hole-punch display rather than the bezel that the tech giant has used in the past.</p>



  



<p>The hole-punch display would allow Apple to deliver an iPhone with a true full-screen display. What’s more impressive, though, is that Apple will reportedly do that without affecting the performance of its Face ID 3D facial recognition setup. Most of the hardware in the Face ID camera system has traditionally been stored in the bezel. However, the new rumor indicates that Apple is planning to move some of its facial recognition sensors under the display to preserve its utility while maximizing display space.</p>



<p>It’s not yet clear what the actual layout would look like in such a system. Apple’s 3D facial recognition system currently consists of an infrared camera, a flood illuminator, a proximity sensor, an ambient light sensor, and a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-describes-far-field-dot-projector-latest-patent-application-080706/">dot projector</a> in addition to the camera itself. Having said that, the rumor claimed that Apple’s hole-punch display would be pill-shaped instead of circular, which might create more space for those extra components.</p>



<p>Hole-punch displays are fairly common on Android phones, though they tend to feature a circular cut-out rather than a pill-shaped design. One notable exception is the Huawei Mate 40 Pro, which is one of the few Android phones that also offers 3D facial recognition capabilities.</p>



<p>Apple’s screens will reportedly have a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, and will come courtesy of Samsung and LG. While the premium iPhones are getting a screen upgrade, the standard iPhone 14 will still feature a bezel rather than a hole-punch display.</p>



<p>Of course, Apple prognosticators have been <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/biometrics-news-latest-rumor-suggests-apple-ditch-camera-notch-2020-iphone-092603/">predicting that Apple would phase out the bezel</a> for the past several years, so it’s too early to tell whether or not the latest batch of rumors is accurate. Apple did receive a patent for a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-patents-new-face-id-assembly-system-052809/">new Face ID assembly framework</a> in May of 2021.</p>

<p><a href="https://precisebiometrics.com/">Precise Biometrics</a> is teaming up with <a href="https://www.infineon.com/">Infineon</a> to extend its reach in the automotive market. In that regard, the two companies will work together to develop a new identity verification solution that combines Precise’s proprietary BioMatch fingerprint algorithm with Infineon’s leading semiconductor technology.</p>



  



<p>The joint offering will eventually be installed in smart vehicles to provide drivers with a more customized in-car experience. The sensors would be used to verify the driver’s identity when they get behind the wheel, and that identity could be linked to that individual’s personal preferences. As a result, the car could automatically adjust the seat, the mirrors, and the radio station, amongst other things. The driver could also use fingerprint recognition to log into various connected applications, including those associated with <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/cerence-picks-up-another-car-payments-partner-052002/">in-car payment services</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Precise noted that Infineon already has established relationships with many equipment manufacturers. Infineon, meanwhile, believes that the collaboration could eventually extend beyond the automotive sector.</p>



<p>“The collaboration with Precise forges a perfect combination of hardware and software,” said Ralf Koedel, the Senior Director of Product Marketing for Infineon’s Automotive Division. “Together, we can provide ODMs with cutting edge solutions for the authenticating of drivers using biometric data. These will initially be used in the sports and luxury car segment. Gradually, however, a significantly larger market will develop here.”</p>



<p>“We are happy to collaborate with Infineon to enable tailor-made experiences for the driver in next generation vehicles,” added Precise CEO Stefan Persson. “Together we will work closely to provide the market with innovative technology that strengthens the connection between humans and vehicles.”</p>



<p>The news comes only a week after Precise <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/precise-signs-deals-place-fingerprint-tech-smart-vehicles-010404/">signed licensing agreements</a> with two unnamed equipment manufacturers in the automotive industry. Several automakers have now introduced cars with fingerprint-powered ignition systems, with the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/toyota-outfits-2022-land-cruiser-with-biometric-ignition-080506/">Toyota 2022 Land Cruiser</a> and the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/genesis-offer-facial-authentication-fingerprint-ignition-with-upcoming-gv60-092002/">Genesis GV60</a> standing as some of the most recent additions to the list.</p>

This and more you can find answered in this article, brought to you by your Telegram admin, Ontology Harbinger and proud owner of candidate node “CZ/SK Ontology community node”,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">DuMonT</a>.  Which one is better for&nbsp;me? <p>In order to make a correct decision, you should know what staking is, what it means to run a candidate node, and what are the main differences. To put it simply, staking means that you assign your ONTs to a candidate or consensus node. For doing this, you earn ONG rewards based on the distribution ratio set by the node owner. On the other hand, as a node owner, the main advantage is that you manage the distribution ratio. Let’s see the main pros and cons of both approaches.</p> Staking <p>(+) Low limit - you can stake as little as 1 ONT, while the upper limit depends on how much the specific node can accept from&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>(+) Higher flexibility - you can decide to cancel the full, or part of the stake at any time. Your tokens are unlocked when consensus round ends (in the case of unstaking from candidate nodes).</p><p>(+) No entry barrier - no extra fees applied, only a transaction fee of 0.05&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>(-) Trust in the node owner - your rewards depend mainly on the node’s distribution ratio, the risk is that node owner can change it or even cut it to 0, which may force you to stake to a different node. To minimize the risk, it is recommended to either stake with nodes that have stable fee sharing ratio checkmark at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>, or regularly check whether the node you stake with changed the ratio to unfavorable values.</p><p>(-) Switching nodes - if you decide to change a node, cancelling the stake and staking to a different node will result in losing 1 consensus round of&nbsp;rewards.</p> Candidate node&nbsp;owner <p>(+) You manage the distribution ratio - you decide on how much % of generated rewards you keep, and how much is distributed to your&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>(+) Potentially higher rewards - explained in next parts of&nbsp;article.</p><p>(+) A way to promote yourself/your company.</p><p>(-) Higher entry limit - minimum amount to start a candidate node is 10,000&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>(-) Lower flexibility — as a node operator you can not reduce your stake below 10,000 ONT, or unstake such an amount that would result in user stake being more than 10x higher than your remaining node stake (example: your node stake is 15K ONT, user stake is 100K ONT, at max you can unstake 5K ONT). In case you would need to unstake more, you must cancel your node entirely.</p><p>(-) Entry fee - to start a node you need to pay a fixed 500 ONG fee, + 0.05 ONG transaction fee.</p> Summary <p>Staking is a great way to get passive rewards for holding your ONTs. Moreover, it is suitable for everyone as you can stake from as little as 1 ONT, and it also provides more flexibility than when you run a node. You can learn more about staking in the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ultimate-ontology-staking-guide-e70c44330429">Ultimate Ontology Staking Guide</a>. On the other hand, if you have more than 10,000 ONTs, and you are a long term holder that wants to maximize your rewards, it is a good time to consider creating your own candidate node.</p> I want to run a candidate node! <p>So you decided to run a candidate node? In the next part, I will cover how to create a candidate node, the requirements, and possible strategies.</p> How it&nbsp;works? <p>Ontology candidate nodes are nodes which do not validate transactions. They could become active validators if they get to the top 15 by size, which would turn them to consensus nodes. A basic candidate node is something like staking pool, which creates room for stakers. Therefore, once you register a candidate node, and you are not in the top 15, you are not required to have your device online 24/7. This is all you need to start generating ONG rewards. In addition, you could run an online node, which synchronizes the blocks generated by consensus nodes. This would require your device to be online but does not bring you any extra rewards as you do not actively participate in consensus. If you still want to go in that direction, then you can find documentation at <a href="https://docs.ont.io/ontology-node/abstract">https://docs.ont.io/ontology-node/abstract</a>, but it also requires some technical skill.</p> How to launch a candidate node? <p>The main tool you need is OWallet on your PC. It is a desktop wallet application developed by Ontology. Download it only from the official GitHub source: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases</a>.</p><p>Once you have OWallet installed, you can create a new wallet, import your existing wallet, or use a Ledger hardware wallet. Last but not least, you need at least 10,000 ONT in your wallet address, + at least 500.05 ONG. Ontology published a step-by-step guide on how to proceed within OWallet, you can find the guide here: <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/guides/sign-up-to-run-an-ontology-node">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/guides/sign-up-to-run-an-ontology-node</a></p><p>Once you launch the node within OWallet, and set important settings, you just need to wait until a new consensus round begins. At that point, your node generates rewards which will be available for you to claim after each consensus round&nbsp;ends.</p> Explanation of important settings in&nbsp;OWallet <p>There are few important settings, which you definitely should not miss because they define rewards distribution as well as how stakers see&nbsp;you.</p>  Allowed stake unit — located at the “User stake Authorization” page, determines how many ONT your node can accept from stakers. By default it is set to 0, which means stakers can not stake at your node. The maximum value you can set is 10x of your initial node stake, and you can also see this value in the table below. So, if your node stake is 10K ONT, you can set a maximum of 100K&nbsp;ONT.    Fee sharing ratio — located at at “User Stake Authorization” page, determines the distribution ratio of rewards between the node operator and its stakers. You set the ratio for the node’s initial stake and user stake separately. Remember, in OWallet, you set reward values which you, as node operator, decide to keep. The remaining rewards are automatically distributed to stakers. The first value represents % of rewards generated by the node initial stake, while the second value represents % of rewards generated by the user stake. If you set it to 100/100, this would mean you keep all rewards and stakers get 0 (so nobody will stake with you). On the other hand, if you set it to 0/0 then all rewards will go to the stakers and you get 0. The trick is to find the ideal setting which fits your strategy. Some popular ratios are 90/10, or even more generous to stakers, 90/5. This would be displayed to stakers at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a> as 10/95. Keep in mind that any change of ratio takes effect in the consensus round after the next one. (Example: you change the ratio in OWallet during round 150. When round 151 begins, it will be displayed to stakers at node.ont.io as the next round ratio and becomes effective when round 152&nbsp;begins).  Node info — it is a separate page where you can fill in all the information about your node. For instance, you can change the node name, set a logo, etc. If you want to obtain a “Verified” checkmark next to your node at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>, you need to also fill in the “Email to contact with Ontology”. You can learn more about checkmarks at <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/node-checkmark">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/node-checkmark</a>   When will I get&nbsp;rewards? <p>Reward distribution frequency is the same as when you are a staker. You do not get rewards for the round during which you launch a node, but you get your first rewards for the next consensus round. Rewards are added to your profit section each time when a consensus round ends. You can claim them after each round, or keep them accumulating and claim anytime you like. (Example: you launch the node during consensus round 150, you will get your first rewards when round 151 ends and the next rewards when round 152 ends,&nbsp;etc.)</p> Candidate node possible strategies   Operator only — some candidate nodes decide not to allow user staking to their node so they participate only with their node initial stake. In this case, they keep all rewards generated by node initial stake, but lose the potential of getting additional rewards from user stake. The difference from normal staking is that they do not need to worry about changing the distribution ratio, because they are node&nbsp;owners.  Self promotion — some nodes may decide to use their node for promotional purposes, such as Unifi Protocol node, which distributes 100% of all rewards to stakers. Node operator gets 0 rewards but in return is well visible in the community, which can help achieve long term goals of the operator in the&nbsp;future.  Win/win — this strategy means that you set a distribution ratio, which gives you, as node operator, higher rewards than you would get with the “operator only” strategy, and at the same time gives good rewards to stakers, which motivates them to stake with you. Success of this strategy depends on the node operator’s ability to attract stakers, because the goal of such a node is to achieve 100% filling of the staking capacity. An example may be Harbinger nodes, which are represented by outstanding members of the Ontology community. Stakers can decide to stake with those Harbingers to support them and their work, instead of some company or corporation.  Anything else — you can develop your own strategy which fits you best&nbsp;:)  <p>In the end, I hope this article helped you with your decision making process. Now it is your turn, whether you decide to stake or run a candidate node, that fully depends on your own preferences. Should you pick any of them, I welcome you&nbsp;onboard!</p><p>If you have any questions, or to report missing or wrong content, or if you want to tip my wallet to buy me a cup of coffee, please reach me on <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Twitter.</a> See&nbsp;you!</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  24,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  12,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  134,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>A total of 200k OCEAN is available.</p><p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to Ocean Protocol there are earmarked Core Tech Initiatives that are being continuously expanded upon.

They can qualify again for funding up to 35,000 OCEAN conditional that Unleash Data projects:</p>  “Unleash data” has actually always had a broad intent, towards driving Data Consume Volume. It is intended for projects like: becoming a data broker to get data owners’ data into Ocean Market, networking / “hitting the phones” to increase consumption on Ocean Market, integrating Filecoin &amp; publishing data on Ocean Market, etc. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#3-unleash-data">Here are further examples</a>. It was never meant to be solely for constructing / maintaining a small number of datasets.  Whatever is proposed should be high value-add to the Ocean ecosystem.  Example of poor value-add: requesting a lot of OCEAN to construct / maintain a small number of datasets to sell with expectation of profit. We expect and encourage OceanDAO voters to downvote such proposals.  <p>Burning becomes Recycling</p><p>Starting Round 13, any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the Treasury.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">For intuition on how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>You can find all the steps&nbsp;below:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  Any remaining funds inside an Earmark, are then moved towards [General&nbsp;Grants]  [New &amp; Core Tech] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Categories].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.

<p><a href="https://www.incognia.com/">Incognia</a> has cleared a major milestone and obtained Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type II certification. The certification indicates that Incognia’s authentication technology meets certain compliance standards, and was awarded following the completion of an independent third-party evaluation.</p>



  



<p>For its part, Incognia is hoping that the certification will make its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/incognia-introduces-location-based-anti-fraud-tool-mobile-devices-060203/">location-based authentication solution</a> more appealing to potential customers. The company bills its platform as a ‘<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/interview-incognia-ceo-andre-ferraz-zero-factor-authentication-912202/">Zero-Factor Authentication</a>‘ offering that analyzes a user’s movement patterns to assign a risk score to each interaction. Most logins occur at home or at another frequently-visited location like the office, so Incognia can automatically approve login requests that come from one of those trusted locations to deliver a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/download-incognia-mobile-app-friction-report/">frictionless authentication experience</a>.</p>



<p>“The SOC 2 certification demonstrates Incognia’s commitment to ensure the protection of information security and privacy for our customers,” said André Ferraz, CEO and founder of Incognia. “This external validation of Incognia’s information security programs and mechanisms only further supports our objective to provide customers with confidence that Incognia is maintaining the highest level of security and compliance.”</p>



<p>Incognia recently published a case study that showed how its technology produced a major <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/incognia-major-reduction-in-fraud-challenger-bank-709281/">fraud reduction for will bank</a>. The company has since gone on to <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/incognia-tech-integrated-into-outseer-beyond-platform-120901/">join the Outseer partner program</a>, integrating its solution with the Outseer Beyond platform as part of that arrangement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://zwipe.com/">Zwipe</a> has received an official endorsement from the Central Bank of Iraq, a development that could help to further strengthen its global position in the emerging biometric payment cards market.</p>



<p>“We deeply appreciate that global technology leaders [such] as Zwipe are putting immense efforts to not just introduce great innovations but building the payments ecosystem, helping all the parties in the value chain,” said the bank’s General Manager, Duha Al Atta, in a statement. “We encourage banks to pilot innovations from Zwipe, assess the end users’ feedback and bring biometric payment cards to Iraq in 2022.”</p>



<p>The affirmation arrives on the heels of Zwipe’s announcement that an undisclosed bank in the Levant region will soon <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/middle-east-bank-announces-biometric-card-pilot-with-zwipe-areeba-010602/">trial a biometric payment card</a> based on the Zwipe Pay ONE platform. The project, conducted in partnership with payment services provider areeba, is expected to begin in the first half of this year.</p>



<p>“We are extremely glad to see the support from Central Bank of Iraq for Zwipe,” commented Zwipe’s General Manager for the MENA region, Ramzi Saboury. “Their interest in biometric payment cards will further accelerate the adoption of our innovation in 2022.”</p>



<p>The central bank endorsement may help Saboury to deliver further wins for Zwipe in the Middle East region. Appointed to his role <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-targets-middle-eastern-market-with-new-partnership-regional-gm-041304/">less than a year ago</a>, Saboury appears to have helped to drive considerable business for Zwipe in the region in recent months, with the company having announced multiple partnerships and, most recently, a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/egyptian-bank-trial-biometric-cards-zwipe-tech-7122101/">pilot project with an Egyptian bank</a>.</p>



<p>That having been said, in seeking to establish a partner network ahead of an anticipated boom in biometric payment cards, Zwipe’s scope is global, with recent partnerships spanning from <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-partners-with-mexico-based-card-maker-biometric-payments-401042/">Mexico</a> to <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/new-zwipe-partner-north-american-biometric-cards-812201/">Africa</a>. Zwipe CEO André Løvestam got some attention at the start of this year with his prediction that 2022 will deliver <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-anticipates-breakthrough-year-2022-010302/">a commercial breakthrough</a> for the company.</p>

<p>Xiaomi has patented a new full-screen fingerprint recognition solution. The solution is being pitched as the next evolution of <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/xiaomi-introduces-rear-amoled-display-with-mi-11-ultra-smartphone-033002/">in-display fingerprint recognition</a>, which has become <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/biometrics-news-new-xiaomi-phone-features-ultra-thin-in-display-sensor-goodix-110706/">increasingly ubiquitous in consumer devices</a> in the past few years.</p>



  



<p>Phones that support in-display fingerprint recognition allow users to unlock their devices with a fingerprint sensor that has been placed below the screen. Such sensors do not take up any real estate on the surface of the phone, but users do need to place their fingers directly over the sensor in order to generate a positive match. In that regard, such sensors have many of the same limitations as more traditional fingerprint scanners.</p>



<p>The technology in Xiaomi’s patent is designed to fix that problem, which is to say that it would allow people to place their finger anywhere on the screen when they unlock their phone. In practice, the feat is accomplished with an array of infrared LED light transmitters that is placed in between the AMOLED display and the capacitive touch layer of the screen. The LED transmitters will activate whenever someone presses their fingertip onto the capacitive layer.</p>



<p>The system will only activate the transmitters in the area covered by the fingertip. The infrared light will shoot up through the screen and then bounce back, where it will be picked up by an array of infrared light receivers. The phone will use that light data to map the person’s fingerprint, and unlock if that new data matches the fingerprint data already registered to the device.</p>



<p>The infrared light receivers will be placed above the infrared light transmitters. While the transmitters below the fingertip will light up, the transmitters in the rest of the screen will not activate at all during the scan.</p>



<p>Xiaomi is expected to deploy the new technology across its entire smartphone portfolio. The company’s new patent was granted in China. Huawei also tried to <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/huawei-files-patents-for-full-screen-fingerprint-biometrics-108114/">patent its own full-screen fingerprint recognition system</a> in several countries back in 2020.</p>

<p>In the world of real-time ACH payments, open banking instant account verification is quickly making the old, manual methods look like the rotary phone. Why use an unreliable relic, when there’s a better, more secure, faster innovation? Throughout the years, financial institutions have relied on voided checks, manual routing and account number input by the consumer and microdeposits. These require days or weeks to complete, and are prone to errors or fraud.</p>
<p>More recently, data consortiums were used to confirm customer-submitted account details, checking them against existing databases. This assisted with clearing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Mixed-solution authenticators provided a fraud risk rating for the account being verified, but their information was sometimes based on older data. At best, these methods yielded only a sensible prediction of risk. With FinicityPay, failed payment risk is mitigated by obtaining account owner and balance insights prior to processing.</p>
<p>Previous methods of verification were rife with processing delays and lost revenue due to failed payments and fraud. Open banking APIs and platforms are the next evolution of payments. Faster, more secure and more transparent.</p>
 Open Banking Platforms Create a Real-Time Network of Connections to Financial Institutions 
 
 Trusted financial data aggregation platforms facilitate secure access to consumer-permissioned data via traditional connections (enriched with bank-level security) and APIs. 
 Tokenized access to account credentials is granted to third-party financial services innovators, utility providers and investment platforms, opening up consumer options. 
 Open banking is making third-party ACH payments faster and more secure, maximizing savings, rewards and investment opportunities. 
 A simple account balance check smooths the pre-funding path and protects consumers and merchants alike from failed payments and potential fees. 
 
<p>Using secure, consumer-permissioned access, financial institutions and vendors now get instant account balances and data from a consumer’s bank. Owner details, addresses, account and routing numbers and real-time balances are all immediately available. They can be scrutinized before authorizing payments on an open banking platform. Account access credentials are packaged into a “token” that can be passed to a third party. It yields no meaningful data if intercepted and hacked. This new level of security is spawning a much larger, more niche-oriented market of financial services providers and app developers. Open banking applications allow users to move money at the speed of the market.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking Opens Up Payment Enablement and Authentication 
 
 Innovation across all data-sharing stakeholders in the ecosystem expands what you can do to verify data and customize it to fit your payment use cases. 
 New technologies like AI are now available to integrate into your user experience. Move customers through your account setup process quickly and intuitively, while gaining permission to curated data that fits your needs.&nbsp; 
 Once an account is authenticated, payments from it can be issued instantly (dependent upon market/account providers) throughout your suite of products. Financial management, investment, utilities and recurring payments are all open for immediate money movement. 
 
<p>All of this has been revolutionary for consumers. Their mobile phones are full of financial services options powered by open banking, and they’re adopting them at a rapid pace. With a few taps on the screen, a user can grant permission to third-party apps and platforms, without having to type in account or routing numbers. The app or service the user wants to access is up and running with a full package of information pre-loaded. Secure, real-time ACH payments can be made within moments of installing and setting up an app. With the richer level of insight that’s available through consumer-permissioned data, developers are giving consumers a wealth of new options for managing, spending, and borrowing money. This is industry-changing innovation. It’s giving consumers more flexibility and ownership of their financial position than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking Simplifies the Payments Experience for Consumers 
 
 Customers aren’t asked to supply sensitive information, just permission to their accounts. 
 No more waiting periods for further verifications, like microdeposits or database checks. The customer’s data is pulled in milliseconds and rolled into the app they’re using, making real-time payments a breeze. 
 Financial management apps with AI integration pull together a holistic picture of the consumer’s moment-to-moment financial well-being.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While authenticating account details, ownership and current balance can streamline your payment process, it also reduces the hassle of setting up accounts and making payments for your customers. Enhancing their experience, especially when setting up payment is one of the first interactions they have with you.</p>

        <p>Major transaction processors in the Bitcoin SV network are upgrading to accept and handle Bitcoin block sizes up to 4 Gigabyte.</p>
  <p>On January 24, 2022, major transaction processors in the Bitcoin SV network are upgrading to accept and handle Bitcoin block sizes up to 4 Gigabyte!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The upgrade to 4GB is a breakthrough that will help everyone in the BSV ecosystem. TAAL is here to support the community and to help every BSV transaction processor to mine bigger and bigger blocks. That’s why we’re encouraging all miners to immediately increase their excessive block size limit to 4GB. They’ll be able to take full advantage of the node upgrade to expand their revenues and client base,” said Lars Jorgensen, TAAL Chief Operating Officer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin protocol does not have a limit on the block size (!), it is up to the decentralized transaction processors (aka “Miners”) to decide how big a block they accept based on their own capacity.</p>
<p>The market decides. When there is a market demand for more transactions and thereby larger blocks, the transaction processors will invest in hardware, network and energy contracts to be able to capture and handle more transactions efficiently and earn the transaction fees on the transactions they process and store.</p>
<p>The old term “Crypto Mining” becomes irrelevant as the initial “block reward” diminishes and becomes irrelevant compared to the massive amount of (very low) transaction fees. Transaction processors are not “mining crypto” they are processing transactions and storing data in the distributed blockchain.</p>
<p>Now when the Bitcoin blocks become larger and store many million transactions, the energy cost per transaction also becomes irrelevant, especially as the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) becomes very high due to the practical use of Bitcoin blockchain technology in for example enabling Global Supply Chains to become more efficient.</p>
<p>Global Supply Chains waste at least 80%! i.e., global supply chains end-to-end aggregated efficiency is less than 20%. If we can increase global supply chains efficiency by just some percentages by using Bitcoin Blockchain technology the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) will be enormous! Not to mention the enormous positive environmental and sustainability effects that will bring us.</p>

			<p>Tokeny, the Luxembourg-based tokenization platform, announced today a partnership with Inveniam Capital Partners, Inc. (“Inveniam”), a SaaS company delivering trust, transparency and completeness of data to private market assets. The partnership includes a €5m investment by Inveniam, Apex, and K20 Fund.</p>
<p>Inveniam works with private market asset owners and managers to deliver trusted valuation and pricing data using distributed ledger technology. This data underpins private market digital assets and gives these assets integrity upon which market participants can establish price discovery. The benefit to asset owners and managers is a more liquid asset, which can unlock value.</p>
<p>Tokeny offers a comprehensive and institutional-grade white-label solution for digital assets that allows asset owners and managers to efficiently and compliantly issue, transfer, and manage digital assets. All processes, from the client onboarding process including KYC/AML checks to the administration required to manage investor subscriptions, capital tables, distributions, capital calls, etc., are streamlined on the Tokeny platform.</p>
<p>The partnership aims to fully unlock asset liquidity via tokenization, which will be facilitated by providing all technical solutions private asset owners need, covering the entire value chain of tokenized assets underpinned with trusted data regarding asset valuation and pricing. These synergies can return significant value to each company’s clients.</p>

		 
	 
    We’ve been watching the Tokeny team’s progress and product evolution for more than two years and know they're building next-gen tokenization systems the efficient and compliant way. Totally altering the global trading of private market assets will only work on the institutional level if the experience is seamless, the technology is top-notch, and the right regulatory structures and business networks are in place. This partnership addresses all those requirements for success.  Patrick O'MearaChairman and CEO of Inveniam    
	 
		 
			<p>While Tokeny’s solutions provide a compliance infrastructure enabling asset managers to easily bring nearly every kind of real-world asset to blockchain, Inveniam allows their investors to access trusted data and asset valuation. Liquidity will be realized as investors can conduct peer-to-peer transfers using Tokeny’s compliance framework with a fair and transparent price reference provided by Inveniam.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokeny’s capabilities pick up right where Inveniam’s end and vice versa, addressing two biggest obstacles in private markets — pricing data and compliance — on a hyper-efficient infrastructure. In tandem with this very synergistic partnership, the investment by Apex, K20, and Inveniam will allow us to further improve our solutions and accelerate the adoption of tokenization with the best-in-class technology.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions    
	 
		 
			<p>Additional value to the market will accrue as the partnership will ultimately enable Apex Group, Inveniam’s fund administration partner, to deliver end-to-end cutting-edge services to a broad ecosystem of private asset owners.</p>

 About Tokeny&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Tokeny allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly and seamlessly issue, transfer, and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.&nbsp;Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance, and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments. Tokeny is the leader in its field and in 2020 was named one of the top 50 companies in the blockchain space by CB Insights. The company is backed by Euronext.</p>

 MetaMUI and Sovereign Yidindji Government launched 1st Self-Sovereign Identity-based National ID&nbsp;system 1st Self-Sovereign Identity-based App “Yidindji SSID” for Yidindji’s National ID&nbsp;system<p>We are delighted to announce that our first E-Government pilot program with the Sovereign Yidindji Government has been successfully completed on Jan 7,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The Sovereign Yidindji government is a representative of Sovereign Yidindji which is a rainforest-based micronation with several clan groups in the area described as far north Queensland on the Australian continent and it has a combined population of more than 150,000 Australian citizens and Yidindji citizens. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the planet. In 2014, history was made on September 20 as the official government of the Yidindji nation came into life with the launch of its coat of arms. Since then, the SYG, as it is known, has created several departments and its parliament continues to pass laws for the peace, order and good governance of the Yidindji territory. Currently, SYG has 17 ministers and 22 ministries and plans to be the first government to become fully digitized in its venture towards E-Governance and national ID&nbsp;system.</p><p>The purpose of this pilot program was to establish the world first fully blockchain-based E-Government. During the six-month pilot program, Sovereign Wallet Network(SWN) team has implemented the first self-sovereign identity-based national identity system to digitize all government services such as digital identity authentication, vaccination certificate, and digital administrative works.</p><p>We just finished our first step to open the gate for making governments become automated and fully compatible with each other country on top of MetaMUI Blockchain. MetaMUI Blockchain is the world’s first blockchain that every government and institution can issue their own digital currency while complying with all the financial legal conditions. MetaMUI Blockchain allows users to have their own Decentralized Identity(DID) and all the personal information of the users only stays inside the users’ device. Every ownership of the assets is bound to the identity of the user, not to the private key, therefore it can be recovered should the user lose the private key. This will make every bank adopt MetaMUI Blockchain to build a practical application for their customers and it will allow the customers borrow, lend and store their digital currency and digital assets through the&nbsp;app.</p><p>The Yidindji SSID and MetaMUI SSID will soon provide more functions such as storing various digital assets including NFTs, Carbon Credits, Stocks and even gold certificates. These 2 apps will also present a special feature called “Pairwise Trust”. Pairwise Trust is a two-way cryptographic binding system that enables users to login any websites without registering a new ID and password but only with DID. Users can also avoid phishing websites through its Pairwise Trust function because the two-cryptographic binding makes possible not only the users prove themselves to the website but also the website must prove itself to the users through the&nbsp;system.</p><p>More innovations will come through the year of 2022 and our journey has just begun. We are glad that we could deliver this wonderful news to our audience at the very first month of this year and we will keep building and developing our technology to make a better&nbsp;world.</p><p>Cointelegraph article:<br><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/metamui-and-sovereign-yidindji-government-launched-1st-self-sovereign-identity-based-national-id-system">https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/metamui-and-sovereign-yidindji-government-launched-1st-self-sovereign-identity-based-national-id-system</a></p><p>Sovereign Yidinji SSID Launch Video: <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjX1OysGbk4&amp;t=102s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjX1OysGbk4&amp;t=102s</a></p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism(CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

  <p>On an iPhone, when we log in to an app, we click a login button, and a website pops up to verify our credentials. Once verified, the website then redirects back to the app, and you are logged in. This familiar Single Sign-On (SSO) pattern is frequently referred to as the redirect flow for authentication. The use of a web browser for auth in this example is considered <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.txt">a “Best Current Practice”</a> for security and usability reasons.</p>

<p>However, in 2017, a new prompt appeared in the login flow, before you were taken to the website. The following screenshot came from an iOS app preparing to log you in with Facebook. The interface prompt informs you that a specific app, the Yelp app in this example, wants to use a specific website to sign you in, and it warns you about information sharing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are a couple of problems with this prompt:</p>

 
   
    <p>Problem One (Where did this prompt come from? ) : Many people consider this a bad user experience because the prompt looks out of place, and the wording is confusing and might alarm end users.</p>
   
   
    <p>Problem Two (Ambiguous UI message): If you implement logout functionality through the same flow, the prompt still says Sign In, even though the user may have already clicked a Logout button. This too is confusing to the end user, as shown in the following screenshot. This problem is reported as <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/255">a bug on the AppAuth library</a>, although it was designed as a security and privacy feature.</p>
   
 

<p></p>

<p>In this article, I’ll go into more detail on aspects of the iOS platform limitations. I’ll explain why this prompt is shown and how to get around it to build a more seamless user experience.</p>

<p>Specifically, this article will:</p>

 
   explain the evolution of iOS over time, and how and why this prompt was introduced. 
   describe various ways you can invoke a standalone or embedded browser on iOS, and explain the cookie-sharing behaviors. 
   discuss several ways to eliminate the confusing user experience issues we’ve identified above. 
 

 A brief history of iOS evolution 

<p>The browser options available for authentication  on an iOS device have changed significantly over the years, as Apple continues to add capabilities to enhance user privacy.  To understand the behavior of the browser options provided on iOS, some historical context is  helpful.</p>

 Authentication prior to iOS 9 

<p>Before the release of iOS 9 in 2015,  there were only two ways to authenticate through a web browser, and neither one was optimal.</p>

 
   
    <p><code>UIWebView</code>. This approach shows web content in a <code>UIView</code>. The mobile app can intercept interactions with the <code>UIView</code>,  hence it is not secure.</p>
   
   
    <p>Redirect to an external browser. The mobile app can open a webpage in a separate browser app, and the browser app can redirect back to the mobile app after authentication. However, app switching is not a good experience for mobile users. In addition, the redirect back can fail if another app has registered the same URL scheme first.</p>
   
 

 Authentication in iOS 9 (2015) 

<p>In 2015, Apple introduced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller"><code>SFSafariViewController</code></a>, which displays an embedded Safari browser in the app. As an in-app browser tab, this interface lets the user stay in the app. Once the user interaction with the website is no longer needed, the browser tab can be closed and dismissed.</p>

<p>This solution was groundbreaking, because it is secure (the native app can neither peek into the embedded browser, nor alter its state) and it provides a better user experience by avoiding app switching.</p>

<p><code>SFSafariViewController</code> shares cookies with the standalone Safari browser. This gives developers a way to implementSSO (Single Sign-On) with shared cookies..</p>

 iOS 11 changes (2017) 

<p>Apple changed <code>SFSafariViewController</code> behavior to address privacy concerns with the release of iOS 11 in 2017. <code>SFSafariViewController</code> no longer shares cookies with the standalone Safari browser. Thus, a website can no longer determine that the user on <code>SFSafariViewController</code> is the same user on Safari, even though the view controller and the browser are open on the same device.</p>

<p>Apple understood that  the <code>SFSafariViewController</code> behavior change would break SSO, since single sign-on relies on the ability to share cookies. Instead, Apple had to introduce <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> as a workaround, where <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> would share a persistent cookie with Safari.</p>

 Iterative changes in iOS 12 (2018) 

<p>In 2018, Apple deprecated <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code>, but introduced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession"><code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code></a> as a revised solution.</p>

<p>Both <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> and <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> are designed specifically for OAuth 2.0 authentication, not for showing general web content. To avoid abuse, when <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> or <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> are used, Apple always displays the prompt we saw earlier. The prompt is designed explicitly for user sign-in, and indicates that cookies are shared.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Apple does not know whether an <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> is invoked  for sign in, sign out, or general web browsing. This is why the prompt text is generic. It only states that your app is trying to Sign In, regardless of the actual use case, which results in the ambiguity described earlier in  Problem 2.</p>

 iOS 13 changes (2019) 

<p>In 2019, Apple introduced <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> as an option for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>. If this option is set to true, <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> does not show the prompt above, and as a consequence, it does not share cookies with Safari. This gives developers a choice. Either they gain  a better user experience with no confusing prompt and no SSO, or they get  SSO, along with the annoying prompt.</p>
 <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> or <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> behavior 
<p>The various browser options offer differing levels of cookie sharing in order to limit websites’  ability to track a user.</p>

<p>The cookie-sharing behavior is not well documented in Apple’s documentation. The  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller"><code>SFSafariViewController</code> doc</a> mentions that, “In iOS 9 and 10, it shares cookies and other website data with Safari … If you would like to share data between your app and Safari in iOS 11 and later, … use <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> instead.”</p>

<p>A few third-party websites extend Apple’s documentation to highlight that persistent cookies are shared between an embedded browser and Safari. Unfortunately, it is rarely known that session cookies can also be shared between different embedded browsers. If your application just needs SSO between your mobile apps, you do not have to use a persistent cookie; a session cookie is sufficient.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the complete sharing behavior in iOS 11 or later. I’ve omitted <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> for brevity because it is deprecated, but it behaves the same as <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>. I’ve also omitted the <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> option for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> because when it is set, cookies are not shared at all. 
I also use SVC as shorthand for <code>SFSafariViewController</code> and WAS as shorthand for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>.</p>

 

  
    
      
        &nbsp;
        APP1 + SVC
        App1 + WAS
        App2 + SVC
        App2 + WAS
        Safari
        Other browsers (ex.: Chrome)
      
    
    
      
        Session cookie
        ❌
        ✅
        ❌
        ✅
        ❌
        ❌

        ❌
        ✅
        ✅
        ❌
      
    
  

 

<p>In the following iOS cookie behavior demo video, you can see how the session cookie and the persistent cookie are shared. The session cookie sharing behavior is not intuitive. Even when App1 is closed (which should clear all session cookies), opening App2 would make it possible to see App1’s session cookie.</p>

 
            
         

<p>It is worth noting that in iOS 14 and later you can specify another browser, such as Chrome, as the default. This does not affect the sharing behavior. <code>SFSafariViewController</code> and <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> always use Safari under the hood, so they will never share cookies with browsers other than Safari, even if they are set as the default. The term system browser, often used in online articles, is synonymous with Safari.</p>

 Solution: how to remove the extra prompt 

<p>Now that we’ve reviewed the evolution of iOS browser behavior, and explored the rationale for the changes, let’s look at solutions to improve the user experience.</p>

 Solution to problem two 

<p>Solving problem two only – eliminating the ambiguity of the prompt message – is straightforward: Use the browser for sign-in only; do not use the browser to sign out. You can sign out of your application directly by revoking the access token and the refresh token. Okta provides a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/revoke-tokens/main/">revoke API</a> that you can call directly.</p>

<p>Revoking a token works as a solution if you are okay with signing the user out of the native app only. The user may still have a login session in the browser, and if the native app wants to log in again, the browser will not ask the user for credentials before granting an access token.</p>

<p>This is the recommended approach if your web session may be supporting many different native apps. For example, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/unity/reference/current/FB.Logout/">FB logout</a> specifically recommends not to log out of the web session.</p>

<p>However, if you require a stronger privacy and security posture, for instance for a banking app, keeping the web session alive may not be an option.</p>

 Solutions to problem one 

<p>There are two potential approaches to solve problem one.  Both solutions use browser components that do not show a prompt. Both have the drawback that no cookie can be shared, so SSO will not work. If your app requires SSO, you’ll have to find a new way to share login sessions. Fortunately, Okta recently introduced <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Native SSO</a>, which allows native apps to implement single sign-on without cookies. See our <a>blog post on SSO between mobile and desktop apps</a> for a full example. The following code shows how to remove the prompt, and it assumes your app either does not require SSO or uses Native SSO.</p>

<p>First, you can use the <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> option for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>. If you are using the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-ios">Okta OIDC iOS</a> library, you can configure the <code>noSSO</code> option as follows:</p>

   <code>let configuration = OktaOidcConfig(with: {YourOidcConfiguration})
if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
    configuration?.noSSO = true
}
</code>   

<p>Under the hood, the <code>noSSO</code> option sets the <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> flag. Note that this flag is only available in iOS 13 and above.</p>

<p>Second, if you desire to support older iOS versions, you could use <code>SFSafariViewController</code> as the browser to present the login session. The following demonstrates how to launch <code>SFSafariViewController</code> if you are using the <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS">AppAuth iOS</a> library.</p>

<p>AppAuth iOS supports a concept of external user agent, where you can use any browser to present the sign-in webpage. Normally, you invoke the following method to bring up a browser:</p>

   <code>OIDAuthState.authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest:presentingViewController:callback:
</code>   

<p>This method will invoke a default user agent. Alternatively, you can use the following method, which gives you an option to plug in any external user agent, as long as it conforms to the <code>OIDExternalUserAgent</code> protocol.</p>

   <code>OIDAuthState.authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest:presentingViewController:callback:
</code>   

<p>There is already an implementation of using <a href="https://gist.github.com/ugenlik/2a543f351e9b9425800b48266760dc85"><code>SFSafariViewController</code> as an external agent</a>. You can download it and plug it into your project. The following code snippet shows how to create and pass in an external user agent <code>OIDExternalUserAgentIOSSafariViewController</code>.</p>

   <code>let appDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate
let externalAgent = OIDExternalUserAgentIOSSafariViewController(presentingViewController: self)

appDelegate.currentAuthorizationFlow =
        OIDAuthState.authState(byPresenting: request, externalUserAgent: externalAgent) { authState, error in
    if let authState = authState {
        self.authState = authState
        print("Got authorization tokens. Access token: " +
              "\(authState.lastTokenResponse?.accessToken ?? "nil")")
    } else {
        print("Authorization error: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Unknown error")")
        self.authState = nil
    }
}
</code>   

 Summary 

<p>Understanding iOS and Android platform-level constraints is a prerequisite for developing great mobile experiences. I hope this article will help you understand the browser options available on iOS and their cookie sharing behaviors.</p>

<p>At Okta, we are adamant about optimizing end-user experience. Every extra click needs to be eliminated if possible, and every extraneous prompt should be avoided. We develop solutions such as Native SSO to help you overcome mobile constraints. I hope our solution helps you improve the experiences you are building for your end users. We’d love to hear more about your needs and how we can build solutions together. Feel free to add your questions and suggestions about this solution or future topics in the comments below.</p>

<p>A few keen-eyed readers pointed out that I never wrote a follow-up article on last year’s DevCamp. They’re absolutely right; all I wrote since the start was this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-more-holochain-releases/#devcamp-8">small update</a> halfway through the course. It’s time to write something!</p><p>As you may have heard, over 1800 people signed up for the DevCamp, which amazed us all. This was a huge increase from the previous DevCamp’s roughly <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/speedy-improved-holochain-release-unblocks-all-the-things/#register-for-devcamp-7">200</a> registrants. More and more people are hearing about Holochain, among them developers who may go on to create some really wonderful apps.</p><p>I’m so grateful to the DevCamp organisers. I think they did a fantastic job presenting a pretty demanding subject to a huge group of people, all online and spread out across time zones. They facilitated with enthusiasm, structure, patience, and compassion. This was a big project, and they faced it courageously and skillfully. (Did you know that they were all volunteers, doing it simply because they love the project?)</p><p>The organisers did have some selection criteria to make sure it would be a rewarding experience for participants — this was, after all, meant to train people to build Holochain apps, so it probably would only be useful to people who intended to build Holochain apps. Roughly 1000 of the registrants were selected for participation, and roughly 400 enrolled once they were accepted.</p><p>Over the course of the DevCamp’s two-month schedule, we did see a drop in participation. Live session attendance dropped by 67% between the beginning and the end of the course. This might sound disappointing, but it’s actually quite good — various studies say online courses see from <a href="http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html">85%</a> to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2019/01/16/study-offers-data-show-moocs-didnt-achieve-their-goals">97%</a> dropout rate. This shows that an above-average number of people committed themselves to learning a pretty demanding subject.</p><p>Not knowing why individual participants decided to leave, I have some guesses: some may have found the course load or meeting times didn’t work for their schedules, others may have decided that Rust or Holochain development wasn’t for them, and still others may simply have joined because they wanted to learn a little bit about the project but not develop an app.</p><p>Some Holo team members helped with the DevCamp too, which gave us the opportunity to do some research. We learned a few important things:</p>  People don’t get interested in Holochain simply because it solves a technical problem for them. Instead, they get involved because they believe in the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/what-holochain/">values</a> it represents — agency, accountability, privacy, cooperation, voluntary participation. They want to join a movement, not just use a piece of tech.  Holochain’s community is unique among open-source communities — it seems stronger, more closely knit and supportive, with passionate people who are willing to give their time to help newcomers. (The DevCamp organisers are a case in point!) Reputation revolves around commitment to helping others grow, rather than crowing about one’s accomplishments.  It’s not just one ‘community’ either — there are many communities who value slightly different things or are focused on different aspects of the project. There are a lot of different perspectives about what matters. In a way, the tech and the social structures mirror each other.  DevCamps are a special way to experience the health of the community — it might be that the community is the most valuable part, because they create a supportive space for learners and help them become part of the Holochain community at large. The Discord server, in particular, was a great addition to DevCamp 8, and resulted in a lot more active conversations than the <a href="https://forum.holochain.org">forum</a> had had in previous DevCamps.  There’s a steep learning curve. Not only is Rust a new language for most, but Holochain is quite different from either cloud or blockchain. Many DevCamp participants had already participated in a DevCamp but wanted to reinforce or refresh their knowledge. The strong, supportive community also helps people gather the courage to meet this challenge.  Many participants feel like there was still so much to learn by the end of the course. In fact, we learned that some had already participated in a DevCamp and wanted a refresher. This reinforces what we learned about the learning curve, and suggests that a community, ongoing events, and self-serve resources for alumni would be useful.  Not everybody can participate in a DevCamp or online learning community. Time constraints — busy life or time zone differences — are the biggest barriers. Most people participated asynchronously, replaying the recorded session videos and chatting on Discord. We would do well to develop more self-serve resources for those people. (Fortunately, the organisers have published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuXrtFJO6zVMOMiqt0iOvwGtEba470wi">all of DevCamp 8’s session videos</a> on YouTube, which is a great start!)  Session 1 of the DevCamp Holochain 0.0.122: big gossip performance improvements <p>Most of the recent Holochain releases have been maintenance releases.</p><blockquote>But today’s release brings big New Year news. I’ve been looking forward to sharing this one!</blockquote><p>Recently one of the core developers has been troubleshooting a performance bottleneck we saw in the Elemental Chat tests. Gossiped DHT ops were being integrated at a rate of 40 per second, which seemed unusually slow because it didn’t involve a lot of processing.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with the mechanics of the DHT, here’s how it works: when an agent commits an element to their source chain, it results in the creation of a number of DHT operations. These operations are messages, sent to peers on the DHT, that update their local DHT shard. Here’s an example of the ops produced by a ‘create app entry’ element:</p>  A <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.StoreElement"><code>StoreElement</code></a> operation stores the header in the neighbourhood of the new header’s hash.  A <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.StoreEntry"><code>StoreEntry</code></a> operation stores the entry, and a copy of the header, in the neighbourhood of the new entry’s hash.  Finally, a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.RegisterAgentActivity"><code>RegisterAgentActivity</code></a> operation stores a copy of the header in the neighbourhood of the author’s public key, allowing those authorities to detect source chain forks or serve up source chain segments to other validators.  <p>Each of these operations has to be ‘integrated’ by the authorities in the neighbourhood — that is, validated and stored in their DHT shard. This happens initially, at publish time, when the author first sends out these operations. But it also happens on an ongoing basis, as new peers join the DHT and start building their shard, or as peers disappear and cause remaining peers to increase their coverage. These peers share this information through gossip, which happens at regular intervals — more frequently for new data, less frequently for historical data.</p><p>In the Elemental Chat tests, the historical data gossip loop was slowing down HoloPorts. Part of this was because sharding wasn’t yet turned on, which meant that everybody gossiped everything with everybody else. But that ended up being a great way to catch this performance problem.</p><p>The solution was to optimise the table that stores the operations, along with the queries that manipulate it (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1167">#1167</a>). Now, operations are integrated at a rate of 1000 per second — a 25× increase!</p><p>There are other changes you should know about as a developer:</p>  The conductor API lets you manually insert elements into a source chain. This will be used to build source chain redundancy for Holo hosting, as well as source chain backup and restore for natively installed Holochain instances. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1166">#1166</a>)  Breaking: The <code>Path</code> abstraction for working with links has changed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1156">#1167</a>)  Breaking: You can now query a source chain by ranges — either between two sequence numbers, between two hashes, or the most recent element plus a certain number of preceding elements. All range queries are inclusive. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1142">#1142</a>)  The above breaking changes mean that Holochain 0.0.122 is compatible with <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.118/hdk/">HDK 0.0.118</a>.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#20220106093622">Read the full changelog</a>.</p><p>That’s the news from the start of 2022. I’m looking forward to sharing more this year as our projects move towards beta status and see wider adoption among developers!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@tegan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Tegan Mierle</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/camp?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the launch of <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops on GlobaliD</a>.</p><p>Every crypto project faces the same challenge: How to strategically or fairly distribute tokens to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>A common practice is called an airdrop — giving away tokens to users who qualify for certain terms or accomplish certain tasks. For example, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, created one billion governance tokens and airdropped 15% of them to anyone who had used the protocol up to that point — 400 UNI tokens in total, at the time, worth about&nbsp;$2000.</p><p>Airdrops are a great way to distribute tokens to your most active and engaged users while also helping to promote and market the&nbsp;project.</p><p>But as airdrops have gained in popularity and prominence — and with significant money at stake — these distributions are increasingly vulnerable to people gaming the system, undermining their equity and effectiveness. When bots sabotage your airdrop, it compromises the strategic intent of the token distribution.</p><p>For any project, the goal is to reach engaged users that are real people. Naturally, that extends to NFT drops, DeFi platforms, and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) as&nbsp;well.</p> Trusted Airdrops <p>By introducing self-sovereign identity to airdrops, you can now guarantee that real people receive tokens rather than bots in a privacy preserving way. It’s the natural symbiosis between decentralized finance and decentralized identity.</p><p>With GlobaliD’s Trusted Airdrops, developers can quickly and easily verify that wallets belong to real&nbsp;people.</p><p>Users that receive airdrops can conveniently verify themselves and participate in exciting new projects without compromising ownership or control over their identity or their data. GlobaliD never sees users’ private data, which is encrypted and decentralized.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/why-self-sovereign-identity-matters-8fd2c982ca2e">Learn more about why self-sovereign identity&nbsp;matters</a>  <p>The process is simple and straightforward:</p>  Developers create a signup link for their airdrop through&nbsp;GlobaliD  Recipients follow the link to verify their&nbsp;identity  Recipients add a wallet and get their&nbsp;drop  <p>You can learn more about the process&nbsp;here:</p>  <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>For projects building on XRPL, they can leverage <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-globalid-enhances-trust-for-xrpl-labs-xumm-wallet-d397cc836cf7">GlobaliD’s native integration with XUMM Wallet</a>, the most popular XRP wallet in the ecosystem that boasts over 200,000 active&nbsp;users.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs/status/1410301192702410757">How to verify your XUMM Wallet with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>It’s also incredibly cool to see the many projects come up with hacky solutions for custom needs.

In just the last few weeks, we’ve seen dozens of projects choose GlobaliD through word of&nbsp;mouth.</p><p>In order to meet and address that demand, we’re actively working toward improving our documentation and developer support. That starts with the <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops</a> landing page, but it’s just the beginning.</p><p>It’s also just the tip of the iceberg for what’s possible with GlobaliD and the entire suite of tools available for developers. That includes GlobaliD Groups for building communities as well as the GlobaliD Wallet for payments.</p><p>We’ve also been working with a handful of DeFi organizations to address some of their biggest challenges — all while maintaining the decentralized spirit of their platform.</p><p>That includes:</p>  ID verification for compliance (Green DeFi or&nbsp;XeFi)  Elimination of bots, scams, and bad actors on the&nbsp;network  Protecting their master nodes and protocols  <p>So stay tuned for more exciting releases in the very near future (including a noncustodial wallet) as we look to make self-sovereign identity more useful for more&nbsp;people.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-globalid-enhances-trust-for-xrpl-labs-xumm-wallet-d397cc836cf7">How GlobaliD enhances trust for XRPL Labs’ XUMM&nbsp;Wallet</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/trusted-airdrops-with-globalid-cf7cd6b51797">Trusted Airdrops with GlobaliD</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The online sports betting market in Ontario, Canada is seeing rapid expansion after lawmakers passed a bill (C-218) in June 2021, removing the prohibition of single-game betting in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This bill allows players to make single bets, rather than the previously allowed combination-only betting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result of this bill is hugely increased flexibility for both operators and bettors, as single bets make up a sizable portion of gambling activity and are some of the simplest to both place and offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sports betting regulation in Canada comes down to local governments, with each province having authority over the regulations in their jurisdiction and Ontario is no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Key iGaming Regulations in Ontario&nbsp; 



<p>In July 2021, shortly after the passing of C-218, Ontario created iGaming Ontario (iGO) – a body to conduct and manage iGaming in Ontario, serving directly as a subsidiary of the pre-existing Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of iGaming Ontario is to enter into agreements with operators, allowing them to offer online gaming experiences to residents of Ontario, so long as they are compliant with the new legal code and provincial law. One of the four iGO and AGCO’s market objectives is Consumer protection quoted on <a href="https://igamingontario.ca/en">IGO website</a> are 3 bullet points:&nbsp;</p>



  Ensure safe and responsible play, and game integrity&nbsp;  Prevent underage access  Ensure compliance by private operators with applicable laws, including compliance with anti-money laundering rules and regulations and compliance with relevant privacy and information security laws&nbsp;  



<p>A full list of <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a> details what is expected of operators and what kind of rules and regulations are being enforced for iGaming in Ontario. These are largely based on existing standards of Ontario’s regulatory body, AGCO, and there are some key things to note for operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canada’s iGaming sector is also subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC). Although, iGaming Ontario has established a strict set of regulations, which go beyond the basic FINTRAC requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, there are a strict set of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and know your customer (KYC) requirements. Operators are required to maintain internal AML operating procedures that comply with Canadian federal regulatory requirements, which include a wide range of rules and regulations, such as reporting suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there are detailed KYC requirements in place, such as in-depth identity verification standards. This means players will have to provide official government documents, recent photos (or selfies), and liveness (such as a video) to verify their identity during the registration process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Becoming Compliant With Ontario’s iGaming Regulations&nbsp; 



<p>Considering the depth and complexity of iGaming requirements in Ontario, entering the region as an operator may prove to be difficult. Operators will have to meet strict PCMLTFA and FINTRAC standards, as well as go above and beyond those to meet iGaming Ontario-specific regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key barriers will also include meeting iGO’s AML and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC</a> program requirements, which could require operators to complete overhauls of data storage, tracking, and verification systems. This is something that has already been a hot topic around the world, with more and more regulators calling for stricter iGaming systems and regulations. A good example of this were <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/german-online-gambling-regulations/">the changes for operators in Germany</a> which was challenging to say the least. Having experienced partners in a situation like this will be key to success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One solution to overcoming this is working with an identity verification partner like IDnow. As an identity verification specialist, IDnow has the experience and tools to aid operators in entering new markets. This is done with the help of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">Autoident</a> – an AI-powered verification tool that quickly and securely verifies users identities, while being completely AML compliant.</p>







<p>Autoident is very well suited to the FINTRAC standard set by Ontario, already supporting verification processes that include Document verification, selfie and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">liveness detection</a>, while also being backed by an experienced team with years of success and experience, globally in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">iGaming</a> industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there are also other ways to become compliant with Ontario’s regulations, such as adjusting things like the onboarding process, looking at AML reporting requirements, and much more that is required by iGO. Depending on an operator’s current systems, this could be an expensive and time-consuming process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whichever way operators choose to tackle Ontario’s regulatory climate, it will be a complicated and tough battle to become compliant in a reasonable timeframe. </p>



<p>However, utilizing an identity verification partner to help smoothen the bumps in the road and provide a guiding hand will prove to be an incredible advantage. KYC and AML should not be a burden but an enabler for your success.&nbsp;</p>

				  Helen Garneau joins the Hyperledger Foundation as Vice Chair of the Marketing Committee and Trevor Butterworth joins the Steering Committee of the Covid Credentials Initiative.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>, an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies hosted at the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>, has welcomed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helengarneau/">Helen Garneau</a>, Chief Marketing Officer of <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> as Vice Chair of its Marketing Committee.</p>
<p>This is the second leadership role for Indicio in recent months at a Linux Foundation Project. In December, Vice President of Governance, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorwbutterworth/">Trevor Butterworth</a>, was elected to the Steering Committee for the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.org/">COVID Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI), a part of <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH), the leading organization for hosting and nurturing open-source technology for the benefit of public health initiatives.</p>
<p>Garneau has an extensive track record in implementing successful marketing strategies for a range of Hyperledger Foundation projects, including <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>,<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/aries"> Hyperledger Aries</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>. She also played a key role in project launches and the growth of Hyperledger communities.</p>
<p>As Vice Chair of the Marketing Committee, Garneau is committed to broadening Hyperledger’s membership base during her one-year term.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to be named vice-chair of the Hyperledger Foundation Marketing Committee alongside Chair, Duncan Johnston-Watt, CEO &amp; Co-founder at Blockchain Technology Partners (BTP),” said Garneau. “One of the things I enjoy most&nbsp; in the Hyperledger community has been seeing the technology, use cases, and contributions from other members and companies. The dollars that companies put into their Hyperledger Foundation membership are valuable and I’ve seen the return in business growth first hand. The Hyperledger marketing team does an incredible job and I look forward to helping articulate that value proposition in my role as Vice-Chair.” </p>
<p>Butterworth was already involved in Linux Foundation Public Health as Chair of the Steering Group for the Cardea Project, an open-source ecosystem built on Hyperledger Indy&nbsp; and Hyperledger Aries for digital health credentials developed by Indicio and SITA and donated to LFPH.</p>
<p>“At Indicio, we are at the front end of building and implementing digital health credentials with commercial partners—and our success in this area, in open-sourcing the results, and in creating a community of developers to extend functionality is a win for both the Hyperledger Foundation and Linux Foundation Public Health,” said Butterworth. “Joining the Covid Credentials Initiative will help us learn from its experts, build better products, and drive adoption of technology that is sustainable and solves fundamental problems in privacy and security.”</p>
<p>Indicio is both a member and active contributor to the Hyperledger Foundation and Linux Foundation Public Health and has taken a significant leadership role in the open sourcing of a number of technologies. Among others, Indicio has helped lead the development and contributions to several projects at Linux Foundation including:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-monitor">Hyperledger Indy Node Monitor</a> (August 2020): A set of tools for monitoring the status of Hyperledger Indy networks.

Malcolm, whose experience has spanned over three decades across strategy, technology, operations, and risk and compliance will join <a href="https://shyft.network/">Shyft</a> Network to lead Veriscope while also acting as the Head of Strategy for Global Regulatory &amp; Compliance Solutions.</p><p>He will be responsible for the expansion of Veriscope, the open source Travel Rule protocol built on the Shyft network, for leading strategy and growth for upcoming ecosystem infrastructure that includes Shyft’s Cross-chain Institutional DeFi System &amp; the Shyft DAO’s regulatory and compliance solutions, and&nbsp;more.</p> BitMEX to&nbsp;Shyft <p>Malcolm is joining the Shyft Network Core team from BitMEX, one of the world’s leading crypto derivatives exchanges.

This is very much aligned to my own desire to provide the governance foundations upon which responsible innovators can design impactful, transformational, successful solutions.”</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/bitmex-compliance-chief-malcolm-wright-jumps-to-shyft-network/">BitMEX Compliance Chief Malcolm Wright Jumps to Shyft Network (coindesk.com)</a></p> Shared beliefs <p>Joseph Weinberg, Co-founder of Shyft Network said: “Over the last 3+ years a group of incredible individuals have been working to guide policy and educate regulators across this space. Malcolm and I were among several of that group who share a belief that decentralization and maintaining the ecosystem is critical to its foundational success.</p><blockquote>“As Malcolm and the policy side of Shyft had already been working together, both in his capacity at BitMEX, and through policy development across regulators, bringing on Malcolm to drive this next phase of institutional development &amp; growth was a 1+1 = 6 equation.</blockquote><blockquote>“We began working on Shyft Network &amp; its public infrastructure out of a belief that we can apply the open innovations built from within the ecosystem to bridge the gap between the traditional world’s regulatory &amp; compliance requirements, identity &amp; decentralized economies without eroding privacy, decentralization &amp; openness.</blockquote><blockquote>“As these two worlds collide and we see rapid acceleration in both regulatory requirements, as well as adoption, we also need the best and brightest people who continue to bring balance for the ecosystem to be driving critical infrastructure like Veriscope &amp; other public utilities for the new market participants who need identity-based compliance capabilities to operate across all verticals. Malcolm’s deep expertise across the space, from policy makers, to Open Standards, as well as his vast experience prior to entering crypto, makes him an excellent person to lead all compliance related aspects of the public utility smart contracts that the Shyft Core team developed for the Shyft network.”</blockquote> Leading role <p>In this role, Malcolm will be tasked with leading the Veriscope teams both inside of Shyft Core, and across all VASPs &amp; Travel rule solutions that are globally utilizing or contributing to the public network, while also managing the open governance task force responsible for proposing policy changes across the counterparty processes that are universal to Veriscope through the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Along with this, Malcolm will lead all regulatory compliance &amp; institutional strategy for upcoming extension systems of Veriscope that includes universal cross chain layers for Institutional Defi, NFT’s, DAO’s and&nbsp;more.</p><p>As Shyft Network is an open source project, and it’s infrastructure is being deployed to open source, Malcolm’s work will focus across regulators, institutions currently joining Veriscope, the Shyft DAO &amp; continued open standards development across the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>Malcolm will be tasked with designing and documenting the frameworks and critical policy requirements across Shyft Network’s products and maintain his already impressive status as an industry thought leader recognized by virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and financial institutions.</p><p>On behalf of the Core team, the Shyft Community, Veriscope’s open Network of VASPs&amp; institutions, and all developers building atop of Shyft Network, We are excited to welcome Malcolm to the Community</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems.

  皆さんこんにちは! Hi everyone! I’m Jagna Nieuważny and I have been at Coinfirm for almost 4 months! Those months have proved a steep learning curve as before joining the team I possessed only a very general knowledge of how blockchains work and an even fuzzier knowledge of crypto markets and regulations. But thanks to the help...

 Web3Auth raises $13M Series A to drive mass adoption on Web3 applications and wallets via simple, non-custodial authentication infrastructure  Led by Sequoia Capital India with participants such as Union Square Ventures and Multicoin Capital, the Series A funding round advances our mission to eliminate seed phrases and make blockchain authentication decentralized and accessible to&nbsp;all. <p>We are excited to announce that we have raised $13M led by Sequoia Capital India, Union Square Ventures, Multicoin and others, to drive mass adoption in Web3 through simple, secure, and non-custodial auth infrastructure for apps and wallets. The round follows demonstrable success, with our infrastructure securing over 1M monthly users and 8M keys, on wallets and applications such as Binance Extension Wallet, Ubisoft, Kukai, Skyweaver, and more. We are also proud to reveal Web3Auth, which kickstarts the decentralization of the Torus&nbsp;Network.</p><p>The Series A was raised with additional participation from FTX, Bitcoin.com, DARMA Capital, Chainstry, Hash, KOSMOS Capital, Kyros Ventures, LD Capital, Minted Labs, P2P Capital, Phoenix VC, Staking Facilities, YBB Capital, Moonwhale Ventures, and Decentralab.</p><p>For those who don’t know us, the Torus team (now specifically more known as <a href="https://web3auth.io">Web3Auth</a>) have been working on improving onboarding and non-custodial key management in the crypto space. A critical problem that quantifiably has contributed to the loss of nearly 20% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Fear of loss and unfamiliarity of keys/seed phrases presents a significant barrier to entry that deters non-technical users from exploring Web3 and participating in the ecosystem.</p> Introducing Web3Auth <p>Web3Auth is simple, non-custodial auth infrastructure for Web3 wallets and applications. For your crypto native users Web3Auth makes them feel right at home, allowing them to connect or use their key management of choice, be it Metamask, Phantom, Ledger and so on. For new users developers can use Web3Auth to build intuitive login flows, such as single sign-on with Google and Twitter, eliminating the need for users to directly interface with vulnerable public-private key&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>Under the hood, Web3Auth’s mainstream UX is powered by the Torus Network (which Torus now refers exclusively to), it enables users to use multiple factors to access their wallet, leveraging on existing things a user has to secure these factors. These include their social login, existing devices, backups/passwords and in the future even family. This immediately improves on the existing key management standard of seed phrases, which is essentially a single point of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>For those who have known Torus before Web3Auth, Web3Auth consolidates our existing products, and draws a clear distinction between the products we build and the underlying infrastructure, allowing us to take further steps towards further decentralizing this infrastructure. Moving forward, the Torus Network will refer to the underlying infrastructure that supports our products, and Web3Auth will refer to the one stop pluggable product that Web3 apps/wallets know &amp;&nbsp;love.</p><p>Developers can integrate Web3Auth into their application just with a couple lines of code and allow users to connect to any blockchain. And can start&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">here</a>.</p><p>Apart from the initial connection, Web3Auth also provides:</p>  Customizable UI / even fully whitelabel  Plugging in your own existing auth and user&nbsp;base  Fiat-to-crypto aggregator, so users can also choose the best fiat-to-crypto provider for your application and the user’s&nbsp;region.  Incremental security and better redundancy, which drastically reduces support tickets for mainstream users.  Broad platform support, including SDKs for iOS, Android, React Native and&nbsp;Unity.   What will happen to existing users/developers and the Torus&nbsp;Network? <p>Existing users and developers on our current products (i.e. CustomAuth, OpenLogin, Torus Wallet) do not have to do anything, and they can be rest assured that these products will continue to be developed and supported as they are used as components of Web3Auth. No action is required from developers or end-users.</p><p>We will continue working on the underlying infrastructure to improve efficiency and security, but the priority for us is to further decentralize the Torus Network. This means major improvements to the capability for new nodes to join and leave the Torus Network, as well as additional features that formalize the interactions between dApps and nodes. Stay tuned for more updates on this over the next few&nbsp;months!</p><p>As usual, we’re always hiring and if you’re interested in solving some of the hardest problems in this industry, we welcome you to apply. If you’re an application or wallet looking to use Web3Auth, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@web3auth.io">hello@web3auth.io</a>, and let’s&nbsp;discuss!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-raises-13m-series-a-to-drive-mass-adoption-on-web3-applications-and-wallets-via-simple-948b6008cdb5">Web3Auth raises $13M Series A to drive mass adoption on Web3 applications and wallets via simple…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Highlights <p>The <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-2022-roadmap-a0036cd72f1b">Ontology 2022 Roadmap</a> has been officially released. Our goal for 2022 is to make the Ontology high-speed, low-cost, public blockchain, the blockchain of choice for Web3 applications. We are working hard to develop a more diverse and prosperous Ontology ecosystem. Ontology’s efforts in creating interoperability between the different public chains, including Ethereum with the upcoming Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) launch, will provide the opportunity to incubate more high-quality Web3 applications in the new year, across a multitude of industries and services. Ontology will continue to vigorously develop ONT ID, ONTO, and other products, making Web3 available to everyone. Ontology is proud to be part of this rapidly changing landscape and is excited to share more updates in the future. Here’s to another year exploring the future together.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet. Developers are welcome to conduct various application tests. Related documents can be obtained at the <a href="https://docs.ont.io/">Ontology Developer Center</a>.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the ONT and ONG decimals and we are 75% done with&nbsp;testing.  We are 72% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.  We are 53% done with the truebit challenge design&nbsp;survey.  We are 22% done with the Rollup VM&nbsp;design.   Product Development   ONTO App v4.1.5 was released, bringing support for Avalanche and NFTs on OEC, as well as FIO address registration and&nbsp;binding.  ONTO is hosting its very own <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1479362169737302018">NFT ONTOvaganza</a>. This event rewards NFT holders from previous ONTO events with more NFTs. Each NFT comes with a different ONG airdrop quota and rights. Top winners can get up to 1,000 ONG from this event. The event is in progress, and the claiming of NFTs will end at 21:00 (Singapore time) on January 15th. Don’t forget to open ONTO and claim your&nbsp;NFT!  ONTO is hosting a campaign with <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1479800051132100608">Parking Infinity</a>. Participants who complete related tasks have the opportunity to earn rewards. The event is in progress, with more than 1,100 participants.  ONTO hosted an NFT Giveaway campaign with <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1478712890773450760">MetaYoka</a>. Participants who completed related tasks had the opportunity to earn NFT rewards. The event has successfully concluded, with more than 2,000 participants.  ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1477263336899108868">HyperJump</a>. Participants who completed all the tasks had the opportunity to earn rewards. The event has successfully concluded, with more than 1,000 participants.   On-Chain Activity   123 total dApps on MainNet as of January 10th,&nbsp;2022.  6,856,727 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 18,420 from last&nbsp;week.  16,928,849 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 75,643 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   5,539 new members joined our global community this week. Over the past four years, Ontology Harbingers have always been our most dedicated supporters, driving the growth of the global community. We welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join us</a> to experience and promote a more decentralized future together with Ontology.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1471563278023217152?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “EVMs”. The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022. The EVM aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform, and offer an inclusive experience to developers and users. The new VM will join a suite of existing VMs, which include the Native (Ontology) VM, NeoVM, and WasmVM. Community members believe that this is a crucial step in the realization of the Ontology Multi-VM. It adds to the opportunities provided by the WasmVM, which allows more traditional developers to deploy apps on the blockchain.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about ENS, including its application scenarios, how to participate in the ecology, and more. Community members discussed the differences between Ontology DID and ENS. For example, ENS currently focuses more on associated addresses, while DID focuses on a wider range of information and is more inclined to personal&nbsp;data.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Gizmodo — 《<a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-is-web-3-and-why-should-you-care-1848204799">What Is Web3 and Why Should You&nbsp;Care?</a>》</p><p>“In recent months, you may have come across a phrase growing in popularity: Web3. You might be wondering what it is, what it will mean for the future, and how exactly the third-generation internet differs from the first two. And now the dawn of Web3 is upon us. People define it in a few different ways, but at its core is the idea of decentralization, which we’ve seen with cryptocurrencies (key drivers of Web3). Key to this decentralization is blockchain technology, which creates publicly visible and verifiable ledgers of record that can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. The blockchain already underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as a number of fledging technologies, and it’s tightly interwoven into the future vision of everything that Web3 promises. The idea is that everything you do, from shopping to social media, is handled through the same secure processes, with both more privacy and more transparency baked&nbsp;in.”</p><p>Ontology has worked on bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through providing decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions. From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not changed. 2021 draws to a close and 2022 promises to bring us closer to Web3 than ever before. Four years of work has positioned Ontology as a leader in the space, through the development of products focused on DID and data, and by taking a Multi-VM approach.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>With millions of people boarding flights every day, customer data and experiences are the most important elements to the travel industry. As airports increasingly ramp up to meet the digital age, they are more prone to cyberattacks and data breaches. One such incident occurred when <a href="https://www.airport-technology.com/features/five-times-airports-were-involved-in-cyberattacks-and-data-breaches/">Heathrow airport</a> was fined £120,000 when they lost sensitive data stored on a memory stick, which included the Queen’s travel history and passport numbers.</p>



<p>To prevent such data leaks in the future and avoid heavy fines, airports are constantly evolving and adapting biometric security in airports.</p>



 Why Are Biometrics Used in Airports? 



<p>The technology associated with air travel has advanced considerably in recent years. Biometrics for airports have provided passengers with a faster, safer end-to-end experience. It may go unnoticed at first but biometric technology is used widely in airports. Be it filling your visa application from the comfort of your home or automated barrier control at the airports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biometrics for airports can provide a contactless experience using facial recognition for the ease of passengers and to meet growing concerns around health concerns with contact methods. Biometric technology can identify individuals, measuring dozens of physical attributes, such as fingerprint, voice recognition, and facial recognition, among others.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Biometrics for airports can be used for security checks, luggage, boarding, and check-in facilities. Implementing biometrics at airports helps automate the verification process, and sharing a digital identity can expedite the immigration process.</p>



 Benefits of Using Biometric for Airports 



<p>Biometric authentication and its use cases in the travel industry and airports provide several advantages including:</p>



 High Security 



<p>Biometrics provide increased levels of security to the airlines that the person is truly who they claim to be. The identification is done by tangible and real-world traits that relate to the passenger. Nearly any username, passwords, and PINs can be compromised, and a data breach can leak sensitive information to the hackers.&nbsp;</p>



 Improved User Experience 



<p>The internal implementation of biometric technology may be difficult, but it provides a smooth user experience to passengers at the airport. Placing a finger on a scanner and getting border access is much easier and fast than going through the long processes of physical verification.&nbsp;</p>



 Non-Transferable and Unique 



<p>Every individual has a unique set of biometrics which are impossible to duplicate with current technology. Also, biometrics are not transferable. The only way to access biometric data at airports is through the physical application.&nbsp;</p>



 4 Biometric Technologies Used at Airports 



<p>There are currently four biometric technologies being used at airports. These include:</p>



 Facial Recognition 



<p>Facial recognition identifies facial features such as distance between eyes, eye shape, nose shape, and more, through stored facial patterns and data to find a match. Facial recognition enhances security, is contactless, and is easy to integrate.&nbsp;</p>



 Fingerprint Recognition 



<p>Fingerprint recognition automatically identifies someone based on a comparison between a stored and live fingerprint. Fingerprint recognition is one of the most popular biometrics and is being implemented at airports all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



 Iris Recognition 



<p>Iris scanning or <a href="https://imageware.io/the-eyes-have-it-what-is-iris-recognition">iris recognition</a> is the process of using infrared light to take a high contrast image of your iris. Similar to fingerprints, iris patterns are unique to each individual and provide exceptional accuracy. Iris recognition is another contactless biometric method which is considered to be one of the most accurate.</p>



 Palm Recognition 



<p>Palm recognition evaluates the unique patterns and characteristics in the palms of an individual’s hands. The systems use a scanning device that processes data from a digital photo of an individual’s hand and compares it to the stored biometric template in the database. Many airports have started deploying palm recognition as a part of their authentication processes.&nbsp;</p>



 Biometric Solutions for Airports with Imageware 



<p>Imageware develops identity solutions that can provide comprehensive and easy-to-use applications to create inviolable photo identification and access credentials. With Imageware’s solutions, you can strengthen your biometric security for airports by:</p>

 Web3Auth has allowed Binance Smart Chain users to seamlessly create and manage their extension wallets with their Social&nbsp;Accounts  About Binance Chain Extension Wallet&nbsp;(BEW) <p>Binance Chain Extension Wallet is the official Binance cryptocurrency wallet for accessing Binance Smart Chain, Binance Chain, and Ethereum. The extension allows users to securely store crypto and connect to thousands of projects across different blockchains. It currently supports Chrome, Firefox, and&nbsp;Brave.</p> The Story Behind the Integration <p>Key management is a long-standing problem in crypto. Users have lost crypto worth over $150bn (Worth more than even GDPs of several nations) due to inefficient management of their private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem knew how important it was to make key management and onboarding easy for mainstream crypto adoption. Especially with the increase in the adoption of decentralized apps, mismanagement of private keys was rampant leading to significant financial loss.</p> The search for a perfect non-custodial key management solution <p>To fix this — the BSC community started considering multiple private key management solutions. Few solutions had made significant progress in streamlining the user onboarding experience but had long been plagued by the trilemma of sacrificing security or redundancy for convenience. Many of these systems also had points of centralization that reduced censorship resistance.</p><p>They were then introduced to Web3Auth.</p> Onboarding thousands of users through&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Binance chain Extension Wallet (BEW) introduced a new seamless and secure user onboarding process through Web3Auth in early 2021 and has since onboarded hundreds of thousands of users into the BEW&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Designed with a simple and straightforward user experience for mainstream users, the onboarding includes OAuth logins, key management that reduces account loss while retaining the non-custodial guarantees that the decentralized ecosystem requires.</p> How Web3Auth handles users’ private&nbsp;keys <p>Web3Auth is a model of threshold key management that solves the trilemma without sacrificing user experience while retaining end-user autonomy and security. The model implements the Shamir Secret Shares (SSS) scheme using the user’s device, private input, and wallet service provider.</p><p>The user’s private key is split into multiple factors, and these split factors are used to reconstruct the original encrypted secret key. Like 2FA systems, as long as the user has access to 2 out of 3 of their factors, they will be able to retrieve their private key and gain access to the&nbsp;wallet.</p> BEW — Web3Auth pave the way for crypto’s&nbsp;future <p>BEW’s partnership with Web3Auth ensures that no user in the future will ever lose access to their valuable Cryptos just because they forgot or misplaced their private keys. This revolutionary approach paves the way for the mainstream adoption of cryptos across the industry.

 Kukai: A go-to wallet for leading NFT projects on&nbsp;Tezos  About Kukai <p>Kukai is the longest-running web-based Tezos wallet. It allows you to manage your tokens, NFTs and digital assets in a single easy-to-use and secure platform. As a Tezos wallet, Kukai includes the ability to store, transfer and delegate your Tezos (XTZ) tokens, so you can easily receive XTZ rewards through staking. Kukai supports the fast-growing Tezos ecosystem with features like an NFT gallery, DeFi token support and more. Kukai has been pivotal to the success of Ubisoft, HicEtNunc, OneOf, and other notable NFT launches.</p> The Origin <p>The origin of Kukai goes back to 2018 when it was started as an open-source community project. The team spent the initial days figuring out the technical aspects and focused on security. Once the tech was sorted and the wallet started gaining traction — the team realized how the onboarding experience was integral to achieving their goals of acquiring millions of mainstream users.</p><p>That’s when Web3Auth came into the&nbsp;picture.</p> Deciding on&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Kukai discovered Web3Auth at the perfect time when they decided to redesign the wallet user experience to drive user adoption. The ease of onboarding provided by Web3Auth’s social logins and key management solution made a lot of sense. The primary reasons they chose to integrate Web3Auth SDK&nbsp;were:</p>  The Decentralised Non-custodial nature of the private key&nbsp;handling  The Social logins to onboard blockchain non-native users  The Web3Auth’s Lookup feature to send crypto/NFTs to socials&nbsp;directly  The single-click setup, the documentation, and the dev support throughout  <p>The Kukai team was evaluating other solutions as well but did not proceed with them because of their inflexibility, low maturity, and centralized method of managing&nbsp;keys.</p><p>“We have been so happy with Web3Auth, and whenever we do our regular reviews of other solutions we continue to be convinced we made the right choice for Kukai users” <br>— Klas Harrysson, Co-Founder, Kukai</p> Winning the NFT space with&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Kukai took less than two weeks to integrate Web3Auth SDK. The detailed documentation and the code examples made the integration process straightforward and easy to complete. With Web3Auth developer support readily available, our engineers worked closely with the Kukai team to build the final product within a short developmental time&nbsp;frame.</p><p>It’s been one year since Kukai launched with Web3Auth handling their authentication and key management, and the SDK has processed more than a million social logins thus&nbsp;far.</p><p>“We never faced any roadblocks during integration because the Web3Auth team was always available at every step” <br>— Klas Harrysson, Co-Founder, Kukai</p><p>Kukai has onboarded hundreds of thousands of non-native crypto users with ease and they devote the success to the Web3Auth SDK which has made their app’s onboarding look like any other web2 app’s. The Tezos community loves Kukai and Web3Auth is excited to support the Tezos ecosystem in their Kukai 2.0 and the upcoming mobile wallet where they expect to multiply their user-base threefold.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/how-kukai-reached-a-million-user-logins-with-web3auth-sdk-58bdc08ca83d">How Kukai Reached a Million User Logins with Web3Auth SDK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and welcome to the first episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity for this New Year 2022. And we have a very special guest who has been in very short clips in an episode we had in October, very recently in October. A very special episode, a storytelling episode called <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/openid-connect/" title="<em>How OpenID Connect took over the World</em>">How OpenID Connect took over the World</a>, and today’s guest was there. We are talking about our super special guest called Nat Sakimura, one of the creators of the OpenID Connect standard.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura is a well-known identity and privacy standardisation architect and a representative partner of NAT Consulting. Besides being an author and editor of such widely standards such as the OpenID Connect, FAPI, JWT, OAuth PKCE among others, he helps communities to organise themselves to realise the ideas around identity and privacy. As the chairman of the board of the OpenID Foundation, he streamlined the process, bolstered the IPR management, and greatly expanded the breadth of the Foundation spanning over 10 working groups whose members included large internet services, mobile operators, financial institutions, government, etc. He has been serving in various committees in the Japanese government, including a Study Group on the Platform Services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and a Study Group on the competition in Digital Market of the Fair-Trade Commission of Japan.</p>
<p>Hello, Nat.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura: Hi, Oscar. Thanks for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s a great pleasure talking with you, Nat. And well, Happy New Year. And let’s talk about digital identity.</p>
<p>Nat: Likewise, yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. And I think we know a lot of your involvement, of course, you are leading one of the most important standardisation organisations in the digital space. We’d like to hear a bit about yourself, something personal, of course, how life led you to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So you wanted to know, how was my journey to the world of identity?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. There are three reasons. They all converge to identity. In the middle 1990s, I was working on VPN as an alternative way to secure communications than having dedicated leased lines. And at that time, we were using dedicated leased lines in the financial institutions. And that actually amounts to the identification and the authentication of machines and people as well as integrity protection and encryption of the communication channel. So there you have identity.</p>
<p>Then also, the second reason was that I found in the hard way that access to our personal data is not granted. My daughter had a failed surgery, she was three years old then, and for re-operation I needed to access the medical record quickly but it was not granted. So it was not useful for us. That was a surprise for me. We didn’t have the right nor technology in place to access our own data in a meaningful timeframe. So I started on the combination, the identity and privacy then.</p>
<p>The third one was the research commissioned by the Japanese Postal Agency. It’s been subsequently privatised, but it was still a government agency at the time, on the future of mails. And as part of the research, I got acquainted with Drummond Reed, who dragged me into the standardisation part of the identity arena.</p>
<p>All of these combined paved the way for me to get into the digital identity standardisation work.</p>
<p>Oscar: I see, it’s very interesting you mentioned these three points. One very technical, solving the security problem so that those time- the VPNs in ‘90s, 1990s. Then you needed to access personal data of your daughter, right? And even though I’m sure it was stored somewhere, but you were not able to access it in a timely manner, as you said so.</p>
<p>Nat: Right.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And then I think the opportunity came, as you mentioned in the Japanese Postal Agency to start working on the standard. So, yeah, super interesting. And we have talked recently and you say you wanted to talk about FAPI, one of the… yeah, one of the main – well children of OpenID Foundation. We have <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/don-thibeau-openid-foundation/" title="interviewed also Don Thibeau">interviewed also Don Thibeau</a> a bit more than one year ago. He a little bit talked about that standard. He has been very enthusiastic about talking that standard and I’m sure you have much more to tell us. But please tell us what is the… what – where is the beginning of that? So what were the challenges that you were working on OpenID Foundation found, led that – led to the, yeah, to start working on the creation of FAPI?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So, right after we have finished OpenID Connect in 2014, I think I have started working on FAPI- preparation for FAPI in 2015. OAuth and OpenID Connect are designed to scale from the point of view of security. If you use only the very basic, you can achieve entry-level security quite simply. Since you’re not using options, it was not that hard to achieve interoperability.</p>
<p>However, when you wanted to achieve more security, you had many options to choose from. And the different combinations not only led to different security properties, but also a lack of interoperability. We needed to bolt the options down so that we have known security properties as well as interoperability.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, I think interoperability is a word that always come to any standard because there are so many different… yeah, so many possibilities can be done and so many different needs in different, yeah, different industries, different places in the world. Yeah. FAPI is Financial-grade API, correct? And I understand also that from the beginning, it has been, as the name says it’s for financial transactions. Please tell us a bit, what is FAPI in practice?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, the FAPI is a general purpose security profile of OAuth and OpenID Connect to protect APIs. It started off from financial use case, from which the letter F comes from. But later, it also made clear that it has general purpose. So we changed the name from Financial API to Financial-grade API. It can be used by for example, healthcare, transportation, and name any.</p>
<p>So there are two notable characteristics of FAPI. Number one is that all the communication is integrity protected, so that it’s tamper-evident. All messages are authenticated. And the second characteristic is that no bearer token is used.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So even if the token was stolen, it cannot be used. You know, the bearer token is like metro ticket or something like that. So if you drop it, and if somebody picks it up, it can be used, right? And instead, in the case of FAPI, we decided to use something called sender constrained tokens. Sender constrained token is much like international airline ticket, I mean the boarding pass. So when you use it, it’s got your name, and you need to show your passport, for example, or travel card so that the person at the entrance can match that you are the rightful user of that boarding pass. So that’s the sender constrained token. And in FAPI, we have stopped using bearer token completely and went all the way to the sender constrained tokens.</p>
<p>So another way to look at it is that it fulfils four authentication properties. In many cases, when we talk about these things, we kind of focus on the user authentication. But there are many other kinds of authentication, which is really important. The number one is strong server authentication. Number two, strong client authentication. Number three, strong message authentication. And these combined with strong user authentication, you will have a pretty complete security picture. So that’s the security part.</p>
<p>And also, we wanted to address the interoperability. So to improve our interoperability, we also needed to provide a testing framework. That is now provided by the OpenID Foundation as FAPI Certification. There are now over 150 implementations that are certified and number is increasing quite rapidly now.</p>
<p>Oscar: And there is some sort of self-certification, correct?</p>
<p>Nat: Yes, it’s a self-certification. So, the test suite is also available as open source. So you can, for example, use it for the continuous development – some banks are actually using it like that. But when you are done with the development, and you have passed all the tests, you can submit the result to OpenID Foundation, and then it will be published from the OpenID Foundation site, and they can be checked by your peers as well so that you know, you have a conformant implementation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Yeah. One thing I was not aware now that I said just before asking you is FAPI’s Financial-grade API. And when I read and when I heard for the first time that term, to me sound like yeah, it’s financial, but now you clarified that initially it was Financial API but then now it’s financial-grade, so as secure as the financial transaction, I guess that’s the idea, right? So now it’s more general purpose in a very secure profile from OpenID Connect and OAuth 2, so that’s interesting.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, that’s correct. Yeah. I mean, so I think it was by 2017 or ‘18, we had a request from both the healthcare sector as well as the international travel sector, you know airlines, that they wanted to use it. But their request was to change the name because having labelled as financial, it’s going to be harder for them to actually make industry-wide adoption of it. So we kind of searched for the name. By then the acronym FAPI was quite popular so we didn’t want to change the acronym and we wanted to generalise the F part. And we couldn’t come up with anything better than financial-grade. But the intent is that it is for any industry, and it’s secure. That’s what we wanted to communicate.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for that clarification. I think it’s very important also, for the ones who are not so familiar with the term yet, so yeah. And also, the fact you mentioned in the description that in FAPI, as a profile of OpenID Connect, you don’t – you get rid of the bearer token so that already tells a lot about how much secure it is per se, the bearer token is just – it’s not a possibility in this profile.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So we have removed the bearer token, removed completely to the sender constrained token, as well as other communications even through the browser, is integrity protected. That’s not the case in the usual OAuth or OpenID Connect. So…</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that is correct.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds very interesting. I have to play myself in the browser, what can I see, what I cannot see, so it’s super interesting.</p>
<p>Nat: So unless the sender and the receiver is using the encryption model, you can still see it, but you cannot tamper it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly.</p>
<p>Nat: &nbsp;It’s signed. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Exactly. The integrity, you cannot, yeah. You cannot modify it. OK, excellent. Please tell us, yeah, you mentioned that initially it was for financial, then at least healthcare and aviation or transport were interested, what are the – nowadays, let’s say, what are the main use cases? Those are still the main use cases or it’s even broader?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, as I’ve said, it’s general-purpose, so it can be used for any use cases that require high level security. Having said that, since we have started off from the financial world, they are leading in the implementation. They had like two years of head start. So the most popular implementation scenario currently is banking. So like accessing banking data, or making payments, and things like that.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. And I know, I read from some examples from FAPI, the documentation is available. They mentioned some has been already – FAPI has been made part of some, I don’t know standards or regulations in few different countries, including UK, open banking is the most known. Could you tell us about those? How has FAPI being implemented in different countries?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, so as you mentioned, the first mainstream usage was the UK Open Banking. Nine biggest banks were mandated by Competitive Market Authority, CMA, to open up the API and FAPI was chosen as the protocol to secure them. And I understand the first reason for that is to make banking data portable. But subsequently, PSD2 kicked in, and now it was expanded into the payment.</p>
<p>And then after that, Australian Consumer Data Standard adopted FAPI. So as the name suggests, it’s much wider than just banking. It’s for any consumer data costs. Again, they have started from banking, and if I remember correctly, they are now expanding into electricity and things like that.</p>
<p>And then Brazil followed the step. I actually had the opportunity to talk with the Vice Governor, I think of the Brazilian Central Bank in London, just before the COVID outbreak. And we agreed that adopting a standardised approach for the testing or certification coming together is going to be really, really vital for widespread adoption and quick adoption. So I think that was taken by Brazilian Central Bank and they are now mandating that to the banks and TPPs, they’re like parties in FinTechs.</p>
<p>And then more recently FDX in the United States announced its adoption, so did the Russian FinTech Association, they have been public. While FDX has made a written statement in the blog post on their website, in the case of the Russian FinTech Association, it’s still verbal, but they’ve been speaking about that in the conferences. So I think it’s, you know, public knowledge now.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a little bit of tweaks that are required for the Russian use cases. In the case of current FAPI, for the purpose of bolting down the options, we have specified a few encryption algorithms and signature algorithms to be used. But in the case of Russia, they need to use their own cost standard for those algorithms. So we need to expand it, modify it and expand it a bit. But that can be done as extension. We are talking about that right now.</p>
<p>And then most recently, we have started joint workshop with the Berlin Group, which is very prominent in continental Europe to seek a way to converge. So, it’s getting good traction now.</p>
<p>Oscar: Berlin Group, I’m not so familiar. It’s also into financial or what it covers, Berlin Group?</p>
<p>Nat: So Berlin Group is mainly… how can I put it? It’s an association of mainly banks. And then there are advisory groups made up which includes FinTechs and other industries as well. But although the name says Berlin, it’s not only Germany. It’s from many other countries as well. So it’s quite widespread in the continent of Europe. And also, I heard some of the Berlin Group banks are now implementing FAPI, or they have already implemented FAPI as well. So that’s an interesting development as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: And it’s also possible that some – in other countries, in different institutions they can implement independently, right, without having a regulation or a main association that – say it force them to use them.</p>
<p>Nat: Sure. Sure. It’s a standard and standards, unless required by regulations like in some other cases, it’s totally optional. It’s totally voluntary. But at the same time, you know, anybody can actually use it. So you don’t have to wait for regulators to come in, and mandating you to use it.</p>
<p>Oscar: So it’s very likely that we will hear in the next, well, in the new year and in the coming months, coming years more associations like this, or banking or even in other industries, more regulations in different other geographies that are embracing FAPI.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, so one of the reasons for FDX I understand to adopt FAPI is to move ahead. Well, I don’t know if that’s correct in other countries, but in many countries, if industries or industrial body actually self-regulate themselves, the government regulations do not kick in and you’ll get more freedom. So I think it’s actually better for the industry to adopt something like this without being mandated by the government.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/global-assured-identity-network-gain-elizabeth-garber/" title="GAIN">GAIN</a>, the project you are heavily involved also, a project that was released a few months ago that also requires GAIN, or – I’m sorry, FAPI. Is FAPI part of GAIN, or could you tell us?</p>
<p>Nat: So GAIN itself is technology neutral, so…</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Nat: It’s not mandating any particular technology. It’s open, but FAPI can also be used. And certainly, that is envisaged by some of the participants in GAIN as the first step. So certainly, you can use FAPI and there are people who are using FAPI in the GAIN POC that they’re self-organising right now.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And could you tell us – leaving a bit outside of the main topic of FAPI, but could you tell us a bit what was also coming from in GAIN, what is happening lately and what is coming in the next months?</p>
<p>Nat: So, there are two distinct paths, at least two, or maybe depending on how you count, it can be three. One is a technical working group, which is hosted by OpenID Foundation and the others are the legal and the business working groups, which are hosted by IIF and Open Identity Exchange. IIF stands for International Institute of Finance, right?</p>
<p>And as to the technical part, we are currently working on the legal agreement, a legal participation agreement so that we can create a safe space for all the participants whose taking part in GAIN POC. We’re in the final phase of drafting such a legal agreement, so that we can participate in POC feeling safe.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So yes, more… the POCs are coming for GAIN. Excellent. And tell us, core FAPI is the project that has ended, I know you are you’re working on that. So tell us what is coming next for the FAPI Working Group?</p>
<p>Nat: So FAPI Working Group is very far from being done, right? And we have ever more work to do. In the beginning, we didn’t create a profile for dynamic client registration, or consent or intent grant, and every jurisdiction says it slightly differently, but grant management will be core. We had enough work to work then as well. So we kind of postpone the work.</p>
<p>However, after UK, EU, Australia and Brazil went online, it became quite clear, painfully clear, that there are compatibility and security headaches because of no standardised way of doing it. So we decided to start work to address them. So the new technical specification called Grant Management for OAuth is being drafted. And it’s gone through the first implementers draft for OAuth successfully so that it can be implemented by implementers without fear of being sued or something like that. And people are just ironing out the kinks about the draft. We’ll probably need multiple rounds of these things to get to the finalisation but it’s a good start, right.</p>
<p>And then now we’re just starting, just in this, like, a month or so, we’ve been starting dynamic client registration part. It’s been done slightly differently in the UK, Australia and Brazil, as well. And, you know, we are gaining a lot of knowledge from that as well. So we are trying to codify the best practices about those. And hopefully, that’s going to be a very good guidance for other jurisdictions to follow.</p>
<p>Oscar: So that relates to the enrolment of customers or identity for customers.</p>
<p>Nat: Well, actually, no, that’s KYC, right. The dynamic client registration is so the end users uses software to interact with the, for example, banks, in the case of open banking, right? And this software actually needs to be registered to those banks. And we have to exchange the keys and things like that. And that can, of course, be done manually but that doesn’t scale. So we needed to have some kind of programmatical way of doing it. That’s called dynamic client registration. And again, we have a lot of options there. And we need to fold it down for the interoperability purpose and to have predictable security. So that’s what we are doing.</p>
<p>When it comes to the KYC part, KYC is a big field. And it’s a headache for all the financial institutions. It hasn’t been too effective to date, but we’re trying and one of the ways to help the pain there is to create a protocol which would make it easier and more secure to exchange those KYC data among the participants, like GAIN. And that’s not being worked on by FAPI Working Group, but in the adjacent working group called eKYC and IDA Working Group.</p>
<p>Actually, if you join the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> call without dropping off and calling another number or accessing new URL, you will be seamlessly taken to eKYC and IDA Working Group. It’s just happening at the same time, I mean at the same location, just they are connected to each other. And that working group is working on the data and metadata side. That is how to express verified attributes and how they were verified. And these attributes, in the first phase we are sorting out the natural persons, but in the coming days we will also be doing legal entities as well, just passing that this person has been verified as, for example, Nat Sakimura isn’t good enough, you really can’t trust it, right? You need more information and, for example, how it was verified, why it was verified, which evidence you have used, under which legal framework, and so on, so forth, and when.</p>
<p>So, these we call metadata needed to be sent with the data itself. And the specification called OIDC for identity assurance, or OpenID Connect for identity assurance, deals with it. And using that standard, you can get those data and metadata together in a signed format. So the combination of the standard, together with FAPI will be very, very powerful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see it’s needed definitely. It’s powerful as you said. So yeah, fantastic job that the FAPI Working Group and this other adjacent group is doing together. Nat, just one final question, for all business leaders who are listening to this conversation we had, what is the one actionable idea that you would like them to write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So while it’s been talked a lot about – the data economy, that it will be over 5% of GDP, it’s yet to be seen. Why? The data economy needs a secure and interoperable data network. And we are finally getting there with FAPI and eKYC standards. So, you guys need to get ready for the ride. It’s the time. You need to start acting, start preparing for that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And that will affect all industries.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, it’s not only financial institutions. Yeah, it’s for everybody.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Thanks a lot Nat for this very interesting conversation. We had knowing a lot more about FAPI and all the great work you do. And please let us know for people who like to continue the conversation with you or know more about the work you are doing, what are the best ways to find you on the net, get in touch?</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So, I’m in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natsakimura/">LinkedIn</a>. If you search Nat Sakimura, you can get there. I’m on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NatSakimura">YouTube</a> as well, so you can get to me there as well, so is <a href="https://twitter.com/_nat_en">Twitter</a>. And of course, if you’re technical, I highly recommend you to join <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> so we can share the technical ideas in a safe IPR environment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot Nat for this interview and all the best and Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Nat: Thanks, much obliged and likewise.</p>

<p>In this article, you will learn how to use the Vision <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/">Face API</a> to perform facial analysis in a .NET MVC application and store user profile pictures in <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/">Azure Blob Container Storage</a>. You’ll also authenticate with Okta and store user data as custom profile attributes.</p>

<p>At the end of this post, you’ll be able to upload a profile picture in your app and get information about image error conditions, such as when zero or more than one face is detected or when your facial features don’t match a new picture.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>
 
   Basic knowledge of C# 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5.0 runtime and SDK</a>, which includes the .NET CLI 
   Your favorite IDE that supports .NET projects, such as <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a>, <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/">Visual Studio for Mac</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">JetBrains Rider</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> 
   A <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">Microsoft Azure Account</a> (Azure free account) 
 

 Create a new ASP.NET project 

<p>Let’s create a new ASP.NET project. We’ll use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/">.NET CLI</a> to scaffold the project.</p>

<p>Run the following commands to create the solution, the project, and add the project to the solution.</p>

   <code>dotnet new sln -n OktaProfilePicture
dotnet new mvc --auth none --framework net5.0 -o OktaProfilePicture
dotnet sln add ./OktaProfilePicture/OktaProfilePicture.csproj
</code>   

<p>Now you can open the project in your favorite IDE and run the app to ensure everything runs correctly. If you are using the command line to build and serve, use the following commands.</p>

   <code>dotnet build
dotnet run --project OktaProfilePicture
</code>   

 Secure your app with Okta 

<p>You’ll use Okta to secure the application quickly with Okta SDKs, so you don’t have to spin up an identity provider and deal with the tricky details of authentication.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Other. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback</code> and use <code>https://localhost:5001/signout/callback</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Okta CLI will configure a new OIDC application and save some secret properties in the solution folder in a file called <code>.okta.env</code>. We’ll use the values in the app.</p>

<p>Some of the values in the <code>.okta.env</code> are secret, and ideally, they should be in a trusted store or in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&amp;tabs=windows">Secrets Manager</a> for local development. Since you’ll be making updates to configuration through this post, we’ll use App Settings so you can set up your configuration as you go along.</p>

<p>Open <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> to add a new section, <code>Okta</code>, with authentication details of your app as shown below. The <code>Domain</code> is the URL of the <code>Issuer</code> value without the path segments.</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": ""
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s add authentication to the app. Open a terminal window, then run the following command to add Okta’s authentication middleware package.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Okta.AspNetCore --version 4.0.0
</code>   

<p>To set up authentication services and register Okta’s authentication middleware services, open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before the <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
  {
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
  })
  .AddCookie()
  .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
    {
      OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
      ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
      ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret")
    });
</code>   

<p>Next, in the <code>Configure()</code> method, add a call to use authentication before adding authorization. Your code will look like this:</p>

   <code>app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
</code>   

<p>If your IDE is having trouble figuring out references, add the following <code>using</code> statements:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
</code>   

<p>Next, you’ll add a controller that handles login, logout, and protected data. Let’s add the methods for login and logout.</p>

<p>Create a controller named <code>AccountController</code> in the <code>Controllers</code> folder. Add the two methods to support login and logout. Your <code>AccountController</code> code will look like the following.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaProfilePicture.Controllers
{
  public class AccountController : Controller
  {
    public IActionResult LogIn()
    {
      if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
      {
        return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
      }

      return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public IActionResult LogOut()
    {
      return new SignOutResult(
        new[]
        {
          OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
          CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        },
        new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/Home/" });
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We’ll create an empty view for the <code>Account</code> controller as a placeholder. Create a new folder named <code>Account</code> in the <code>Views</code> directory. The <code>Account</code> folder is where the views to display and edit your profile will go. Add the file <code>Profile.cshtml</code> to the new <code>Account</code> folder, and paste in the following code.</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "User Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;Your Profile&lt;/h1&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next we can update the initial view to add login and logout. Open <code>Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> and add the following markup above the <code>&lt;ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"&gt;</code> tag:</p>

   <code>@if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
{
  &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello, @User.Identity.Name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    @* &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="nav-link" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Profile" id="profile-button"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; *@
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;form class="form-inline" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="LogOut" method="post"&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark" id="logout-button"&gt;Sign Out&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
}
else
{
  &lt;a&gt;@Html.ActionLink("Sign In", "LogIn", "Account")&lt;/a&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>The parent <code>div</code> for the element we added needs some updates to the styles. Replace the</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex justify-content-between"&gt;</code></p>

<p>with</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex flex-sm-row-reverse"&gt;</code></p>

<p>If you run the app now, you can log in and log out, but there’s nothing to see yet.</p>

 View user details 

<p>We’ll use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet">Okta .NET management SDK</a> to get and update user data. Add the Nuget package by running the following command.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Okta.Sdk --version 5.3.1
</code>   

<p>The Okta management SDK requires an API token that we manually generate. Log in to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login/">Okta admin dashboard</a>. Then navigate to Security &gt; API &gt; Tokens tab and press the Create Token button. Enter a name for the token (I will use “OktaProfilePicture”) and press the Create Token button to finish creating the token. Make sure you copy the token value because you won’t be able to view it again:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now we can add the token to the settings file. Open <code>appSettings.Development.json</code>, and add a new property named <code>ApiToken</code> inside the Okta section. Add your token value. Your settings file should look like this.</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": "",
    "ApiToken": "{token}"
  }
}

</code>   

<p>We want to add the Okta management SDK client to the Dependency Injection (DI) system to use it in the controller. Open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code to <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before the method call <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton((serviceProvider) =&gt; new OktaClient(new OktaClientConfiguration()
{
  OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
  Token = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ApiToken")
}));
</code>   

<p>Add the following using statements if your IDE didn’t already add them for you.</p>

   <code>using Okta.Sdk;
using Okta.Sdk.Configuration;
</code>   

<p>Now we can use the service in the controller. Open <code>Controllers/AccountController.cs</code> and add a private field of type <code>OktaClient</code> and add a constructor to set the field to the <code>AccountController</code> class. The DI system injects an instance of <code>OktaClient</code> that you will use. Your code will look like this.</p>

   <code>private readonly OktaClient _oktaClient;

public AccountController(OktaClient oktaClient)
{
  _oktaClient = oktaClient;
}
</code>   

<p>In the <code>AccountController</code> class, create a private method to interact with Okta management SDK and retrieve user information.</p>

   <code>private async Task&lt;IUser&gt; GetOktaUser()
{
  var subject = HttpContext.User.Claims.First(claim =&gt; claim.Type == JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub).Value;
  return await _oktaClient.Users.GetUserAsync(subject);
}
</code>   

<p>If your IDE is confused about which packages to use, add the following using statements.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens;
using Okta.Sdk;
</code>   

<p>Let’s get your profile info. Create a new public method in <code>AccountController</code> named <code>Profile</code> to handle interacting with the Profile view. You’ll use the user model from Okta. Your code will look like the following.</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Profile()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();

  return View(user);
}
</code>   

<p>We want to protect the <code>Profile</code> method against non-authenticated calls. With the Okta middleware configured, you can add guards. Add the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute directly above the <code>Profile</code> method.</p>

<p>Let’s update the profile view with user information. Open <code>Views/Account/Profile.cshtml</code> and replace the existing code displaying your user info and a profile pic. You won’t have a profile pic to show yet, but that’s coming up soon!</p>

   <code>@model Okta.Sdk.IUser

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "User Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;Your Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="card" style="width: 36rem;"&gt;
  &lt;div class="card-header d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
    @if (ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"] != null)
    {
      &lt;img class="rounded-circle border border-info" src="@ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"]" alt="Profile picture" width="300px"/&gt;
    }
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
    &lt;h2 class="card-title h3"&gt;@Model.Profile.FirstName @Model.Profile.LastName&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p class="card-subtitle h6 mb-2 text-muted"&gt;@Model.Profile.Email&lt;/p&gt;
    @if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(@Model.Profile.City) || !string.IsNullOrEmpty(@Model.Profile.CountryCode))
    {
      &lt;p class="mt-3 card-text"&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;📍&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ml-2"&gt;@Model.Profile.City, @Model.Profile.CountryCode&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    }
    &lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-end"&gt;
      @* @if (ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"] != null) *@
      @* { *@
      @*    &lt;a class="btn btn-outline-danger mr-4" asp-action="DeleteProfilePic"&gt;Delete Profile Picture&lt;/a&gt; *@
      @* } *@
      @* &lt;a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" asp-action="EditProfile"&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/a&gt; *@
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now that we have a <code>Profile</code> method, we can update the main navbar. Open <code>Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> and uncomment the line of code that links to the “Profile” view.</p>

<p>You can view your profile, but the edit button doesn’t work yet.</p>

<p></p>

 Edit your Okta profile 

<p>We’ll add the support to edit your profile info, except for your profile picture. We need a new model that supports the form fields for editing profiles. Add a new file named <code>UserProfileViewModel.cs</code> to the <code>Models</code> directory. Copy and paste the following code into the file.</p>

   <code>#nullable enable
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

namespace OktaProfilePicture.Models
{
  public class UserProfileViewModel
  {
    [Required]
    public string? FirstName { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public string? LastName { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [EmailAddress]
    public string? Email { get; set; }

    public string? City { get; set; }

    [Display(Name = "Country Code")]
    public string? CountryCode { get; set; }

    [Display(Name = "Profile Image")]
    public IFormFile? ProfileImage { get; set; }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next open the <code>AccountController</code> class. We need to add the methods to support editing your profile. First, we need a method to populate the view for editing, and we need another method to handle the profile update. Because both methods relate to editing the profile, we’ll name them the same and create a method overload.</p>

<p>Add a public method <code>EditProfile</code> to <code>AccountController</code> to populate the view and guard it against unauthenticated users. The method looks like the code below.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; EditProfile()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();

  return View(new UserProfileViewModel()
  {
    City = user.Profile.City,
    Email = user.Profile.Email,
    CountryCode = user.Profile.CountryCode,
    FirstName = user.Profile.FirstName,
    LastName = user.Profile.LastName
  });
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll overload the <code>EditProfile</code> method with the user profile model. This method calls Okta management SDK to apply updates. Add the following method to <code>AccountController</code>.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)
{
  if (!ModelState.IsValid)
  {
    return View(profile);
  }

  var user = await GetOktaUser();
  user.Profile.FirstName = profile.FirstName;
  user.Profile.LastName = profile.LastName;
  user.Profile.Email = profile.Email;
  user.Profile.City = profile.City;
  user.Profile.CountryCode = profile.CountryCode;

  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s add the view for editing. Create a new view named <code>EditProfile.cshtml</code> in <code>Views/Account</code> folder. Copy the code below and replace the contents of <code>EditProfile.cshtml</code> with it.</p>

   <code>@model UserProfileViewModel

@{
  ViewData["Title"] = "Edit Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
    &lt;form asp-action="EditProfile" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
      &lt;div asp-validation-summary="ModelOnly" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="FirstName" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="FirstName" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="FirstName" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="LastName" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="LastName" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="LastName" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="Email" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="Email" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="Email" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="City" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="City" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="City" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="CountryCode" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="CountryCode" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="CountryCode" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="ProfileImage" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;div class="custom-file"&gt;
          &lt;input asp-for="ProfileImage" class="custom-file-input" id="customFile"&gt;
          &lt;label class="custom-file-label" for="customFile"&gt;Choose file&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="ProfileImage" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Save" class="btn btn-primary" /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a asp-action="Profile"&gt;Back to Profile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

@section Scripts {
  @{await Html.RenderPartialAsync("_ValidationScriptsPartial");}

  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    const fileInput = document.querySelector('.custom-file-input');
    fileInput.addEventListener('change', (event) =&gt; {
      const fileName = event.target.value.split("\\").pop();
      document.querySelector('.custom-file-label').textContent = fileName;
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>Lastly, open <code>Views/Account/Profile.cshtml</code> to uncomment a line of code towards the bottom of the file. Uncomment the line that displays a button to edit profile - the line with <code>&lt;a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" asp-action="EditProfile"&gt;EditProfile&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to edit your profile information except for your profile picture. Next we’ll make it so your app persists your profile picture.</p>

<p></p>

 Add Azure Storage 

<p>To make your profile picture viewable, we need to persist the image somewhere. We’ll use Azure Storage to do this and use a custom attribute in Okta to store a unique identifier associated with the file in Azure. You’ll be able to upload and display a profile picture in the app.</p>

<p>First, we’ll create the custom attributes in Okta using the Okta admin dashboard.</p>

<p>Log in to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login/">Okta admin dashboard</a>. Then navigate to Directory &gt; Profile Editor. You should see an item named User (default) in the list, which is Okta’s default user profile template. Select User (default) to open the Profile Editor. Press the +Add Attribute button.</p>

<p>You’ll add two string attributes, <code>profileImageKey</code> and <code>personId</code>:</p>
 
   Use “Profile Image Key” as the display name and <code>profileImageKey</code> as the variable name. 
   Use “Person Id” as the display name for the second attribute and <code>personId</code> as the variable name. 
 

<p>See the image below for the “Profile Image Key” attribute inputs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Create another attribute named <code>personId</code>. If you look at the “User (default)” user type attribute list, you should see your two new attributes listed at the bottom.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, we’ll create Azure Storage. If you don’t already have an Azure subscription, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F">make a free account</a> before you begin. We’ll walk through the steps using the Azure Portal, but if you are an Azure pro, feel free to use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">Azure CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?view=azps-7.0.0">Azure PowerShell</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have an Azure subscription, open the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure Portal</a>. Open the menu by pressing the hamburger menu on the left, and select Storage accounts. Press +Create to create a storage account. In the Create a storage account view, create a Resource Group if you don’t already have one for test projects. I named my Resource Group “OktaDemo”. Enter <code>oktaprofilepicture</code> as the storage name, select a region (Azure’s default selection is fine here), then select Standard performance and Locally-redundant storage (LRS) for redundancy. Press the Review + create button at the bottom as the default options for the remaining selections are acceptable. Press Create to complete creating the storage account.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, we need to get the access keys for integrating the storage account SDK in the app. In the <code>oktaprofilepicture</code> storage account, open Access keys below the Security + networking section in the nav menu. Then press Show keys and copy the first Connection string field. Now we can move to the code!</p>

<p></p>

<p>We’re going to add a new section for Azure resources to the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file in the solution to connect to the Azure resource. Open <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and add a new key named “Azure” with a property called “BlobStorageConnectionString” like the following code snippet.</p>

   <code>{
  ... Logging and Okta sections here,
  
  "Azure": {
    "BlobStorageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=oktaprofilepicture;AccountKey=eWlJUj.....A==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll need to add the packages and set up the service. Add two Nuget packages — one for Azure Storage and the other for integrating Azure clients into the DI system. Add the packages by running the following commands in the terminal.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Azure.Storage.Blobs --version 12.9.1
dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Microsoft.Extensions.Azure --version 1.1.1
</code>   

<p>Open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code to the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddAzureClients(builder =&gt;
{
  builder.AddBlobServiceClient(Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Azure:BlobStorageConnectionString"));
});
</code>   

<p>We can inject the blob service client into the <code>AccountController</code> and connect to the blob container. We’ll create the blob container that we’ll use in the constructor. Open <code>Controllers/AccountController.cs</code> and add the blob container client as shown below.</p>

   <code>private readonly OktaClient _oktaClient;
private readonly BlobContainerClient _blobContainerClient;

public AccountController(OktaClient oktaClient, BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient)
{
  _oktaClient = oktaClient;
  _blobContainerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient("okta-profile-picture-container");
  _blobContainerClient.CreateIfNotExists();
}
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>Profile()</code> and <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> methods to upload and view the blob container image. First, let’s update the <code>Profile()</code> method.</p>

<p>The blob container’s access level is private, so we need to generate a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview">shared access signature</a> that creates a read-only, temporary URL that we can use in the view. We’ll also use the custom attribute <code>profileImageKey</code> to retrieve an existing image if one exists.</p>

<p>Replace the existing <code>Profile()</code> method with the following code.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Profile()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();
  var profileImage = (string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"];
  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(profileImage))
  {
    return View(user);
  }

  var sasBuilder = new BlobSasBuilder
  {
    StartsOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
    ExpiresOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMinutes(15)
  };

  sasBuilder.SetPermissions(BlobSasPermissions.Read);
  var url = _blobContainerClient.GetBlobClient(profileImage).GenerateSasUri(sasBuilder);
  ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"] = url;

  return View(user);
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> changes to</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)
{
  if (!ModelState.IsValid)
  {
    return View(profile);
  }

  var user = await GetOktaUser();
  user.Profile.FirstName = profile.FirstName;
  user.Profile.LastName = profile.LastName;
  user.Profile.Email = profile.Email;
  user.Profile.City = profile.City;
  user.Profile.CountryCode = profile.CountryCode;

  if (profile.ProfileImage != null)
  {
    await UpdateUserImage();
  }

  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");

  async Task UpdateUserImage()
  {
    var blobName = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty((string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"]))
    {
      await _blobContainerClient.DeleteBlobAsync((string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"]);
    }
    await _blobContainerClient.UploadBlobAsync(blobName, profile.ProfileImage?.OpenReadStream());
    user.Profile["profileImageKey"] = blobName;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>If you run the app, you can select a picture from local files to add to your profile and see your profile picture on the “Profile” page.</p>

 Add Azure Cognitive Services 

<p>Finally, we get to check out Azure Cognitive Services for facial analysis. We’ll use facial analysis in two different ways — for face detection and face verification.</p>

<p>First, we need to create the Azure resource and get the access keys. Open the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFace">Cognitive Services Face</a> resource page in the Azure portal. Press + Create to open the Create Face view. Select “OktaBlog” as the Resource group (or a Resource group of your choosing) and name the instance “OktaProfilePicture”. Since this is for demo purposes, I used the “Free F0” pricing tier. Press Review + create to create the resource. Open “OktaProfilePicture” Face service instance and open Keys and Endpoint. You will need both the key and the Endpoint.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file and add two new fields in the <code>Azure</code> section named <code>SubscriptionKey</code> and <code>FaceClientEndpoint</code>. Copy and paste the key and endpoint values from the Azure Keys and Endpoint view. The <code>Azure</code> section of your <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> will now look like the following.</p>

   <code>{
  ... Logging and Okta sections here,
  
  "Azure": {
    "BlobStorageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=oktaprofilepicture;AccountKey=eWlJUj.....A==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",
    "SubscriptionKey": "{FaceResourceKey}",
    "FaceClientEndpoint": "https://{FaceResourceName}.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>To add the packages, run the following command in the terminal.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.Face --version 2.8.0-preview.2
</code>   

<p>Let’s add the face service to the DI system to use it in the controller. Open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code to the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before the call to <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton((serviceProvider) =&gt;
  new FaceClient(
    new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials(Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Azure:SubscriptionKey")))
  {
    Endpoint = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Azure:FaceClientEndpoint")
  }
);
</code>   

<p>Now we can incorporate the service into the controller. Open <code>Controllers/AccountController.cs</code>, inject the face service in the constructor, then connect it to a private instance that we’ll use throughout the controller class. Your code will look like this:</p>

   <code>private readonly OktaClient _oktaClient;
private readonly BlobContainerClient _blobContainerClient;
private readonly FaceClient _faceClient;

public AccountController(OktaClient oktaClient, BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient, FaceClient faceClient)
{
  _oktaClient = oktaClient;
  _faceClient = faceClient;

  _blobContainerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient("okta-profile-picture-container");
  _blobContainerClient.CreateIfNotExists();
}
</code>   

<p>The first thing we want to do with the cognitive service is ensure there’s only one face in an image. To do so, we’ll use a built-in method to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.face.faceoperationsextensions.detectwithstreamasync?view=azure-dotnet">detect faces</a>.</p>

<p>In <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> method, we’ll add code to open the image file, detect the number of faces, and set an error if there isn’t exactly one face in the image. Replace the <code>if(profile.PageImage != null){await UpdateUserImage();}</code> statement with the following code.</p>

   <code>if (profile.ProfileImage == null)
{
  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");
}

var stream = profile.ProfileImage.OpenReadStream();
var detectedFaces = await _faceClient.Face.DetectWithStreamAsync(stream, recognitionModel: RecognitionModel.Recognition04, detectionModel: DetectionModel.Detection01);

if (detectedFaces.Count != 1 || detectedFaces[0].FaceId == null)
{
  ModelState.AddModelError("", $"Detected {detectedFaces.Count} faces instead of 1 face");
  return View(profile);
}

await UpdateUserImage();
</code>   

<p>The <code>RecognitionModel.Recognition04</code> is the most accurate model currently available, and <code>DetectionModel.Detection01</code> is a model that avoids detecting small and blurry faces.</p>

<p>Now, if you try running the app and upload an image with you and your friends, you’ll see an error.</p>

 Perform facial analysis 

<p>Next, let’s add the facial analysis. We need to handle two scenarios.</p>
 
   You’re adding a profile picture for the first time — this sets the baseline for the facial features to use in future comparisons 
   You’re updating your profile picture — facial analysis runs against the face in this image and compares it to the baseline 
 

<p>Let’s handle the first scenario.</p>

<p>The Face API only stores the extracted facial features for 24 hours by default, so we need to set a baseline that we can refer to beyond the 24-hour window. We can store facial features within the “OktaProfilePicture” Azure Cognitive Services resource, which we’ll do for the first upload scenario.</p>

<p>In the <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> method, replace the line of code that calls <code>await UpdateUserImage();</code> with the code snippet below.</p>

   <code>var personGroupId = user.Id.ToLower();

if (string.IsNullOrEmpty((string)user.Profile["personId"]))
{
  await _faceClient.PersonGroup.CreateAsync(personGroupId, user.Profile.Login, recognitionModel: RecognitionModel.Recognition04);

  stream = profile.ProfileImage.OpenReadStream();
  var personId = (await _faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.CreateAsync(personGroupId, user.Profile.Login)).PersonId;
  await _faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.AddFaceFromStreamAsync(personGroupId, personId, stream);

  user.Profile["personId"] = personId;
  await UpdateUserImage();
} else {

}
</code>   

<p>The <code>PersonGroup</code> is a container object for a group of people. We’re using your Okta user ID as the unique identifier for this group, so each group is truly individualized. Other options could be group or department IDs. The <code>PersonGroupPerson</code> object is an individual within the group, so there is usually a 1:n relationship between <code>PersonGroup</code> and <code>PersonGroupPerson</code>. We’re also associating one face to a <code>PersonGroupPerson</code>, although you can add multiple images of an individual so you can train the service to analyze an individual better. We’re using a simple case here to showcase how this service works by a single image of an individual.</p>

<p>Now we want to handle the second scenario — where we want to perform facial analysis compared to the baseline facial features. We want only to allow the image to update when we have some measure of confidence that the new face image matches the baseline. Add the following snippet inside the <code>else</code> block from the code above.</p>

   <code>var faceId = detectedFaces[0].FaceId.Value;

var personId = new Guid((string)user.Profile["personId"]);
var verifyResult = await _faceClient.Face.VerifyFaceToPersonAsync(faceId, personId, personGroupId);

if (verifyResult.IsIdentical &amp;&amp; verifyResult.Confidence &gt;= 0.8)
{
  await UpdateUserImage();
}
else
{
  ModelState.AddModelError("", "The uploaded picture doesn't match your current picture");
  return View(profile);
}
</code>   

<p>We used a confidence level of 80% in positive identifications since we only have one facial feature for comparison. With better training, you can increase the confidence level.</p>

<p>Now you can upload a picture of yourself and then upload a photo of a friend to see what happens.</p>

 Resetting profile pictures 

<p>Sometimes you need to clear everything out and start over. I uploaded a picture of myself wearing oversized sunglasses and a hat, and the face service no longer recognized me. 😎</p>

<p>Let’s add in the delete functionality so you can reset everything.</p>

<p>In <code>AccountController</code> we’ll add a new method called <code>DeleteProfilePic()</code>. This method deletes the image from container storage, removes links to stored facial features, and clears out the custom attributes set in your Okta profile. Copy the code below and add it to the end of the <code>AccountController</code> class.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DeleteProfilePic()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();

  await CleanAzureResources();

  user.Profile["profileImageKey"] = null;
  user.Profile["personId"] = null;
  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");

  async Task CleanAzureResources()
  {
    // remove image from blob
    await _blobContainerClient.DeleteBlobAsync((string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"]);

    // remove face from Face services
    var personId = Guid.Parse((string)user.Profile["personId"]);
    await _faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.DeleteAsync(user.Id.ToLower(), personId);
    await _faceClient.PersonGroup.DeleteAsync(user.Id.ToLower());
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>Views/Account/Profile.cshtml</code> and uncomment the remaining commented out code. Doing so allows the “Delete Profile Picture” button to display.</p>

<p>Now you can reset your profile picture and upload that picture of you wearing a hat and sunglasses to test out the facial comparison ability.</p>

<p>How people pay bills, shop online, open accounts and experience their finances is evolving quickly. Fintech innovations are altering the way consumers think about and relate to money. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated the digital transition. The shifting reality of how finances are managed is underway. Bank branches and paper checks are an afterthought to a growing number of consumers. Eight in 10 Americans are linking their bank accounts digitally, using these connections to automate everyday tasks like paying credit card and utility bills, according to Mastercard’s new study, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">The Rise of Open Banking</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sea change in consumer expectations is already in motion. With every leap in speed, security, and ease of use, open banking apps and services usher in the next generation of finance. The advent of the internet has trained the human mind to process far more information than in the past, and to do it quickly. When it comes to their personal finances, people want the real-time data whenever they want it. Save them time and money, and enhance their financial health, or they won’t adopt your platform.</p>
 1. Saving More Time, Creating Less Work 
<p>Just a handful of years ago, a group of friends out to dinner would have to all reach into their wallets and purses, chip in cash, write a check or stack a pile of credit cards on top of the bill, and wait for the server to swipe them all. With the massive adoption and growth of P2P payment apps, these antiquated processes are quickly becoming a thing of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In real time, payments can be split between friends with a few taps on the mobile screen. Digital wallets allow a busy shopper to tap their phone against a payment terminal and breeze through checkout at retail stores. Encrypted credit card info auto-populates, saving time and reducing user error when shopping online. The countless hours these new processes save is the biggest driver for adoption. 59% of study respondents cited this as their number one motivator.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Saving Money 
<p>65% of Americans <a href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/budgeting/spending-knowledge-survey/">don’t know</a> how much money they spent last month. Saving doesn’t come naturally to many people, and our <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/08/why-are-we-so-emotional-about-money">emotionally-charged relationship</a> with money certainly doesn’t help. So much emphasis is placed on new and better ways to spend that saving becomes just a lurking afterthought. Open banking innovators are addressing this huge segment of consumers with a rich slate of apps and services. AI and machine-learning engines do the heavy lifting of savings calculation, goal-setting and projection, raising the level of users’ financial literacy. 42% of Americans surveyed wanted help saving their money, and trust technology to give them the advantage they need.</p>
<p>Open banking technology powers some of the most effective fintech apps for saving money, using artificial intelligence and machine learning to take a deep dive into spending habits and cash flow. Some even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/how-gamification-can-help-you-meet-financial-goals/">gamify finances</a>, injecting the process with fun and some healthy self-competition.&nbsp;</p>
  
 3. Improving Financial Health 
<p>Open banking and AI make a powerful duo. Open banking connections to third-party financial service providers are flipping the data experience to favor the consumer. Anyone can download a financial management app, grant permission to access their bank accounts, and be guided easily through opening accounts, investment suggestions, and loan applications. This happens in moments, not hours or days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fintech AI systems process massive amounts of data in milliseconds. App and service developers can leverage this power to analyze a consumer’s subscription payments, utility bills, direct deposits and loan obligations near-instantaneously. Machine learning and AI engines can use this rich, real-time data to suggest smart financial planning and investing options. It’s a growing expectation that has to be accounted for in app development. Exposure to the open banking ecosystem is raising the level of consumer financial literacy, and it’s happening quickly. As a result, financial decision-making can improve dramatically. Consumers are seeing the positive results of adoption in their bank balances: 35% of respondents to the survey say improved financial health is why they use fintech.&nbsp;</p>
 4. Automate It! 
<p>No one leaps out of bed in the morning in wild anticipation of paying the electricity bill. Mundane, time-consuming financial tasks don’t actually have to absorb anyone’s time. Open banking allows easy setup and maintenance of connections to financial institutions, allowing consumers to set a variety of monthly payments and subscriptions to auto-pay. With the average consumer spending <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/average-consumer-spending-273-per-month-on-subscription-services-report/">$273 per month</a> on a mixed bag of small payments, automation saves a considerable amount of time, and it ensures payments aren’t missed. U.S. households average <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/18/deloitte-consumers-load-up-on-subscriptions-but-are-frustrated-with-fragmentation/">nine separate payments</a> per month just for entertainment subscriptions. Add gym memberships, retail subscriptions and utilities to an ever-growing list of small, recurring transactions, and the benefit of utilizing technology to manage these payments becomes obvious. 26% of North Americans surveyed are attracted to technology to help them automate these little chores, freeing up their time for more important concerns.&nbsp;</p>
 5. Getting a Better Holistic View of Finances 
<p>Gone are the days when consumers used file drawers stuffed with manila folders, neatly tabbed, in an attempt to keep checking the pulse of their financial health. Open banking data has spawned a wealth of apps and services that give consumers and small businesses an up-to-the-moment picture of their finances. Open banking connections across accounts and across financial institutions power the apps that consumers are using to take their financial temperature. The growing expectation is that individuals should be able to see what their money is doing and where it’s going, 24 hours a day. 18% of North American users said that tracking their money was a major driver for fintech adoption.&nbsp;</p>

Here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-markets-2a7b7e7c-972f-4858-bbde-7073417e1abe.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Things change fast in a pandemic. And a rapidly changing economy has the Federal Reserve playing catch-up, Axios’ Neil Irwin&nbsp;writes.</blockquote>  Less than a month ago, the Fed made an abrupt pivot toward a more hawkish monetary policy stance. By the end of last week, the data was pointing toward an even faster withdrawal of stimulus.  <blockquote>Why it matters: Cheap money has become baked into the economy, so the Fed’s moves to take it away will bring risks of abrupt swings in markets that could spill back over into the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>By the numbers: Friday’s jobs data are Exhibit A. While initial headlines focused on soft growth in payroll numbers, the report points toward a labor market that has become exceptionally tight, contributing to already high inflation.</blockquote>  The unemployment rate is down to 3.9%. In the last economic cycle that level was not reached until May 2018 — at which point the Fed had already raised interest rates six times (now:&nbsp;zero).  Wages are not only rising, but rising at an accelerating pace. Average hourly earnings rose 4.7% over the entire course of 2021, but at a 6.2% annual rate in the final three months of the&nbsp;year.  <blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The bottom line: The labor market has gotten tighter, faster than most people, including at the Fed, thought possible just a few months ago. Now, policy is on track to follow&nbsp;suit.</blockquote><p>Goldman Sachs now predicts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/goldman-predicts-the-fed-while-hike-rat%20es-four-times-this-year-more-than-previously-expected.html">the Fed will hike rates four times next&nbsp;year</a>.</p><p>Once the Fed starts hiking rates, they’ll also start <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/fed-minutes-december-2021.html">shedding their balance sheet</a>, essentially sucking easy money out of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>When that money gets sucked out, it gets sucked out of riskier assets like certain equities and&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>We’re now entering that part of the&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/goldman-predicts-the-fed-while-hike-rates-four-times-this-year-more-than-previously-expected.html">Goldman predicts the Fed will hike rates four times this year, more than previously expected</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-10/goldman-now-expects-four-fed-hikes-sees-faster-runoff-in-2022">Goldman Now Expects Four Fed Hikes, Sees Faster Runoff in&nbsp;2022</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/fed-minutes-december-2021.html">Federal Reserve puts wheels in motion for balance sheet reduction</a>  <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-yields-build-on-post-fed-minutes-rise-11641472017">2-year Treasury yield hits an almost 2-year high as Fed’s Bullard says first rate hike could come as soon as&nbsp;March</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/business/economy/federal-reserve-minutes-interest-rates.html">Fed officials discussed raising rates sooner and faster in&nbsp;2022.</a>   2.

According to the order published by the CFTC, Polymarket offered at least 900 such markets over the last 18&nbsp;months.</blockquote><blockquote>These markets are swaps under federal&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Polymarket cooperated with the investigation, according the CFTC’s press release, leading to a reduced fine. The company will stop offering markets by Jan. 14 and commit to making all funds available to users by Jan. 24, according to the order. Polymarket will also cease and desist any further violations of the CEA, though it doesn’t appear the company itself will be shut&nbsp;down.</blockquote><blockquote>Elsewhere, Berlin-based Neuhaus is<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/10/why-were-shutting-our-successful-fundraising-platform/"> preemptively shutting down a “viable security token business” due to lack of regulatory clarity</a> (via /gregkidd):</blockquote><blockquote>Our concept-proving case — Greyp Bikes — made the full cycle, from issuing tokenized shares for retail investors, through corporate governance on blockchain, to the exit to Porsche and proceeds distribution via ERC20 tokens. Effectively, there were never any compliance issues, technical problems or security breaches. An European tech company fundraised through the issuance of securities using a decentralized technology. And more than 1,000 investors from dozens of countries participated. How&nbsp;cool.</blockquote><blockquote>Yet, we are closing the Neufund business.</blockquote><blockquote>Why? Because today, more than two years after Greyp fundraised, we still are unsure whether regulation allows us to repeat the Greyp fundraising model with other similar companies. Despite engaging with regulators for years, we didn’t manage to get out of the limbo of legal uncertainty.</blockquote><blockquote>And, I dare say, no DeFi (decentralized finance) company, aiming for regular investors on a bigger scale, has ever made it so&nbsp;far.</blockquote><p>Not the most encouraging updates.

<p><a href="http://dock.io/">Dock</a> is a bespoke blockchain designed and built to be used for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. One of the many important use cases where Dock’s technology can be used is alongside NFTs to reduce fraud and preserve the privacy of NFT owners. To help illustrate how this could work, we are sharing a specific use case with world-renowned vintage watch dealer, <a href="https://www.fogcityvintage.com/">Fog City Vintage</a>.</p><p>Before we dive into the use case, it’s important to understand the differences between NFTs and Verifiable Credentials, and how they can work together.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials contain cryptographically signed pieces of information that can be instantly verified and authenticated based on the identity and trustworthiness of the issuer of the Verifiable Credential. Information contained in the Verifiable Credential is specific to the holder of the credential, which can be an individual, entity, or even an object, and Verifiable Credentials aren’t considered transferable or able to change ownership. In addition, Verifiable Credentials are stored off-chain, typically in a holder’s wallet, and the only data on-chain is the DID and a hash pointing to the credential ensuring data privacy. Some common use cases for Verifiable Credentials include credentials used to prove identity, skills, and achievements.</p><p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are blockchain-based tokens that contain digitally unique data and identifiers. They are designed to be transferable and can contain digital artwork, collectibles, or representation of real-world assets. Most NFTs today exist on the Ethereum blockchain and so their ownership is tied to a public Ethereum address. Dock has integrated with Ethereum to enable NFTs to be created directly on the Dock blockchain.</p> How can NFTs &amp; Verifiable Credentials work together? <p></p><p>Although they are fundamentally different, there are some very interesting use cases for Verifiable Credentials to be used alongside NFTs. Verifiable Credentials can provide a privacy preserving yet cryptographically provable identity linked to an NFT, and therefore provide tamper-proof information about the identity of an NFT owner, creator, or buyer.</p><p>Fraud is rampant both within and outside of the blockchain space, and NFTs are no exception with scammers setting up fake accounts and selling fake NFTs. A Verifiable Credential can be used to verify the identity of all parties involved in creating, buying, and selling NFTs, to ensure the reputation and authenticity of everyone involved without divulging private information. For example, an NFT creator could share a Verifiable Credential that demonstrates a history of creating legitimate NFTs, or a seller can have a Verifiable Credential that shows a reputation score based on their previous NFT sales. Verifiable credentials issued via Dock use Zero-Knowledge Proofs to ensure data privacy, so the parties involved in the NFT transaction can prove their legitimacy without actually revealing their real-world identities or private information.</p><p>Another way that Verifiable Credentials can be used alongside NFTs is to prove qualifications in order to access an NFT or an NFT marketplace. For example, an artist may want their NFTs to only be accessible by their fans or specific members of a community who meet certain criteria. In this instance, Verifiable Credentials could be issued to community members demonstrating they meet the criteria and can then present the Verifiable Credential to enable them to receive the NFT. There could also be an NFT marketplace that is only appropriate for certain ages or populations; a Verifiable Credential could be used to prove that someone meets this criteria without compromising their identity in order to be able to transact in the NFT marketplace.</p> Dock and Fog City Vintage Watches <p>Fog City Vintage is a world-renowned vintage watch dealer who is using NFTs to address specific problems that exist in the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/luxury-watch-shortage-drives-growth-of-20-billion-secondhand-market.html">$20 billion vintage watch industry</a>. Vintage watches are inherently unique, highly tradeable, and very expensive, but the market for these watches is highly susceptible to fraud and there are no quality standards. Most trades are based on loose connections and it’s not uncommon for sellers to be defrauded out of &nbsp;tens of thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands, of dollars. Tim Bender, CEO of Fog City Vintage, estimates that well over $1 billion is lost annually by buyers of fraudulent vintage watches.</p><p>Fog City Vintage is planning to use NFTs to represent the authenticity of the watch in order to prevent fraud and enhance the tradability of the watches. Fog City will be issuing NFTs that represent the vintage watches and provide an expert evaluation of the condition of the watches based on a new standard they are developing. By issuing NFTs, which can be done on the Dock blockchain, Fog City can provide watch buyers with the assurance that they are purchasing legitimate watches from reputable buyers.</p><p>Dock’s technology can be used to enhance Fog City’s watch marketplace in several ways. Verifiable Credentials can be issued to marketplace buyers and sellers that reflect their purchase history to eliminate fraudsters and ensure only legitimate parties are involved in the transactions. In addition, Fog City, as well as other vintage watch dealers, can have a Verifiable Credential that proves their own identity as reputable experts who are qualified to evaluate the condition of the watches. The watch dealers would issue certificates of authenticity for the watches based on their evaluations to ensure only genuine watches are being traded and therefore provide further trust and transparency in the marketplace.</p><p>Since Dock provides technology to issue anonymous credentials, all of the Verifiable Credentials shared in the transactions would protect the real identity of the marketplace participants without compromising the integrity of the marketplace. Verifiable Credentials and NFTs are stored in the holder's own digital wallets rather than in a centralized database, which removes the risk of holding customer data while giving customers control of their own identity and assets. Combining Verifiable Credentials with NFTs is a powerful and secure way to add trust and authenticity to marketplaces while ensuring the privacy of everyone participating.</p>

Description: Welcome to lucky episode number 13! Your new host Aubrey Turner, Executive Advisor at Ping, is thrilled to welcome Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder of the award-winning data platform Meeco. Katryna discusses Meeco’s mission to enable everyone on the planet access to equity and value in exchange for the data and information they share. She talks about why she saw a need for Meeco’s services, what we need to know as we approach a more “physigital”world, and how her vision all started with a Tom Cruise film. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [1:34] Katryna talks about her journey of founding Meeco, and how she was inspired by Tom Cruise’s movie Minority Report. In early 2012 she sat down and wrote a Manifesto, and asked the question: what would happen if everyday people had the power to make really good decisions on data, the way that social networks, government, and enterprise do? How can we create meaningful value and make better decisions with our data? [8:12] Katryna shares some of her concerns around modern privacy and where she sees things evolving, both good and bad. [9:35] Technology is neutral. It’s what we do with it that gives it bias and can make it either creepy or cool. [11:33] What does Katryna mean when she says it starts with trust by design? [17:22] The next wave may be just starting to bring people and things into the direct value chain, through wearables or IoT devices for example. [18:31] How can we create better digital onboarding for employees, knowing that even post-COVID-19 our world will not go back to how it was in December 2020? One thing that Katryna is sure of is that we must lean into innovation rather than doing nothing and waiting to see. [36:13] We must make sure we are paying attention to the misalignment between law and technology, especially when it comes to ethics and the safety of children growing up in a digital-forward world. &nbsp; Quotes:    “I think the challenge for any kind of technology and regulation is a lag  factor, not a lead factor.”—Katryna         “The line between creepy and cool is one of the things we are always trying to address from a technology point of view.”—Katryna   “There isn’t really the option to not find better ways of digitally engaging.”—Katryna    Mentioned in This Episode: PingIdentity AubreyTurner KatrynaDow Meeco “HowCOVID-19 has pushed companies over the technology tipping point—and transformed business forever”     &nbsp;       &nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;

<p>Today, January 11, is the International Day of Gratitude. What better time then, to tell partners that you cherish their work and thank them for the inspiration they have given you? We at Jolocom reflect on amazing projects that became possible by joining forces with partners such as T-Labs, Bundesdruckerei, Stacks, and TIB – the Technical Information Library Hanover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been a privilege to work with you and we hope to continue our work together.&nbsp;</p>



 About Us&nbsp; 



<p>Jolocom is a leading steward of self-sovereign identity (SSI) in Europe with a long-term commitment to open source and open standards. We bring a full SSI tech stack, including library, software development kit (SDK), SSI protocol and the Jolocom SmartWallet application, as well as our technical expertise, to the community. Our aim is to accelerate the deployment of DIDs and verifiable credentials, ensuring interoperability between available solutions and increasing the self-sovereignty of users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve had the chance to engage with multiple partners in the past year, allowing us to broaden and deepen our SSI knowledge and, what’s more, partnering up in projects that mark a significant turn in the SSI world and increase engagement from both users and developers.&nbsp;</p>



 &nbsp;<br>Thank You to..&nbsp; 



<p>T-Labs/T-Systems (Deutsche Telekom)&nbsp;</p>



<p>T-Labs is the Research &amp; Development Department of Deutsche Telekom, focusing on bringing new technology trends to the market and delivering tangible results into Deutsche Telekom’s innovation portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in November 2017, Jolocom has partnered with T-Labs to launch the development, bringing together a group of blockchain startups to build the prototype operating stack: the idea being that enterprises can build a decentralized back-end in a matter of minutes. Jolocom is developing a modular solution that enables individuals, organizations and companies to get a self-sovereign digital identity. In the T-Labs prototype, Jolocom provides the tool to create and securely verify claims about identity. This allows for the modeling of a trustworthy and complex relationships between entities (e.g. ownership structures of IoT devices with organizations/individuals). Modeling these relationships with a self-sovereign solution enables a frictionless bridge between different ecosystems and network environments. What we have begun with T-Labs in 2018, we are happy to continue from early 2021 into the middle of 2022 with T-Systems and others as part of our current project portfolios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Bundesdruckerei&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundesdruckerei (BDR)&nbsp; is home to the digital experts supplying Germany’s ID cards and passports. They are working with different ID management solutions and technologies at the federal government security company. One of these approaches made use of Jolocom’s identity library and wallet. In 2019, the BDR demonstrated the potential of decentralized self-sovereign identity solutions in NAME OF PILOT, where identity information remains under the complete control of the citizen via the Jolocom SmartWallet downloaded onto their mobile device.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More precisely, researchers at BDR merged the Jolocom software for decentralized identity and access management with the existing government IT infrastructure for verification and identification. The goal: creating one of the earliest proof-of-concepts (POCs) for a decentralized digital ID in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This particular POC was an early example of an issuing and verification authority merging its existing technology with self-sovereign identity software. Jolocom’s software is fully open source. The part we played was adjusting our app interface to support BDR’s work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With more governments exploring the advantages of blockchain and, more specifically, self-sovereign identity solutions for common identity and access management challenges, we look forward to offering our open source library more widely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, we have engaged with the BDR in another main project of which you might have heard: ONCE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft: ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’ projects ONCE, ID-Ideal and SDIKA&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project is part of the competitive innovation program “Showcase Secure Digital Identities” (SDI) funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), where a dozen consortia were invited to present their concepts in an innovation competition and&nbsp;four projects that qualified for a fully-funded three year implementation phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom is a partner in three of these four SDI implementation projects, to which we will lend our expertise in self-sovereign identity, years of experience in developing digital identity wallets and the open-source Jolocom stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ONCE is the first of these projects to launch, followed by ID-Ideal and SDIKA. A few words about each:&nbsp;</p>



<p>ONCE aims to harmonize eID with SSI in user-controlled wallets. ID-Ideal has the goal of harmonizing trust providers and consumers from multiple networks and legal setups under one coherent trust framework. Finally, SDIKA pursues the realization of cross-use case identities in open ecosystems with widespread adoption. We thank our new and old partners for joining us on this path.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these projects are funded and supported by the BMWi, and we are grateful for using this huge opportunity to bring SSI to the individual citizen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technical Information Library Hanover&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Technical Information Library in Hanover is the German specialist library for technology as well as architecture, chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics. TIB is the world’s largest specialist library for technology and natural sciences. What’s more, TIB and Jolocom have both been early adopters and pioneers of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and the Web 3.0 approach in Germany. Multiple encounters within the DLT community have led to a growing desire to join forces so we can further develop interoperability, open standards and open access. Together, we created the Conference Digital Identifier Integration (conDIDi) project. The idea was to implement the SSI approach in the academic sector, while also increasing global collaboration and interoperability due to the gradual integration of different solutions (i.e. ORCID, ConfIDent and conDIDi) into one single system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply put, conDIDi seeks to reduce the management burden for both participants and organizers: Automating the process of verifying that participants fulfilled requisite criteria, such as having paid fees, met requirements for paper submission, agreed to chair a panel, checked into the venue, etc, would reduce a large part of the bureaucratic, time-consuming and costly overhead of conference management.&nbsp; At the same time, automated exchange of verifiable participation credentials reduces the waiting time for academics to build their CVs and paper portfolios, and – more recently – for medical professionals to collect proofs of training and education requirements. ConDIDi is now an ongoing pilot project within TIB and we are excited to see what it will grow into and to support its continuous development in future collaborations with our partners at TIB. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Stacks&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom also partnered with Stacks, integrating the Stacks into Jolocom SSI solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The integration will enable any developer to easily add support for Stacks-based identities to their SSI service, and to build new SSI services (e.g. issuers, verifiers, mediators) with identities secured by the Stacks blockchain. Furthermore, the developed tools will also allow any user who owns a BNS name to easily derive a valid, globally resolvable DID and use it with various SSI services. Finally, the Jolocom SmartWallet will allow regular users to easily interact with SSI services secured by DIDs anchored on the Stacks network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, real-world activities providing any verifiable information for renting a bike or hotel room would happen in a much more seamless, secure, and privacy-preserving way. While the benefits of this technology will be globally available and relevant, we are applying to the Stacks Foundation with a time-sensitive opportunity to reach the European market with pilot projects that can really scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at Jolocom are looking forward to continuing our great partnerships in current and upcoming projects, as well as building many more partnerships in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				  In just a year, the Indicio Network has grown into the leading platform for enterprise-grade decentralized products and services—and a community of ground-breaking companies in decentralized and Web3 identity products and services  
			  
				
				
				 <p>What a year.</p>
<p>Last January, we launched the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio MainNet</a>, the keystone of the Indicio Network, a global platform designed to support mission critical uses of decentralized identity built on the open-source Hyperledger Indy code base.</p>
<p>The MainNet joined its older <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">TestNet</a> sibling, launched in 2020, and — in the summer of 2021 — both were joined by the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonet/">DemoNet</a>.</p>
<p>Together, they enabled companies to build and test their products (TestNet), demonstrate their products in a safe environment (DemoNet), and then deploy their products in a global &nbsp;marketplace with the assurance that they were backed by a robust, professionally staffed, global MainNet.</p>
<p>That assurance is critical. We know how long it takes to test and demo products. We know what enterprises need to create and sell products. We saw the need, we heard, repeatedly, from our earliest clients that’s what they needed; and so we made it a reality.</p>
<p>Now, in January 2022, our growing global network of nodes is supported by twenty-six diverse companies on five continents. Each is an innovator. All are committed to building a better way to manage digital identity and to create the trust in data needed for the machine, spatial, and Web3 age. Indicio is a global network for a technology that brings value to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes the Indicio Network the best network for decentralized identity solutions?<br>Decentralized identity networks are often likened to utilities for identity, so what do people, typically, want from utilities? Dependability, affordability, and simplicity</p>
<p>Dependability. There can’t be outages. If technical problems occur, they need to be fixed fast. The Indicio Network meets these challenges, first by scale. Each node on the network supports a copy of the ledger, so unlike Facebook going down, there are 26 other Facebooks to make sure your product, company, or organization isn’t in the dark.</p>
<p>Second, our network is staffed and monitored by experts using state-of-the-art monitoring tools. This may sound obvious—surely every network has this? But it isn’t and they don’t. We as a company build solutions on the Indicio Network. We have skin in the network working dependably. We need it to be the best functioning utility for identity out there. This means our staff are your staff in this endeavor. We’re here for you — all the time. Your success is our success.</p>
<p>Affordability. Writes to the ledger are one way to monetize decentralized identity. We believe in making fees for writing to our ledger simple, cost effective, and predictable. We also believe that these fees should not be an obstacle to implementing the right architecture for a solution. No decentralized identity system should cut corners to save money or from fear of unexpected future costs. We see affordability driving reliability, and reliability driving and sustaining adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simplicity. It’s no secret that decentralized identity can be tough to understand if you’re delving into it for the first time (and especially if you’re not an engineer). We get it! We want to make everything about decentralized identity as simple as possible, from onboarding a node to providing wizards to simplify technical processes and enabling machine-readable governance.</p>
<p>Still too complicated? We will host and run a node for you.</p>
<p>We also have the largest range of hands-on <a href="https://indicio.tech/training-workshops/">training workshops</a> for all aspects of decentralized identity—and we were chosen by Hyperledger to develop and run technical training programs.</p>
<p>This is what we built in 2021—and it’s amazing to look back at the year and all we — and our node operators — achieved. But it was even more exciting to see what people began building and releasing on this foundation, projects such as the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/resources/videos/happy-traveler-card/">Aruba Health Pass</a>, <a href="https://liquidavatartechnologies.com/the-liquid-avatar-verifiable-credentials-ecosystem/">LAVCE</a>, and <a href="https://www.thenewswire.com/press-releases/1k98Fpjr0-liquid-avatar-technologies-and-dynamics-inc-tap-payment-infrastructure-for-verification-of-digital-credentials.html">Passmate</a>.</p>
<p>As we move toward a more trustworthy digital world, 2022 is going to be one long, energetic build-athon. And if that excites you,<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"> we should talk</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know that until 2021 <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html">82.4 million people</a> have been forcibly displaced from their homes due to wars and conflicts? That’s almost the size of Germany’s population!</p><p>Yet, they are struggling for basic human needs such as food, clothing, and&nbsp;shelter.</p><p>Why?</p> An Identity&nbsp;Crisis <p>Much of their woes stem from the fact that they do not have the documents to prove their nationality or for that matter, even their refugee&nbsp;status.</p><p>Unfortunately, a majority of the documents that prove identity and nationality are in the form of physical documents such as a passport or driver’s license that can get lost, damaged, or stolen while fleeing from their country. Sometimes, it may even be left behind for security&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>As a result, many of these people become stateless and are unable to get refugee status or its benefits, and for the most part of their lives, languish in camps and work only in low-paying jobs.</p><p>The sad part is that this trickles down to their children as well, and the next generation of refugees are unable to study or find jobs because the parents don’t have the required documents.</p><p>In this sense, the state of refugees today is an identity crisis as they do not have documents to prove their identity and nationality.</p> What is the Solution? <p>From the above discussion, it’s clear that every refugee requires an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">identity</a> that would enable that person and his/her family members to get the refugee benefits offered by the host&nbsp;country.</p><p>Ideally, the document must&nbsp;be,</p>  Verifiable, so the refugee can get access to financial and non-financial benefits under treaties and host nation programs.  Easy to access from anywhere, so an individual can digitally prove his or her educational credentials and job experience to make it easy for them to find work in the host&nbsp;nation.  Stored in a safe&nbsp;place.  Tamper-proof.  From a competent authority that is trustable by anyone in any part of the world. For example, the government of a&nbsp;nation.  <p>While these conditions may sound daunting at first, the truth is we already have such an identity in place. It’s called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/is-ssi-the-disruptor-for-a-better-world-aec34cef6275">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and this is implemented through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p><p>The existing format of these VCs has to be simply extended to meet the requirements of the host nation, so every refugee can prove his or her identity and credentials in no&nbsp;time.</p> How can Verifiable Credentials Help? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a> meet all of the requirements mentioned above.</p><p>It is machine-verifiable, tamper-proof, and has the digital signatures of the entity that is authorized to issue&nbsp;it.</p><p>Here is how a VC&nbsp;looks.</p><p>As you can see, the cryptographic proof in the VC proves that it has come from an authorized entity while the identification details show the credentials of the holder. Furthermore, it cannot be tampered with or censored.</p><p>Let’s understand this with a real-world example.</p> Real-world Example <p>Let’s say Mr.X is forced out of his country due to war and he reaches the neighboring country but doesn’t have any physical document to prove his identity such as name, address, educational qualifications, work experience, etc.</p><p>Thankfully, he has them all in the form of a verifiable credential. So, he visits the Foreign Office of the host nation, logs into the office’s computer, generates a verifiable presentation, and shares the same with the government officials.</p><p>In turn, the officials scan the QR code and learn all about Mr. X. They check if he qualifies for the refugee status and grants the same through a&nbsp;VC.</p><p>Now, Mr.X is all set to move around the host nation, collect refugee allowances, study, find a job, and get on with&nbsp;life.</p><p>As you can see, the entire process takes only a few minutes and gives Mr. X a chance to start his life all over again. That’s the true power of&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Before we start dreaming about a pain-free world, note that VCs may not work well in all situations.</p> Are There Any Downsides? <p>There are a few problems that come with using VCs to handle refugee identities.</p><p>Let’s say Mr. X is going to his neighboring country because of political persecution. Knowing this, his country revokes all the VCs issued for him. As a result, he can no longer use the VCs to prove his identity, though he can use VCs issued by his employer and educational institutions, provided they are not <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">revoked</a>.

 Stories from the UK and&nbsp;Ghana <p>In 2021, together with <a href="https://habitusinsight.com/">Habitus Insight</a>, we explored stories on the human impact of identity exclusion for <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/home">Women in Identity</a>. This is the first of two blogs on that research — the following blog will share the findings from the UK and&nbsp;Ghana.</p><p>As part of that work, we spoke to several people who have experienced ID exclusion. Va-Bene is a transwoman — or as she calls herself, a transvatar — based in Kumasi, Ghana. She faces challenges every time she goes to a physical bank branch. Her IDs (and particularly the photos on them) don’t reflect who she is&nbsp;now.</p><p>“If I have to withdraw money with my ATM card, that is fine. But any other thing I will do directly in the bank. Believe me, either we are going to fight in the bank or I’m just going to be delayed for several hours without any money.” Being denied access to her own money not only has a direct financial impact on Va-Bene. It also has an emotional impact: “it is very frustrating when I am excluded. Very, very frustrating. Very depressing.”</p> “Know Your Customer” and existing challenges of exclusion <p>In her book <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780199463510.001.0001/oso-9780199463510">In Pursuit of Proof</a>, Tarangini Sriraraman documents how “identification” began as a need to recognise individuals for governance, but has become a process heavily shaped by social norms. Why is gender an important characteristic for identification? Who decides how that is categorised (male/female)? What happens when gender goes beyond binary, as in Va-Bene’s case?</p><p>“Know Your Customer” (KYC) is a legal requirement to comply with anti-money laundering regulations (AML) in most countries. Verification requirements to access financial services often include database checks, identity document verification, and, increasingly, biometric checks. For proof of address, utility bills or bank statements can often serve as acceptable documentation. By verifying a customer’s identity and intentions when they open an account, and then understanding transaction patterns, financial institutions can more accurately pinpoint potential account takeover or other suspicious activities.</p><p>However, many people get stuck when trying to prove who they are (like Va-Bene) or where they live. Obtaining an ID can be a time-consuming and expensive process, made more challenging for those who are <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/why-is-id-important-for-women/home">female</a>, from an ethnic or racial minority background, live in a rural area or with a disability, or are <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/report-launch-identity-at-the-margins-identification-systems-for-refugees-69466244fa62">refugees or migrants</a>. <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/early-financial-inclusion-can-lead-to-exclusion-experiences-of-kenyan-youth-eb99c7476d7d">Youth, too, are emerging as a demographic</a> facing barriers to ID. Often these issues include not having a proof of address (being without a fixed address, having recently arrived in the country, or for other reasons) or not being able to easily prove who one is (not having <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/types-id-systems">foundational ID</a> documentation). These challenges can become even harder to address without knowledge of where to go or what to do&nbsp;next.</p><p>Interview with Payal, a recently arrived migrant in northwest London, UK, who faced challenges opening a bank account without proof of&nbsp;address.</p> Next steps <p>In addition to Va-Bene and Payal, we spoke to a range of participants who are or who have felt excluded from financial systems for different reasons and we’ll be sharing these stories over the next few months. This research is the foundation for Women in Identity to build an Identity Code of Conduct — a set of guiding principles and a framework for inclusive ID-product development.</p><p>Nowhere is this more necessary than in financial services, where ID is needed to protect users (e.g., from financial crime), but at the same time provide access to specific products. Service providers need to know who users are, but how does that process happen, why, and when does it become problematic? The Identity Code of Conduct will establish a set of guiding principles around inclusion, building on the broader <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/principles">Digital ID Principles</a>. It will offer a practical set of tools to address inclusion at every stage of identification.</p> Note from Women in Identity: <p>At <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/">Women in Identity</a> we believe identity solutions should be inclusive, built for all, by all. But we also believe this does not happen by&nbsp;chance.</p><p>The aim of our initial research and videos is to work towards this Code of Conduct: a practical guide for product designers to gain deeper empathy for the challenges experienced at the user end of the ID lifecycle and the knowledge to take these challenges into account when designing products.</p><p>Other sectors already take this approach to product development. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has an ongoing Code of Practice based on principles of care, fairness, honesty, and respect that impact agreed standards of product development (e.g., clear and transparent information on packaging).</p><p>We believe we can learn from other industries and create an Identity Code of Conduct which ensures inclusion is built into identity product design, thus making these products better for the organisations that rely on them and for the people that use&nbsp;them.</p><p>We look forward to you joining us on this journey and welcome feedback and suggestions. Please reach out to us on @WomenInID on Twitter or @WomenInIdentity on LinkedIn!</p><p>Read more about this project at <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/code-of-conduct">ID Code of Conduct</a> and follow us at @womeninID @WomenInIdentity @CaribouDigital @habitusinsight #DiversityByDesign #ForAllByAll #IDCodeofConduct #IdentityExclusion</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-human-impact-of-identity-exclusion-in-financial-services-ce1e0d769389">The human impact of identity exclusion in financial services</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Introduction to Server Blazor apps 

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor">Blazor</a> is an exciting new technology from Microsoft that will allow developers to bring C# to clients. Server and client components are written in the same language and can be used and re-used interchangeably. Blazor comes in two flavors, server and client apps. In this tutorial you will be working with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-6.0">Server Blazor</a> apps, where the C# code is run on the server, and messages are exchanged using <code>SignalR</code>.</p>

<p>I’ll show you how to integrate Okta with a server-side Blazor app. Then you will learn how to use Okta’s multi-factor authentication system to provide an additional layer of security. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a technology in which a user must present two or more credentials before they can successfully gain access to complete a login or other transaction.   There are a number of ways this can be accomplished.  The most common is to email or text message a code to a user after the user is authenticated.  The user can then verify the code thus establishing that the user knows the proper credentials but also has access to the phone number or email address of record.</p>

 What you’ll need 

 
   Your favorite IDE (I will be using Visual Studio 2019, but Visual Studio Code is another great option.) 
   A <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">git repository</a> 
   .NET <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0">5</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer Account</a> 
   The <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> tool 
 

 Create your Okta application 

<p>Using the Okta CLI, <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/apps/create/">create a new Okta app</a> for .NET Blazor. Or, use your Okta admin portal to accomplish this: Navigate to Applications, click on <code>Create App Integration</code>, select OIDC for <code>Sign in Type</code>, Web for <code>Application Type</code>, and fill out the specifics for your localhost environment.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select ASP.NET Core. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>https://localhost:44378/authorization-code/callback</code> and use <code>https://localhost:44378/signout/callback</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/aspnetcore3/create-okta-application/">Create a ASP.NET Core App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Once you have completed an Okta application setup you will need to enable multi-factor authentication and then enable it on your application. Now, navigate to the admin portal and under Applications select the application you just created. Click on Sign on and under the Sign on Policy section click on Add Rule.</p>

<p>Under the Access section click on Multifactor Settings. For this application you will only be enabling SMS Authentication but you can see the Factor Types that Okta allows on this page. Under the SMS Authentication tab set the drop-down to Active.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Return to the Rule page and click Prompt for factor and then click Every sign on. Give your new rule a name and click Save. This sign-on policy will now trigger for anyone who attempts to sign on to this application.</p>

<p></p>

 Create your Blazor application 

<p>Open Visual Studio 2019 and select Create a new project. Find the Blazor App entry on the Create a project page.  Please note, if you are using a different version of Visual Studio your project create templates may look different.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Under the Create a new Blazor app section select Blazor Server App and give it a minute to set up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once it does you will see the Configure your new project screen.  Name your project Okta_ServerDemo and press Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After setup is complete, take a minute to run the application and see how Blazor is set up. For this tutorial, the demo application that comes with Blazor setup is enough. We will need to make some changes to the application though.</p>

 Set up your application 

<p>First install the <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> package from NuGet via the Command Line or NuGet package manager. This will make integration with Okta quick and easy.</p>

   <code>Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 4.0.0
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and edit the code with the following.</p>

 <code>{
  "DetailedErrors": true,
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>If you don’t know where to find the values for your Okta settings, you should be able to find them in <code>.okta.env</code>. You can also retrieve them from the Okta admin console.</p>

<p>You can now alter your <code>Startup.cs</code> to configure authentication using Okta.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Okta_ServerDemo.Data;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;

namespace Okta_ServerDemo
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddRazorPages();
            services.AddServerSideBlazor();
            services.AddSingleton&lt;WeatherForecastService&gt;();

            services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
            {
                options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
            })
           .AddCookie()
           .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
           {
               OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
               ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
               ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
               Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
           });
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
                // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
                app.UseHsts();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();

            app.UseStaticFiles();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
            {
                endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
                endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

 Write your application 

<p>Next, you can turn your attention to the pages. First, you will want to edit <code>App.razor</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>&lt;CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
    &lt;Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly" PreferExactMatches="@true"&gt;
        &lt;Found Context="routeData"&gt;
            &lt;AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;Authorizing&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Determining session state, please wait...&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/Authorizing&gt;
                &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;Sorry&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;You're not authorized to reach this page. You need to log in.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;UserComponent&gt;&lt;/UserComponent&gt;
                &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
            &lt;/AuthorizeRouteView&gt;
        &lt;/Found&gt;
        &lt;NotFound&gt;
            &lt;LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/LayoutView&gt;
        &lt;/NotFound&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
</code>   

<p>Much of this page is boilerplate from the setup process. But you need to make a few important changes. First, wrap the entire code in the <code>CascadingAuthenticationState</code> element. This will cascade the authentication state to each of your routes. Next, you need to change <code>RouteView</code> to <code>AuthorizeView</code> and handle the <code>Authorizing</code> and <code>NotAuthorized</code> states.</p>

<p>At this point, you may have noticed that <code>UserComponent.razor</code> doesn’t exist, so create that now in the <code>Shared</code> folder. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>&lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;a href="logout"&gt;Log out&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;a href="login?redirectUri=/"&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
</code>   

<p>This component makes use of the <code>CascadingAuthenticationState</code> from above and presents two different views. If the user is logged in, then you display a logout button. If the user is unauthorized, present them with a login button.</p>

<p>The two routes here, <code>login</code> and <code>logout</code> need to be implemented next. Under Pages, add a new <code>RazorPage</code> called <code>Login</code>. Razor pages are created with two components, a <code>cshtml</code> file and a <code>.cs</code> file. Since your login page is hosted by Okta you do not need any presentation in the <code>.cshtml</code> file. However, you still need to tell the page which model file to use. Open <code>Login.cshtml</code> and add the following code.</p>

 <code>@page
@model Okta_ServerDemo.Pages.LoginModel


@{
   
}
</code> 

<p>Next, open <code>Login.cshtml.cs</code> and add the login logic.</p>

   <code>using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_ServerDemo.Pages
{
    public class LoginModel : PageModel
    {
        public async Task OnGet(string redirectUri)
        {
            await HttpContext.ChallengeAsync(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme, new AuthenticationProperties
            {
                RedirectUri = redirectUri
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This code should look familiar if you’ve used Okta with any ASP.NET application. You’re simply returning the <code>Challenge</code> provided by Okta. This will redirect the user to the Okta login page.</p>

<p>After you authenticate, you’ll either be asked for your phone number or prompted to send a code to your phone. This depends on whether you’ve set up your phone in Okta yet. If you haven’t, add your phone number to your account and verify the code; otherwise, click Send Code and then verify the code on this page. And just like that, your application is now secure with MFA using Okta! You can select several MFA methods found on <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/mfa/mfa-home.htm">Okta’s site</a>, ranging from email and phone codes to physical authenticators.</p>

<p>Now you can add the <code>Logout</code> page the same way you added the <code>Login</code> page. Again, since there is no presentation here your <code>.cshtml</code> file will declare the model page without any HTML.</p>

 <code>@page
@model Okta_ServerDemo.Pages.LogoutModel
@{
}
</code> 

<p>Your <code>Logout.cshtml.cs</code> file will contain the stock ASP.Net Core logout logic.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_ServerDemo.Pages
{
    public class LogoutModel : PageModel
    {
        public SignOutResult OnGet()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(
                new[]
                {
                     OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                     CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
                },
                new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, the <code>Counter</code> and <code>FetchData</code> pages will require user authentication.</p>

<p>Open <code>Counter.razor</code> and add the <code>@attribute [Authorize]</code> annotation.</p>

 <code>@page "/counter"

@attribute [Authorize]

&lt;h1&gt;Counter&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current count: @currentCount&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
</code> 

<p>This code is almost identical to the boilerplate code except for the <code>Authorize</code> attribute at the top of the page. Like ASP.Net Core, this attribute will require the user to be logged in before accessing it.</p>

<p>Similarly, edit the <code>FetchData.razor</code> file with the following code.</p>

 <code>@page "/fetchdata"

@using Okta_ServerDemo.Data
@inject WeatherForecastService ForecastService

@attribute [Authorize]

&lt;h1&gt;Weather forecast&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This component demonstrates fetching data from a service.&lt;/p&gt;

@if (forecasts == null)
{
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loading...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
}
else
{
    &lt;table class="table"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Temp. (C)&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Temp. (F)&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Summary&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
            @foreach (var forecast in forecasts)
            {
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;@forecast.Date.ToShortDateString()&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;@forecast.TemperatureC&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;@forecast.TemperatureF&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;@forecast.Summary&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
            }
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
}

@code {
    private WeatherForecast[] forecasts;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        forecasts = await ForecastService.GetForecastAsync(DateTime.Now);
    }
}
</code> 

<p>Again the only change here is the addition of the <code>Authorize</code> attribute.</p>

 Test your application 

<p>Now start the application and navigate to the <code>Counter</code> page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will see the message found on your <code>App.razor</code> page. Click on the Login button and walk through the authentication and MFA process. Once you’re logged in, you should be presented with the `** page.</p>

 Building the infrastructure and delivering the tools for&nbsp;Web3  Introduction <p>2021 draws to a close with Web3 firmly establishing itself in the consciousness of the crypto community. Perhaps more importantly, we have started to see signs that it is transcending into the minds of those outside of the cryptosphere. Web3, in its association with the Metaverse, looks set to capture the imaginations of people worldwide in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Ontology has worked on bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through providing decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions. From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not&nbsp;changed.</p><p>Our goal for 2022 is to make the Ontology high-speed, low-cost, public blockchain, the blockchain of choice for Web3 applications. Ontology’s efforts in creating interoperability between the different public chains, including the upcoming Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) launch, will provide the opportunity to incubate more high-quality Web3 applications in the new year across a multitude of industries and services.</p><p>Beyond providing a blockchain to build Web3 applications, delivering ease of access and a seamless experience is essential to the user experience. That is why ONTO Wallet aims to become the access point of choice in 2022, providing the easiest access to Web3 for every user by allowing them to own their identity and data. This approach of empowering developers and users alike, to build and experience together, underlines Ontology’s goals for&nbsp;2022.</p> Decentralized Identity and&nbsp;Data <p>Web3 should allow you to have self-sovereign identity and data, and it should allow you to choose which parts of your online existence, or perhaps we should say your existence in the Metaverse, you’d like to share with each other. This requires technical interconnectivity and interoperability, as well as more philosophical and collaborative discussions across the entire community for how identity is defined and&nbsp;changed.</p><p>In the end, there will not be a single blockchain, but rather a collection of different chains, each with their own characteristics, benefits, and subcultures. Whilst there will be competition, there is also tremendous opportunity for collaboration for the benefit of the overall ecosystem and user experience.</p><p>Ontology will continue to optimize deeper product integrations across different blockchains. With a focus on DID and data, users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence.</p><p>The launch of the new <a href="http://ont.id">ONT.ID</a> website brings us 1 step closer. ONT ID, ONT Login, and ONT TAG empower both developers and users by providing cost-effective and private methods to authenticate and manage their identities.</p> Multi-VM <p>Virtual Machines (VMs) play a crucial role in both the aforementioned need for interoperability and in the expansion of applications built on Ontology. By taking a Multi-VM approach, Ontology maximizes interoperability and allows more developers to create in the development languages they are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022, and represents the culmination of all the hard work by the team that began at the start of 2021 when Ontology’s tech team first began developing the Ontology EVM. The EVM aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform and to offer an inclusive experience to developers and users. The new VM will join a suite of existing VMs, which include the Native (Ontology) VM, NeoVM, and&nbsp;WasmVM.</p><p>This is a crucial step in the realization of the Ontology Multi-VM. It adds to the opportunities provided by the WasmVM, which allows more traditional developers to deploy apps on the blockchain. As the most common virtual machine used on the traditional Internet, the support of Wasm also prepared Ontology for big-scale Web2 applications to transition to Web3 in the near&nbsp;future.</p><p>From a dApp development perspective, the Multi-VM approach taken by Ontology allows dApps to be integrated into multiple platforms. This boosts long-term growth for cross-chain dApps, exposing them to a larger user base and to receive all the benefits offered by the various alternative chains.</p> Web3 <p>This Multi-VM approach, combined with a focus on DID and data, brings us back to the importance of Web3. Since the very beginning, Ontology has been building the infrastructure necessary for a cross-chain, interoperable Web3.</p><p>Ontology will continue to vigorously develop the following products, already familiar to the community:</p><p><a href="http://ont.id/">ONT ID</a> will be optimized to be more applicable to all blockchains, including products like ONT TAG, ONT Login, and OScore. Over 1.5 million users now manage their digital identity using ONT ID, with control over how, when, and with whom their data is shared. Furthermore, we continue to work on the design of more DID products for developers to further expand DID applications.</p><p><a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, as the essential gateway for every individual to Web3, aims to provide crucial infrastructure for a seamless Web3 experience. Over the past year, we have seen tremendous growth in ONTO users (over 750K), and its social influence, with 30 times increase in social media channels and communities.</p><p>With ONTO, users can create their decentralized identities and verify credentials, powered by Ontology’s decentralized identity framework. The ONT ID digital identity wallet allows users to use a single private key to log into their multi-chain wallets. They can also manage their digital assets, including NFTs, perform cross-chain swaps, keep up-to-date with the latest industry developments and events via the ONTO news feed, and enjoy access to a full range of dApps anywhere and anytime, available as both mobile and web applications. Moving forward, ONTO will continue to expand its multiple chains assets and dApps support, making Web3 easily accessible in the palm of your&nbsp;hand.</p><p>The decentralized digital asset and distribution tool, <a href="https://anydrop.ont.io/">ONTO Anydrop</a>, also provides faster, cheaper, and more convenient event support for our partners, and will continue to benefit the expansion of our ecosystem.</p><p><a href="http://wing.finance">Wing Finance</a> will continue to utilize Ontology’s decentralized reputation solution for DeFi projects. Its unique and pioneering Inclusive Pool, coupled with Ontology’s OScore, allows people to under-collateralize assets and maximize their borrowing capabilities based on Web3-native credit and reputation scores.</p><p>Ontology will continue to work with Wing to develop further product lines, which will enable more types of assets to be lent, borrowed, and collateralized. There will also be continued expansion of accessibility, allowing more users to enter the DeFi ecosystem.</p><p><a href="http://protocol.sagamarket.io">SAGA</a> provides data management in the Web3 era. Offering a decentralized alternative, where the data providers remain in control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Thanks to these platforms and more, whether it is DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, or one of the countless other innovative decentralized applications, Ontology is well placed to support their development and expansion. Ontology will keep developing more easy-to-use products and tools to meet the requirements of the era, making Web3 available to everyone, whilst maintaining the security and privacy of users, and bringing a decentralized experience to the&nbsp;world.</p> Looking Ahead <p>2021 draws to a close and 2022 promises to bring us closer to Web3 than ever before. Four years of work has positioned Ontology as a leader in the space, through the development of products focused on DID and data, and by taking a Multi-VM approach.</p><p>The upcoming launch of the Ontology EVM will bring the benefits of Ontology to a new, larger audience. More applications will be built on the Ontology network, expanding the opportunities for developers and users alike. The relevance and application of the Ontology approach extend to the entirety of Web3, regardless of the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>No doubt 2022 will bring new tech advancements, alongside ecosystem growth.

<p>More than 7 billion people walk the face of the earth, and more than half (4.66 billion, to be specific) of us have access to the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>People love the internet because it makes everything easier. We buy and sell, we communicate with people from anywhere, and for most of us, our source of livelihood is heavily connected to the connected world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But (and there’s always a but), nothing’s perfect, not even the revolutionary “interconnected network.” The internet’s problems are underneath one overarching concern —security and fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what does this all have to do with online marketplaces? Easy—they are big and just getting bigger. Thus, they are like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, especially for fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 So why are online marketplaces a big deal?&nbsp; 



<p>Online marketplaces can be described as “advanced department stores”.&nbsp; They are digital points (websites or apps) that facilitate shopping for several buyers and sellers, with Amazon being the best example. Not actually owning any inventory, its essence is to create a platform for numerous sellers to display their merchandise to attract and make transactions with all the buyers who use that platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Basically, online marketplaces are the new way to shop. Everything from housing, consumer goods, automobiles, and digital services are accessible through online marketplaces. Plus, they are super convenient, especially from a buyer’s perspective, and that’s why they’ve been so successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the United Kingdom alone, Amazon, eBay, and Etsy get around <a href="https://www.webretailer.com/b/online-marketplaces-uk/">700 million visits</a> per month to their websites. Furthermore, several of the world’s fastest-growing online marketplaces are from Europe, which are included in our detailed eBook.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The prevalence of online marketplaces in Europe is the secret behind the geometrically progressive growth of e-commerce in Europe. Europe’s e-commerce sector is expected to be worth <a href="https://www.arcade.global/blog/online-marketplaces-europe-2021/">$575 billion by 2025</a>, and you can bet your bottom dollar (or your choice currency) that online marketplaces will be at the centre of that boom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s what makes them a big deal.&nbsp;</p>



 Online Marketplace Fraud: The Spoilsport&nbsp; 



<p>Online marketplaces are a treasure trove for fraudulent activities, and there are very few issues that keep the marketplace operator awake at night, like online marketplace fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, the United Kingdom lost around 400 million pounds to e-commerce fraud. And more than half of these instances of fraud took place on online marketplaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s not just the United Kingdom that’s getting torn apart by fraudsters, as countries like Poland, Hungary, and Malta having a higher fraud rate than the UK. Rather, it’s the whole of Europe. But that should come as no surprise since Europe dominates around <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/online_fraud_2017.pdf">40% of global B2C e-commerce</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Two things which make online marketplace fraud very dangerous:&nbsp; 



<p>The first is obvious. The simple fact that marketplace operators, buyers and suppliers suffer enormous financial loss makes incidences of fraud undesirable. No one likes to lose money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second is less obvious to everyone else except marketplace operators. Marketplace fraud is the easiest way to create a horrible user experience, lose customers and ultimately go out of business. A pest infestation of a field of corn offers a near-perfect analogy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless the right fraudulent strategies are implemented, a single fraudulent event is always a harbinger of more fraudulent events.&nbsp;</p>



 What makes online marketplaces attracted to fraudsters?&nbsp; 



<p>In one word:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more successful your marketplace becomes, the more attractive it looks to fraudsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most online marketplaces don’t just connect buyers with sellers; they also facilitate transactions. Online marketplace operators receive, pay and hold money for their platform users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ability to receive, pay and hold money is like a clarion call to unwanted third parties. They want to get in on the act and divert money for themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Granted, the desire to divert may not be enough until you add that these parties to the transaction are strangers to each other. They are transacting on faith and trust that both the operator and the person on the other side is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combine sufficient liquidity with invisibility, and you’ll quickly discover that someone somewhere ends up with something that isn’t theirs. No one knows this better than fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 Examples of online marketplace fraud&nbsp; 



  Fake money, real goods:&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Online Marketplace purchasers posing as fraudsters will acquire real goods and services without paying for them.&nbsp;</p>



  Real money, fake goods and services:&nbsp;  



<p>This is also known as marketplace supplier fraud. What typically happens here is that a supplier takes a confirmed order for goods or services and does not actually provide anything in return.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Where do fraudsters make their first move?&nbsp; 



<p>The typical gateway for fraudsters is at the initial entry point into the online marketplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonymity is a necessary tool for fraudsters, and the best time to create that anonymity is during customer onboarding. Fraudsters typically choose false profiles rather than create accounts with real identities behind them. These fraudulent profiles appear legitimate to the unsuspecting eye, so business carries on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you look closely, you may discover a few things. For example, a purchaser account might contain the exact same details as a supplier account, with the profile name being the only difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is precisely why the best fraud prevention strategy is to leverage a system that validly identifies new customers. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to disable systems in the marketplace software that allow people to sign up without connecting their true identities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thankfully, marketplace operators don’t have to start from scratch with identity verification because most citizens already have a recognised identity document. All that is left is to choose a service that can verify a person’s ID document and biometrics to check whether a person behind the transaction is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Yesterday, Google has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/raising-the-bar-in-security-operations">announced</a> that it has acquired <a href="https://www.siemplify.co/blog/siemplify-is-joining-forces-with-google/">Siemplify</a>, a well-known provider of security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) solutions, for an undisclosed amount. The stated strategic goal of this acquisition is to “change the rules on how organizations hunt, detect, and respond to threats”. The SOAR capabilities of the Siemplify platform will be integrated into Google’s own Chronicle security analytics platform to provide even better visibility and productivity for security analysts.</p>
<p>Now, at the first glance, one could simply ask: “What’s the big deal? Acquisitions happen all the time, especially in the cybersecurity market nowadays”. However, there are a few interesting observations to be made here that go beyond this particular purchase.</p>
<p>First of all, Google has never been seen by the public as a “security vendor”. Despite operating one of the world’s largest clouds and playing a role of an identity provider for (literally) billions of users worldwide, we usually don’t hear much about cybersecurity from Google (although to be fair, we don’t hear much about Google’s security problems, as opposed to some of its largest competitors). However, the appearances can be deceiving – just last summer the company has pledged to invest $10 billion in cybersecurity over the next five years, and an acquisition of a SOAR technology is just a small part of this strategy.</p>
 What is SOAR anyway? 
<p>Emerging less a decade ago, SOAR was hailed as a means to finally make traditional SIEMs useful and, more generally, to centralize the management and automation of multiple security tools in a single interface for security analysts. The biggest selling point of having a separate SOAR tool is its ability to integrate with a variety of existing SIEM, XDR, or other platforms that typically power a modern security operations center.</p>
<p>SOAR solutions usually provide several key capabilities:</p>
 
 Security data collection and enrichment – either on their own or through a bidirectional integration with existing SIEM platforms; 
 Security orchestration and automation – by implementing playbooks and automated workflows across disparate security tools and to let analysts concentrate on more creative tasks; 
 Incident Response – by coordinating mitigation activities across multiple teams, departments, and systems. Here the degree of automation might vary from opening support tickets to autonomous isolation and cleanup of malicious activities. 
 
<p>Siemplify was notably one of the few remaining independent SOAR vendors. This is not the first and certainly won't be the last acquisition in this space. A few SOAR specialist vendors we covered in the 2020 edition of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80016/security-orchestration-automation-and-response-soar">Leadership Compass on SOAR solutions</a>&nbsp;have been acquired in the meantime as well. Stay tuned for further updates: KuppingerCole is in the process&nbsp;of updating the SOAR Leadership Compass for 2022.</p>
<p>The trend is however completely logical and predictable from the start – since the primary strategic goal for every digital business is to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80476/security-fabric-a-methodology-for-architecting-a-secure-future">reduce the overall complexity</a> of their security architectures, having yet another standalone tool is not the best idea. Rather, most customers would prefer seeing SOAR capabilities integrated directly into their favorite SOC platforms. For security vendors, such technology acquisitions have always been absolute no-brainers, but nowadays, even companies that, like Google or Microsoft, were never calling themselves security vendors, see such investments as extremely important.</p>
 Security as a brand reputation factor 
<p>In the era of large-scale data breaches and constant cyber-attacks, being perceived as a “secure vendor” is crucial for every cloud service provider, and every major one now has a broad portfolio of services to assure their customers that their sensitive data and critical workloads remain safe at any time. However, while some vendors (like AWS or Oracle) are primarily focusing on protecting their own customers with their “cloud-native” (in other words, proprietary) solutions, others (like IBM and now Google) see multi-cloud support and open ecosystems as a potential competitive advantage.</p>
<p><a href="https://chronicle.security/">Google Chronicle</a> is an interesting example of the latter strategy. Created with a vision of a security analytics platform with unlimited scalability and intelligent automation, Chronicle harnesses Google Cloud’s infrastructure to offer a platform for managing security data at a petabyte scale. Although it is not positioned as a SIEM, it does offer all the features typically found in one: ingesting, retaining, and analyzing massive amounts of network and security telemetry from a variety of sources, including an ecosystem of third-party partners.</p>
<p>On top of this, Chronicle offers a range of tools for incident investigation, threat hunting, and attack detection. Adding SOAR capabilities from Siemplify will make Chronicle a very capable, scalable, and open security analytics service you’ve probably never heard about. Which is a shame, actually. Perhaps one thing Google still has to learn from its competitors is to invest more into spreading awareness about their newest developments in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Speaking of awareness – we’re planning to publish a new Leadership Compass report on the market segment of Intelligent SIEM Platforms soon. We’re covering over 20 solutions in this report, both big and small, including Google Cloud among the vendors to watch. Stay tuned!</p>

			<p>Leading crypto exchange <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/">BitMEX</a> today announced its partnership with <a href="http://tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>, a leading tokenisation service provider, to help launch its highly-awaited BMEX token.</p>
<p>Tokeny contributed its technical expertise and advice during the token’s development phase in 2021, and is working alongside the BitMEX team to ensure the smooth rollout of the token’s launch phase, which is taking place in early 2022.</p>
<p>BMEX is an ERC-20 token with a maximum supply of 450 million – many of which will be used to reward new and existing BitMEX users. The token will incentivise participation within the growing BitMEX ecosystem, giving token holders trading discounts, enhanced yield on <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/earn?utm_source=Media+Release&amp;utm_medium=Media+Release&amp;utm_campaign=EARN&amp;utm_content=EARN+Launch">EARN</a> products, early access to new products, and more.</p>
<p>For a limited time, users will get the chance to earn as much BMEX as possible by participating in contests and giveaways. Just yesterday, the exchange unlocked its latest welcome offer: the first 10,000 new users who complete KYC and subscribe to <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/earn?utm_source=Media+Release&amp;utm_medium=Media+Release&amp;utm_campaign=EARN&amp;utm_content=EARN+Launch">EARN</a> will receive up to 40 BMEX tokens. Subscribe 500+ USDT to receive 5 BMEX, 1,000+ USDT for 15 BMEX, and 2,000+ USDT for 40 BMEX as a reward.</p>

		 
	 
    BitMEX is fast becoming a full crypto exchange ecosystem to serve our growing user base. Our users always come first, and we launched BMEX to reward them for their loyalty. We chose to partner with Tokeny - one of the global leaders in the tokenisation technology space - to guide us in developing and issuing BMEX in the most secure way possible. Tokeny has a strong track record of working with major crypto players to streamline the token issuance process, and we’re glad to have brought them onboard to support the launch of BMEX.  Alexander HöptnerCEO of BitMEX

<p>Today, I’m going to put this statement to the test! First, I’ll show you how to run a secure, OAuth 2.0-protected, Java REST API that allows JWT authentication. Then, I’ll show you how to build a native image with GraalVM. Finally, I’ll compare Helidon to the most popular Java REST API frameworks: Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot.</p>
 
 
<p>My <a>Build Native Java Apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot</a> post compares startup times and memory usage of these three frameworks. How does Helidon perform? Read on!</p>

 Get started with Helidon 
 
 
<p>I created a GitHub repository you can clone and run to get started with Helidon quickly.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples.git
cd native-java-examples/helidon</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In a section below, I’ll show you how I created this example. First, let’s see how to run it.</p>
 
 
<p>Open the <code>helidon</code> directory in your favorite IDE, so you have easy access to the example’s project files.</p>
 
 






If you just want to see how to build a native image, skip to the <a>build a native Helidon app</a> section.



 
 
 
 
 Install a JDK with GraalVM 
 
 
<p>You will need a JDK with GraalVM and its <code>native-image</code> compiler. Using SDKMAN, run the following command and set it as the default:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 21.3.0.r17-grl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the native extension to the JDK:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gu install native-image</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run a Helidon Java API 
 
 
<p>In a terminal window, run <code>mvn package</code> to package the app into a JAR. Then use <code>java -jar</code> to run it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn package
java -jar target/helidon.jar</code> 
 
 
 






Helidon’s Maven Plugin doesn’t have a run command. You can install the <a href="https://helidon.io/docs/v2/#/about/05_cli">Helidon CLI</a> and run <code>helidon dev</code>. Running this command allows you to change code and automatically recompile and restart your application.



 
 
<p>If you open another terminal window and try to access it with HTTPie, you’ll get a 401 Unauthorized error.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>$ http :8080/hello

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Length: 0
Date: Tue, 4 Jan 2022 10:17:11 -0700
connection: keep-alive</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To make it so you can access this endpoint, you’ll need to generate an OAuth 2.0 access token and update the JWKS (JSON Web Key Sets) URL to yours (in this project’s <code>application.yml</code>).</p>
 
 






If you’re unsure what OIDC and OAuth 2.0 are, see <a>What the Heck is OAuth?</a>.



 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Take note of the <code>clientId</code> and <code>issuer</code> values. You’ll need those to get an access token and to configure each framework for JWT authentication.</p>
 
 
<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties</code> and change the Okta URL to match yours.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=${mp.jwt.verify.issuer}/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Stop your Helidon app with Ctrl+C, repackage it, and re-run it with ⬆️+Return.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn package
java -jar target/helidon.jar</code> 
 
 
 
 Generate an OAuth 2.0 access token 
 
<p>An easy way to get an access token is to generate one using <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a>. First, you must configure your application on Okta to use OpenID Connect’s implicit flow.</p>
 
 
<p>Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your browser. Go to the Applications section and select the application you just created. Edit its General Settings and add Implicit (Hybrid) as an allowed grant type, with access token enabled. Then, make sure it has <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> in its Login redirect URIs. Click Save and copy the client ID for the next step.</p>
 
 
<p>Now, navigate to the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> website. Fill in your client ID, and use <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> for the Authorize URI. The <code>state</code> field must be filled but can contain any characters. Select token for the response type.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Click Send Request to continue.</p>
 
 
<p>Once you have an access token, set it as a <code>TOKEN</code> environment variable in a terminal window.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJZMVRxUkRQbEFEcm1XN0dX...</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Test your Helidon API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Use HTTPie to pass the JWT in as a bearer token in the <code>Authorization</code> header.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should get a 200 response with your email address in it.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a native Helidon app 
 
 
<p>To compile this Helidon app into a native binary, run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn package -Pnative-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will take a few minutes to complete. My 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM took 2 min. 14 s. to finish.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it with <code>./target/helidon</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 $ ./target/helidon

 Create a Helidon app from scratch 
 
 
<p>You might be wondering, "how did you build a secure Helidon app"? Did I just hide the complexity? No. It only takes five steps to create the same app.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Install <a href="https://helidon.io/docs/v2/#/about/05_cli">Helidon’s CLI</a> and run <code>helidon init</code> or use Maven:</p>
 
 
 mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \

 -DarchetypeVersion=2.4.1 \
 -DgroupId=com.okta.rest \
 -DartifactId=helidon \
 -Dpackage=com.okta.rest 
 
 
 
<p>If you use <code>helidon init</code>, answer the questions like I did.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloResource</code> in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/rest/controller/HelloResource.java</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import io.helidon.security.Principal;
import io.helidon.security.SecurityContext;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import java.util.Optional;

import static javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Path("/")
    @Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext context) {
        Optional&lt;Principal&gt; userPrincipal = context.userPrincipal();
        return "Hello, " + userPrincipal.get().getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Enable and configure JWT security in <code>src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=${mp.jwt.verify.issuer}/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloApplication</code> class in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/rest</code> to register your resource and configure JWT authentication:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest;

import com.okta.rest.controller.HelloResource;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.auth.LoginConfig;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
import java.util.Set;

@LoginConfig(authMethod = "MP-JWT")
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClasses() {
        return Set.of(HelloResource.class);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Delete <code>GreetingsProvider</code>, <code>GreetResource</code>, and <code>MainTest</code> since they’re not used in this example.</p>
 
 
 rm src/main/java/com/okta/rest/Greet*
rm src/test/java/com/okta/rest/MainTest.java 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! Now you can start the app or build the native image as shown above.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Native Java startup time comparison 
 
 
<p>To compare startup times between Micronaut, Quarkus, Spring Boot, and Helidon, I first created native executables. You can run the following commands to do the same from the root directory of the example you cloned.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd micronaut
./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image

cd ../quarkus
./mvnw package -Pnative

cd ../spring-boot
./mvnw package -Pnative

# Helidon should already be built, but just in case it isn't
cd ../helidon
mvn package -Pnative-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I ran each image three times before I started recording the numbers. I then ran each command five times.</p>
 
 
<p>These numbers are from a 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM. I think it’s important to note that my WiFi connection was 9.88 Mbps down and 0.37 Mbps up (according to the Speedtest app).</p>
 

Table 1. Native Java startup times in milliseconds

<p>Helidon</p>
<p><code>./helidon/target/helidon</code></p>
<p>53.6</p>

<p>Spring Boot</p>
<p><code>./spring-boot/target/demo</code></p>
<p>59.2</p>



 
<p>The chart below should help you visualize this comparison.</p>
 

 

 
<p>I also tested the memory usage in MB of each app using the command below. I made sure to send an HTTP request to each one before measuring.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color &lt;executable&gt; | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I substituted <code>&lt;executable&gt;</code> as follows:</p>

<p>This data shows that Helidon has some work to do to catch up to its competition!</p>
 
 
<p>I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/bercut2000">Dmitry Alexandrov</a> about these numbers and he’s what he had to say:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The numbers may look higher than expected, but, in Helidon MP you’ve got a fully functional CDI container and full MicroProfile support, unlike other competitors. If you still require ultimate performance, you should try Helidon SE, which is a fully reactive "magic free" flavour of Helidon, designed for environments working under maximal pressure.</p>

<p>Here at&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>, we’re gearing up to celebrate&nbsp;<a href="https://staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-week/">Data Privacy Week 2022</a>&nbsp;from January 24 to 28.</p>



<p>The week-long event is an international effort to empower individuals and encourage businesses to respect privacy, safeguard&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">data</a>&nbsp;and enable trust. And that goal aligns nicely with what we do here at&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>.</p>



<p>Data Privacy Week is an annual opportunity to amplify the conversation about the real risks to our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data privacy</a> that exist in the highly connected digital world, and to encourage people to take action. For businesses, that could mean working with us to rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cybersafety solutions using our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;complete business toolkit. Read more about how our solutions&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/dr-paul-ashley-presents-on-how-to-solve-the-privacy-problem/">help solve the data privacy problem</a>.</p>



<p>We’re actively participating in this year’s Data Privacy Week, with our co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley presenting during&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/">The Rise of Privacy Tech (TROPT)</a>&nbsp;event on January 26 and 27 2022.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley will discuss “Progress and Pitfalls on the Path to Decentralization”, and we’ll bring you details of how you can catch this presentation closer to the time.</p>



<p>As a business in today’s highly connected digital world, there’s never been a better time to think hard about how you collect, store and share your customers’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. Certainly,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers worldwide</a>&nbsp;are calling for better stewardship of their personal information by business and government, especially as the United States lags well behind most of the rest of the world in developing a national data privacy regulation. Latest figures show&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">75% of Americans</a>&nbsp;want national data privacy standards and there’s useful discussion of what customer data&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/the-us-data-privacy-law-floor-what-deserves-basic-protections/">deserves basic privacy protections</a>. But while the US government clearly recognizes the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">national security risks</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>, it is yet to settle on a regulatory solution. We hope 2022 brings more progress.</p>



<p>So in the meantime, we encourage businesses to be proactive about how they protect their customers’ information. Joining in some of the Data Privacy Week 2022 activities and the wider&nbsp;<a href="https://staysafeonline.org/cybersecurity-awareness-month/">Cybersecurity Awareness Month</a>&nbsp;activities,&nbsp;which the National Cybersecurity Alliance and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched in October 2004, is a great place to start—as is talking to us about&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;would help your business.</p>

<p>While digital experiences are rapidly becoming the norm for mortgage lending, the verification process has largely remained a manual, paper-driven process. Fortunately, this is changing.</p>
<p>Finicity, a Mastercard company, is the only authorized report supplier that offers a digital, single-vendor solution for assets, income, and employment authorized for representation and warranty relief through both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. By automating the asset and income verification process, providing transaction data for rent payment history and providing a 10-day pre-closing report, we can help you streamline the approval process and in turn even be a more inclusive lender.&nbsp;</p>
 Approved by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae&nbsp; 
<p>Finicity is an authorized supplier for <a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">Freddie Mac’s Loan Product Advisor® AIM</a>, which automates borrower assets, income, and employment assessment for lenders. By leveraging the expertise of third-party service providers, AIM helps to deliver a simpler, more efficient loan origination process.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) validation service also accepts our <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/desktop-underwriter-validation-service/du-validation-service-verification-report-vendors">mortgage verification services</a> to independently validate borrower assets, income, and employment data—providing<a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty"> Day 1 Certainty®</a> on validated loan components. By digitally validating secure third-party data through DU, you can help eliminate the paper chase and help get your borrowers approved quicker.</p>
 Rent payment history in credit decisioning 
<p>On September 18, Fannie Mae introduced the inclusion of rent payments in their automated mortgage credit decisioning process in DU. Fannie Mae identifies recurring rent payments in bank statements and transaction data as a factor which could deliver a more <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/perspectives/helping-renters-unlock-door-homeownership">inclusive credit assessment</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For first-time homebuyers who may have a limited credit history but a strong rent payment history, the enhancement creates new opportunities for homeownership while still promoting safe lending. Fannie Mae <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/fannie-mae-introduces-new-underwriting-innovation-help-more-renters-become-homeowners">said 17% of applicants</a> who have not owned a home in the last three years and who did not receive a favorable mortgage recommendation could have instead received an “approved” or “eligible” recommendation if their rental payment history had been considered.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the rent payment history feature, Finicity provides a <a href="https://docs.finicity.com/finicity-lend-reports/#finicity-lend-report-list-7">Verification of Asset and Income (VOAI) report</a> through its Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) that includes up to 24 months of transaction data that Fannie Mae can use to identify rent payment history and provide a more favorable credit assessment.</p>
<p>The VOAI report can be called with a direct API or is available currently in <a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/">ICE Encompass and Encompass Consumer Connect,</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a> mortgage point-of-sale (POS) platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to VOAI, we’re pleased to announce that we now offer Verification of Asset (VOA) as a standalone product. Lenders can utilize Finicity’s VOA report to provide 12 months of data and participate in Fannie Mae’s rent history assessment. Lenders have the freedom to access two and 12 months of data to satisfy their own underwriting requirements, while VOA automatically sends 12 months to Fannie Mae, keeping the file GSE-compliant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VOA report is available via direct API connection or on most ecosystem platforms.</p>
 10-day pre-closing verification 
<p>Additionally, Finicity’s 10-day pre-closing reports provide just the right data GSEs need for 10-day verification of employment.</p>
<p>In adding a 10-day pre-closing report to our mortgage verification services, we have enabled lenders to receive only the data GSEs require for the 10-day verification. You can use these<a href="https://docs.finicity.com/refresh-reports-2/"> 10-day pre-closing reports</a> to view just your borrower’s employment status rather than refreshing our current full reports that contain financial data. This minimizes the introduction of new income data or other redundant and unnecessary underwriting changes.</p>
<p>One of the reports available is the VOE Transactions report, which contains 120 days of refreshed transactions with dates and description but no amounts or totals so that income is not re-assessed. It shows the latest direct deposits in the income streams so that it can be determined that the borrower is still being paid on their regular cadence.</p>
<p>Another option is the VOE Payroll report. This contains only employment status—no income or other data—so lenders can see that the individual is still employed according to their payroll provider.</p>
<p>Our 10-day pre-closing reports are part of MVS at no extra charge and are currently only available for lenders connecting directly to Finicity.</p>
<p>These new reports could help you improve accuracy and simplify the process of verifying employment within ten days of closing, which is simplifying the loan origination process even further without increasing risk. Because these products are part of Finicity MVS, you would no longer have to call your borrower’s employers to get the information or manually ask for any extra interaction from the borrower.</p>
 How can you access these 10-day pre-closing reports? 
<p>To pull the VOE reports today, your team will need to code directly to the endpoints. You can find<a href="https://docs.finicity.com/refresh-reports-2/"> documentation here</a>. As we integrate them further into LOS and POS platforms, they will be even easier for consumer loan officers to access.&nbsp;To see Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services in action,<a href="https://www.finicity.com/demo/"> request a demo here</a>.</p>

   Microservices are an increasingly popular architecture, as they allow you to split application development into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces. However, microservices introduce complexity when it comes to implementing authentication.

  <p>Microservices are an increasingly popular architecture, as they allow you to split application development into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces. However, microservices introduce complexity when it comes to implementing authentication. Generally, you only need to worry about one point of ingress for auth with a traditional monolithic application. Still, there are multiple ways to set things up with microservices and just as many authentication patterns to suit.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll see how to build a small demo application consisting of four microservices and a simple API gateway. I’ll share some handy patterns for securing access to the microservices. Here is a rough diagram of the intended architecture and a sequence diagram showing the flow of communication between components.</p>

<p>Rough architecture:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sequence diagram:</p>

<p></p>

 Implementation 

<p>Before you get started, there are some dependencies you will need to install in order to follow along. First, you’ll need <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a>, as this tutorial relies heavily on containers to run the microservices. If you do not already have Docker installed on your machine, please follow <a>Docker’s setup instructions</a> for your OS of choice.</p>

<p>This tutorial also heavily utilizes Okta for the various authentication patterns you will implement. As such, you will need to create an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta Developer account</a>. For now, create a free account. The tutorial will cover any operations you need to perform as they come up later.</p>

<p>Finally, for testing the APIs and authentication methods, make sure you have the latest version of <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a> installed. Postman dramatically simplifies the process of getting OAuth tokens and calling the APIs.</p>

<p>As this tutorial primarily focuses on the authentication patterns themselves, the actual microservices are not overly significant as long as you have an API to call. You can create some <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> projects to get a few microservices up and running. Though Laravel is a bit on the heavy side for such simple use cases, it is quick and easy to set up, comes with most of the libraries you will need out-of-the-box, and has a sound middleware system that you can use to implement these auth patterns. To create the Laravel projects, the official documentation suggests using the <code>laravel.build</code> site, which serves as a Bash script for you to run. It is a good idea to read the script yourself before piping it into Bash, so be sure to <a href="https://laravel.build/api-gateway?with=redis">review the script</a> before executing it if you are uncertain. It works by taking the <code>path</code> parameter and using that as the project name.</p>

 Getting started with microservices 

<p>To begin, create a directory to hold all of the microservices for this tutorial named something like <code>php-microservices-demo</code>. <code>cd</code> into this directory, and execute the following command: <code>curl -s "https://laravel.build/api-gateway?with=redis" | bash</code>. This will create a directory containing a Laravel project named <code>api-gateway</code>. Once this step is done, you will need to run it four more times like so; once for each of the microservices you will create:</p>

   <code># service a
curl -s "https://laravel.build/microservice-a?with=redis" | bash

# service b
curl -s "https://laravel.build/microservice-b?with=redis" | bash

# service c
curl -s "https://laravel.build/microservice-c?with=redis" | bash

# service d
curl -s "https://laravel.build/microservice-d?with=redis" | bash
</code>   

<p>Now our directory should contain five projects in total. These projects are intended to run with <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail">Laravel Sail</a>, but it isn’t optimal for running five of them simultaneously. Use Sail to install dependencies and execute <code>artisan</code> commands, but for running the APIs, create a new <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file in the tutorial directory. This file will allow you to start all the containers together. Luckily, because the APIs will be simple, you don’t even need databases for this, only the PHP containers. In your newly created <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, add the following content:</p>

   <code>version: '2.1'
networks:
 php_microservices_demo:
   external: true
services:
 api_gateway:
   build:

     dockerfile: Dockerfile

     dockerfile: Dockerfile
     args:
       WWWGROUP: '${GID}'
   image: sail-8.0/app
   extra_hosts:
     - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'

     dockerfile: Dockerfile
     args:
       WWWGROUP: '${GID}'
   image: sail-8.0/app
   extra_hosts:
     - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'
   environment:
     WWWUSER: '${UID}'
   volumes:
     - './microservice-d/:/var/www/html'
   networks:
     - php_microservices_demo

</code>   

<p>This file specifies the network that the containers will share as <code>php_microservices_demo</code>, which you will need to create. Do this now by running <code>docker network create php_microservices_demo</code> in your terminal. Next, expose your current User and Group IDs as environment variables for Bash, so Bash can map the correct permissions when it builds the images. To do this, run the following commands in your terminal:</p>

   <code>export UID=${UID:-$(id -u)} 
export GID=${GID:-$(id -g)}
</code>   

<p>The above command may return a warning about read-only variables depending on your OS. You can safely ignore this if it happens.</p>

<p>Now, if you run <code>docker-compose up -d</code> from the tutorial root directory, after a moment, you should be able to access the <code>api-gateway</code> Laravel project at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>Before you implement authentication, you’ll need to make some simple mock APIs so that you have something to test. To do this, you can define a single route for each of the four <code>microservice</code> applications—something like <code>api/service/</code>—and have this route return a string indicating which microservice it is. Then, the API gateway can define multiple routes that will forward requests appropriately to the microservices. Because the API gateway is the only container with port mapping in the <code>docker-compose</code> file, this will be the only way for you to access the internal microservices. To do this, add the following routes for each corresponding Laravel instance’s <code>routes/api.php</code> file:</p>

 API Gateway: 

   <code>Route::get('/service1', function(Request $request) {
   $response = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::get('http://microservice-a/api/service');
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response($response-&gt;body(), $response-&gt;status());
});

Route::get('/service2', function(Request $request) {
   $bearer = $request-&gt;bearerToken();
   $response = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::withToken($bearer)-&gt;get('http://microservice-b/api/service');
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response($response-&gt;body(), $response-&gt;status());
});

Route::get('/service3', function(Request $request) {
   $bearer = $request-&gt;bearerToken();
   $response = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::withToken($bearer)-&gt;get('http://microservice-c/api/service');
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response($response-&gt;body(), $response-&gt;status());
});
</code>   

 Microservice A: 

   <code>​​Route::get('/service', function (Request $request) {
   return \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::get('http://microservice-d/api/service');
});
</code>   

 Microservice B: 

   <code>Route::get('/service', function (Request $request) {
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response('success response from microservice b');
});
</code>   

 Microservice C: 

   <code>​​Route::get('/service', function (Request $request) {
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response('success response from microservice c');
});
</code>   

 Microservice D: 

   <code>Route::get('/service', function (Request $request) {
   return new \Illuminate\Http\Response('success response from microservice d');
});
</code>   

<p>Now, if you navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/api/service1</code> in your browser or Postman, you should see the response from one of your microservices via the API gateway. With this out of the way, you can implement your first authentication pattern.</p>

 JWT verification at the gateway 

<p>The first pattern is a simple JWT verification at the API gateway. All API requests going through the gateway will require a valid JWT access token. To do this, you can use Laravel middleware. A middleware refers to code you can configure to run when a request is received but before the Controller or function that the route definition specifies can handle it. In practice, this means that you can have a middleware component that checks for valid access tokens and returns an unauthorized response if no valid token is found.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, you can use Laravel Sail to execute <code>php artisan</code> commands inside your containers. To do this, navigate to the directory containing the codebase you want to run the command on—<code>api-gateway</code>, in this case—and run <code>./vendor/bin/sail up</code>. You’ll create some more containers running on your system. While they don’t matter much for the actual API, the containers provide a convenient way of executing PHP commands without custom tooling. At this point, you should also create an alias for Sail: <code>alias sail=./vendor/bin/sail</code>. The rest of the Sail commands in this tutorial will assume you have an alias like this configured for brevity.</p>

<p>After running <code>sail up</code> in another terminal, navigate back to the same <code>api-gateway</code> directory and run <code>sail php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwt</code>. This action will create the middleware used by the gateway to check the access tokens for incoming requests. While you are here, you will also need to install two composer dependencies to verify the JWTs. To do this, run the following command: <code>sail composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt</code>. Before fleshing out your newly created middleware, you will need to make a quick detour to the Okta Developer Portal to create an application so that your middleware has the details it needs to verify incoming JWTs.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://developer.okta.com">https://developer.okta.com</a> and either sign in or set up a new account. Next, navigate to applications on the sidebar and click Create App Integration.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select a new OIDC integration with a “single-page application” application type and then click Next. Fill out the details of your new app integration by choosing a name to help you identify it, setting the “Grant type” to “Authorization code” and the “Controlled access” to “Allow everyone in your organization to access.”</p>

<p>Note: We’re keeping things simple for now by using a single client ID throughout this whole tutorial. In practice, you’d probably want to use separate client IDs for your front-end application and each of your microservices so that you have better audit logs and can better control access.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once these steps are complete, you’ll receive a page showing your client ID and Okta domain. Make a note of both of these for later.</p>

<p>Next, navigate to the middleware you created—<code>api-gateway/app/Http/Middleware/VerifyJwt.php</code>—and set its content as follows:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;

class VerifyJwt
{
   /**
      * Handle an incoming request.
      *
      * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
      * @param  \Closure  $next
      * @return mixed
      */
   public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
   {

      $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
       	-&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
       	-&gt;setAudience(env('OKTA_AUDIENCE'))
       	-&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
       	-&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
       	-&gt;build();

      try {
       	$jwt = $jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());
       	return $next($request);
      } catch (\Exception $exception) {
       	Log::error($exception);
      }

      return response('Unauthorized', 401);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Then go to the<code>.env</code> file for the gateway, and add the following values:</p>

   <code>OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
OKTA_ISSUER_URI=https://{your okta domain}/oauth2/default
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={your client id}
</code>   

<p>Next, navigate to <code>api-gateway/app/Http/Kernel.php</code> and find the <code>$middlewareGroups</code> array. There should be a key of <code>'api'</code> with a corresponding array. In this array, add <code>\App\Http\Middleware\VerifyJwt::class</code> as a new item. This action will cause the middleware to run for any routes in the API group, including the ones you created earlier, to allow users to access the microservices. You can verify this by using Postman or your browser to access the same route from earlier—http://localhost:8080/api/service1 —except you should now be met with an unauthorized error, as you do not have a JWT yet.</p>

<p>To get a JWT, open Postman and create a new GET request. Open the Authorization tab, change the type to “OAuth 2.0,” and set Add authorization data to Request Header. Next, scroll down to the “Configure New Token” section and give it a name like “PHP microservices.” This name doesn’t affect anything besides how Postman displays it. Set the rest of the values as follows:</p>

 
   Grant Type: Authorization Code (With PKCE) 
   Callback URL: http://localhost:8080/login/callback 
   Auth URL: https://{{your okta domain}}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize 
   Access Token URL: https://{{your okta domain}}/oauth2/default/v1/token 
   Client ID: {{Your client ID}} 
   Scope: openid email 
   State: 1234 
   Client Authentication: Send client credentials in body 
 

<p>With these details set, when you click Get New Access Token, you should be presented with an Okta login window. Log in with your Okta Developer account details, and when the process completes, you should see your new token. Click Use Token to set it for this request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you have not already done so, finish creating the request by setting the URL as http://localhost:8080/api/service1, and click Send. After a short delay, you should get a response from the API gateway forwarded from one of your microservices. Bravo! You’ve implemented the first auth pattern successfully. With this pattern, the gateway verifies the JWT, and Microservice A does no further verification. It assumes that the gateway has already handled verification. This approach is only viable when the underlying microservice is not publicly accessible via the internet. It works well enough when the microservice must be accessed via a gateway, as is the case here.</p>

 JWT Scope Validation 

<p>The next pattern to implement will be for Microservice B. Microservice B will perform its own local JWT token validation and look for a particular scope on the token. If this scope is not present, it will reject the token, even if the gateway has already accepted it.</p>

<p>Your first step is to add a custom scope for Microservice B to seek. On the Okta portal, navigate to Security &gt; API on the sidebar, and select the default auth server from the list. Go to the Scopes tab and click Add Scope. Give it a name like <code>microservice-demo-scope</code> and fill out the rest of the details like so:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the next step, you’ll add the Microservice B middleware. If <code>sail up</code> is still running for the gateway, terminate this command (Control + C on macOS) and change the directory to Microservice B. Run <code>sail up</code> again. In another terminal, navigate to Microservice B’s directory.  Now run the following:</p>

   <code>sail composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt
sail php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwtWithScope
</code>   

<p>Once you’ve run these commands, open the new middleware located at <code>microservice-b/app/Http/Middleware/VerifyJwtWithScope.php</code> and set the contents as follows:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Arr;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\UnauthorizedHttpException;

class VerifyJwtWithScope
{
   /**
      * Handle an incoming request.
      *
      * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
      * @param  \Closure  $next
      * @return mixed
      */
   public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
   {

      $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
       	-&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
       	-&gt;setAudience(env('OKTA_AUDIENCE'))
       	-&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
       	-&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
       	-&gt;build();

   	// Microservice B verifies the token itself, and looks for a specific scope
      try {
       	$jwt = $jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());

       	$scopes = Arr::get($jwt-&gt;claims, 'scp', []);
       	$requiredScope = 'microservice-demo-scope';

       	if (!in_array($requiredScope, $scopes)) {
           throw new UnauthorizedHttpException('missing required scope');
       	}

       	return $next($request);
      } catch (\Exception $exception) {
       	Log::error($exception);
      }

      return response('Unauthorized', 401);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Note that after verifying the JWT, you can extract its claims. The <code>scp</code> claim will contain the scopes, which you can then check for the presence of your newly created scope.</p>

<p>Register this middleware in the <code>Kernel.php</code> file for Microservice B, just like you did with the API gateway, and add the following to Microservice B’s <code>.env</code> file:</p>

   <code>OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
OKTA_ISSUER_URI=https://{your okta domain}/oauth2/default
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={your client id}
</code>   

<p>If you go to Postman and change your request’s URL to point to <code>/service2</code> instead of <code>/service1</code> when you fire the request, it should fail, as your token is missing the needed scope. Go back to the Auth tab in Postman and scroll down to where you specified your scopes. Add your new one so that it is now “openid email microservice-demo-scope” and request a new token. Once you select Use Token, your request to Microservice B should now succeed.</p>

 Remote token introspection 

<p>The third pattern to implement is for Microservice C. In this pattern, the microservice will again perform its own validation of the token. This time it will call the Okta <code>/introspect</code> endpoint to assert that the token has not been revoked. If this endpoint says the token is OK, the request will proceed; otherwise, it will be blocked.</p>

<p>Stop the running <code>sail up</code> job from the previous pattern, and change the directory to Microservice C before running <code>sail up</code> again. In your other terminal, run the following command from Microservice C: <code>sail php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwtWithIntrospection</code>. Open the newly created middleware file and set its contents as follows:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\Response;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Illuminate\Validation\UnauthorizedException;

class VerifyJwtWithIntrospection
{
   /**
      * Handle an incoming request.
      *
      * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
      * @param  \Closure  $next
      * @return mixed
      */
   public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
   {

      $accessToken = $request-&gt;bearerToken();
      $accessTokenType = 'access_token';

      $oktaDomain = env('OKTA_DOMAIN');
      $oktaClientId = env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID');

      try {
       	// make api call to introspect endpoint
       	$introspectionResponse = Http::asForm()-&gt;post("$oktaDomain/oauth2/default/v1/introspect?client_id=$oktaClientId", [
           	'token' =&gt; $accessToken,
           	'token_type_hint' =&gt; $accessTokenType
       	]);

       	$isTokenActive = $introspectionResponse-&gt;json('active');

       	if (!$isTokenActive) {
           throw new UnauthorizedException('token is invalid');
       	}

      } catch (\Exception $exception) {
       	Log::error($exception);
       	return new Response('Unauthorized - Token failed Introspection', 401);
      }

      return $next($request);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Register this middleware in Microservice C’s kernel and add the following to <code>.env</code> for this microservice:</p>

   <code>OKTA_DOMAIN=https://{your okta domain}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={your client id}
</code>   

<p>Now, when you call the gateway’s <code>/service3</code> endpoint, it will forward the request to Microservice C, which will subsequently perform an introspection to see if the token has been revoked. You can see this in action by taking your access token from Postman and revoking it with <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/revoke-tokens/revokeatrt/">Okta’s revoke endpoint</a>. This will cause subsequent requests to <code>/service3</code> to fail when using that token. If you use this same token to call <code>/service1</code>, you will find that it still works, as this service only does local JWT validation and is not aware that the token has been revoked elsewhere.</p>

 Client Credentials Grant 

<p>The final pattern to implement is for Microservice D. Here, you will implement the Client Credentials flow. Microservice D will validate its own tokens, but the user-supplied token will not be adequate. Microservice D is not accessible directly via the gateway; instead, it is called by Microservice A. For this flow to work, Microservice A will need to request a token using the Client Credentials grant and use this token to make the request to Microservice D.</p>

<p>As before, stop any running <code>sail up</code> commands, navigate to Microservice D, and run <code>sail up</code>. In the other terminal, navigate to Microservice D and run these commands:</p>

   <code>sail composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt
sail php artisan make:middleware VerifyClientCredentialsToken
</code>   

<p>Set the contents of the new middleware as follows, and then register it in the Microservice D kernel:</p>

   <code>​​&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;

class VerifyClientCredentialsToken
{
   /**
      * Handle an incoming request.
      *
      * @param \Illuminate\Http\Request $request
      * @param \Closure $next
      * @return mixed
      */
   public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
   {

      $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
       	-&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
       	-&gt;setAudience(env('OKTA_AUDIENCE'))
       	-&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
       	-&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
       	-&gt;build();

      try {
       	$jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());
       	return $next($request);
      } catch (\Exception $exception) {
       	Log::error($exception);
      }

      return response('Unauthorized', 401);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, head back to the Okta Developer portal, and go to Applications on the sidebar. Create another app integration and select API services as the sign-in method. Give it a name and click Save.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The new integration will provide a new client ID and secret. Make a note of these. Next, go back to Security &gt; API, select the default auth server, and add another scope—this time calling it something like “machine-scope.” This will become the custom scope when Microservice A requests its token.</p>

<p>In the <code>.env</code> file of Microservice D, add the following:</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID={your new client id from the API services integration}
OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
OKTA_ISSUER_URI=https://{your okta domain}/oauth2/default
</code>   

<p>You should now find that Postman calls to <code>/service1</code> will fail, as Microservice A cannot authenticate with Microservice D yet. To solve this, you need to update the API route in Microservice A to use the Client Credentials grant to get a fresh token. Open <code>microservice-a/routes/api.php</code> and change the content as follows:</p>

   <code>Route::get('/service', function (Request $request) {

   // Microservice A needs to request a new token using the Client Credentials flow, and use that to authenticate with Microservice D.

   $customScope = 'machine-scope'; // This is the scope we created in Okta for our default auth server.

   // The details for our machine-to-machine application integration
   $clientId = env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID');
   $secret = env('OKTA_SECRET');

   $oktaDomain = env('OKTA_DOMAIN');

   $tokenResponse = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::withBasicAuth($clientId, $secret)
   	-&gt;asForm()
   	-&gt;post("$oktaDomain/oauth2/default/v1/token", [
       	'grant_type' =&gt; 'client_credentials',
       	'scope' =&gt; $customScope
   	]);

   $token = $tokenResponse-&gt;json('access_token');

   return \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http::withToken($token)-&gt;get('http://microservice-d/api/service');
});
</code>   

<p>Next, update the <code>.env</code> file for Microservice A to include these details:</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID={your new client credentials client Id}
OKTA_SECRET={your new client credentials secret}
OKTA_DOMAIN=https://{your okta domain}
</code>   

<p>With these details in place, <code>/service1</code> should once again work, as it will get a token of its own and use it to communicate with Microservice D.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>If you have followed along in code, you should now have an API gateway with three endpoints, supported by four underlying microservices, with four unique authentication patterns. You’ve seen the basic local JWT validation used by the API gateway. This is the fastest method, but it is unable to catch revoked tokens. Next, there is Microservice B, which checks for a specific scope. This pattern is similar to the first method but gives more granular control around which users can perform specific actions based on the scopes attached to their tokens. Finally, you saw how to validate a token with remote introspection. This approach is more robust, as it is able to catch revoked tokens, but it has the drawback of requiring an additional HTTP call when compared to the local JWT validation.</p>

<p>The complete code for this tutorial can be found in the public <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-php-microservices-example">GitHub Repo</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this tutorial has given you some idea of the different ways you can handle authentication with PHP microservices. All of these patterns are well supported by <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a>, along with many others. Okta offers a vast selection of authentication tools and services to make adding world-class authentication to your apps as easy as can be.</p>

<p>Financial services are going through a rapid digital evolution to keep up with the needs of digital-native consumers. The<a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/125631/millennials-now-trust-fintechs-as-much-as-banks-mobile-app/#:~:text=The%20percentage%20of%20Americans%20who,2020%20to%2048%25%20in%202021."> percentage</a> of Americans who use fintech services daily rose from 37% in 2020 to 48% in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step in adopting a new fintech app is to set up a new account. Here is where you can lose those digital native consumers. Slow and time-consuming background checks, eligibility requirements, ACH microdeposits and inadequate credit scores are all major sources of friction and can cause abandonment of the account setup process. Integrating Finicity’s open banking data can reduce friction through secure account verification and eliminate frustrating delays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Secure account opening is crucial for financial institutions today. Open banking data can reduce the friction and mitigate the risk associated with digital account opening,” said Andy Sheehan, President and COO, of Finicity, a Mastercard company. “FTA’s integration of Finicity’s open banking platform will further empower consumers to take charge of their financial data and financial futures.”</p>
 FTA Partners with Finicity to Add Secure Account Verification and Automated Personal Financial Management Capabilities to IaaS 
<p>The agreement with Finicity provides FTA’s customers access to consumer-permissioned account data for secure account validation and ownership when opening new accounts. This allows consumers to connect their primary account to deposit funds into a new investment account. It signals the end of tedious validation methods like micro-deposits, which can take days to clear, and can minimize risk by verifying the ownership of an existing account.</p>
<p>“Integrating consumer-permissioned data from Finicity’s open banking network streamlines account opening and funding, making it safer, easier and faster, which reduces account opening abandonment for our customers,” said David Park, Founder and CEO of FinTech Automation. “It’s a great example of how open banking can improve banking and personal financial management offerings and their customer experience at the same time.”</p>
<p>FTA will also utilize consumer-permissioned data from Finicity’s open banking platform to give consumers a holistic picture of their finances across all their financial and wealth accounts by allowing customers to download all transactions from their wealth account into their personal financial management tool.</p>
 Fintech Automation’s Unified Business Platform 
<p>The first era of fintech dealt with helping consumers more effectively visualize what is happening with their money across their different account types. In essence, building a better user experience and user interface on top of each of the specific accounts, providing a more user-friendly experience to customers.</p>
<p>While digital apps and interfaces may have changed how consumers experience financial services, the underlying systems facilitating those products and services have not advanced. To meet this growing market opportunity, FTA and its open-loop FinServ Infrastructure-as-a-Service platform offers financial institutions and other fintech companies a banking, payment and wealth management core system of records, bridging multiple financial verticals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The FTA platform can operate across several financial verticals while bearing the innate complexity, reducing the cost and difficulty of building and deploying financial applications. The platform will allow financial institutions and fintech companies to embed additional services into their existing offerings, providing a better customer experience and an opportunity to drive more profitability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This enables FTA’s B2B customers to shift the burden of technology to FTA, focusing instead on relationships with customers and offering new types of services. A fast, easy, secure way to launch financial services such as banking, cards, wealth management and payments is critical to increasing customer engagement and revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;FTA’s platform offers a one-stop access point to various account types and services through a single point of entry. It also offers regulatory, compliance, and KYC/AML uniformly, while offering a suite of best-in-class providers through a single, secure integration with Finicity’s open banking platform.</p>
<p>Using consumer-permissioned data from Finicity’s open banking platform, FTA is helping FamilyWealthTM, a startup personal financial management and digital advisory firm, to power its growing range of digital financial services that leverage artificial intelligence and automation algorithms to make better financial decisions for their users. FamilyWealth will analyze data to understand users’ spending habits, financial goals and risk tolerance, building a data profile that is used to enhance decision-making while maximizing financial performance. Finance features will include automatically moving funds to the highest-yielding accounts, automating portfolio allocation or paying bills. Key to FamilyWealth to automate finance are improvements in AI and data accessibility, such as financial data including debt, income, spending and investments.&nbsp;</p>

 GiD Report#193 — The 6 stories that matter in&nbsp;2022 <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-192-the-sec-v-ripple-a-year-later-8e2a65f35414">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Happy new&nbsp;year!</p><p>2021 was a year of milestones. We saw the explosion of NFTs and DeFi. Buzzwords like web3 and metaverse entered the mainstream lexicon — with Facebook even changing its name to Meta. Coinbase went public and we finally got a Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin itself hit an all time high of $69,000 (nice) with one country — El Salvador — proclaiming it to be legal tender (albeit with plenty of snafus in its national rollout).</p><p>But 2021 is&nbsp;over.</p><p>These are the stories that matter in&nbsp;2022:</p>  It’s last call at the Fed’s easy money&nbsp;party  Chart of the week — S&amp;P 500&nbsp;edition  They aren’t just expensive jpegs&nbsp;anymore  Chart of the week — Punk&nbsp;edition  The year of regulators  New York gets a crypto-loving mayor  The buzziest&nbsp;buzzword  Web3 is in, but web2 ain’t&nbsp;out  The rise of the&nbsp;DAO   1. It’s last call at the Fed’s easy money&nbsp;party Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Photo: Brookings Institute<p>Inflation is at an all-time high. Fed chief Jerome Powell is aggressively tapering — i.e. unwinding the massive bond-buying program sparked by the pandemic induced recession and market fallout. Market analysts predict multiple interest rate hikes this year. Emergency stimulus packages are also running their course — the child tax credit just expired, and amid Congressional squabbling, hopes for a robust infrastructure bill are&nbsp;dimming.</p><p>In short, this latest period of easy money is coming to an&nbsp;end.</p><p>That will hit the stock market, but it will also impact all the other assets that have enjoyed the flow of easy money including crypto.</p><p>Bitcoin has long been touted as a check to freewheeling central banks and governments, the narrative that it serves as an inflationary hedge. It’s a story that remains untested. Since Bitcoin’s arrival in 2009, it’s existed in a predominantly easy money environment with the Fed struggling to meet its preferred target of 2 percent inflation — helping to boost crypto to over $2 trillion in&nbsp;value.</p><p>Inflation is now the highest it’s been in 30 years and the Fed is actively trying to pull the&nbsp;plug.</p><p>For crypto and the rest, we’re entering uncharted waters.</p><p>Caveat: Jerome Powell is only just starting to pull the plug. Even while tapering, the Fed is still buying bonds. Even with hikes, rates will still be near historical lows.</p><p>Other risks: China. Since entering the WTO in 2001, the Middle Kingdom has been an engine for global growth. A confluence of factors — the pandemic (and <a href="https://www.axios.com/china-zero-covid-strategy-xian-lockdown-533b794d-48a3-4656-bc62-c126ae8222c1.html">China’s zero tolerance policy</a>), Xi Jinping’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57739634">aggressive Maoist policies</a>, and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f0fe5b5e-6a0f-4b39-b457-db07294c696f">a looming demographic crisis</a> have <a href="https://www.axios.com/china-evergrande-debt-property-market-55d61183-6ae7-4ad6-96a1-61f961a52d72.html">some observers</a> wondering if China’s economy starts sputtering.

Anyone can go and deposit their coins somewhere and start earning returns — returns wildly higher than what they would get in a savings account. Others can play the other side of the trade, offering liquidity for a fee. Those looking for leverage can get instant collateralized loans.</p><p>All decentralized. All without an intermediary. All without any KYC (know your customer) processes. Everything is non-custodial, recorded directly on the blockchain, powered by smart contracts (i.e. open source&nbsp;code).</p><p>As someone living in New York who isn’t able to access centralized services such as BlockFi due to stringent regulations (BitLicense), DeFi becomes one of the few accessible portals to crypto innovation.</p><p>So the rise of DeFi should be no surprise.</p><p>It should also be no surprise that regulators are taking&nbsp;notice.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-2-trillion-cryptocurrency-market-is-drawing-interest-from-investors-scrutiny-from-u-s-regulators-11641119404">the&nbsp;WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>A rapidly growing set of cryptocurrency applications known as “decentralized finance,” typically allows certain users to vote on how they operate. They are often supported by software developers and charge transaction fees.</blockquote><blockquote>And even though networks like bitcoin can execute transactions without a middleman, there is still a small group of programmers, known as maintainers, who have the ability to change the underlying code in case bugs&nbsp;emerge.</blockquote><blockquote>Policy makers say the presence of people in all these systems creates the potential for conflicts of interest and necessitates oversight.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“Few technologies in history, since antiquity, can persist for long periods of time outside of public policy frameworks,” Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/wsj-ceo-council-tesla-intel-reddit-pfizer/card/MsUND2c5kqPJC9qYeOAk?mod=article_inline">said at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council in December</a>.</blockquote><p>But this will be a fight for the ages. Here’s <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/128757/crypto-lobbying-kicked-into-high-gear-this-year">The&nbsp;Block</a>:</p><blockquote>Happily, we believe the crypto community has embraced the need for political power and is ready to engage at a new level of investment in the coming&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>First, some helpful context for the situation the industry finds itself in. The American public supports cryptocurrencies and their potential at unprecedented levels. Already, 61% of voters believe the US government should support the crypto industry so that our financial system remains a world leader. The sooner our national leaders understand the views the broader public already have on crypto, the sooner they’ll embrace the promise and potential of this technology. Many of the business world’s most recognizable figures have made owning and investing in crypto something close to boring. And other luminaries are leaving Web2 stalwarts for the green pastures of the Web3 frontier. Combine this with the growth of the crypto industry itself, generating good American jobs for workers right here in this country, and the tailwinds for crypto are&nbsp;clear.</blockquote><blockquote>To leverage this position, we are glad to predict that those telling the crypto story in D.C. will have access to much more resources over the next year and beyond. As crypto investors, founders, and others who have grown rich in this space come alive to the need for a powerful lobbying and advocacy force, the amount of money available to those shaping the policy and regulatory environment will undoubtedly increase. Likewise, new types of groups have and will continue to spring up, formed around new conceptions of lobbying, messaging, legal, and advocacy work that the industry&nbsp;demands.</blockquote><p>It will also be a boon for compliance-centric offerings. Here’s The Information’s Hannah Miller&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>Crypto compliance startups will gain favor. There’s no doubt that regulators will increase their scrutiny of crypto, and will likely home in on DeFi and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as well. All of this regulatory attention would be a boon for compliance startups that make it easy for crypto companies to meet the anti-money laundering and know-your-customer requirements common among traditional financial institutions. VC firms are already paying serious attention to crypto compliance startups. TRM Labs, featured in The Information’s 50 Most Promising Startups, raised $60 million in Series B funding this month from investors led by Tiger Global Management.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-2-trillion-cryptocurrency-market-is-drawing-interest-from-investors-scrutiny-from-u-s-regulators-11641119404">The $2 Trillion Cryptocurrency Market Is Drawing Interest From Investors, Scrutiny From U.S. Regulators</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/128757/crypto-lobbying-kicked-into-high-gear-this-year">Crypto lobbying kicked into high gear this&nbsp;year</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/crypto-predictions-for-2022?rc=wsoyyg">Crypto Predictions for&nbsp;2022</a>   3a.

Unfortunately, New York ranks among the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/20/heres-where-to-meet-new-yorks-youngish-crypto-millionaires/">country’s least hospitable venues</a> for bitcoin and cryptocurrency innovation — indeed, “just wait” is what we’ve been doing for&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>Before we can operate in New York, companies that work in this space are forced to navigate byzantine state rules and regulations — including obtaining what’s known as a “BitLicense.” The BitLicense demands that a company furnish extensive financial disclosures and demonstrate compliance with countless cybersecurity and anti-money laundering rules, complete with audits. Firms are also required to meet among the highest capital requirements in the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><blockquote>All that has deterred cryptocurrency and bitcoin innovation in New York.

In 2022 it refers to the fusion of video games, social networking and entertainment to create new, immersive experiences, like swimming inside your favourite song at an online concert. Games such as Minecraft, Roblox and Fortnite are all stepping-stones to an emerging new medium. Facebook has renamed itself Meta to capitalise on the opportunity — and distract from its other&nbsp;woes.</blockquote><p>And here’s <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/2022-954987?utm_campaign=Issue&amp;utm_content=view_in_browser&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=That+Was+The+Week">Keith&nbsp;Teare</a>:</p><blockquote>The Metaverse will not become mainstream and there will be no compelling AR experiences that are embraced by consumers. Mark Zuckerberg will continue to make most of his money by selling adverts on Facebook feeds. But the word metaverse will be used more and more to describe the internet as PR forms earn fees from associating everything with&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/what-next-22-emerging-technologies-to-watch-in-2022">What next? 22 emerging technologies to watch in&nbsp;2022</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/29/new-years-eve-party-comes-to-the-metaverse-as-times-square-building-owner-enters-decentraland/">New Year’s Eve Party Comes to the Metaverse as Times Square Building Owner Enters Decentraland</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/27/decentraland-luxury-marketplace-unxd-to-host-metaverse-fashion-week/">Decentraland, Luxury Marketplace UNXD to Host Metaverse Fashion&nbsp;Week</a>  <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/2022-954987?utm_campaign=Issue&amp;utm_content=view_in_browser&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=That+Was+The+Week">Keith Teare:&nbsp;2022</a>   5. Web3 is in, but web2 ain’t&nbsp;out <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/2022-954987?utm_campaign=Issue&amp;utm_content=view_in_browser&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=That+Was+The+Week">Keith Teare&nbsp;again</a>:</p><blockquote>Web3 will continue to attract talent, especially from engineers and product designers. The promise of fully decentralized infrastructure will dominate but the first decacorns built on top of Web 3 will be minted, probably in the fintech space. The UK will become a major center for Web 3 projects that are fintech-centered. Bitcoin will reach $100k at some point in the year. But there will be no “killer app” pulling regular consumers into the Web 3 world. Consumers will continue to use Amazon, Uber, Facebook, Twitter, and other centralized Web2 infrastructures.</blockquote><p>And here’s <a href="https://continuations.com/post/671863718643105792/web3crypto-why-bother?utm_campaign=That%20Was%20The%20Week&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Albert Wenger on why it all&nbsp;matters</a>:</p><blockquote>Now the important part to keep in mind here is that prior to the Bitcoin Paper we literally didn’t know how to have permissionless. Yes, we had distributed databases. And yes, we had federated databases. But all of those still had a small group of entities in charge (cf pretty much every financial network such as ACH or VISA). We didn’t have a protocol for maintaining consensus — meaning agreeing on what’s in the database — that would allow anyone to join the protocol (as well as anyone to&nbsp;leave).</blockquote><blockquote>It is difficult to overstate how big an innovation this is. We went from not being able to do something at all to having a first working version. Again to be clear, I am not saying this will solve all problems. Of course it won’t. And it will even create new problems of its own. Still, permissionless data was a crucial missing piece — its absence resulted in a vast power concentration. As such Web3 can, if properly developed and with the right kind of regulation, provide a meaningful shift in power back to individuals and communities.</blockquote><blockquote>And if widely adopted Web3/crypto technology will also start to improve along other dimensions. It will become faster and more efficient. It will become easier and safer to use. And much like the PC was a platform for innovation that never happened on mainframes or mini computers, Web3 will be a platform for innovation that would never come from Facebook, Amazon, Google,&nbsp;etc.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/2022-954987?utm_campaign=Issue&amp;utm_content=view_in_browser&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=That+Was+The+Week">Keith Teare:&nbsp;2022</a>  <a href="https://continuations.com/post/671863718643105792/web3crypto-why-bother">Web3/Crypto: Why&nbsp;Bother?</a>   6.

<p>Though Blockchain Commons initiatives date back to our 2016 foundation of <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a> and our 2017 work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a> (initially funded through support from <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Blockstream</a>), it’s only in 2020 and 2021 that <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/">Blockchain Commons</a> has come into its own as a full member of the blockchain design community. We’re thrilled with the work we’ve been able to produce in the last two years, with many projects seeing great advancement in 2021.</p>

 Our Vision 

<p>One of the core things we did last year was to define our vision and objectives in a concrete form. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">vision</a> is to advocate “for human dignity online by enabling people to control their own digital destiny.”</p>

<p>We feel that this is particularly critical following the increased focus on digital life during the pandemic, and what we hope will be an increase in human prosperity as we emerge from the COVID crisis. At this crossroads, we must choose to either trust governments to have total control over our digital self, or we must fight for our digital freedom. Obviously, we choose the latter path.</p>

<p>We are working toward our vision through the creation of infrastructure that is open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate. Four early objectives are intended to advance our vision in the next few years: the creation of a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community">community of designers</a>; the definition of a self-sovereign design architecture; the creation of demand for this architecture; and the welcoming of peers into our industry.</p>

 Architectural Overview 

<p>To date, our biggest focus has been on our architectural objective. We began with community discussions about the extant flaws in the blockchain ecosystem, particularly related to interoperability between different applications and services. That led us into the creation of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/README.md">specifications</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">Gordian Principles</a>, which outline our core desires for interoperable infrastructure.</p>

<p>This led to the development of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons">reference libraries</a> that followed our specifications &amp; architecture objectives and then <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">reference applications</a> that used the libraries. The next step will be for these specifications (and libraries) to be deployed in physical products, which we’re just starting to see as 2021 comes to an end.</p>

<p>We generally see this as the model for Blockchain Commons development: we talk with the community, create a spec, and demonstrate how to use it, then the community creates applications.</p>

<p>So what did 2021 specifically bring for our architectural objective?</p>

 Our Specifications 



<p>Much of our original architectural work on specifications such as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info#readme">LifeHash</a>, <a>SSKR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md">URs</a> occurred in 2020, but in 2021 we made few major expansions: we produced v2.0 of LifeHash, to make it more compatible with grayscale screens; and we released our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md">Request/Response design for URs</a>, which we see as the interoperable end-goal of UR design.</p>

<p>With much of this base work done, we also increased our educational support for our specifications in 2021: our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">technology overview video</a> overviews our work; while we also produced extensive docs for both <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-overview.md">UR</a>.</p>

 Our Reference Apps 

<p>Our next goal with our specifications is to bring them into practical usage by the blockchain ecosystem. Blockchain Commons trailblazes the way with reference apps that demonstrate both their usage and our libraries. Our most notable release in this regard for 2021 was <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS">Gordian Seed Tool</a>, an app now available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">iOS and Mac App stores</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229"></a>
Gordian Seed Tool demonstrates how to create an app based on the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. It also shows best practices and UX for specifications such as LifeHash, UR, SSKR, and PSBTs with animated QRs. The app is a complete reference for the feature set that we’d love to see all airgapped hardware wallets supporting in the coming year.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070"></a>
We also produced <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool</a>, also for the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple app store</a>, which reveals how the Gordian Principles can be applied to the wider world of data storage.</p>

<p>Finally, our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server platform</a> saw its 1.0 release: this is the linchpin of our Gordian architecture, meant to demonstrate how users can maintain independent control of their digital destiny.</p>

<p>We look forward to more of this work appearing in the deployments of blockchain manufacturers, with some of the first releases of Blockchain Commons specifications already out from
<a href="https://foundationdevices.com/passport/details/">Foundation Devices</a>, <a href="https://keyst.one/">Keystone</a>, and <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow</a>, with more to come. We’ve already begun <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/Integration.md#using-sparrow-as-a-transaction-coordinator">documentation</a> on how shared use of these specifications creates a new world of interoperability.</p>

<p>Though our architectural work has been our biggest priority, we also did work on our two other major objectives: creating demand for our work and enlarging the blockchain community through education.</p>

 Creating Demand 

<p>Creating demand for open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate infrastucture came mainly through work with legislative bodies. We’ve worked with Wyoming for years, and were thrilled to see their first-in-the-country definition of digital identity go into effect <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">in July 2021</a>. It depends on the delegatable power of a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">Principal Authority</a>, so we wrote about what that means for the future of digital identity. Because Wyoming is so far ahead of the rest of the country on digital matters, we’ve suggested they create an <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JNmCMVEdMpAHoqVZ7UBakr2PtHgQI4hIgSpRD07nkkU/">eResidency program</a>, to bring these advantages to everyone.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons also testified before other legislatures and lawmakers including ones in Nevada, North Dakota, Buenos Aires, and the Netherlands. We’re thrilled to be able to continue explaining the need for self-sovereign and compassionate digital infrastructure across the world.</p>

 Supporting Education 

<p>The flip side of creating demand is educating the next generation of blockchain developers. One of our prime thrusts in that direction has always been our Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course, which we minorly updated to keep up-to-date with Bitcoin 20.0 as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin 2.1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/es"></a>
More importantly, we also released complete translation of Learning Bitcoin into <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/es">Spanish</a>. This was our first truly open-development project, initiated and entirely conducted by volunteers. We’re very grateful to these volunteers for managing the translations, as we think they’re critical in the continued design and development of blockchain technology internationally.</p>

<p>Our other long-term educational program at Blockchain Commons is <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody">SmartCustody</a>: helping designers and users alike to increase the resiliency of their digital holdings. We feel that this is critical education because it allows people to take full andresponsible control over their digital assets and it helps them to avoid the most common losses, stemming from lack of knowledge and human error.</p>

<p>Though we’re still seeking funds for a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md">v2.0 of our course</a>, we have written a few articles that cover some of the technological methods that can improve the resilience of custody in the future, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">multisigs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">SSKR shares</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">timelocks</a>. Some of the material remains preliminary, but that’s because integration of the technology is exploratory as well. We look forward to more completely bringing this material into #SmartCustody in the future, as these technical tools are what we’ve always seen as the end-goal of #SmartCustody work.</p>

<p>Finally, we also repeated our internship program in 2021, and were thrilled to herald another coterie of new blockchain developers (and others interested in the field) into the industry.</p>

 Our Future 

<p>Looking forward, there’s lots to be done.</p>

<p>We’re hoping to see even more third-party projects bringing our specifications to market: not only hardware and software wallets, but also online services that leverage them. We’ll also be continuing to support our specifications with reference applications that can be used by developers to test their interoperability.</p>

<p>
Gordian Recovery is our next planned reference release: it’s intended to demonstrate how to recover funds even if a wallet manufacturer disappears, especially for the more complex situation of multisig recovery.</p>

<p>More new initiatives will include investigations into Ethereum as another blockchain that could benefit from some of our infrastructural work and beginning to leverage Rust as a more fundamentally secure language for writing apps. Finally, we’re expecting to work with the recent Taproot soft-fork, and opportunities offered by its Schnorr signatures, as the biggest new advance in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>

<p>This coming year, we also hope to see the return of the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a> design workshops, which incubated a lot of the ideas that have gone into Blockchain Commons. A second virtual salon is occurring <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/out-of-the-box-2052-tickets-231958081867">this month</a>, but the resumption of the full design workshops will of course be pandemic-dependent. In the meantime, we’re thrilled to see the continued development of RWOT’s ideas: we celebrated the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/26/self-sovereign-identity-5-years-on/">five-year anniversary of self-sovereign identity</a> with Coindesk and were also thrilled to contribute to the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity book</a> from Manning.</p>

<p>Our biggest challenge going forward is that we need Blockchain Commons to be more self-sufficient, which has proven a difficult nut to crack given the foundational nature of a lot of the work we’re doing. We’re very grateful to our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub sponsors</a>; if you’re doing work that will ultimately benefit from some of the specification and interoperability work we’re doing, we encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor as well</a>, to ensure we can keep doing that work. You can also show your support for our ideals with the self-sovereign NFTs that we’re hoping to roll out in 2022.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone for the support and interest in Blockchain Commons to date, especially including the early adoptors of our specifications, our sustaining sponsors: <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blockchainbird/bird">Blockchainbird</a>, <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a>, <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a>, <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a>, <a href="https://keyst.one/">Keystone</a>, <a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained Capital</a>, and our many [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons].</p>

Community Growth &amp;&nbsp;Bounty   This month, <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1463809689775329284?s=20">Polaris</a> from the English Ontology community officially became an Ontology Harbinger. This excellent community member has always been an active supporter, and will bring new energy to our community. We welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join&nbsp;us</a>.  Ontology published the next couple of interviews in its Harbinger Series. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-polaris-31234dc4c1dd">Polaris</a> from our English community said that Ontology uses blockchain technology to continuously promote the development of the smart economy on the basis of protecting user privacy, making it fairer, and more transparent. As such, he has become a supporter of Ontology.  This month, the <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1471563278023217152?s=20">Ontology Community Call</a> on Discord and Telegram was held as usual, focusing on topics such as “the value of a project” and “what is trust?”. Head of Community Humpty Calderon, Ontology Harbinger Polaris, and Atherton Hoge discussed those issues with community members, shared that a “Trustless” decentralized network should be able to protect the privacy of users through DID, and achieve anonymous and secure interactions by integrating the reputation system on the&nbsp;chain.  This month, we held our <a href="https://twitter.com/DeIDSummit/status/1469454043437223940?s=20">DeID Summit</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He invited bloXmove CEO Sophia Roediger and CTO Harry Behrens to discuss the application of DID technology in the field of mobile travel. The fragmentation of the urban transport industry means there is a great need to fortify user security and data through decentralized technologies. By integrating Ontology’s DID and data solutions, the whole ecosystem of bloXmove will be made more private, more secure, and will be easier to navigate.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1468066893168738304?s=20">Telegram Community Call</a> of our Spanish community for the first time, led by Ontology Harbinger Emilio. He reviewed the latest progress made in the fourth anniversary of Ontology with community members: Through the comprehensive deployment of DID, global users can maintain the unity of identity and the interoperability of&nbsp;data.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1476108226055876611?s=20">Telegram Community Discussion</a>, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about Ontology’s 4th anniversary NFT event, recent popular NFTs and games, the current Metaverse construction, and the role of Ontology in the construction of Web3. Community members expressed their opinions enthusiastically.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.

<p>Another year just flashed past us again with the COVID-19 problem continuing to affect us all socially, economically, physically, and mentally. I guess this will be the case for a long while more until they find a panacea for&nbsp;it.</p><p>After a tumultuous start to the year with a major restructure, we had gone through a lot of developmental changes in terms of the organization itself, and the design and development of the core. I have flattened the organizational structure of ProximaX now with each project group being headed by its respective lead on a regional basis. Eleazar heads Latin America, while Shin Neng looks after South East Asia. Our core development is being championed by Oleg and his team. He has been instrumental in regrouping the team and working towards getting the core solution up and running. We took close to seven months to redesign the service layers and started to code the new design in August this year. We had to do this because the original design was not optimal and lacked in-depth consideration of many things. This was due to indecision and poor technological leadership and direction at that time, which led me to reform and revamp the organization. We have now overcome most of these issues, put better management processes in place, and we are coming out stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>Storage as a core service layer of our ProximaX Sirius platform is important for the other service layers to work. Streaming relies heavily on the storage layer as it needs to store its content there, whether in transit (live) or in storage (playback). Additionally, Supercontract requires the storage layer to store code, often also storing results from Supercontract executions.</p><p>The last four months have been spent on making the storage layer more robust for production. First, ensuring it works well on one node and then later, extending it to a few nodes, and now we are finishing to make it work on unlimited distributed nodes. We hope to roll out the storage layer on testnet before the end of Q1, 2022. Concurrently, we are working to finish the streaming layer which shouldn’t take much longer than the storage to complete. Finally, we hope to finish the Supercontract before the end of Q2&nbsp;2022.</p><p>As we progress towards the completion of the service layers, we are also putting together various tools to make the service offering complete. These include SDKs, APIs, the explorer, and the wallet. We are also enhancing the blockchain and merging our codebase with the relevant code from the Symbol blockchain. New features to look forward to include transaction finality; delegated and remote harvesting; staking XPX as a locked fund for other rewards; DEX; modifying the keypair implementation scheme; update and upgrade the SiriusID to be inline with W3C which is evolving rapidly; and roll out Silo, a cloud-based instant messaging service enhanced by blockchain encryption. All these will be rolled out in various stages throughout 2022.</p><p>On the gaming front, we are continuing to develop the Xarcade marketplace as a portal for game developers and gamers to publish their games and for gamers to download/play these games. Unfortunately in December 2021, Typhoon Rai hit South East Asia and crippled parts of southern Philippines where some of our developers reside. In addition to the displacement and devastation left by the typhoon a severe and extended power outage also ensued. We have been making arrangements to bring some sense of normality back to the lives of our team members and get them online so that the development of the Xarcade marketplace can continue. It is our hope to launch this marketplace as the first of many great centrepieces of the ProximaX public network and we are optimistic that we will see great utility of the XPX in time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>As part of an extension of the Xarcade marketplace, we are also designing our version of a metaverse. Named MetaXar, our metaverse is unique in that it does not place emphasis on NFTs but instead, makes it an incidental feature. The tokenomics for MetaXar will be tied in closely with ProximaX Sirius tokenomics. In fact, it is going to play a very important role as a catalyst to the tokenomics of ProximaX in the immediate term. Akin to what is commonly termed as Parachains, the MetaXar project is like a “Para-economy” of the ProximaX&nbsp;project.</p><p>The entire crypto landscape is fast evolving and it is imperative that our project evolves and adapts as quickly too. Fortunately, our platform solution has most of the elements needed to quickly change and meander through the ever changing terrain, and I am happy to say that we are well prepared for that. In our initial tokenomics plan, XPX was supposed to be designated as a utility coin. Today, as we evolve, XPX shall also be used as a precondition to partake in other tokenomic initiatives. For example, in the MetaXar project, we shall be airdropping a token associated with the project — MetX — and only those who possess XPX XAR can claim for this token through a conditional airdrop. MetX is therefore minted on the fly as a reward for those who participate in the activities of the ecosystem. Initially, about 9.2 million units of MetX shall be minted and airdropped. Later, owners of XPX can stake XPX by locking their XPX funds to gain more MetX as they harvest and participate in the validation of ProximaX transactions. The utility of MetX is explained in our paper titled “ <a href="https://files.proximax.io/xarcade/Metaverse_Autonomous_Economy_20211230.pdf">Metaverse Autonomous Economy</a> “, or MAE in short. It gives a new dimension to the value of MetX and correspondingly, to the value of XPX. XPX is finite and its supply will deplete through the passage of time from lost keys. All of it has already been distributed and therefore no more can be minted. MetX will add a new twist to our tokenomics, in line with other initiatives, including DeFi initiatives which can be implemented on the platform once the Supercontract service layer is&nbsp;ready.</p><p>Having XPX allows us to have a strong say in the consensus mechanism. It is also a precondition for us to have a strong influence in the tokenomics of the ecosystem, e.g., MetX can only be rewarded to an XPX holder, which will be used for something else in the ecosystem. As we progress to build more ecosystem components, more tokens can be created to perpetuate the need for XPX to power the economy. This indirectly pushes the demand for XPX in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Many people have asked us how we are different compared with other storage projects, Smart Contract projects, and streaming projects. To answer this, we should liken the ProximaX Sirius platform to what Aristotle once said, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” Our platform has been designed in such a way that each service layer, while being useful on its own, contributes to a holistic development environment which individually, the service layers cannot provide. While we are a storage project, a streaming project, and a Smart Contract project, we are at the same time a project that provides an all-in-one infrastructure that can spawn all sorts of ecosystem projects. We are breaking new ground when it comes to utility and we hope to carry this through in the years to come, especially when developers start to discover that they don’t need to do Supercontract on one chain, storage on another chain, and streaming on yet another chain in order to provide a solution or application.</p><p>And this is exciting.</p><p>For the seeds have been sown, the perseverance and arduous nurturing will bear superior fruits that we can then reap and benefit from. Upwards and&nbsp;onwards!</p><p>Lon Wong</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://blog.proximax.io/en/proximax-in-2021/">https://blog.proximax.io</a> on January 1,&nbsp;2022.</p>

<p>This article was written by Mike Truppa, a content developer and blockchain expert at Webstacks, a <a href="https://www.webstacks.com/">website and marketing operations agency</a> helping high-growth SaaS, FinTech, and Blockchain startups&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Passwordless authentication is the future of online security, and promises a future where users don’t need to remember username and password combinations, spend time resetting passwords, and worry about the security of their personal and financial information being&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>Passwordless authentication is a fundamental shift in how people will access their tools and information online, and it will provide more security, prevent billions in losses, and create greater transparency.</p><p>Let’s explore the different types of passwordless technology and compare a few companies offering passwordless authentication software.</p> What is Passwordless Authentication? <p>Passwordless authentication is a method for verifying an internet user’s identity without requiring a password.</p><p>Types of passwordless authentication methods in use today including, magic links, one-time passwords (OTP), biometric authentication, and public-private key pairs using blockchain technology.</p>Diagram of how passwordless authentication solutions work. Is two-factor authentication (2FA) passwordless authentication? <p>Because the nature of two-factor authentication (2FA) is to add an additional layer of security to passwords, it can sometimes be mis-categorized as passwordless authentication.</p><p>However, 2FA methods such as <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/building-sms-authentication-c2cabccbd5f8">SMS-based authentication</a> would still be considered a one-time password which is a form of passwordless authentication.</p> 3 Types of Passwordless Authentication that Eliminate Single Points of Failure from Centralized PAP-based Authentication <p>Today’s password authentication protocols (PAP) are designed with centralized intermediaries or organizations that maintain a database of username-password pairs to prove a user’s identity.</p><p>The central point of failure of PAP-based authentication puts people at risk of hacks, data breaches, identity theft, fraud, and leaks, all of which can be mitigated with passwordless authentication.</p> 1. Public-Key Cryptography and Blockchain Authentication <p>Public key cryptography is a form of public and private key authentication, which has been broadly used in the current information world including WebAuthn, machine-to-machine communication, etc.</p><p>Public-key cryptography has exploded in popularity in the last decade in large part because of public blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana that use public-private cryptography to secure blockchain transactions of digital assets and Non-Fungible Tokens&nbsp;(NFTs).</p><p>Because blockchain technology is built on top of public-key cryptography, they can be confused as one and the same. However, public-key cryptography doesn’t necessitate authentication with a blockchain.</p><p>For example, although <a href="https://magic.link">Magic enables Web 3.0 platforms to connect to public blockchains</a> like Ethereum, throughout the entire authentication flow there is no interaction with the underlying blockchain; no consensus is involved or required to prove the user’s identity.</p> How does blockchain authentication work to prove a person’s identity? <p>Instead of using the traditional method of typing in a username and password, blockchain authentication uses public-key cryptography for self-sovereign identity management.</p><p>When a user creates a wallet account on the blockchain, they receive a private key which only they know, and it is paired with a public key that connects them to the wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>To access Web 3.0 applications or complete blockchain transactions, the user signs transaction requests using their private key which authenticates their account&nbsp;access.</p> How are blockchains secured using public-key authentication? <p>Blockchains have a variety of security mechanisms to protect the integrity of the blockchain and secure user’s information.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work and Ethereum 2.0’s soon to be Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms ensure censorship resistant networks that are practically impossible to&nbsp;hack.</p><p>To hack (i.e. modify transactions on a blockchain’s distributed ledger) a malevolent user would need to control 51% of Bitcoin’s hash power, or more than 33% of Ethereum’s stake.</p><p>For example, the top four Bitcoin mining pools which power Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus, control ~60% of the mining power, and to manipulate the network, all four of these independent miners would need to&nbsp;collude.</p><p>As long as someone does not have access to your private key, it is highly unlikely for someone to access your wallet or impersonate the identity tied to your public-private key&nbsp;pair.</p> 2. Decentralized Authentication <p>Decentralized authentication means no single centralized platform, organization, person, or entity is needed to verify your identity.</p><p>While blockchain authentication has proven to be a strong use case for decentralized authentication, the two are not the same. You don’t need blockchains to use decentralized authentication methods.</p> What is an&nbsp;ITF? <p>Identity Trust Fabric (ITF) is a decentralized mechanism for establishing trust between credentialed users. ITFs act as middlemen by interacting directly with a centralized intermediary.</p><p>For example, an ITF could handle all the identification and access requests needed from a centralized party. ITFs decrease the risks of sending your confidential information to an organization.</p> What are the tradeoffs between decentralized authentication and blockchain authentication? <p>The main argument for using decentralized authentication methods like ITFs instead of blockchain authentication is the speed and cost of using blockchains.</p><p>However, with the emergence of lightning fast layer one blockchains like Solana, layer 2 solutions built to help Ethereum scale transaction throughput like Polygon, blockchains are quickly becoming a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional decentralized authentication protocols.</p><p>ETH 2.0 brought Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and sharding to the scaling conversation. These aren’t bad options as they do increase the L1 transaction throughput, but to reach scalability where there are millions of transactions on the network on any given day, PoS and sharding simply aren’t&nbsp;enough.</p> 3. Distributed Authentication <p>Distributed authentication is a collection of hosts interconnected by a single network. While distributed authentication is the leading choice based on the adoption across the industry, it poses a high amount of<a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/common-flaws-of-distributed-identity-and-authentication-systems.pdf"> security&nbsp;threats</a>.</p> Two Common Flaws in Distributed Authentication <p>Two main flaws with distributed authentication are:</p>  Unconstrained delegation  Unbalanced authority   What is unconstrained delegation? <p>Unconstrained delegation allows some entity to authenticate you as an individual and also authenticate on your behalf (i.e. impersonate, act as you) to another&nbsp;party.</p><p>While unconstrained delegation has benefits such as allowing administrators to update database servers from a web server, it creates an area of exploitation where a hacker with access to admin credentials can unilaterally compromise the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Unconstrained delegation can lead to data breaches, exposing millions of confidential usernames and passwords, causing fraud and potentially billions of damages every&nbsp;year.</p> What is unbalanced authority? <p>Unbalanced authority is when a specific centralized party or system has information that identifies specific principles within the system (e.g.&nbsp;users).</p><p>Unbalanced authority occurs between enterprise businesses where an external business partner is trusted inside the system, allowing them to access company resources.</p><p>When the access granted is over-provisioned it allows external companies access to too much sensitive information that can cause harm to the internal organization and their customers.</p> What type of passwordless authentication does Magic&nbsp;use? <p>Magic uses public-private key authentication. While the authentication flow doesn’t involve interacting with blockchain, Magic’s authentication allows users to interact with blockchains after they are authenticated by binding the authentication to 16+ different blockchain key generation schemes.</p><p>Borrowing security principles from blockchain hardware wallets like Ledger, Magic secures accounts using a combination of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0">hardware wallet security and AWS’s Delegated Key Management</a>.</p><p>Software developers can use Magic plug-and-play Software Developer Kit (SDK) to quickly add magic links secured with public-private key authentication to their application.</p><p>A magic link is a special URL that represents a login URL, typically emailed to users at login. This link contains an embedded token that authorizes users without requiring a username or password. Magic also supports other login methods like SMS, Social Logins, WebAuthn and&nbsp;MFA.</p> The Type of Passwordless Authentication You Choose Will Be Different for Each Application’s Security Requirements <p>Passwordless authentication removes the need to remember passwords and for password managers, and improves upon the security benefits of password-based authentication.</p><p>Scalable passwordless authentication tools like Magic help software developers reduce the complexity of securing their applications, while simultaneously hardening security using the best aspects of public-private key cryptography.</p><p>With the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology transforming every business sector, having the option to <a href="https://magic.link/docs/home">bind authentication with 16+ blockchain key generation schemes</a> helps today’s Web 2.0 companies prepare for the future of Web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>Passwordless authentication isn’t a zero-sum game. Every business has different needs, and not every type of passwordless solution will fit within the regulatory and compliance needs of each business.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/types-of-passwordless-authentication-for-web-3-958062e9d265">3 Types of Passwordless Authentication for Web 3.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Look back at our year of product launches, partnership announcements, educational blogs &amp; more as we kick off a new year for our platform and community <p>What a year, Shyftoshis! We’ve come a long way since the official <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/shyft-federation-launches-shyft-network-150000425.html">launch</a> of the Shyft Network Mainnet in July of 2021. It’s hard to believe how much has happened in only four&nbsp;months.</p><p>We find ourselves in an exciting and undoubtedly challenging time for the entire crypto and blockchain ecosystem. As our world experiences growing institutional adoption, regulation will inevitably increase, leading to even more of a need for compliant solutions and frameworks that maintain privacy and trust — and create opportunity out of these&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Crypto markets are experiencing constant turbulence as global economies navigate before unprecedented inflation rates and the continuous challenges of COVID worldwide. At Shyft Network, we’re hard at work bringing on new partners, exchanges, and governmental bodies who will utilize our attestation framework and Veriscope Travel Rule solution and look to the future of compliance across DeFi and NFTs. We’ve got a lot done in the last year since we published our <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-network-roadmap-ee7c78fbc3ac">roadmap</a> back in April and had a massively successful IDO.</p><p>Below, we’ve listed some highlights from this monumental last year for our platform. Best of luck to everyone in these exciting yet uncertain times. We’re all in this together and share the same space and hope for a positive and productive future. Keep building and looking towards the long-term opportunities around us&nbsp;all.</p><p>We’ll see you in&nbsp;2022!</p> Shyft in the&nbsp;Media <p>We always love to see Shyft Network out in the media and on podcasts spreading our gospel! 2021 saw our fearless leader Joseph Weinberg appear on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7sI5oiNpjKN4p4ohwuNJDr?si=iGYjhSUlSJi0DTw28svzNw&amp;dl_branch=1&amp;nd=1">Decrypt Daily</a> and <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/124362/policy-scoop-with-aislinn-keely-unpacking-the-fatfs-guidance-and-its-impact-on-the-global-crypto-landscape?utm_source=twi">The Block</a> to discuss the newly-released FATF Guidance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cln5aD2p0NM">CryptoCoinShow</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpWmgGP_bM&amp;t=2s">Coin Desk TV,</a> and Charlie Shrem’s Beyond the Base Layer for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9r6Gbc0Keg">deep dive</a> on all things Shyft. Joseph also went on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbn9cn_ssJM&amp;t=276s">Bitcoin Stories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkMn1aJAWM">Cryptonites</a> for a look into our platform, compliance, and lots&nbsp;more.</p><p>Joseph was also featured in an article on Facebook’s Meta and the growing issue of “meta-crime” in <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164497/facebook-metaverse-cybercrime-marc-zuckerberg">New Republic,</a> and a stellar op-ed in Cointelegraph on the future of Compliant NFTs and regulation in the space. To wrap up this monumental year, he also shared some 2022 predictions for the crypto industry and what to watch out for on the regulatory front for Cointelegraph. Thanks for reading (and listening!).</p> A Monumental Year for Veriscope <p>​​2021 was the biggest year yet for the rollout of Versiscope, our Travel Rule solution for exchanges, governments, and businesses. In June, Shyft Network &amp; Veriscope <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-day-the-veriscope-secretariat-responded-to-the-fatf-ab37957746b3?source=user_profile---------14-------------------------------">went public</a> with an official response to FATF’s March guidance, responding section by section with their collective thoughts and constructive feedback to how the guidance can be improved. This helped set the scene for what was to&nbsp;come…</p><p>In November, we shared the <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-federation-deploys-the-shyft-bridge-65f64afa3cad">news</a> that leading stablecoin Tether (owned by Bitfinex) had begun testing and integrating Versicope. Later in the month, we announced that Shyft Network has officially <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pnoP22tJSMu7Uo9RDn4Ks3dkHQvtGIeHHBLi2shf2dA/edit#:~:text=Shyft%20Network%20Core%20Team%20Open%20Sources%20Veriscope%2C%20prepares%20to%20enable%20cross%20solution%20discovery%20to%20Make%20Travel%20Rule%20Compliance%20Open%2C%20Free%2C%20and%20Simpler%20than%20Ever%20%7C%20by%20Shyft%20Network%20%7C%20Nov%2C%202021%20%7C%20Medium">open-sourced</a> the Versicope technology, making it free and simpler than ever for people to use. This update came two months after we shared the<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf?source=user_profile---------10-------------------------------"> latest list</a> of exchanges involved in the phased deployment of Veriscope on our Network.

 Scores of illicit vendors are capitalising on vaccine scepticism in Europe and North America by selling counterfeit Covid-19 vaccination and test certificates for Bitcoin. Elliptic’s internal analysis, which has identified at least $100,000 in profits for these vendors, suggests that this lucrative business could be making individual criminals around $15,000 a month.

 Redefining the Metaverse — MetaXar by Xarcade — ProximaX Official&nbsp;Blog  Prelude <p>Discovered by an expedition fleet sheerly by happenstance, the mysterious artifact, known as the Nexus — a massive city complex entirely abandoned — appears to be both an isolated pocketverse as well as a gateway to different routes throughout the multiverse.</p><p>As of now, the Nexus is of unknown origin. Investigations will be conducted ascertaining whether it is alien or man-made.</p><p>Scientists posited that the Nexus is not only a gateway to different realities but different times as&nbsp;well.</p>  Could humans have built the Nexus far into an alternate future timeline?  If so, where are the human settlers&nbsp;now?  Did they abandon the city intentionally or under&nbsp;duress?  Did they&nbsp;perish?  Will they be able to&nbsp;return?  <p>The technological benefits salvaged from the artifact are too valuable to ignore. Scientists estimate that only 1% of the dimensional gateway routes have been re-activating.</p><p>Who will discover the rest? The call has gone&nbsp;out.</p><p>Adventure, creative exploration as well as a multitude of yet untapped rewards await those daring enough for such an endeavor.</p><p>The story continues: <a href="https://files.proximax.io/xarcade/Founding_of_Xarnadu_and_the_Genesis_of_MetaXar_20211230.pdf">The Foundation of Xarnadu and the Genesis of&nbsp;MetaXar</a>.</p> Metaverse Autonomous Economy <p>ProximaX has conceptualized a unique tokenomy. It should be born out of creativity and be autonomous and egalitarian, giving everyone an equal opportunity to make it to the pinnacle.</p><p>The MetaXar project will be the first to roll out this autonomous economy. It shall be carried out in phases. The initial phases will involve gamers and game developers coming together with an aggregation of games and activities in a metaverse setting. More complexity will arise as the ecosystem grows, creating a broad spectrum of earning capabilities.</p><p>There will be an announcement for the MetaXar token, MetX, that shall be freshly minted and airdropped to XPX and XAR holders at a specific block height. To be eligible for this airdrop, XPX and XAR holders must stake a claim for it. No MetX will be airdropped to those who missed it or want to make a claim later. About 9.2 million MetX will be minted in this&nbsp;airdrop.</p><p>Find out more: <a href="https://files.proximax.io/xarcade/Metaverse_Autonomous_Economy_20211230.pdf">Metaverse Autonomous Economy</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://blog.proximax.io/en/redefining-the-metaverse-metaxar-by-xarcade/">https://blog.proximax.io</a> on December 30,&nbsp;2021.</p>

   All of us have multiple identities at any point. We are sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, parents, partners, friends, colleagues, and more to different people.  Sometimes, we may want to keep our identities separate from one another.

<p>All of us have <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">multiple identities</a> at any point. We are sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, parents, partners, friends, colleagues, and more to different people.</p><p>Sometimes, we may want to keep our identities separate from one another. For example, we may not want our colleagues to know our personal identities or we may not want our personal information to get mixed with our online identity.</p><p>How can we do&nbsp;this?</p><p>One option may be Trusted Third Parties, where a third-party entity facilitates interactions between two parties, where both trust this third-party. In our above example, it can be your boss who knows your personal information, but will not disclose the same to your co-workers. But since your co-workers trust your boss, they may accept anything that he/she says about&nbsp;you.</p><p>In the real world though, a Trusted Third Party (TTP) is a term that is often associated with online security. Here, a domain or a third-party acts as a facilitator between the owner of an information and the verifier of that information, such that the TTP vouches the identity of the party and this is accepted by the verifier.</p><p>The big question here is — can these TTPs be trusted in a digital&nbsp;world?</p> Are TTPs a Viable Solution? <p>TTPs, in today’s world, are organizations or entities that store and handle your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. Facebook is a company that stores your information, and authenticates you on other sites. The other sites, in turn, trust Facebook and since your data comes from it, they trust your data. Here, you are the owner and the other sites are the verifiers, and Facebook is the&nbsp;TTP.</p><p>While TTP may seem like the perfect solution to create online trust, it is unfortunately ridden with many problems.</p> Security and Privacy Loopholes <p>What happens when your TTP’s database is hacked? All the data stored in it gets stolen and used by hackers. Recent hacking incidents show that such centralized databases are <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">not secure</a> enough to keep your data from falling into the wrong&nbsp;hands.</p><p>Further, this centralized storage is a privacy loophole as well because anyone who has access to the database knows about you! Also, TTPs determine who can access your data and how it must be used. Some of them even monetize your data by targeting you with relevant advertisements.</p><p>So, from both a security and privacy standpoint, TTPs are a loophole.</p> Creates data&nbsp;silos <p>TTPs store data in silos, and this makes the data a lot less effective, both in terms of utility and leverage.</p><p>Data leverage is the degree to which we can use data. A prominent aspect that determines the usability and leverage of a data is its trust. In other words, when verifiers trust a data, it can have greater utility and leverage.</p><p>When a piece of information about an individual comes from a government organization, it is trusted implicitly, and this is an example of trusted data. Some examples of trusted data are passports, Adhar cards, Social Security Numbers, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Utility follows leverage because when the data is trusted, it is widely accepted and can be used extensively for authentication and authorization. In the current business world, most of the data do not come from the government, and hence are not&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Let’s take a practical scenario&nbsp;here.</p><p>Let’s say you go to a supermarket close to your house twice a week to buy groceries. One day, you forget to take your wallet and phone, so they are unable to sell their products to you on credit. Though you have a loyalty card with the supermarket, the data they have about you is not trustworthy enough to give you&nbsp;credit.</p><p>Likewise, a blue collar worker does many part time jobs. When he applies for a new job, he doesn’t have any trusted proof of the part time jobs he has done so far, and hence his potential employer has no way to verify his&nbsp;data.</p><p>In both the above scenarios, the available data is not considered trustworthy, hence it has little leverage and utility. The same can be extended to cross-border rentals, credit history, etc because the data that is generated is not trusted and hence is of little value to its&nbsp;holders.</p><p>Thus, online trust is a major issue and to overcome that, TTP has been in vogue. But this TTP comes with privacy and security issues, and also, it creates data silos that have little utility for its&nbsp;holders.</p><p>Much of this lack of utility stems from the fact that the data is not portable or interoperable and hence cannot be used in all scenarios.</p><p>Now comes the big question. What is the alternative to TTP and the data silos they&nbsp;create?</p> Self-Sovereign Identity <p>One option that can overcome the privacy and security problems of TTP and make the data more usable for its holders is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>, or SSI in&nbsp;short.</p><p>Let’s see how this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/is-ssi-the-disruptor-for-a-better-world-aec34cef6275">framework</a> overcomes the issues related to&nbsp;TTP.</p> Decentralized or Custodial Storage <p>In this <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">identity framework</a>, every individual stores his or her own data and is responsible for its security. This may make it difficult for a hacker to steal data, and more importantly, there is little financial incentive for hackers as they would spend too much resources to steal a single&nbsp;record.</p> Ensures Privacy <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/an-in-depth-exploration-of-self-sovereign-identity-and-verifiable-credentials-1a3eb2296004">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> gives complete control to users, so they can decide how their data is used and with whom it is shared. Such granular control reduces the possibility for unauthorized people to peek into an individual’s data.</p> Data Leverage <p>The trust associated with data is greatly enhanced when it is in the form of a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credential</a>. This is a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">tamper-proof credential</a> that can capture even the smallest of details such as volunteering experience, rental history, and more. These small pieces of information can add a ton of value and give you an edge in securing the services you&nbsp;need.</p><p>Since these credentials can’t be changed by anyone, it is more acceptable as a trusted form of data, and hence, has a higher utility&nbsp;value.</p><p>As you can see, SSI can be a good alternative to TTP as it preserves privacy, enhances security, and creates trusted data that in turn can have wide-reaching leverage.</p><p>Do these sound interesting to&nbsp;you?</p><p>Visit Affinidi’s <a href="http://build.affinidi.com">Dev Portal</a> to learn more about SSI and VCs and how you can leverage them to do more with your data in a safe and secure&nbsp;way.</p><p>You can also <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a>, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/trusted-third-parties-vs-self-sovereign-identity-4e96de929b1b">Trusted Third Parties vs Self-Sovereign Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It’s been a big year for reining in big tech, with all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/16/big-tech-critics-mustered-their-forces-2021/">sorts of developments</a>&nbsp;and no doubt more to come in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/agcm-fines-apple-google/">story</a>&nbsp;is that Google and Apple were each fined&nbsp;€10 million by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/PS11147-PS11150">Italy’s competition and market authority</a>&nbsp;(AGCM) for not providing their customers with clear information about how they use their data commercially, and for being “aggressive” in pushing users to accept commercial processing of data. These actions violate Italy’s consumer code.</p>



<p>According to the AGCM, Google didn’t give users relevant information at the account creation stage and when using services so they could make informed decisions about whether or not to consent to their data being used for commercial purposes.</p>



<p>Apple copped the fine for reportedly failing to give users immediate access to clear information about how it uses customer information commercially when a customer creates an Apple ID or accesses digital stores like the App Store.</p>



<p>This news is interesting because let’s face it: we expected it from Google, but Apple is one of the good guys on privacy—or so its careful marketing narrative would lead us all to believe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To us, these sanctions are yet another reason why every consumer needs&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>—secure, customizable digital identities or ‘profiles’ that intentionally differentiate from a consumer’s personal identity and protect their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;Regulators and watch dogs usually don’t intervene in data misuse until after harm has been done. So isn’t it better to close the gate&nbsp;before&nbsp;the horse bolts?&nbsp;</p>

 A possible solution to the participation problem. <p>a16z, the famous venture capital company, is entering the DAO field through investments into DAO projects, such as the recent investments in social DAO project,&nbsp;FWB.</p>Source: <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/">https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/</a><p>Since 2020, DAOs have become more well-known and have gradually become mainstream players in the blockchain industry. Recently, we have seen major venture capital institutions disclosing their investments in DAO projects, which has attracted the attention of major blockchain media. Therefore, some people think that “2022 will be the first year of&nbsp;DAO.”</p><p>What is it about DAOs that attracts the interest of these market-leading investment institutions and the associated media??</p> Understanding DAOs <p>Human beings have entered the DAO era, and all this cannot be&nbsp;avoided.</p><p>— Stephenson, the Father of the Metaverse</p><p>Everyone has their interpretation of what a DAO is, but they all share a common logic: members vote with tokens, and open-source codes automatically run voting results. This trustless system eliminates human error and members can manage community finances as a collective.</p>Source: <a href="https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw">The DAO landscape</a>.<p>At present, DAOs have developed across many platforms, including social media, agreement platforms, project principles, and so on. Moreover, it is more like a bottom-up management company, where members rely on their personal abilities and subjective wishes to divide labor to build the entire DAO. The DAO will reward members based on their contribution value.</p><p>In the upcoming Metaverse, DAOs may well be at the core of governance models, as it returns the rulemaking and governance power to the public, promoting the complete decentralization of the Metaverse.</p> Still In Early&nbsp;Stages <p>Whilst the vision for DAOs is beautiful, the reality is still working towards fulfilling these goals. It is true that people in the decentralized field are increasingly interested in DAOs, but the development of DAOs still faces difficulties. These hurdles&nbsp;include:</p> Low ​​Member participation <p>Most DAOs use the digital assets of their members as key indicators. For example, voting is based on the number of tokens, and rewards are based on the proportion of digital assets. This approach not only inhibits the voice of DAO members but also makes members with a small proportion of tokens unwilling to invest time and energy in governance, due to the imbalance of investment returns.</p> Centralization crisis <p>The above-mentioned system employed by DAOs can easily lead to the emergence of a mindset that “the rich will always be rich, and the strong will always be strong”. The simple reality is that with the right to speak, comes the right to set rules that are more beneficial to you, and you can get greater benefits. This has pushed many DAOs into an unwanted centralized situation.</p> Decisions are difficult to&nbsp;balance <p>In a fully autonomous DAO system, the decision should be based on the number of votes. But sometimes there are conflicts between the opinions of the development team and the interests of community members. How to maintain a good balance is a headache for many DAO organizations. Sometimes the DAO development team will directly ignore the community opinions, resulting in accusations of centralization. The alternative is to completely follow the DAO community, which may result in constructive opinions not being&nbsp;adopted.</p> Which Brings Us to Reputation <p>The above problems essentially have a key point: what kind of incentives should be set up? The incentives should not only satisfy decentralization and fairness but also promote proactive DAO members that actively participate in governance.</p><p>Based on its own technology and past service experience, Ontology proposes the following solution: Set up a DID with a reputation scoring system for each DAO&nbsp;member.</p> Verification <p>When you enter a DAO, you need to first register/own a DID and submit certain verifications (authorization through encryption to protect privacy), such as on-chain/off-chain assets, whether you have similar experience or capabilities, and so on. After verification, you will be given an initial value and mark to help you better participate in&nbsp;DAO.</p> Record <p>When participating in DAO governance, DID will record the amount time spent in the DAO and your contributions after joining. Contributions would include voting, suggestions, operational work, and so on. If you also use this DID to participate in the governance of other DAOs, those data will also be recorded in the same DID, increasing your data diversity.</p> Reputation Score <p>The reputation system will make a comprehensive score based on the above records. For example, the more DAOs you participate in, and the longer, and the more active you are, the higher your score will be. In addition, corresponding weights can be set when designing the reputation scoring model, such as reducing the weight of digital assets and increasing the weight of participation.</p> Decentralization <p>With reputation value, DAO can dynamically divide rights based on reputation. The higher the reputation value, the greater the power. This power could be manifested in the right to more votes (right to speak) and the right to more DAO dividends.</p> Participation <p>Based on this, we can imagine a completely decentralized DAO organization as:</p>  The acquisition of rights and benefits is no longer difficult for ordinary&nbsp;members.  The development team, like ordinary members, needs to rely on contribution to gain the right to&nbsp;speak.  It has become very important to increase your participation and enthusiasm.   To Summarize <p>Implanting DID in DAOs can eliminate “centralization” based on digital assets to a certain extent. DID can encourage DAO members to become more active, and balanced decision-making between the development team and ordinary&nbsp;members.</p><p>Whilst DID can help to solve some of the current DAO problems, this is still only the beginning.</p><p>In the future, DAOs will inevitably become the organizational form of the decentralized world, with more blockchain technologies being absorbed by DAOs, allowing for the quick and healthy development of ecosystems.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thank you for [joining] the last episode of this year 2021 for Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. We are now talking about how to budget projects, identity and access management projects, and we have very a interesting guest for that.</p>
<p>Originally from New Zealand, Ian Yoxall started Intragen in 2006 after working for several companies in the US and in London. As Principal Consultant and CEO of Intragen, Ian has worked on many of the largest projects in the Netherlands and throughout Western Europe. With a broad experience with small and large scale implementations, both in the private and public sector, he brings a pragmatic approach to problems that arise around identity and access management projects. Prior to joining Intragen, Ian worked for global infrastructure and security vendors and consultancies.</p>
<p>Hello, Ian.</p>
<p>Ian Yoxall: Good morning. Hello. And how are you Oscar?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Nice having you here, Ian.</p>
<p>Ian: It’s great to be here. Thank you for the invitation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Our pleasure. And please tell us a bit more how your career, your life led you to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Ian: Right. Well, yeah, that’s a long train wreck of a story. So let’s start off. Originally, I started in consulting as a DBA working for the various database vendors in infrastructure, and then moved across into business consulting, still with an infrastructural angle and infrastructural projects. And one day I arrived in London and sort of fell into banking security. And after that, I dropped into the gravity well that became identity and access management. And once you start down the career of identity and access management, you can’t escape. That’s it. That’s the end. Yeah, you can’t go anywhere else.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that attracts people to stay in it is it’s got a high failure rate. I have a personal hobby of flying, and when you fly a plane, nobody expects you to do everything perfectly, but it’s about making fewer mistakes and reducing your risks. And with the rapidly evolving industry that we’re in, it attracts plenty of bad actors. We’ve seen just recently the Log4j issues that have come up. And already that’s been weaponised and deployed very, very quickly. So when you’ve got bad actors who are so willing to try and make a profit here and attract businesses it’s an interesting field to work in.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it is definitely. It’s an exciting place to be working in these days, right? There are so many things happening, good and bad, of course, and that’s why we are here to solve the problems.</p>
<p>Ian: Exactly, exactly. And it’s that engaging with businesses to help solve those problems that makes it such an exciting field.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. I know that Intragen works in several industries, education, we are doing projects together in education, but you also work a lot with SMEs, so medium businesses, not known as large corporations, or some of these who are becoming, but still not there. And often we talk about all the capabilities that advance identity and access management have, everything you can do, but of course that costs money. If there is unlimited budget and time, you can, yeah, achieve everything that the brightest minds of identity have delivered until now. But how far you can go when you have more tighter budget, you don’t have enough budget, but you need IAM? So what would you say about that? So what – with some organisations listening to that in, “Yeah, we need IAM but the budget is tight. What can we do?”</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, great question Oscar. And it’s something that we try and engage our clients with on a regular basis, is saying “What sort of budget should you set for the upcoming budget period?” And I think it’s – from a CFO perspective, you don’t want to be throwing money away, but you do want to be covering risk from the CISO perspective.</p>
<p>Let’s take the hospital sector. They want to set a budget that delivers as much patient care as possible, but you can’t ignore the cyber threat, whether it’s fines or whether it’s payments that they’re making to unlock hospital systems. There has to be budget spent here because it’s going to be spent either for the bad actors or preferably to defence against the bad actors.</p>
<p>When you look at a lot of projects in the space, they generally will set themselves a relatively large scope and that they’ll have a budget and a timeframe of years. And we fundamentally feel that that’s not a good way to go. Think, what’s the fastest time to business value? So when you’re replacing the old infrastructure, and it might be that you’ve got an old identity management or access management system. Everybody has one. It’s just a question of, is it automated? Is it good? Is it ugly? Or what have you.</p>
<p>And if you’re doing a rip and replace type project, often the question is, OK, we just want it to do whatever the old system did but then against that, when are you going to get new business value in there? People want to see business value enhanced and more engagement, particularly with end users to make their lives easier. So if you turn the question on its head and say, “Look, I want to get some really nice goal. How do I get there? So what’s my first step? What are the big rocks that I need to put together my whole project breaking those big rocks down?”</p>
<p>So when we take access management, probably the first thing you want to do is make sure everybody loves you. So that’s going to involve making sure that the SSO elements, and the easiest SSO elements are there as quickly as possible. So you’re going to need an MVP, a Minimum Viable Product of your infrastructure around access management, getting the user datastore sorted, and then looking at all the web apps that you’ve got in the landscape. Take the ones that are best suited to the technology, take the business owners there that do want to engage and deliver that.</p>
<p>That small budget – that small initial success will create a bigger ripple effect for the organisation, whereby more business units and more applications will want to engage. And that’s what it is, by doing that, that small delivery, you tipped the scales, you’ve shown people what can be done, and you’re able to go back to the CFO and say, “Look, we did X amount of spend. And we’ve delivered this level of improvement in security. And for example, we’ll remove passwords from 10 or 15 applications, improving people’s productivity, making them happier, and enjoying what you get with SSO and multi-factor authentication.”</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, as you said, minimal viable product in which you mentioned, I think it’s mostly, well, two main features: single sign-on that is the basic, basic has to be there, and yeah, replacing passwords with some type of multi-factor authentication. So those are the very basic that you think has to be always in mind.</p>
<p>Ian: Absolutely, because if you start, I mean, it is the one thing. I just had my family, and we have, we all have devices here. And you know, whether it’s our Wi-Fi passwords, whether it’s the email addresses for school, whether it’s their – getting into the home network, or what have you, they all have different usernames and passwords. And even in my own home, this is something which falls for some reason under my responsibility.</p>
<p>And users who have 5, 10, 15 applications, they don’t really love security. They want to get on with the job. So if we’re able to make their life better, we’re going to affect organisational change. And really, looking at security, it’s not about the zeros and ones, it’s about that organisational change. And you’re only going to be able to do that if you can make people’s life easier.</p>
<p>If you’re going to make it easy for end users to log on with single sign-on they’ll love you for it. Likewise, if you’re an administrator and have access to privileged accounts, if you can use multi-factor authentication, and the same multi-factor authentication for many applications, or step-up authentication, it’s going to make your life easier, not harder. And that’s what we want to be doing in security, improving the security level and making it easy.</p>
<p>And I see passwords as being the one thing that you ask anybody in the street, “Do you hate your password?” And the answer is yes. And of course by proxy, that means that they hate the security team. And it is kind of annoying when you have a project and nobody wants to sit with you at lunch. So we’ve got to make their lives easier and make them want to engage.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And I can imagine, I’m sure you know better how many organisations already at medium level, not so small, don’t have SSO or they have – yeah, not sufficient, maybe they have, if a software just a couple of their systems and all the rest is not covered.</p>
<p>Ian: Exactly. And on that I have a little follow up thought. One of the things that we try and do is make it easy to decide what to do and how do you prioritise these projects? So normally, they’ll say, “Right, let’s take all of our applications.” “Well, do you really want to start there?” So what we try and do is say, if you start colour coding your applications, and say, “I’ve got black applications, which are super-secret, I’ve got red ones which are finance, and I’ve got green ones, and yellow ones, and purple ones, and blue ones.” And you put them in buckets that way, and then you’re not trying to cover your whole landscape.</p>
<p>And what you can report back, as you engage with those businesses, you can report back and say like, “We’ve covered all of our red applications now, all that stuff, which is in the cloud, or on a web server internally, we now have it 100% secured.” And that is something which you can report back to the board. And they get an insight into saying, “Oh yeah, we’ve asked the security to step in, they’ve come back. And we now know a definable metric that would actually improve our security.”</p>
<p>Rather than say, “I’ve done 20 applications out of 400.” If you do that by colour coding, that in itself, it makes sense to people. If you say I’ve done 20% of my applications. Well, is that good? Is that bad? I don’t know. So knowing what good looks like and using that colour coding system, even for something as a simple step, such as SSO, this is a great way to communicate and engage users.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I believe that sounds more tangible and easier to explain with someone, let’s say the IT manager of that company has to convince people, others in the company with, this is important. Yeah, it’s definitely a good way to continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Another thing that implies money indirectly is when time goes long. You plan one IAM project or any project, let’s say for six months, and it goes longer. And that means more money. So how would you go about running over time on an IAM project? I’m sure you have a lot of interesting stories to tell.</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, sadly, both good and bad. You know, every project is always going to give you a new set of challenges. And how do you deal with those challenges? Now, there’s a great quote from the British naval historian and author, Cyril Northcote Parkinson, who said, “It’s a commonplace observation that work expands to fill the available time for its completion.” You know, if you ask somebody to tidy their room, and you give them, I have children so if you give them two hours to tidy their room, they’ll take two hours. If you give them 10 minutes, they’ll do it in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>So how do you again, not just looking at budget but on time, how do you do that with identity and access management projects? I think there was a good report from Gartner a few years back saying that the number one killer of these projects is scope creep. And it’s very, very difficult to rein that in, because there are always things in every project that creep up. So you’ve got to have first off exceptionally strong project governance, not just on the project manager, on the project sponsors, and communicating that.</p>
<p>Let’s say you do increase the project scope for a very good reason, then there is still going to be a delay and will be perceived as a delay. So whether it’s doing things such as saying, “Well, this is the MVP core, and then MVP extra, any way in which you can separate that out and do it as the next step, in the next follow up, absolutely needs to be done.” Because something we talk about is losing the coffee corner argument, where people will talk about a project and about the perception of the project, and particularly around security where even when you’re taking…</p>
<p>Let’s take the passwords example. Up to now people have been using 10 passwords and they knew their 10 passwords. You’re going to replace that with single sign-on. It’s a change. Nobody likes change. And if there’s something that goes wrong, and generally something goes wrong in all projects, they’re going to blame the project. So it’s very important to take small bites at a time, you know how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Small incremental steps that deliver business value for each step and resist the temptation to increase scope. Put that into a tomorrow bucket. Always find a way to define a separate list. And that’s one of the reasons why we really like doing projects in an agile manner.</p>
<p>Again, looking at – let’s take access management. It’s very relevant. You’re going to need to have the relevant service set up, that core infrastructure. But that’s a relatively small part of the project. What’s going to take most of the time in the project is getting the application factory to onboard applications. And by doing that in sprints saying, you know we’ll do five applications this week, or 10 applications this week, depending on how big your factory is, you’re able to deliver business value quickly, and show people that it’s actually progressing.</p>
<p>You can increase the size of the factory by turning the tap up or tap down on funding. And by delivering value in each sprint it’s tangible to the business. They actually get to see from a risk perspective that the attack surface is reduced, you’re reducing costs because you’ve got fewer password resets, and you’re making everybody’s life easier. So step by step, as long as you’re always delivering business value, instead of doing it in three months increments or 12-month increments.</p>
<p>I was talking to a project a few days ago, and they’ve been doing a three-year phase so nothing would be delivered for three years. Now, I don’t know about you, but I can’t remember anything for more than three weeks, let alone in three years. So that sort of approach, we’ve got to move away from these big projects. And let’s be honest, a lot of consultancies like to work this way because it’s got a big budget attached to it. It’s, you know, you can put a lot of people on, it’s very easy to plan resourcing that way.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t really work for clients. And I think we as an industry, we need to make sure that we’re making our clients’ lives easier, not harder. Because the projects do go on, they do become business as usual processes. There will always be new cloud applications coming along. You want to make it trivially easy for the business to say, “Oh, I’ve gone and added a new cloud application. It just came on. It’s fantastic. It does everything we want. Can you tie that in to SSO?”</p>
<p>If that takes you longer than a couple of business days to engage with them, plan it and get it done, you’re doing it wrong. And I think that’s one of the values that companies like Ubisecure bring – standards-based ways to onboard these applications and really integrate the security. I’ve seen so many data breaches from luckily ex-customers, but still they’re data breaches that caused millions of losses and damages, where these orphaned accounts don’t get picked up. And with cloud computing, which is fantastic and great and enables businesses to move quickly, if we as IT security can’t make sure that we’re enabling the business to choose the applications they want, and onboard them so that we’re taking away this problem, we’re really not doing a good job if we can’t do that in a fast and easy way. And make sure that those sprints are done quickly.</p>
<p>So how do you dot on the horizon 100% coverage? Make sure that every single quarter or whatever accounting period you’ve got where you’re reporting progress vs budget, you can actually write down tangible business benefits. And this is what’s been going on. The board needs to know that things are working. And it’s up to us to do a better job of explaining that.</p>
<p>I see a lot of reporting up to the board on these projects where people say the project is now progressing through phase one. But what does that mean? If we can say we have taken out 30 business critical systems and made sure that then there are no simple passwords to be hacked there. They’ve all got password rotation on there, using multi-factor authentication. We’ve got encryption enabled via a single SSO access. This is the kind of stuff that they can say, “OK, I understand that. I can see why we’re funding these things.”</p>
<p>So yeah, sorry about the big rant there. But getting that corporate governance risk framework to match what we’re doing in security, it’s really important to have those communication so that people can see yes, it takes time but that during each of these cycles and time, it’s fixing things and it can’t be words. It’s got to be metrics.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you mentioned scope creep. So that one of the main… yeah, potential cause of problems starting – trying to start with too big scope, trying to put too much and that will very likely become longer and longer. And as you said, getting this what you call the sprints or phases in which you get results, that’s absolutely great.</p>
<p>You mentioned for instance, reporting to boards. So now we’re – if you think of smaller companies, less regulated companies, mid-market companies, organisations that they also are building products or services for their customers. Yeah, how they can – with the investment they are doing – maximise time to value for the services they are building?</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, good question. So when I started this a long time ago, back when my hair was a different colour, it was all very artwork to put these projects together. I remember when the SAML standard started getting released. So this is the days before OAuth or what have you.</p>
<p>So the first thing is you’ve got to base your security vision on a standards-based product. So leveraging scalable products that give off the shelf functionality that matches what you’re looking for. So for example, you know, does it have a uer datastore that can be extended to support the various needs you have? What’s the vision of the company? Does it match your own vision? Using these products that are well-defined and well-understood and have clear standards in them, they’re off the shelf. So it should really be a plug and play type approach.</p>
<p>I’m seeing more and more companies want to move away from bespoke development. They want a roadmap that lets them get to those things as… well, let’s take the Joe Biden quote, you know, he’s been talking about single sign-on and cloud computing and zero trust. So defining those components that, you know, you can’t buy zero trust. Defining those components, means you’re going to need to leverage scalable products off the shelf that can be tied together relatively quickly.</p>
<p>So yeah, that’s the first thing that says choose products that aren’t going to require a massive amount of customisation. And I think some of the organisations that we’ve seen have taken a gated funding approach to say, “Well, here’s a ton of money, go and do X and go and do Y and go and do Z.” You learn as you go along on these projects. Every organisation we deal with, it has a vision on security but as you engage with the business, you discover a whole bunch of issues and challenges that are different. And the company’s vision of what security looks like, and what good looks like will change very quickly.</p>
<p>I’m dealing with a customer right now, who’s about to start their project in January. And they’re clinging on to the belief that they can know every problem that they’re going to face for a two-year project on day one. And the short answer is, just can’t do that. So taking a more agile approach, understanding that you don’t know everything that will be, there will be hiccups. It’s just a safer, easier way to go because you can’t know everything around these spaces. So whether it’s, we talked about the profile database, do you know you’re going to need that? Well, in which case then make sure you’re going to choose a product with that. But there may be other aspects you don’t know yet. So be prepared for those unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>Oscar: And who, as I said, in SMEs, in a medium organisation, who, from that side, from the customer side, from the organisation side, who would lead this project? Who is the best person to lead this project?</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, actually, I’m about to head to a meeting to discuss that. So it’s important, you’ve got to define your stakeholders fairly widely. So of course, IT has a role to play in here. But it can’t be an IT party. That’s the sort of guarantee of failure, I guess. Failure is a strong word, but you’re only ever going to get an initial deployment within the things that IT sees. And IT has a very narrow focus of the business. So it’s important to get – people will say, engage with the business. Well, who is the business?</p>
<p>Whether it’s finance, whether it’s whatever operational units you have that do whatever you do as a business, engage with them, understand their problems. What are the 10 things – if they’re logging on 15 times a day, if they have a problem with people getting access, what are those things? You need to engage with those people. If they’re not with their hands in the steering committee, it’s going to very quickly become a pure IT exercise and that’s, you know, an academic thing which will deliver a project, but it will be, if you will, a successful failure.</p>
<p>You need to engage with the heads of business. If it’s a bank, talk to the head of trading. If you’re talking to a hospital, you want to be talking to the heads of department of the different areas, you know, in radiology or what have you. You need to be talking to those people, what are the real things that happen in their day so that you can match things up.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so it sounds like, there’s not only one single person in the customer side, so this is going to be you as IAM vendor of consulting, selling the solution, the full solution had to convince several of these persons including IT of course to join forces.</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah. Exactly. And getting that ownership of the systems, who then owns that core infrastructure? Should it stay with IT or should those business processes belong somewhere else? I mean, one of the things, whether you’re looking at customer identity and access management, you know, marketing has a huge role here. And it’s important for them to understand what the user journey is, and what we’re delivering there.</p>
<p>I know we’ve all had that experience where we try and buy something online and you know, it’s like, I want your date of birth, and you’re buying a pen, or whatever it is. Like, why do you need to know my date of birth, if I buy it? Make the buying experience as simple as it is when you go into a shop. You go into a shop, you get something off the shelf, you walk up to the counter, you do a financial transaction. Is it really essential to capture all that information of the end user? Make that the easiest, happiest process ever and you’ll get customers back.</p>
<p>Just this week, I was… rather in the run up to Christmas. I was buying things online. And in some of the customer identity and access management sites I was at, were so painful, I just closed it down. I’d already picked everything, put it in the basket. So making sure that you’re engaging with the stakeholders who are going to be using whatever security system you’ve got in place is fundamental.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And we also know that some organisations already have the policy of a gated funding approach for most of their projects, including IAM, that could be one of those. So what would you say about the gated funding approach? What are the problems you have found? And how organisations who are into this have good results?</p>
<p>Ian: When you look at projects, people are obviously very concerned about this scope creep issue. So they’ll try and define a fixed scope with a fixed set of deliverables, with a fixed budget. That sounds like a good idea. However, you’re always going to, you know, and when you baseline that plan, it all looks great and you start on day one. But whether it’s on day two, or day 10, or day 50, there will be changes come along. And how do you then account for that? Do you want to do exception reports, request for additional budget, and so forth?</p>
<p>So you can control a project that way. We find it’s a good approach. But it’s not the best approach. It tends to lead to waterfall type thinking and thinking that there will be a deliverable and then the project will stop. And as we know, security never stops, it becomes business as usual. So whilst it has the best intentions, no project ever completes the scope exactly as it was set.</p>
<p>So then designing a project with a minimal viable product for infrastructure, and then moving quickly to an agile based approach, where you can have a backlog and then vary the pace of the project according to funding, so you’re still controlling the spend. But the deliverables, again, are, this is what we delivered for this budget. We’re learning as we go, and our understanding of the IT security landscape and how it engages the business is evolving as a company.</p>
<p>There isn’t a company out there that wakes up and says, “I’d like to do identity and access management now.” No. Well, we do because that’s our business. But every other company out there is trying to do some other business problem. And they’re trying to solve that for their customers and their employees, or whoever the stakeholders are. And to get that thing delivered, they need to do identity and access management. So then they come to us and are looking for us as the experts in the field for what’s the best approach.</p>
<p>So again, buy a package, leverage what’s in the package, deliver the minimum viable product, learn as you go, educate the business, and it’s about effecting organisational change. And that can have a budget set, but understand that it will vary and you need to make sure you have good progress reporting, good dashboards on what has been delivered, understanding the key metrics around identity and access management. Maybe it’s about how many fewer password reset you’re doing. Or, again, we talked about what scope of systems are covered? Are all the red and yellow and green systems covered? Rather than just saying, you know, “70% of our applications.” What does good look like? We don’t know.</p>
<p>So again, we need to educate people on what those KPIs and measures are, what they need to do to find their big rocks, put the dot on the horizon, and then say, “We would set a budget of around this amount, but monitor progress versus budget, increasing the velocity of a project by adding more expert services in or decrease your spend and your velocity to stay within the budget you need to do.</p>
<p>We saw the zero day attacks come out with this Log4j. Obviously, people would have been very busy that first weekend, getting all their engineers to start scanning all their systems and patching everything as quickly as they can. That’s going to have a big impact on budget. You can’t know these things in advance. So you have to be able to turn the tap up and down in response to the environment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent, excellent. Definitely. Very, very tactically important what you said the importance of reporting, knowing the status and yeah, going step by step, sprint by sprint, being agile as you said.</p>
<p>Ian: When we moved from passwords ourselves, because we were originally we had a little, well, data centre is a strong term for it, but we had a room full of computers. And then we moved to 100% cloud, and then you know, with a complete SSO and MFA solution as well. Getting the base infrastructure in place didn’t take long. What took a long time was tying all the elements together. So being able to report on that we know we’ve eaten our own dog food. We know the challenges clients have. So we have a lot of sympathy, and understand that you can’t pick up everything on day one.</p>
<p>So what’s the easy way to apply a budget to something and then monitor that and deliver that and show people that you’ve delivered it? If it remains a secret, it’s no use. If you’re able to evangelise that throughout the organisation, you’re going to get the organisational change you’re looking for. If you look at it from a security perspective, everybody talks about the X Factor. Today, the bad end user. Getting the X factor to understand, hey, security is not here to make your life bad. We’ve got to engage these end users so that they don’t run in fear and they do want to sit with us at the lunch table.</p>
<p>Oscar: Ian, final question for you. For all business leaders listening to this conversation we are having, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Ian: Talk to me. No, I’m sorry. Joking.</p>
<p>Oscar: Talk to Ian. Write down that.</p>
<p>Ian: Exactly. I’ve got all the answers they need. No, no. That’s a bit facetious there. So if there’s one thing that you need to do as a business, it’s have a plan here, have an actionable plan with actionable insights. So that’s going to comprise of a couple of elements. You need to know where you are. If you don’t know where you are, then you don’t know how far you’ve got to go. If you just say, for example, he has a ton of money to go implement PAM or MFA or what have you, well, where are you and how has the landscape changed?</p>
<p>So you need an assessment of where you are now, which should take a couple of weeks to get done, measuring a number of aspects around identity management, access management, role management, PAM, and so on and so forth, business alignment. And then say, “OK, looking at these measures, which one item do I want to fix first?” You need to have actionable insights come from that.</p>
<p>And that’s the key thing I’d say, if there’s one thing having actionable insights in security that you can say, “I need to do X now.” Not in a month or in six weeks, because cybersecurity can be a nebulous problem. It can feel OK, I read another hacking story on what have you or that company had a data breach or what have you. You’ve got to have actionable insight that say to the CFO, allocate budget, that give the CISO something to talk about and say, “These items need addressing.” So the CEO can then make the decision, “Yeah, that’s good. Let’s go get those things done.”</p>
<p>And then with those actionable insights, what are the KPIs and metrics associated with that, so that when it’s delivered, you can show how you’d move the needle. Now that the needles done and you’ve solved that problem, go back to the list. What’s the next actionable insight? If you’re not able to prove that you’re fixing things, then you’re just spending money and people kind of wonder, what are those security guys doing in the corner there? They’re costing a lot of money and they’re – half the time we can’t even log on. You’ve got to be able to prove those actionable insights and the delivery of them to everybody in the company.</p>
<p>I was at a company recently. In the middle of the lobby, they have all sorts of dashboards on big TV screens. And I was happy to see that they’d now added the security dashboards on there as well. So people could see things going to green, lines trending the correct way, traffic lights being the right colour. That’s exactly what we need to do to show people. “Yeah, IT security is doing what it needs to do.”</p>
<p>So if it’s just one thing I have to say, I know I said a lot there, define actionable insights for your business that will improve your security posture and demonstrate that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and that’s where, for instance, it could be in a visible place in the office. Yeah, that’s something that I like the idea of, what we were discussing today. Well, thanks a lot, Ian, for this very interesting conversation. Please let us know how people who would like to continue the conversation with you, how to find you on the net?</p>
<p>Ian: Well, yes. So please reach out to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-yoxall-690184/">LinkedIn profile</a>, it’s an open profile. I’d love to hear from you. Whether you’ve got problems or you want to agree with me or disagree with me, always happy to engage with people. And I’d like to wish everybody a Merry Christmas and all the best for 2022 and happy security days out there!</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot Ian and for you, Ian, for everybody who is listening there. Happy New Year! Happy New Year 2022 and see you next year.</p>
<p>Ian: Thank you very much, Oscar.</p>

Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton spoke, took no questions, and agreed that the multi-trillion dollar crypto innovation space is a dark, menacing threat that legitimate crypto entrepreneurs must follow opaque rules or face crippling SEC lawsuits. Gensler made it clear that there is no difference between “fraudsters” and “good-faith actors” in crypto — both are lawbreakers endangering the&nbsp;public.</blockquote><blockquote>Many in the audience of crypto industry leaders, just maligned as crooks, were stunned. Gensler repeatedly said that “platforms need to come in and get registered,” as if everyone knew what he was talking about. Perianne Boring, the head of the Digital Chamber of Commerce tweeted, “People in the room are looking around and asking, “register as&nbsp;what?””</blockquote><blockquote>It’s a fair question given that the exchange Coinbase — the only crypto company to have gone public on the stock market — tried “going in”. Upon sharing to share its lending platform information, the SEC slapped Coinbase with a subpoena and the threat of what Gensler affectionately calls “the enforcement tool.”</blockquote><p>And so a year later, the U.S. continues to find itself in murky waters when it comes to regulatory clarity and crypto innovation.</p>  Jay Clayton’s crypto op-ed: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-future-depends-on-blockchain-crypto-bitcoin-payments-transfers-federal-reserve-11639668586?mod=article_inline">Opinion | America’s Future Depends on the Blockchain</a>  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s response: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/blockchain-crypto-defi-sec-ripple-regulation-lawsuit-access-warren-11640218049">Opinion | Great Potential, Great Obstacles for Blockchain</a>  <p>Some startups such as Open Props have tried to navigate the existing regulatory landscape in earnest — and failed.

<p>Happy holidays to the Magic community!</p><p>Since our last product update, we’ve launched a multifaceted set of capabilities that enable you to do more with&nbsp;Magic.</p><p>In this post, I’ll cover the latest highlights and improvements.</p> Multi-factor Authentication <p>Developers can now enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your users! This capability allows customers to add a layer of security to their end-user accounts. This means a secondary factor is validated along with the existing primary factor to log in to an account. Typically, the primary factor is an email, and a secondary factor is a phone number or mobile device authenticator. The idea is that both factors will need to be compromised to breach an&nbsp;account.</p><p>The benefits of enabling MFA&nbsp;include:</p>  MFA reduces the risk of a compromised account or stolen NFTs by requiring users to provide multiple credentials to access their accounts.  It protects users from theft. By requiring multiple authentication methods, MFA adds a layer of security from a stolen laptop or&nbsp;device.  MFA is one of the most straightforward and robust security methods a developer can enable. Magic makes enabling MFA simple with one click in the dashboard.  It helps your users meet regulatory compliance standards. You should enable MFA if your users must meet HIPAA, PCI, or CJIS compliance standards.  <p>Magic offers MFA through mobile authenticator apps like Authy or Google Authenticator. Email and SMS primary factors are currently supported. Magic will add WebAuthn, and social login primary factors support in the future. To get started, head to the dashboard and enable MFA or read more about the integration <a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-methods/mfa">here</a>.</p> Custom Email&nbsp;Provider <p>Have you wanted to customize the sender of your email magic link login? With Magic, you can now route emails through your Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. Enabling the custom email provider gives you complete control over where your app’s login email is sent from, as well as the name of the&nbsp;sender.</p><p>Magic will send email magic links through your SMTP server as soon as you configure the custom email provider. Disabling the custom email provider will restore sending emails from <a href="mailto:noreply@trymagic.com">noreply@trymagic.com</a>. Magic’s custom email provider is compatible with leading SMTP servers. Please visit our <a href="https://magic.link/docs/advanced/customization/custom-smtp">docs</a> for more information on how to get&nbsp;started.</p> Teams <p>We believe when it comes to building great apps, collaboration is critical. That’s why we are introducing Teams. Every Magic developer is given a personal team where you can invite up to two collaborators to help integrate Magic, update branding, or manage your users. As a collaborator, you will have access to any teams you have been invited to and your personal workspace.</p><p>Teams consist of two basic permission levels: a team owner and collaborators. The team owner has complete control over their account and is responsible for billing and managing team members. Collaborators have access to Dashboard functionality to collaborate on any project within the owner’s account. To add members to your project, head to your Magic Dashboard and look for My Team to get&nbsp;started.</p> Magic Login Form: Privacy Policy and Terms of&nbsp;Service <p>Our Magic Login Form enables a developer to integrate passwordless login with just 2 script tags. Seamlessly link to your applications Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and have them shown within the <a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-form">Magic Login Form</a>. to new registering users and returning login users. For more information on embedding a URI, review our script options&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-form#script-options">here</a>.</p> SMS Login for&nbsp;SDKs <p>SMS Login support has been expanded to our Mobile, Flutter, iOS, and Android SDKs! This release enables developers to easily integrate SMS Login to their applications on any of the supported platforms.</p> Thank you <p>As 2021 comes to a close, I want to thank you for your support over this last year! At Magic, we are focused on helping our fast-growing developer community solve complex authentication, decentralized identity, and blockchain problems. So I want to invite you to join the Magic community on <a href="https://community.magic.link/">Discord</a>, say hello, share product ideas and help others learn in this technology space.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/magic-product-updates-december-edition-7a24a3dcd4e4">Magic Product Updates: December Edition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Data: A New Direction — But Which Direction? <p>This is the fifth and final blog in our series about the UK Government’s proposals for data protection reform — “Data: A New Direction”. Previous blogs focused on the thinking behind the proposals. This blog summarises what the main proposals are.</p><p>Stated plainly, the UK Government is planning to end data protection rights for UK citizens. Reforms proposed in its paper Data: A New Direction would shift the core operating principle of data protection regulations from citizen protection (that personal data shall only be collected by organisations “for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes”) to a new principle that organisations should have the right to build and maintain databases about citizens without their&nbsp;consent.</p><p>This Briefing Paper shows how the Government is planning to achieve this radical ‘new direction’ for data. (Paragraphs 57 and 58 of the Consultation, around which this ‘New Direction’ pivots are reproduced in the Addendum.)</p> Background <p>The Government is taking the opportunity of Brexit to ‘reform’ data protection law. “Now that we have left the EU, we have the freedom to create a bold new data regime,” says the Minister in his introduction. The stated intention of this “bold new data regime” is to “usher in a new golden age of growth and innovation right across the UK”. This, to be achieved by creating “​​a better balance between protecting individuals and not impeding responsible data use” [Paragraph 59] — a ‘better balance’ that ends citizen data protection rights in all but name, replacing them with corporate rights&nbsp;instead.</p><p>The Minister’s introduction states that “The protection of people’s personal data must be at the heart of our new regime. Without public trust, we risk missing out on the benefits a society powered by responsible data use has to offer.” But the content of the actual proposals do the opposite.</p> What the law currently says <p>The core principle of existing GDPR data protection regulations is that personal data shall only be “collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes”.</p><p>A key supporting principle is that of data minimisation: that personal data shall be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed”.</p><p>There are six conditions for the lawful processing of personal data but the two central ones are&nbsp;that:</p>  the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;  processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;  <p>Conditions for lawful processing envisage situations where “processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party”. But these legitimate interests come with a ‘balancing test’ to test whether they should be “overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal&nbsp;data”.</p> What the UK Government is proposing <p>On the grounds of addressing ‘consent fatigue’, the Government is proposing to:</p><blockquote>“create a limited, exhaustive list of legitimate interests for which organisations can use personal data without applying the balancing test in order to give them more confidence to process personal data without unnecessary recourse to consent.” [Paragraph 57]</blockquote><p>Paragraph 57 adds that “The processing would still have to be necessary for the stated purposes and proportionate.” But the ‘exhaustive’ list of exceptions to this rule provided in Paragraph 58 is so broad that organisations would have the right to process personal data without individuals’ consent in the vast majority of use cases. In other words, Paragraph 57 renders the safeguard meaningless, leaving it for window dressing&nbsp;only.</p><p>The pivotal clause is Paragraph 58 (i), which makes “Managing or maintaining a database to ensure that records of individuals are accurate and up to date, and to avoid unnecessary duplication” a ‘legitimate interest’ where organisations need not seek individuals’ consent for the processing of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>This deft wrecking amendment turns the current rule — that personal data should only be processed for specified, explicit purposes — on its head, promoting organisations’ right to collect data about individuals without their consent instead. No limit or restriction to organisations’ right to collect data for their databases is mentioned.</p><p>The rest of the consultation extends the exceptions to cover most uses to which organisations put data, including for research, business innovation, web analytics, AI training, use of cookies, and data sharing. For example, Paragraph 58 (i) is supplemented by Paragraph 58(h) which includes “Using personal data for internal research and development purposes, or business innovation purposes aimed at improving services for customers”. No definition for ‘internal research’ or ‘business innovation’ is provided, making them vague enough for Cambridge Analytica to claim that its activities were entirely&nbsp;lawful.</p><p>Paragraph 58(c) has another exception. “Monitoring, detecting or correcting bias in relation to developing AI systems” would now also be a ‘legitimate interest’ where individuals’ consent for data processing is no longer needed. This might seem innocent. Desirable even. But practically speaking, the best way to use data to eliminate the risk of bias is to have as comprehensive and complete a database as possible — which means this clause could (and will) be used by some corporations as good reason to collect all possible data about every individual: it opens the door to total data surveillance. (It is also based on a false premise: that the main cause of bias in AI deployments is lack of access to data. This is not true. The main cause of bias in AI is poor management of the processes for testing and deployment: a people thing, not a data&nbsp;thing.)</p><p>That this is the direction of travel intended by the Government is confirmed by other proposals which include unspecified measures that would “permit organisations to use personal data more freely, subject to appropriate safeguards, for the purpose of training and testing AI responsibly” [Paragraph 81] and to ‘disapply’ individuals’ current right to object to automated processing [Paragraph 48]&nbsp;.</p><p>The Government continues in the same direction with its proposals to reduce ‘consent fatigue’ as it relates to cookies. Paragraph 195 proposes to “permit organisations to use analytics cookies and similar technologies without the user’s consent.” (The term ‘analytics cookies’ is used in a variety of different ways without a single, clear definition.)</p><p>Paragraph 197 would “permit organisations to store information on, or collect information from, a user’s device without their consent for other limited purposes” where ‘other limited purposes’ “could include processing that is necessary for the legitimate interests.” (In other words, the free-for-all created by Paragraph 58).</p><p>Question 2.4.4 simply asks “To what extent do you agree that the requirement for prior consent should be removed for all types of cookies?” Again, a door opener to total data surveillance.</p><p>Meanwhile Paragraph 43(b) seeks to expand the grounds for lawful processing of personal data to include ‘research purposes’, with no stipulations on what may be included or not included in the definition of ‘research’.</p> Implications <p>The purpose of these ‘reforms’ seems to be to create a completely ‘free market’ for the trading of UK citizens’ data, without their consent. The Ministerial introduction talks of “secur[ing] the UK’s status as a global hub for the free and responsible flow of personal data” (Note the word ‘responsible’ again. See&nbsp;below).</p><p>To this end, Paragraph 51(g) (part of an extended discussion on lifting restrictions on the ‘further processing’ of personal data) notes that “Innovative data uses may involve sharing personal data sets between different controllers”. This opens the door to corporations trading peoples’ data without their knowledge and behind their backs. To this end, the Government intends to clarify “When personal data may be re-used by a different controller than the original controller who collected the data, and whether this constitutes further processing.” If this ‘clarification’ is based on the new definition of ‘legitimate interest’, it could make UK citizens’ data a globally traded commodity over which they have no&nbsp;say.</p><p>In sum, the net effect of the new regulations would be to turn data protection regulation on its head, effectively removing all main citizen rights and giving organisations carte blanche to collect and use personal data as they wish, without individuals’ consent, thereby opening the door to unrestricted data surveillance and value extraction. All in the name of ‘innovation and&nbsp;growth’.</p> The regulatory environment <p>As part of this ‘New Direction’ for data, the Government is also seeking to compromise the independence of the regulator — the Information Commissioner’s Office. Key elements of the extended discussion on this subject are the proposals [Paragraph 326] to “place a new duty on it [the ICO] to have regard for economic growth and innovation when discharging its functions”.</p><p>The absurdity of this concept becomes apparent if it is applied to other areas of regulatory enforcement. Should the Health and Safety Executive or Trading Standards Officers ‘have regard for economic growth and innovation when discharging their functions’, ‘balancing’ the requirements of health and safety and honesty in trading against the ‘needs’ for economic growth? What such rules and regulations do is create boundaries that channel innovation and economic growth in a certain direction: a direction that protects health and safety rather than undermines it.</p><p>Likewise with data protection. When it comes to data, the Government wants to compromise rules and regulations that channel innovation and economic growth in a direction that protects citizens’ data to take the nation in “a new direction” (the title of its Paper) — one that exploits citizens’ data instead. Should the ICO have held back on fines on Cambridge Analytica on the grounds that it was promoting innovation and&nbsp;growth?</p><p>This overt political interference in the enforcement of law is confirmed by [Paragraph 319] which introduces “a power for the Secretary of State for DCMS to prepare a statement of strategic priorities to inform how the ICO sets its own regulatory priorities”.</p> The nature of the consultation process <p>At 146 pages and over 50,000 words of dense, technical (and often obfuscatory) commentary, the consultation seems designed not to be read, the purpose being to hide its true intent, made possible by carefully chosen wrecking amendments that are hidden in a welter of often irrelevant detail. How many people have had the time or energy to read and inwardly digest the full document to grasp its implications?</p><p>One of the stated justifications for the proposals are that current regulations are “unnecessarily complex or vague” and continuing to “cause persistent uncertainty”. Yet the consultation itself is both unnecessarily complex and&nbsp;vague.</p><p>Its use of the word ‘responsible’ is a good example. The consultation highlights the difficulty of defining terms like ‘the public interest’ and has an extended discussion of the meaning of ‘fair processing’, concluding that “Comprehensively defining ‘outcome fairness’ in the context of AI within the data protection regime may [therefore] not be a feasible or effective approach”. But with the word ‘responsible’ it introduces a term new to data protection regulations, using it 52 times&nbsp;… without ever defining&nbsp;it.</p> Rationale for&nbsp;reform <p>The Government’s main justification for these ‘reforms’ (other than to rectify ‘confusion and vagueness’) is to address ‘consent fatigue’ and “unleash data’s power across the economy and society for the benefit of British citizens and British businesses” thereby “ushering in a new golden age of growth and innovation right across the&nbsp;UK”.</p><p>Neither of these justifications stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>‘Consent fatigue’ is mainly caused by the widespread gaming of consent systems, compounded by lax regulator oversight. The problem can be better addressed without any changes to the law, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-need-to-talk-about-consent-480f6087a0fe">as we show&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>The ‘innovation and growth’ envisioned by the Government in this Consultation represents a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">deep misunderstanding of what makes data valuable</a>; <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">misconceptions about where the biggest opportunities for innovation</a> lie and how to enable them; and a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and potential of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>In short, because it is intellectually incoherent and flawed, it will not achieve its stated goal: to “unleash data’s power across the economy and society for the benefit of British citizens and British businesses”. In fact, it is almost certain to do the exact opposite.</p> This blog&nbsp;series <p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is Data Valuable?</a> Exposes misconceptions about the value of data, and therefore where its biggest economic potential lies.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">Five Myths about Data, Innovation and Growth</a> Explains why the Government’s claims that its ‘reforms’ will promote innovation and growth are without foundation.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-the-emperors-new-clothes-91de9eed3650">AI: The Emperor’s New Clothes?</a> Examines common misconceptions about AI, which the Government repeats and uses as justification for its proposed ‘reforms’.  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-need-to-talk-about-consent-480f6087a0fe">We Need To Talk About Consent</a> Explains why ‘consent’ to data processing got to be a problem and how to address it — without having to change the&nbsp;law.   Addendum: Paragraphs 57 and 58 in&nbsp;full <p>57. The government therefore proposes to create a limited, exhaustive list of legitimate interests for which organisations can use personal data without applying the balancing test in order to give them more confidence to process personal data without unnecessary recourse to consent. The processing would still have to be necessary for the stated purposes and proportionate. For those activities not on the list, the balancing test would still be applied. The balancing test could also be maintained for use of children’s data, irrespective of whether the data was being processed in connection with an activity on the list. The government is mindful that Article 6(1)(f) of the UK GDPR recognises that particular care should be taken when data controllers are relying on the legitimate interests lawful ground to process data relating to children.</p><p>58. Any list would also need to be sufficiently generic to withstand the test of time, although the government envisages it could be updated via a regulation-making power. In that respect, the list would be similar to the approach in Section 8 of the Data Protection Act 2018 for the public tasks processing condition. For example, it could cover processing activities which are necessary for:</p>  Reporting of criminal acts or safeguarding concerns to appropriate authorities  Delivering statutory public communications and public health and safety messages by non-public bodies  Monitoring, detecting or correcting bias in relation to developing AI systems (see section 1.5 for further&nbsp;details)  Using audience measurement cookies or similar technologies to improve web pages that are frequently visited by service&nbsp;users  Improving or reviewing an organisation’s system or network&nbsp;security  Improving the safety of a product or service that the organisation provides or&nbsp;delivers  De-identifying personal data through pseudonymisation or anonymisation to to improve data&nbsp;security  Using personal data for internal research and development purposes, or business innovation purposes aimed at improving services for customers  Managing or maintaining a database to ensure that records of individuals are accurate and up to date, and to avoid unnecessary duplication   <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-a-new-direction-but-which-direction-da547b886ac0">Data: A New Direction — But Which Direction?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 SHR Staking and Swap are coming soon: make sure you’re #ONETHELIST for early access 



<p>Part of our mission at ShareRing is to enable frictionless access. By giving people control of their digital assets, identity, and economic freedom, we empower individuals to engage and move in-and-between industries with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital assets and earnings play a big role in this mission. In the centralised finance environment we exist in, transparency and control of your own assets are highly restricted and monitored. This inability to wholly manage your assets without a third party overseeing all movements impersonates characteristics of distrust and restriction. ShareRing can help overcome this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/df41607cfe7e/ddhhw9cnal">Sign Up Here</a> for your chance to be selected for our pre-release early access.</p>







<p>Today, we’re announcing new features to the ShareRing app, Staking and Swap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staking will offer our users the choice to delegate their $SHR to our masternodes, and earn $SHR rewards in return. Staking also helps facilitate the economic security of ShareLedger (our blockchain), ensuring that our ecosystem runs at its optimum level at all times.&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://mailchi.mp/df41607cfe7e/ddhhw9cnal"></a>



<p>Swap has long been a feature in our roadmap. Initially we created $SHR as BEP2, however as we have matured we too see the need to develop a BEP20 token. Although this is still in development, you are now able to swap your $SHR with other ERC20 wallets, as well as those native to ShareLedger.</p>



<p>Available Swaps:</p>



<p>SLP3-SHR &lt;–&gt; SLP3-SHR&nbsp;</p>



<p>SLP3-SHR &lt;–&gt; ERC20-SHR</p>



<p>(SLP3-SHR is ShareToken native to ShareLedger)</p>



<p>Developing Community</p>



<p>Staking and Swap will be core features of ShareRing. With a lively, vibrant, secure community of masternode holders and stakers (delegators), we all share the belief and recognition that ShareRing enables a frictionless digital future, whether it be engaging with businesses, or managing your own digital assets.&nbsp;</p>

 Part 2 of our discussion around Decentralized Identification solutions, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) <p>In the previous article, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/why-ens-does-not-spell-end-for-did-1d2ef9f197c">Why ENS does not spell END for DID (part 1)</a>, we mentioned that ENS domain names are essentially also decentralized identifiers. So the question is whether there is any difference between ENS and&nbsp;DID?</p> Performance logic <p>The identifier of ENS is the domain name, namely “xxx.eth”. This identifier is readable for users, which is also the most basic goal of ENS, to make unreadable Ethereum addresses resolve to user-friendly identifiers ENS domain names through&nbsp;ENS.</p><p>For DID, its identifier is “did:method:xxxxxx”, for example, the DID identifier provided by Ontology is: “Did:ont:AMQoUFjwjVNNSejomUPRmGrkQDyvmujDt5”, which is a string of “did”, DID Method name “ont” and the address on the Ontology, which is unreadable to&nbsp;users.</p><p>However, the identifier of DID is not fixed but can be designed according to requirements. The DID Method rules give the designer the ability to define DID specifications, and the designer of the DID scheme can also design it as a readable address, such as “did:ont:iris”. This means that designers can take greater initiative in the readability of DID identifiers.</p> Implementation logic <p>In addition to identifiers, ENS and DID are also very different in their implementation logic.</p><p>1. Focus</p><p>For now, ENS itself pays more attention to the associated address. For users, ENS associates the user’s Ethereum address with the domain name through the functions of resolution and reverse resolution, and realizes the binding of the domain name and the internet account. This is then realized as a single sign-on in&nbsp;Web3;</p><p>The information that DID pays attention to is more extensive, and it is also biased towards user personal&nbsp;data:</p>  Contains user’s on-chain data, such as multi-chain addresses, content hashes, on-chain interactions, etc.;  Follow users’ off-chain information, in addition to internet information such as Twitter and mailboxes, they will also follow users’ actual data through third-party authoritative institutions. These sensitive data will be encrypted to generate verifiable credentials, which are saved by the&nbsp;user.  <p>2. On-chain&nbsp;storage</p><p>For user data (on-chain and off-chain), ENS and DID have different storage&nbsp;methods.</p><p>ENS is recorded through the Ethereum smart contract (parser), for example, the content identifier in the IPFS network is recorded through content hash; centralized information such as Twitter, Github, and Email is recorded through text. This means that ENS-based accounts are more open and can be&nbsp;checked.</p><p>According to a survey conducted by <a href="https://blog.sismo.io/a-survey-on-ens-id-and-privacy-management-e8fcd6723316">DAOrayaki</a>, nearly 70% of Sismo respondents indicated that they were unwilling to associate ENS with their private address because the account information was too easy to be&nbsp;queried.</p><p>But in general practice, the DID can be designed by the designer according to the needs. The usual design is for insensitive information to be stored on-chain, and sensitive information being verified through off-chain verification to generate VC and other forms for users to save in their own DID. This method better protects users’&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>3. Permission control</p><p>In the management of ENS, there are two&nbsp;roles:</p>  The registrant, who is the real owner of the domain name and can appoint an administrator or resell the domain&nbsp;name.  The administrator, who has only the authority to manage the domain name, such as the transfer of the administrator and the setting of the domain&nbsp;name.  <p>*If a new administrator is set, the registrant can no longer set the resolver and resolution record of the domain name. These operations must be performed by the administrator.</p><p>DID has a more refined write permission control. According to the description of the W3C DID document, a DID can have multiple verification methods. These verification methods have the rights to change the DID file, authenticate DID entities, and designate agents, including creation, verification, update, and deactivation. Therefore, in terms of access control, the management role of DID appears to be more refined and specific.</p> Application logic <p>The creation of ENS is based on Ethereum. As such, regardless of whether it is created or held, it is necessary to pay on-chain fees on Ethereum. According to the setting of ENS, holding an ENS domain name requires the payment of a rental fee. The fewer the number of words, the higher the rental fee. The annual rental fee for a domain name within three words is as high as $640&nbsp;USD.</p><p>At the same time, ENS is also an NFT, which means that ENS can be resold in NFT markets such as Opensea. These can meet the needs of users for unbinding and monetization.</p><p>For the creation of DID, the user can choose which blockchain to be based on, and it will also incur a certain fee. Moreover, once the DID is created and bound with the user’s identity, it cannot be transferred or destroyed. Therefore, users need to be careful when creating a DID, because DID grants data and identity independent management rights, but also gives users responsibility for their identity. As such, users need to improve their identity and data usage awareness and use their data more securely.</p> Summary <p>In summary, ENS has successfully demonstrated the utility of decentralized identity and helps to highlight the potential of DID. There are opportunities for collaboration and integration between the two, to provide a suite of identity solutions for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Decentralized identity remains an evolving landscape, and although ENS can also be used as a decentralized identity at the application level, it is still quite different from DID in terms of the underlying implementation logic and&nbsp;details.</p><p>Perhaps in the future, ENS will have more refined upgrades, such as KYC and other methods to achieve interaction with off-chain data, adding verifiable credentials to meet the needs of users, including privacy. But for now, it is perhaps better to view it as a complementary technology.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

It is a leap from Web 1.0, where businesses could only broadcast information to&nbsp;users.</p><p>Web 2.0 is also called a social web because social media platforms are one of the biggest drivers of the Internet today closely followed by e-commerce companies. If you look closer, at the heart of these companies’ operations is user&nbsp;data.</p><p>To elaborate, these Web 2.0 companies collect and analyze the data that belong to users, and use it effectively to market their products and services through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-disrupt-surveillance-capitalism-5c8cd6b50278">targeted advertising</a>!</p><p>On the face of it, all of these may seem fine because we are able to find the things we want easily, we get everything delivered at our doorstep, and life is convenient. But what about our most valuable asset — our data, and with it our identity?</p><p>Why is it that a company should store your personal information, analyze your browsing patterns, and make money out of something that defines you and makes you unique? Add to it, the possibility of hackers stealing your data and selling it on the dark&nbsp;web!</p><p>In all, your data is being used by everyone except you! And worse, they thrive off&nbsp;it!</p><p>If all this sounds unacceptable, you’re definitely a part of the revolution called Web 3.0 that is looking to fundamentally change the way your data is owned and&nbsp;used.</p> What is Web&nbsp;3.0? <p>In simple words, Web 3.0 is the next revolution in the world of the Internet and one that can put you in control of your data. It is a world of open and permissionless networks that protect your privacy and empower you to determine how your data is stored and&nbsp;used.</p><p>It is built on three important pillars: decentralized networks, edge computing where data resides in the hands of users rather than in a centralized repository, and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Now that you have an idea of web 3.0, let’s delve a bit into consent management and its current implementation.</p> What is Consent Management? <p>Consent management is a platform or process by which a user determines what must be shared with a business.</p><p>The last few years have seen a greater focus on consent management, thanks to growing awareness about privacy and the emergence of legislation like the&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>That said, the best way to enforce consent management in the current web 2.0 environment is through cookies. Unfortunately, it is a far cry from empowering users to control their data as it focuses more on implied consent buried in unwieldy terms and conditions.</p><p>Here’s a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02479">study</a> that shows how cookies don’t offer any meaningful choices for users and never put them in control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>When you put it all together, it’s clear that the existing consent management practices are not geared for Web 3.0. In fact, it requires a complete shift in mindset as the control has to move away from organizations and into the hands of&nbsp;users.</p><p>But is this even possible? What should a consent management system for Web 3.0 look&nbsp;like?</p><p>To get answers to these questions and more, <a href="https://build.affinidi.com/">download our whitepaper</a> titled, “Building a Consent Management System for Web&nbsp;3.0”</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/consent-management-in-web-3-0-29f9c46767cf">Consent Management in Web 3.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 NFT staking is now&nbsp;live! <p>To celebrate Ontology’s 4th anniversary, we have made 10,000 limited edition <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/cyberspace-4-philosophers-5ab849544879">Cyberspace 4 Philosophers</a> NFT’s available for minting which were all sold out. Not only do they look great, but they will also be used to establish a special NFT Ontology Node where NFT holders benefit from the staking&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>We are delighted to inform all NFT holders and our community members that the node is now all set, and ready for you to stake your NFTs to start earning rewards. NFT holders will also start receiving ONG staking rewards from the next consensus round.</p> Rules of NFT&nbsp;staking <p>Rewards will start generating at the beginning of the next Ontology consensus round (168). At the end of each consensus round, 90% ONG rewards for the node owner are distributed among NFTs that have been staked during this&nbsp;round.</p><p>The amount of ONG distributed as rewards to an NFT is calculated from (X*t)/T. Where X is the total ONG reward available in the consensus round. t is the length of time an NFT has been staked during the round. T is the total time of all the NFTs staked in the current&nbsp;round.</p><p>Therefore, it’s suggested that NFT holders start staking NFTs anytime before the end of the current consensus round.</p><p>Each Ontology consensus round contains 60,000 blocks. Ontology blocks, which contain data of transactions, are generated one by one at time intervals of 1–30 seconds. Therefore, the length of time of each consensus round varies from about 17 hours to about 21&nbsp;days.</p><p>View estimated end time of the current round (167): <a href="https://node.ont.io/stake">https://node.ont.io/stake</a></p> Other information of the&nbsp;node <p>The node’s own initial stake is 100,000 ONT, which is the total amount of ONT spent to mint&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>The node is available for other users to stake with and the maximum amount of other users’ stake is 1,000,000 ONT, which is 10 times the node’s own initial&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Total stake = node’s own initial stake + other users’&nbsp;stake</p><p>The fee sharing ratio of the node is 10%/95%, which is from the other users’ perspective. The first ratio refers to the sharing percentage of the ONG rewards from the node’s own initial stake, and the second ratio refers to the sharing percentage of the ONG rewards from the other users’&nbsp;stake.</p><p>The table below shows how the ONG rewards for the node owner vary according to the amount of other users’&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Under current circumstances, the amount of A, B, and C would be almost the same. Therefore, the higher the other users’ stake, the higher the rewards for the node owner. This also means higher rewards for NFT&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>In summary, for NFT&nbsp;owners:</p>  Welcome other users’&nbsp;stake  Don’t forget to stake&nbsp;NFTs   Guide  Stake NFT and Claim ONG&nbsp;Reward <p>Tap on the “Stake/Redeem” button at the bottom right of the homepage to open the “Stake/Redeem” page, then tap on the “Stake” button to stake NFT or the “Unstake” button to unstake&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>ONG rewards are distributed at the end of each consensus round.

  <p>As the holiday season gets into full swing, the Developer Advocacy team at Okta has sat down around our virtual table to chat about things we’re grateful for across our various technical communities.</p>


    
    
Deepu:
<br>
I’m so thankful for Linux accepting Rust as another language for the Kernel and I’m thankful for all the backing it is getting from big names. I’m sure this will lead to Linux becoming more secure as more and more code might be written in Rust.
<br>
I’m also grateful for great communities like <a href="https://foojay.io/">Foojay</a> and the awesome contributors of JHipster and Rust.


	  
	
Matt:
<br>
I’ve focused on tools in past holiday posts. This year, I’d like to focus on people. I’d like to focus on a couple folks who have really helped me move things along in JHipster and other projects:
<br>
- Marcelo Shima (@mshima on GitHub, no Twitter): for Micro Frontends, migrating Ionic and Quarkus to JHipster 7, and for being an awesome developer. He’s been cranking out code like mad and is now our #4 contributor! https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/graphs/contributors
<br>
- Vishal Mahajan (@vishal423 on GitHub and Twitter): for all his help with OAuth and OAuth-related issues with JHipster.
<br>
- Pascal Grimaud (@pascalgrimaud on GitHub and Twitter): for managing JHipster’s CI and release process. It’s a thankless job and he often does it on weekends, outside of work.
	


	  
	
Brian:
<br>
Like Matt, I’m feeling grateful right now for some individuals who really stand out in my communities. 
<br>
- Benjamin Marwell (@bmarwell on GitHub and Twitter): Awesome developer, he has been helping to push the latest updates to the @ApacheShiro project.
<br>
- The Apache Infra Team (@TheASF on Twitter), some of the unsung heroes of the open-source world. They are always helpful and quick to respond to questions, #HugOps
<br>
- The OktaDev Team. The Great Tech Exodus of 2021 shook up the team a bit, but everyone on the team, new and old, has been a joy to work with!
	


	  
	
Tanay: 
<br>
- The OktaDev team. Joining new teams can be stressful, but my last few weeks have been just amazing! I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for being so kind and helpful 🤗
<br>
- Shawn Wang (@swyx on Twitter): I have been enjoying his writings, and he has inspired me to delve into topics that I didn’t know I cared about as well as think things from a different perspective 👨‍🏫
<br>
- We would all have a tough time learning new things if it weren’t for all the documentation and support teams. Thank you for your hard work in making sure that everyone in the community succeeds 🙌 
	



	  
	
	
Alisa:
<br>
The JavaScript ecosystem is huge and constantly evolving - it’s almost impossible to keep up with changes and new frameworks. But luckily, we have a community of people who share their knowledge, help lower the barriers for each other, and advocate for safe learning environments. I appreciate the bravery and tenacity of code newbies and 100-days-of-coders who share their learning journey so freely, friendly spaces such as dev.to so we can learn from each other, and the voices of established developers who foster a welcoming culture to better the community. 
<br>
As an Angular developer, I also appreciate the contributors and maintainers for awesome OSS libraries that make up the Angular ecosystem. Their hard work power enterprise software systems, usually without any pay or recognition. I am thankful for their continued support of their libraries, inspired by their passion to contribute, and grateful for the time they spend on their projects. 
	



	  
	
edunham
<br>
I share Alisa’s appreciation for the OSS developers who make the DevOps ecosystem, and indeed most of the internet, possible. 
<br>
There’s another group of volunteers that I’d like to highlight this year, too: I’m thankful for all the conference organizers around the world who’ve had to make the hard choices about the best ways to keep their events and communities alive! I’ve seen them making hard choices to cancel and modify events this year, and it’s pretty thankless work right now to keep their communities going. But due to their dedication, I’m able to look forward to reuniting with old friends and making new ones at community events. 
	



<p>Happy holidays from the Okta team!</p>

<p>In 2020, Onfido held its first remote Hackathon event. We called it “The 2020 Effect,” and invited participants to help shape the impact 2020 would have on Onfido. No one on the committee had planned a remote Hackathon before then. Here are a few of the questions we encountered and how we approached them.</p> How do we help people organize&nbsp;teams? <p>Casual office interactions have traditionally been a huge driver for organizing teams before a Hackathon. 2020 was the first remote Hackathon for most of our participants, so we wanted to help foster team formation.</p><p>Our first attempt to resolve this issue was a major fail. I organized a Google Form and asked all Hackathon participants to fill it out. In the form, they indicated whether they wanted to form their own team or be placed onto a team. For those interested in being placed on a team, I also requested additional information about the type of team they wanted to be a part&nbsp;of.</p><p>Then, I played match-maker. I carefully reviewed the responses and hand organized teams based on their preferences. I created Slack channels for each team and invited members to&nbsp;join.</p><p>About half of the people who were originally interested in being placed on a team ended up either finding a team they wanted to join instead, or dropping out of the Hackathon. I reorganized the teams several times. It was painful for myself and nearly everyone involved.</p><p>We found a better way to address this question in 2021: a pre-Hackathon idea&nbsp;share.</p><p>This was the most casual 70-person zoom event I’ve ever hosted, and it was so much fun! After a short introduction about the Hackathon, we had two rounds of small-group interaction, where I organized people into Breakout rooms. Then, back in the big group, people had the opportunity to pitch their ideas to the whole group to attempt to gain teammates. I can proudly say that one of the winning teams was formed during this&nbsp;meeting.</p><p>This second approach of providing a pre-Hackathon event allowed participants to have more autonomy in choosing their groups, while still providing a space to interact and exchange&nbsp;ideas.</p> How do we encourage participation from all&nbsp;geos? <p>The UK-based engineering lead who organized the Hackathon committee in 2020 made sure to include representatives from various geos on the committee. As a US representative, I was able to promote the event with excitement and investment during US team meetings.</p><p>When planning the 2020 event, we also decided that we should allow cross-continental teams. It certainly offered some additional challenges to teams, but if people had interest, why stop them? Both years, we have had cross-continental teams win&nbsp;prizes.</p><p>To address the time difference for presentation events, we tried two different formats in 2020 and 2021, and I would say that they were about equally successful.</p><p>In 2020, we organized multiple presentation times, and allowed teams to select which one to present at. This way, US teams, or teams with US members could select the later&nbsp;time.</p><p>In 2021, we held one presentation event, which was in the morning in the US time, but allowed flexibility on which days teams did their Hacking that week. Overall, I would say I had a slight preference for this version, as it provided more flexibility for everyone.</p> How do we make it feel different from routine&nbsp;work? <p>It’s all about how you&nbsp;Slack.</p><p>In 2020, our internal communications director created an entirely new Slack Workspace. This allowed participants to be present in a completely distinct virtual environment than they usually would be. The downside of the new Slack Workspace was the additional friction it created to get participants added to&nbsp;it.</p><p>In 2021, we tried staying in our usual Slack Workspace, but with channels dedicated to the Hackathon with the prefix “hack”. We had #hack-home, #hack-idea-share, and #hack-banter. Admittedly, it didn’t have the same fresh feeling as the 2020 Hackathon Workspace.</p> What do we do about SWAG? Shall we mail everyone stickers? <p>We decided not to mail everyone stickers. After talking to a few individuals at Onfido, there were some expressed feelings that it wasn’t particularly carbon-conscious.</p><p>We decided to offer “digital swag”, and with help from our design team, we found several entertaining examples.</p><p>In 2020, we offered Hackathon-themed zoom backgrounds, Google presentation slides, Slack images, and Slack emoji responses. In 2021, we added a Hackathon trailer, which was presented at a company-wide meeting.</p><p>The digital swag was a fun way to express the company’s investment in the Hackathon. It was a priority to our e-team that people participate in the Hackathon, and themed digital swag helped communicate that.</p> What do we do about snacks and&nbsp;pizza? <p>We have not figured this one out yet. We have some events where we offer the opportunity for participants to expense snacks to the company… but it just doesn’t have the same feel as walking into a break room and finding a pizza&nbsp;box.</p><p>New Idea! Maybe next year, we create a #hack-snacks channel where people can post photos of their Hackathon snacks.</p> Is it possible to hold a successful cross-continental remote Hackathon? <p>Yes! Even with the match-making flub of 2020, both Hackathons yielded inspirational projects. Planning any Hackathon, including a cross-continental remote Hackathon, is about giving participants an opportunity to shine. As long as a few basic Hackathon needs are&nbsp;met:</p>  The ability to form&nbsp;teams  Time reserved to spend on&nbsp;projects  A way to submit or present&nbsp;projects  <p>Hackathons can be a great way to surface new and inspiring ideas.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/tips-for-planning-a-remote-hackathon-a3caae463ec0">Tips for planning a remote Hackathon</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Holochain is co-hosting the Web3 room again at FOSDEM 2022. I’d love to see up-and-coming Holochain-projects give talks there!</p><p>But first, some Holochain release notes.</p> Holochain 0.0.120: build info <p>Last week’s release saw a new flag for the Holochain conductor: <code>holochain --build-info</code> &nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1163">#1163</a>). This outputs a JSON blob of the context in which the conductor was built, including — most importantly — the HDK version it’s compatible with. This is important, because as I mentioned in last week’s Dev Pulse, HDK version numbers are now <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/thanks-for-hammering-holochain/#wait-where-s-hdk-0-0-119">decoupled</a> from conductor version numbers.</p> Holochain 0.0.121: macOS build issue fixed <p>This week’s release fixes a build issue on macOS involving OpenSSL (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1169">#1169</a>). If you use macOS and build your own conductor from source, this will probably be good news.</p> FOSDEM 2022: see you there! <p>Once again, the Holochain Foundation and Fluence Labs are co-hosting the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/web3_infrastructure/">Web3 room</a> at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/">FOSDEM 2022</a>, Europe’s largest open-source conference. And once again, thanks to a stupid virus, FOSDEM is being held online. The positive side is that everyone on the internet can attend!</p><p><a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/beyond_blockchain_distributed_web/">Last year</a> we saw excellent talks from a number of different and interesting projects — not just Holochain and Fluence, but many other sister projects in the DWeb space. <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a>, <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/">Beaker Browser</a>, and others were represented.</p><p>We’d love to see you present your project at FOSDEM! The call for talks closes soon — December 29th — so please <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22">submit your proposal</a> soon. (Talks should be recorded and submitted by January 16th.) If you want to get a feel for how long the talk should be, and what it can be about, <a href="https://github.com/lekanova/Web3-FOSDEM/blob/main/README.md">read this readme</a>.</p><p>If you’d like to attend FOSDEM, it happens on the 5th and 6th of February. Attendance costs nothing!</p> Holochain and hApp CI matrix <p><a href="https://github.com/harlantwood">Harlan Wood</a>, a long-time supporter of the project and more recently a very active hApp dev, produced a table of <a href="https://holochain-ci.github.io/matrix/">all the most active Holochain-related projects</a>, including hApps and the conductor itself. It shows the continuous integration (test and build) status for all these projects in one place.</p>A recent screenshot of the Holochain CI matrix.<p>Previously, it also showed the HDK versions the hApp projects were currently using. This was based on an older format for the Nix file, however. Since Harlan is no longer maintaining this project, he’d love for someone to add this feature back in. This is a pretty useful feature, because it will help power users find out whether a given hApp is compatible with the version of Launcher that they currently have. If you’re interested in taking over maintenance of this project, you can find the repo at <a href="https://github.com/holochain-ci/matrix">https://github.com/holochain-ci/matrix</a> and talk to Harlan there.</p> Reflections on the year <p>For the end-of-year meeting, the core devs were asked to reflect on the progress made during 2021. The positivity of their comments reflect the hugely improved state of our little project, compared with September 2020 before we <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/new-holochain-rsm-released-to-public/">unveiled</a> the rewritten Holochain. I also appreciate their deep insights into the nature of the project itself and the way it reflects the world as it exists and as we’d like to help it become.</p><blockquote>The SQLite transition has gone pretty well, we still have some optimization-level things to take care of, but [...] we've already realized a lot of benefits over the LMDB implementation. We're starting to get the performance we need out of our networking / P2P / gossip, and we need to keep working on that to really nail it for upcoming scales of testing. One thing we haven't yet done on that front is security hardening. We've started down that path with the lair key management [...]<br>— David B</blockquote><blockquote>I've been very impressed by our demonstrated strive for balancing individual wellbeing with the pursuit of our common goals, and that there is a habit of inviting everyone to exchange their experiences. I'm looking forward to continuing the path we are all on together; that is to realize, continuously refine and advocate for the new paradigms that we came together for.<br>— Stefan</blockquote><blockquote>At the start of the year it wasn't clear to anyone how to build happs on Holochain; I think now it is very clear to anyone paying attention. While we still have a long list of "todos" we also have two hApps operational on Holo (not just Holochain) and scaling steadily with each release. Both of these hApps represent 'impossible' ideas on blockchain that seem not just possible, but moving towards inevitable on Holochain. [...] By this time next year I hope to see more developers, communities and businesses look at holochain and see not just how to build 'a hApp' but how to build 'their hApp'.<br>— David M</blockquote><blockquote>We saw the great SQLite refactor, which [led to a lot of] opportunities for improvement. Tom really shone here, diagnosing and fixing these problems in a steady stream of PRs. [...] This was a huge step forward for networking too, with sharded gossip finally approaching viability. [...] David B built a really solid networking library almost single-handedly, and it's been relatively easy to jump in and contribute to it.<br>— Michael</blockquote><blockquote>I joined Holochain because I wanted to work for an ethical tech company that would be developing in Rust. I didn't know much about distributed systems; however, I have discovered the beauty and complexity in a system that runs spread throughout space and time. This reflects how humans work, distributed around the world, each with our own frame of reference, attempting to operate as a larger organism. [...] Another big highlight is actually seeing Elemental Chat running on a non-trivial sized network. I'm excited to be able to actually use Holochain for a hobby project and get some of my developer friends excited about it.<br>— Tom</blockquote> Milestones we’ve passed <p>It’s encouraging to see what the core dev team has accomplished since they started rewriting Holochain. Here are the highlights:</p>  A <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain">new conductor and core</a>, written from scratch, with a strong focus on maintaining data integrity and keeping resource consumption light  The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a> testing framework, the <a href="http://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/">JavaScript client SDK</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/">DeepKey</a> distributed key management hApp made compatible with the new conductor  A user-friendly <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/">launcher</a> for Windows, macOS, and Linux  A new <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding">scaffolding tool</a> for rapid application development  A new P2P networking <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/kitsune_p2p/kitsune_p2p">protocol and library</a>, with no necessary centralised components  A <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/kitsune_p2p/proxy">proxy service</a> for punching through firewalls  Two bootstrap services — one to be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/bootstrap">run on CloudFlare</a> and one to be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/kitsune_p2p/bootstrap">run on personal servers</a> — for introducing peers to each other  A bundle spec and file format for versatile, multi-DNA hApps that cover all sorts of scenarios  <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/prelude/countersigning/index.html">Countersigning</a> for coordinating safe, atomic state changes among multiple parties  The ability to <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-scheduler-in-your-zome">schedule</a> one-off or repeating tasks from within a DNA  A <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-%60post_commit%60-hook-in-your-zome">post-commit hook</a> for follow-up on a confirmed source chain write  A separate <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/">keystore service</a> with support for seeds and derivations  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/Writing-a-validation-hook-for-an-entry-type">Deterministic validation</a>, which guarantees that any validator anywhere will arrive at the same result for the same source chain element  <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/prelude/enum.ChainTopOrdering.html#variant.Relaxed">‘Relaxed’</a> source chain commits for situations that don’t require exact ordering for validity, which allows state-changing zome calls to be made in parallel  Atomic commits within a zome function — all commits succeed or fail as one  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#how-to-secure-functions-against-unauthorized-use">Capability-based security</a> for all zome calls  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/">Remote zome calls</a> and fire-and-forget DHT <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">signals</a>  Random <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#a-cloud-of-witnesses">agent activity authorities</a> on the DHT, who record source chain writes and detect forks; improved performance for reconstructing a source chain during validation  The dreaded ‘update/delete loop’ bugs are now impossible  A formal approach to DHT transformation operations, giving guarantees of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency#Strong_eventual_consistency">strong eventual consistency</a>  Validation receipts, which set the foundation for warrants and the DHT immune system  Massive performance improvements over both the previous iteration of Holochain and earlier versions of the new iteration  A broader set of testing tools, including Sweettest, a Rust-based testing framework that lets you mock components of the conductor   Happy holidays! <p>No matter where you are and what culture you live in, it’s likely that you’ll be enjoying some sort of holiday times in the next couple of weeks. I hope you all have a lovely, relaxing time — in spite of the challenges we’re all facing this year. Take care, and I’ll see you in the new year, where I’ll have some good news about Holochain development (including some rather dramatic performance improvements to gossip)! We’ll share a 2022 roadmap, which shows the order in which new features should become available, and promises stable beta versions for the networking protocol, the conductor, and the HDK.</p><p>And I’m sure 2022 will also be full of other kinds of news. The developer ecosystem is growing all the time, and existing hApp projects are maturing while new ones are appearing. In addition, the Holo hosting network will keep developing as Holochain nears beta.

<p>We live in a digital age in which technology is advancing at an exponential rate, our world is becoming digitized, and our personal information is linked to more and more apps, devices, and services. &nbsp;Our digital identities are increasingly prone to data breaches and misuse as our personal information is shared with every service provider we wish to engage with. &nbsp;Decentralized identity is an emerging concept becoming more popular for online consumers by eliminating the need to pass personal identifiable information (PII) to an ever-increasing number of companies. However, in practice, decentralized identity has only existed for a handful of years, and its potential is still being discovered. So how did we get here?<br></p><p>Conventional Centralized Identity<br></p><p>Online identity has evolved since the creation of the internet and taken many forms in its relatively short lifespan. &nbsp;Initially, we saw the rise in popularity of conventional siloed identity, in which a centralized authority (service provider, retailer, government agency, university, etc.) gathers and stores PII for every user account in its system. &nbsp;The problem here is that as we created more and more online accounts, each with their own usernames and passwords, more of our personal data was being dumped into these massive databases. &nbsp;<br></p><p>As these centralized identity models continued to increase, so too did the size of the target on the siloed databases. &nbsp;Hackers recognized that these stores of data were ripe for the picking and it became apparent that the more accounts you had spread across the web, the more likely it was for your personal identity information to be compromised in a data breach. &nbsp;Centralized identity is still one of the most common digital identity models in use today, which has unfortunately opened the door to a continuous onslaught of data breaches. &nbsp;Even today, data breaches are up 17% since 2020 and our email address, social security numbers, bank account information, and more, are all vulnerable to exposure.<br></p><p>In addition to being risky, keeping track of dozens of usernames and passwords made digital identity management incredibly inconvenient. &nbsp;Let’s face it, when it comes to the security of our digital identities, and the manner in which data is exchanged, efficiency and urgency are key. &nbsp;Wouldn’t it make sense to be able to reuse one identity account with multiple sites and services? &nbsp;Thus, a new identity solution was created: federated identity. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Federated Identity<br></p><p>Even if you’ve never heard of federated identity (FID), chances are you’ve encountered a federated identity solution before - anytime you’ve been asked to “Log in with Google.” This identity movement gave users the ability to reuse an account across multiple services and put a certain amount of control back in the hands of the user, especially with the rise of Facebook, Google, and other social media platforms. Beyond that, this approach helped usher in the paradigm shift from physical wallets to digital wallets, as our identities became increasingly linked to our mobile devices. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Apple Pay and Google Pay are two examples of this contact-less, mobile payment technology that placed identity credentials directly on a user’s device. &nbsp;Reducing the need to carry and use credit cards definitely added a level of security to the everyday transaction process, and was arguably more convenient, but it did not prove to be the best solution for protecting our digital identities. &nbsp;For one, it required users to place a tremendous amount of trust in the identity provider (Facebook and Google, for example, both of which have had major data breaches), taking control out of the hands of the users. &nbsp;Furthermore, reliance on a centralized service provider means acquiescing to the security and privacy policies implemented by that federation, which could be limited by device type or Terms of Service, for instance. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Decentralized Identity</p><p>The natural solution to the security and privacy issues associated with a centralized digital identity is a decentralized identity. This identity solution has taken off in recent years as personal privacy and cybersecurity becomes even more important. Real-world credentials such as email address, social media accounts, government-issued ID, bank account and more can now be attested to, verified, and stored tamper-proof on a user’s device, and potentially shared and reused at the discretion of the user.

<p>CoinPost: On December 1st, 2021, the NFT Magic team has launched the Frenchie NFT project “Frenchie Land” in the Ardor ecosystem. The limited NFTs drop campaign of 24 NFT art pieces aims to raise awareness about the Ardor platform through a funny challenge of quizzes during the holiday season while making fun of the excessive NFTs fever in the crypto market. By solving the daily task announced on Twitter by the SIGBRO account, the lucky user will receive the Frenchie NFT and bonus prizes will be also distributed among the community. The Ardor ecosystem boasts of several NFTs active projects, such as Mythical Beings, Triffic and the GPS Ecosystem, and Bridge Champ.</p>

<p>Governance Orchestrators</p>
<p>The orchestration required to bring together decentralized identity ecosystems is today’s biggest gap for Commercial SSI. By this I mean the Trust over IP Level 4 governance authorities that are required to make something commercially real.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A youth league soccer referee governs the various elements within a rulebook.</p>
<p>We have the approaches, the principles, the technologies and the standards down. There is also clear market demand for data ownership and privacy-preserving digital interactions. We’ve have also seen great enhancements on mobile devices for authentication methods such as biometrics and continuous authentication.</p>
<p>So the question is: how we make decentralized identity more of a reality in our day-to-day lives?</p>
<p>How can we create a place in which a bank, a gig economy company or a start-up can all simply plug-in and begin using verifiable credentials? </p>
<p>There is a glaring need for Commercial SSI Governance Authorities.</p>
<p>As we know, half of the battle in decentralized identity, especially in government regulated industries, is governance. We require governance entities to help in the formation of ecosystems, the setting of rules, the making of markets, the monetization strategies, the dispute strategies, etc. </p>
<p>More entities are required to manage the bits of a trust framework that are commercial decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Attarius Network and BOTLabs GmbH, initial developer of KILT Protocol, today announced that Attarius will incorporate principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI), by adopting DIDs and Verifiable Credentials using KILT Protocol. KILT will be integrated into the Attarius Network ecosystem products including the Attarius wallet which has already launched, and the NFT marketplace for in-game items that is launching soon.</p><p>Attarius Network is building an all-in-one NFT ecosystem for the gaming industry, with a core focus on developing blockchain gaming in the Middle East and Asia. Attarius Network and KILT are Substrate-based blockchains; KILT is an identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous, verifiable credentials.</p><p>When gamers are onboarded to the Attarius platform, they will be able to add their purchases, achievements and levels as credentials to their KILT identity. The user will then determine how and when to share these credentials, while keeping this data in their possession. As Attarius and KILT add new partners, users can verify and download their assets and skills acquired in these partner games and tournaments. KILT will also be used for tracking user performance across multiple game platforms and networks.</p><p>Users and players on the Attarius Network chain will be able to quickly form gaming guilds and DAOs that match each other in terms of level and skills, using KILT credentials to verify these parameters. This will dramatically accelerate the creation of guilds and DAOs focused on individual games and championships, or with a regional focus in the UAE, Vietnam, Singapore or Northern&nbsp;Europe.</p><p>Fundraising for gaming guilds and indie studios could also be accelerated by incorporating KILT credentials into the Attarius wallet and marketplace. Currently the wallet is designed to hold Attarius Network (ATRN) tokens, game tokens and NFTs of in-game items. In the future, the wallet will offer a decentralized onboarding process utilizing KILT and KYC providers, where users would share only the necessary elements of their identity, without creating centralized data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Quote from Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH:</p><p>“Attarius Network offers multiple use cases for KILT Protocol. Gaming communities and NFT marketplaces are at an inflection point that will be accelerated by blockchain applications. We’re excited to be part of this experimentation and innovation.”</p><p>Quote from Oleg Kotlyarov, CEO and Founder of Attarius&nbsp;Network:</p><p>“Attaruis Network is very pleased to work with BOTLabs GmbH because they make a great product in the SSI field in our opinion. We really want the onboarding of our users to be the fastest and easiest procedure for them, so that in an instant they can immediately start the game or upload assets to our marketplace or find like-minded people and create a game guild. We see an avalanche-like growth of interest and growth of players in blockchain games, and believe that our cooperation with BOTLabs and the use of KILT Protocol will help us accelerate this&nbsp;growth.”</p> About BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH <p>BOTLabs GmbH is a Berlin-based research and development company focusing on blockchain. It was founded in January 2018 by Ingo Rübe and German publishing house Burda GmbH, for whom he served as CTO from 2012 to 2017; Swiss publisher Ringier AG later joined as a shareholder. BOTLabs is the initial developer of KILT Protocol, now a decentralized blockchain network.

  <p>GraphQL’s popularity has grown among frontend and backend developers alike. It allows frontend teams to request only the data they need while preventing an explosion of backend endpoints, since all operations can go through one simple endpoint for all models being worked on.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a GraphQL API with Laravel, a free open-source PHP web application framework. You’ll then secure the API so that it’s only accessible to authorized users logging in with Okta.</p>

 Building the project 

<p>The recommended way to create a new Laravel project is to use Laravel Sail, a command-line interface designed for Laravel’s Docker environment. First, create a directory to hold both sets of code for this project—one set for the backend and one for the frontend. Make sure you have the latest versions of Docker and Docker Compose set up as well. If you need help, check <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/">Docker’s guide</a> as well as the documentation for <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</a>.</p>

<p>To bootstrap the Laravel project for this tutorial, you can get a script from <code>laravel.build</code>. It isn’t advisable to pipe scripts from the internet into Bash, so check the script first. If you navigate to <a href="https://laravel.build/graphql-demo?with=mysql">this demo code</a>, you will see the generated script. You can change “graphql-demo” to whatever you want to name the project. If it looks okay to you, paste it into your terminal or pipe it directly to Bash using <code>curl -s "https://laravel.build/graphql-demo?with=mysql" | bash</code>.</p>

<p>This will create a new directory, named whatever you used as the path parameter (graphql-demo, in this case), and will set up Laravel for you. Once the script is done downloading Docker Image for Sail, it will prompt you to run <code>cd graphql-demo &amp;&amp; ./vendor/bin/sail up</code>. Since you’ll be calling Sail repeatedly, make an alias for it. You can use <code>alias sail=./vendor/bin/sail</code>.</p>

<p>After running the <code>up</code> command, you’ll find Laravel running at <code>http://localhost</code>.</p>

 Laravel models 

<p>Next set up your Laravel models and migrations. For more interesting data to work with, create some interconnected models. This is similar to building an issue-tracking system. The system will have the following models:</p>

 
   user 
   issue 
   comment 
 

<p>If you’d like to copy the files from the public GitHub repository, the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-graphql-laravel-backend-example/tree/main/app/Models">models can be found here</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-graphql-laravel-backend-example/tree/main/database/migrations">migrations can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d prefer to make these models yourself, execute a command with Laravel’s Artisan CLI            tool. Because you’re using Sail, execute with <code>sail php artisan &lt;command&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Then run the following:</p>

   <code>sail php artisan make:model -m Issue
sail php artisan make:model -m Comment
</code>   

<p>The user model and migration already exist by default.</p>

 Laravel migrations 

<p>The above commands also created the necessary migrations thanks to the <code>-m</code> flag. Update them by following the steps outlined here.</p>

<p>User:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
// database/migrations/2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateUsersTable extends Migration
{
   /**
    * Run the migrations.
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function up()
   {
       Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
           $table-&gt;id();
           $table-&gt;string('name');
           $table-&gt;string('email')-&gt;unique();
           $table-&gt;timestamp('email_verified_at')-&gt;nullable();
           $table-&gt;string('password');
           $table-&gt;rememberToken();
           $table-&gt;timestamps();
       });
   }

   /**
    * Reverse the migrations.
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function down()
   {
       Schema::dropIfExists('users');
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Issue:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
// database/migrations/2021_11_14_031132_create_issues_table.php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateIssuesTable extends Migration
{
   /**
    * Run the migrations.
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function up()
   {
       Schema::create('issues', function (Blueprint $table) {
           $table-&gt;id('id');
           $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger('author_id');
           $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger('assignee_id');
           $table-&gt;string('title');
           $table-&gt;text('description');
           $table-&gt;timestamps();
       });
   }

   /**
    * Reverse the migrations.
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function down()
   {
       Schema::dropIfExists('issues');
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Comment:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
// database/migrations/2021_11_14_030557_create_comments_table.php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateCommentsTable extends Migration
{
   /**
    * Run the migrations.
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function up()
   {
       Schema::create('comments', function (Blueprint $table) {
           $table-&gt;id('id');
           $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger('issue_id');
           $table-&gt;string('content');
           $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger('author_id');
           $table-&gt;timestamps();
       });
   }

   /**
    * Reverse the migrations.
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function down()
   {
       Schema::dropIfExists('comments');
   }
}
</code>   

 Relationships 

<p>Next define some relationships on the models to tie everything together. Your models should look like the ones here.</p>

<p>User:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
// app/Models/User.php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
   use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable;

   /**
    * The attributes that are mass assignable.
    *
    * @var string[]
    */
   protected $fillable = [
       'name',
       'email',
       'password',
   ];

   /**
    * The attributes that should be hidden for serialization.
    *
    * @var array
    */
   protected $hidden = [
       'password',
       'remember_token',
   ];

   /**
    * The attributes that should be cast.
    *
    * @var array
    */
   protected $casts = [
       'email_verified_at' =&gt; 'datetime',
   ];

   public function issues(): HasMany {
       return $this-&gt;hasMany(Issue::class, 'author_id', 'id');
   }

   public function comments(): HasMany {
       return $this-&gt;hasMany(Comment::class);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Issue:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
// app/Models/Issue.php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;

class Issue extends Model
{
   use HasFactory;

   public function author(): BelongsTo {
           return $this-&gt;belongsTo(User::class, 'author_id');
   }

   public function assignee(): BelongsTo {
           return $this-&gt;belongsTo(User::class, 'assignee_id');
   }

   public function comments(): HasMany {
           return $this-&gt;hasMany(Comment::class);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Comment:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
// app/Models/Comment.php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;

class Comment extends Model
{
   use HasFactory;

   public function issue(): BelongsTo {
           return $this-&gt;belongsTo(Issue::class);
   }

   public function author(): BelongsTo {
           return $this-&gt;belongsTo(User::class, 'author_id');
   }
}
</code>   

 Factories and seeders 

<p>Add seeders and factories so you have some data to work with. This allows you to generate as many instances of your models as you like, as well as the pre-populated relationships you just defined. Run the following:</p>

   <code>sail php artisan make:seeder SimpleSeeder
sail php artisan make:factory IssueFactory
sail php artisan make:factory CommentFactory
</code>   

<p>Each of these classes will need tweaking to ensure they are generating the correct data. Modify them as shown below:</p>

<p><code>database/factories/IssueFactory.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace Database\Factories;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\Factory;

class IssueFactory extends Factory
{
   /**
    * Define the model's default state.
    *
    * @return array
    */
   public function definition()
   {
       return [
           'title' =&gt; $this-&gt;faker-&gt;sentence,
           'description' =&gt; $this-&gt;faker-&gt;sentence,
       ];
   }
}
</code>   

<p><code>database/factories/CommentFactory.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace Database\Factories;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\Factory;

class CommentFactory extends Factory
{
   /**
    * Define the model's default state.
    *
    * @return array
    */
   public function definition()
   {
       return [
           'content' =&gt; $this-&gt;faker-&gt;sentence
       ];
   }
}
</code>   

<p><code>database/seeders/SimpleSeeder.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use App\Models\Comment;
use App\Models\Issue;
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;

class SimpleSeeder extends Seeder
{
   /**
    * Run the database seeds.
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function run()
   {
       User::factory()
           -&gt;has(
               Issue::factory()
                   -&gt;for(User::factory(), 'assignee')
                   -&gt;has(
                       Comment::factory()
                           -&gt;for(User::factory(), 'author')
                           -&gt;count(3)
                   )
                   -&gt;count(5)
           )
           -&gt;count(10)
           -&gt;create();
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Once you have updated those classes, update <code>DatabaseSeeder.php</code> to call the new <code>SimpleSeeder</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
// database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
   /**
    * Seed the application's database.
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function run()
   {
       $this-&gt;call(SimpleSeeder::class);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>To make sure that everything is working as expected, run the migrations and seeders you just created. This will populate your database with records that can be used by the GraphQL API. Execute the following command:</p>

   <code>sail php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
</code>   

<p>Next you’ll install the GraphQL server.</p>

 Installing Lighthouse 

<p>There are a few different packages for GraphQL with Laravel. This tutorial will focus on <a href="https://lighthouse-php.com/">Lighthouse</a> since it has minimal boilerplate and allows you to get going quickly with GraphQL. As with the <code>php artisan</code> commands above, add the <code>sail</code> prefix if you want to install composer dependencies with Sail.</p>

<p>Install the GraphQL dependencies:</p>

   <code>sail composer require nuwave/lighthouse mll-lab/laravel-graphql-playground
</code>   

<p>Lighthouse will create the server for you, while the Playground allows you to test your schema without an external tool.</p>

<p>Once both dependencies are installed, run the following commands to publish the schema and config file from Lighthouse:</p>

   <code>sail php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lighthouse-schema
sail php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lighthouse-config
</code>   

<p>Add the GraphQL API route to the CORS config file. Navigate to <code>config/cors.php</code> and update the <code>paths</code> array to include <code>'graphql'</code>, like this:</p>

   <code>'paths' =&gt; ['api/*', 'sanctum/csrf-cookie', 'graphql'],
</code>   

<p>Finally, update the Lighthouse schema at <code>graphql/schema.graphql</code>. Change the contents to the following:</p>

   <code>type Query {
   users: [User!]! @all
   user(id: Int! @eq): User @find

   issues: [Issue!]! @all
   issue(id: Int! @eq): Issue @find
}

type User {
   id: ID!
   name: String!
   issues: [Issue!]! @hasMany
}

type Issue {
   id: ID!
   title: String!
   description: String!
   author: User! @belongsTo
   assignee: User! @belongsTo
   comments: [Comment!]! @hasMany
}

type Comment {
   id: ID!
   content: String!
   issue: Issue! @belongsTo
   author: User! @belongsTo
}
</code>   

<p>This file describes which types are accessible via GraphQL and which attributes they expose, as well as the relationships they can follow.</p>

 Demoing without auth 

<p>Navigate to the playground site at <code>http://localhost/graphql-playground</code>. The interface will allow you to try out GraphQL with the backend you just made. Enter the following query on the left and click the Play button:</p>

   <code>query GetIssues {
  issues {
    id
    title
    description
    author {
      name
    }
    assignee {
      name
    }
    comments {
      id
      content
      author {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>You should see your seeded data on the right, in the shape you specified in your query.</p>

<p>Next you’ll add authentication to your GraphQL API and allow users to log in via Okta.</p>

 Adding authentication 

<p>To add auth to your API, you’ll need to do some configuration. Go to <a href="https://developer.okta.com">the Okta Developer Portal</a> and sign up for a developer account so you can create an application for your frontend. To do this, navigate to Applications &gt; Application in the sidebar and select Create App Integration. Select OIDC as your sign-in method and set your application type as “Single-Page Application.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the next page, give your app integration a name like “Laravel GraphQL Demo,” keep the grant type as “Authorization Code,” and change the sign-in redirect and sign-out redirect URIs to port 3000 instead of 8080. For “Controlled Access,” select allow everyone in my organization to access since access levels aren’t important for this tutorial.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll be given your client ID—make sure to note it. You’ll be able to see your Okta domain, which you should note as well. Before you leave the Okta site, navigate to Security &gt; API to see your issuer URI. Note this and go to the Trusted Origins tab. Click Add Origin, set the origin URL as <code>http://localhost:3000</code>, select the CORS and Redirect checkboxes, and click Save. This will avoid problems with the frontend.</p>

<p></p>

 Installing packages 

<p>Go back to your terminal and run <code>sail composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt</code>. This will install the packages needed to verify the Okta access tokens. Then run <code>sail php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwt</code> to create a new class for your middleware. Open it and set its contents as follows:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;

class VerifyJwt
{
   /**
    * Handle an incoming request.
    *
    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
    * @param  \Closure  $next
    * @return mixed
    */
   public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
   {
       $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
           -&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
           -&gt;setAudience('api://default')
           -&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
           -&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
           -&gt;build();

       try {
           $jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());
           return $next($request);
       } catch (\Exception $exception) {
           Log::error($exception);
       }

       return response('Unauthorized', 401);

   }
}
</code>   

<p>Once this is attached to Lighthouse’s middleware config, it will allow you to protect your GraphQL API from requests that don’t have valid tokens. The client ID and issuer are coming from environment variables, which need to be set in your .env file. Open that file and append the following:</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID=&lt;the client ID you noted earlier&gt;
OKTA_ISSUER_URI=&lt; the issuer URI you noted earlier&gt;
</code>   

<p>Open <code>config/lighthouse.php</code> and update the ‘middleware’ array to add the middleware to Lighthouse:</p>

   <code>...
'middleware' =&gt; [
   // Verify BearerToken from Okta
   \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyJwt::class,

   \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Support\Http\Middleware\AcceptJson::class,

   // Logs in a user if they are authenticated. In contrast to Laravel's 'auth'
   // middleware, this delegates auth and permission checks to the field level.
   \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Support\Http\Middleware\AttemptAuthentication::class,

   // Logs every incoming GraphQL query.
   // \Nuwave\Lighthouse\Support\Http\Middleware\LogGraphQLQueries::class,
],
...
</code>   

<p>You could instead add the JWT verification to the API route guard, but the above method is fine for this tutorial. The <code>graphql-playground</code> shouldn’t be able to reach your API because it doesn’t have a token. To get a token, you’ll configure a simple frontend application to log you into Okta, then use that token to call your API.</p>

<p>If you just want to make sure your API is working, you can clone the frontend from the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-graphql-laravel-frontend-example">public GitHub repo</a>. You’ll need to insert your client ID and issuer URL in the <code>App.js</code> file, but it should work out-of-the-box. To build the frontend, read on.</p>

 Building the frontend 

<p>Since this is for testing purposes, you’ll build a simple frontend with React, the official Okta React library, and Apollo Client.</p>

<p>If you don’t have Node.js and npm, you can get up and running with <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">nvm - node version manager</a>.</p>

<p>From the parent directory (that contains your Laravel project directory), run <code>npx create-react-app graphql-demo-frontend</code>.</p>

<p>This will create a minimal React application for you to build your frontend. To install dependencies, run <code>npm install @apollo/client graphql @okta/okta-react @okta/okta-auth-js react-router-dom@^5.1.6</code>.</p>

<p>The React app will have files in the <code>src/</code> directory, but most of them aren’t needed. Delete them all and create the following files instead.</p>

 index.js 

<p>The <code>index.js</code> file mounts your React application onto its root DOM node, but it also handles the creation of Apollo Client, and fetches the Okta JWT from local storage.</p>

<p>Note: Using local storage is fine for this tutorial, but don’t take this approach in production, because changes to the underlying libraries and how they store the token might break it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider, from, createHttpLink } from '@apollo/client';
import { setContext } from '@apollo/client/link/context';

const oktaTokenStorage = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('okta-token-storage'));
const accessToken = oktaTokenStorage?.accessToken?.accessToken;

const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: 'http://localhost/graphql',
});

// inject the access token into the Apollo Client
const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) =&gt; {
  const token = accessToken;
  return {
        headers: {
          ...headers,
          authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : "",
        }
  }
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: from([authLink, httpLink])
});

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
        &lt;ApolloProvider client={client}&gt;
          &lt;App /&gt;
        &lt;/ApolloProvider&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
</code>   

 App.js 

<p>This file houses the main body of the application and sets up the Okta client. Use your issuer URI and client ID here:</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { SecureRoute, Security, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import IssueTracker from './IssueTracker';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: &lt;your issuer URI&gt;, // issuer URL
  clientId: &lt;your client ID&gt;, // client id for SPA app
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
});

const App = () =&gt; {
  const history = useHistory();
  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
      history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
  };

  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home} /&gt;
      &lt;SecureRoute path='/issue-tracker' component={IssueTracker} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/login/callback' component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
};

const AppWithRouterAccess = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Router&gt;
        &lt;App /&gt;
  &lt;/Router&gt;
);

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

 Home.js 

<p>This component acts like a dashboard, prompting the user to log in via Okta if they’re not authenticated, and giving them the link to the issue tracker if they are:</p>

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

const Home = () =&gt; {
    const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

    const login = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
    const logout = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signOut('/');

    if (!authState) {
        return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
    }

    if (!authState.isAuthenticated) {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Not Logged in yet&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;button onClick={login}&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }

    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Logged in!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;a href="/issue-tracker"&gt;go to Issue Tracker&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;button onClick={logout}&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
};

export default Home;
</code>   

 IssueTracker.js 

<p>This component uses the query you tried earlier in the graphql-playground to fetch data in its desired shape. Because the access token is injected into Apollo Client, the frontend is able to query the backend despite the middleware you put in place. When the data returns, the component renders it as a list.</p>

   <code>import * as React from 'react';

import { useQuery, gql } from "@apollo/client";

const ISSUES = gql`
query GetIssues {
  issues {
    id,
    title,
    description,
    author {
      name
    },
    assignee {
      name
    },
    comments {
      id,
      content,
      author {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
`

export default function IssueTracker() {

    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(ISSUES);
    
    console.log({ loading, error, data })
    
    if (loading) {
        return &lt;div&gt;loading...&lt;/div&gt;
    }
    
    if (error) {
        return &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;error.message&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    }
    
    return &lt;ul&gt;
        {data.issues.map((issue) =&gt; {
            return &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;title: {issue.title}&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;description: {issue.description}&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;author: {issue.author.name}&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;assignee: {issue.assignee.name}&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        })}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
};
</code>   

 Running the frontend 

<p>With these components in place, run <code>npm run start</code> and the frontend will launch at <code>localhost:3000</code>. Navigate there, and when you click Log In you’ll see the Okta login screen. Log in using your Okta Developer account credentials and you’ll be redirected to the Home component. You should see a link to take you to the “issue tracker.” Clicking this link will show you the page populated by data from your GraphQL API.</p>

 Go deeper with Okta 

<p>You should now have a Laravel GraphQL API secured by Okta which, as you’ve seen, is easy to integrate with your projects and can provide secure, extensible authentication to your applications with minimal configuration.</p>

<p>Laravel, React, and GraphQL are not all that Okta can offer you, however. Check out the huge list of <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/">supported integrations</a>, and you’ll be sure to find something that suits your needs.</p>

 GiD Report#191 — What is the metaverse? <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-the-age-of-daos-ffcb708c5f9">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The metaverse is already&nbsp;here  What people are&nbsp;saying  Tweet of the&nbsp;week  The 6 web3 use cases people care about the most (small&nbsp;survey)  Stuff happens   1. The metaverse is already&nbsp;here <p>There’s a lot of buzzwords these days. Blockchain, NFT, DeFi, web3. But the metaverse, thanks to Facebook, is not only the buzziest but also the fuzziest of them&nbsp;all.</p>Image: Mojang<p>In a lot of ways, the metaverse has existed for some time. Games like Second Life, Eve Online, and World of Warcraft have been around for decades. More recently, kids (and adults) have been spending more and more time in the worlds of Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite.</p><p>Premier eSports title Counter-Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) is fully funded through in-game transaction fees from the trading of in-game items on the Steam marketplace, netting game developer Valve billions of dollars each year. (You can <a href="https://media.steampowered.com/apps/valve/2014/gdc_2014_grimes_csgo_econ_content.pdf">check out Valve’s original slide deck for how they came up with in-game skins&nbsp;here</a>.)</p><p>You could say that all of that is already the metaverse. People living, playing, and working (yes, working) in a fully digital world with rich communities, cultural norms, and its own built-in economics.</p><p>The one thing you could argue is that all of this up to now has been built under the guise of&nbsp;web2.</p><p>For instance, the only difference from those CSGO skins versus what we know as NFTs today are the fact that they’re centrally managed (by Valve through Steam) rather than through a decentralized blockchain.</p><p>What happens then with the arrival of web3? What happens when items and inventories are interoperable? What happens when we have self-sovereign identity? What happens when characters can seamlessly move from one world to&nbsp;another?</p><p>What happens when that NFT you bought as a collectible is now a character or item you can use in a&nbsp;game?</p><p>What happens when the metaverse is more than just a&nbsp;game?</p><p>I’m not sure we have a clear sense as to what those answers are just yet. But what has gotten people excited is that they’re starting to see the building blocks — NFTs, DeFi, identity — and the possibilities for building a more open and interconnected digital universe.</p><p>We’ve seen the rise of Axie Infinity. (Here’s a fascinating tweetstorm on <a href="https://twitter.com/larsiusprime/status/1459191090100244483?s=21">how the in-game economics are working out</a>.) We’re seeing <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/metaverse-real-estate-piles-up-record-sales-in-sandbox-and-other-virtual-realms-11638268380">record land sales in metaverse games</a> such as The Sandbox and Dcentraland — just as big numbers were thrown around during the early dotcom domain land grab days.

What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Axios:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: Nike <a href="https://news.nike.com/news/nike-acquires-rtfkt">just</a> acquired RTFKT, a developer of digital goods, including virtual sneakers and NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Meanwhile, <a href="https://metaversemeals.io/">Applebee’s</a> is launching a new NFT every Monday this month, following White Castle’s <a href="https://decrypt.co/87991/white-castle-goes-crypto-scoops-ethereum-name-seahams-nft">move</a> into&nbsp;crypto.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>What they’re saying: Companies are speeding to the finish line because “there’s the first-mover advantage for the buzz&nbsp;… signaling to a very valuable audience that you’re a brand that gets it,” says Robert Davis, head of innovation at&nbsp;Ogilvy.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>What to watch: Adoption is still low. Less than 20% of the U.S. population will have used virtual reality at least once per month this year, according to eMarketer.</blockquote><p>Goldman Sachs <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/17/goldman-sachs-says-blockchain-is-key-to-metaverse-and-web-3-development/">via Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>Blockchain technology is central to the development of the metaverse and Web 3, Goldman Sachs said in a research&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>It is the only technology that can “uniquely identify any virtual object independent of a central authority,” and this ability to identify and track ownership will be crucial to the functioning of the metaverse, analysts led by Rod Hall wrote in a note published on Dec.&nbsp;14.</blockquote><blockquote>For Web 3, blockchain allows for the “partial elimination of centralized control,” the note says. In the future, users will be able to log in without the need for a third party, such as Meta, Google or Apple, the note&nbsp;adds.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>The Wall Street bank sees blockchain as the one of the most disruptive technology trends to appear since TCP/IP and HTML “ushered in the internet in the&nbsp;1990s.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Investment implications are hard to predict at this juncture, but companies who are dependent on centralized control of user identity will likely find their business models challenged by the adoption of blockchain,” the report&nbsp;added.</blockquote><p>Jeffries <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/metaverse-investing-virtual-world-land-sales-jefferies-facebook-meta-sandbox-2021-12">via Business&nbsp;Insider</a>:</p><blockquote>“The way to think about it is [that] all human activity that hasn’t moved online is about to move online in the next five to 10 years,” he said. “We can only imagine what it can&nbsp;be.”</blockquote><blockquote>Powell was speaking to CNBC’s “Worldwide Exchange” on Friday, after Jefferies released a research note saying the metaverse will be the biggest disruption to how people live ever&nbsp;seen.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>“What did you want to own from 1989 to 2000? You wanted to own the Ciscos of the world.

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_xG2un5WaI">Trust Registries Webinar</a> (Sept. 2021) 
 Darrell and Drummond discussed what we got wrong (and right) in The Wallet Report, some key points:
 
 Single use wallet apps took off because they solve a single business problem. While Darrell notes that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGdQWuZC-oY&amp;feature=youtu.be">DIDComm</a> is slow to take off, Drummond doubles down and says they’ll be the killer of what we now know as SSI and that next year they’ll be doing the DIDComm update! 
 Darrell’s forecast for Cloud/Custodial Wallets was wrong, he notes that the demand is there but security remains a problem and SSI principles are compromised, but solutions are beginning to form. They discuss portability and how it remains a current problem. 
 We discussed how Standards and Interoperability are still in the very early stages and remain elusive. He also touches on stacks and how governments and industry around the world are starting to pick this technology. Check out Ian Bremmer’s Article: <a href="https://www.ge.com/news/reports/ian-bremmer-3-risks-poised-to-disrupt-a-fast-changing-world-by-2021">3 Risks Poised to Disrupt a Fast-Changing World by 2021</a> 
 Darrell touches on the Trust Registries section of the Wallet Report and its public and private version. He talks about how the trust triangle isn’t enough. How does the verifier know that the issuer is authoritative? Is the Public DID anchored to a real institution? Does the holder trust the verifier? 
 
 
 
 QUESTIONS!? 
<p>Our Question Period started at about <a href="https://youtu.be/fMstQmIwsbM?t=3022">50:23</a> – though some questions did come in earlier and were touched on through the presentation. We had so many questions an couldn’t answer them all, here is a run down of what we covered:</p>
 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/fMstQmIwsbM?t=3030">How do you allow for an appointed governance authority to manage things? </a> 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/fMstQmIwsbM?t=3129">How can one attest the cryptographic health of a remote wallet? </a> 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/fMstQmIwsbM?t=3439">How do you reconcile centralized governance authority in a decentralized world? </a> 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/fMstQmIwsbM?t=3705">What do you think about the European Commission’s proposal for revision regarding eIDAS</a>

<p>On November 10, 2021, KILT became a decentralized blockchain network. This means that decisions on running the network are now made by you, the community of KILT Coin holders, using a sophisticated system of governance similar to that of Kusama and Polkadot. Here we give an introduction to how it&nbsp;works.</p> Overview <p>In brief, governance on KILT involves everyone who owns KILT Coins, a Council, and a Technical Committee. The Council is elected from members of the community (KILT Coin holders). Council tasks include proposing referenda, vetoing dangerous and malicious referenda, voting on Treasury proposals, and electing the Technical Committee. The Technical Committee exists to fast-track any critical upgrades needed, and consists of developers with experience developing and maintaining KILT Protocol.</p><p>Any KILT Coin holder can submit a proposal, which then goes through a formal, transparent online procedure that usually ends in a referendum that goes to community vote. You can also vote on existing proposals and referenda. Of note, coins that are locked for staking can also be used to&nbsp;vote.</p><p>As in Kusama and Polkadot, when a referendum on KILT is successful, the upgrade will be automatically enacted by the blockchain, following the enactment period of one day on&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>Thanks to the design of the Polkadot ecosystem, upgrades do not require a “fork” in the blockchain, as often found in older blockchain networks like Bitcoin. KILT upgrades can simply be carried out by changing the code on-chain, also known as a runtime&nbsp;upgrade.</p> Treasury <p>KILT has a Treasury, a store of on-chain funds that can be used for supporting and maintaining the network. As outlined in the updated<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19_KILT_Token_Metrics_Revised_Version.pdf"> KILT Coin Metrics</a> document, this Treasury will receive around two million newly-minted KILT Coins per year for the first five years. After this time, it will always receive an amount equivalent to around 10% of the maximum collator rewards as newly-minted coins. Bonded funds from rejected proposals and referenda also go to the Treasury.</p><p>In addition to providing potential funding for a parachain if governance decides to move to Polkadot in the future, Treasury funds are available for infrastructure or initiatives that benefit the network. Anyone can make a proposal for Treasury&nbsp;funding.</p><p>Information on Treasury proposals on KILT can be found on the <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/post/1">Polkassembly</a> platform and proposals can be viewed on Polkadot-JS under the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.kilt.io%2F#/treasury">Governance →Treasury tab</a>.</p> Proposals <p>Proposals can be simple proposals, such as the transfer of funds in the case of a Treasury grant, or more complex proposals such as a complete upgrade of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Treasury proposals for grants on KILT are approved or disapproved by the Council with a super majority (60% of&nbsp;votes).</p><p>Proposals from the community of KILT Coin holders will generally be made after discussion with others. This can be done via community channels such as the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kilt-direction:matrix.org">KILT Direction</a> channel on Element, or on Telegram and Discord. In this way, the proposer can get feedback and see if their idea is something that would be supported. Although any KILT Coin holder can make a proposal, there are several systems in place to deter anyone from making a malicious proposal and then leaving the&nbsp;network.</p><p>When submitting the proposal, the proposer must bond a minimum of 1 KILT for a general proposal, and 5% of the amount requested for a Treasury proposal.</p><p>Once the proposal is made it needs to be seconded by others in the community. This involves bonding KILT Coins: the amount is set by the proposer (minimum 1 KILT). One account holder can second the same proposal multiple times, with coins bonded each time. The most seconded proposal automatically becomes the next referendum unless the slot is needed for a motion by the Council. Of note, coins are reserved for the lifetime of the proposal, so if there are multiple proposals, this would lead to an extension of the bonding&nbsp;time.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances if a proposal or referendum is considered uncontroversially malicious or dangerous for the network, it can be cancelled by the Technical Committee or Council. In this case, the proposer and all who seconded the proposal lose their bond, which goes to the KILT Treasury.</p><p>Once a proposal moves to referendum the community has seven days to vote on it. If successful, the result is automatically enacted after one day, and those who seconded the proposal receive their bond back. If the referendum is not accepted, the proposer loses their&nbsp;deposit.</p> Voting in Referenda <p>Like Polkadot and Kusama, KILT has conviction voting. This means if you feel very strongly about a proposal, you can lock up coins for longer periods to increase your voting power up to a maximum factor of 6. The longer you lock your coins, the stronger your vote will be weighted.</p><p>The times range from no lockup to a period of around 224 days, with the lockup time beginning after the voting period ends. Coins used for voting will always be locked until the end of the voting period, no matter what conviction you vote with. Of note: the lock time is based on the standard block time of 12 seconds per block and hence may vary due to differences in the real block&nbsp;time.</p><p>If you choose not to lock any coins, your vote only counts as 10% of the coins that you commit to the voting (vote value), while the maximum lock up of around 224 days means you can make your vote count for 600% of the vote value. You can choose to lock all or some of your coins for any range between 0.1x and 6x, with a lockup time as outlined&nbsp;above.</p><p>As an example, you have a wallet with 1,001 KILT Coins. This could include staked or vested&nbsp;coins.</p><p>Example 1 — minimum</p>  You want to vote but don’t want to lock any&nbsp;coins.  You enter 1,000 into the “vote&nbsp;value”  You choose “0.1 x voting balance, no lockup&nbsp;period”  This gives you a voting power of 100 KILT&nbsp;Coins  Note that all your 1,000 coins are locked for the time of the voting period (7&nbsp;days)  Note that in this example you have 1 KILT left to pay the fees. Currently the transaction fee on KILT is around 0.017&nbsp;KILT.  <p>Example 2 — maximum</p>  You strongly believe in the referendum and want to vote with your full balance and maximum conviction  You also enter 1,000 into the “vote value” and leave one KILT to cover the&nbsp;fees  Choose “6 x voting balance, locked for 32x vote locking period (224.00&nbsp;days)”  This will give you a voting power of 6,000 KILT Coins, if you use your full amount, or 6 times the voting power of the amount you chose. The chosen amount will be locked for a period of around 224 days after the voting period ends (7&nbsp;days).  <p>While coins locked for staking can be simultaneously used for voting, the transaction fee needs to be from a usable, unlocked&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Conviction voting allows users with a small amount of coins to increase their voting power, and deters a token holder from creating and voting on a malicious proposal and then leaving the&nbsp;network.</p><p>If the referendum is successful, your voting coins will remain locked for the time specified (which means that you will be unable to transfer them, but they will still be usable for staking during that time). If unsuccessful, your coins will be unlocked after the referendum has finished.</p><p>KILT also uses an algorithm to adapt the amount of “aye” (yes/agree) votes needed to pass depending on voter turnout: the greater the number of voters, the lower the threshold required to pass. Therefore, when voter turnout is low a supermajority is generally required; with a high turnout a simple majority is sufficient.</p><p>Of note, BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developers of KILT Protocol, currently own around one third of the existing KILT coins as outlined in KILT’s <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19_KILT_Token_Metrics_Revised_Version.pdf">updated tokenomics</a>. To ensure democracy and decentralization, BOTLabs will abstain from voting on all proposals and referenda. The only exception to this would be a critical situation where a malicious proposal threatens the technical security of the network. Due to features built into the governance mechanism, such as the need to lock coins to create a proposal, this is unlikely to happen. The percentage of coins owned by BOTLabs is designed to decrease over time, due to inflation in the&nbsp;network.</p> Active Engagement <p>Before voting on any proposal or referendum, you are advised to read more about it and join the discussion in <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/post/1">Polkassembly</a> (under the “On-chain” section). Polkassembly is an open source platform for providing information, context, and a discussion forum for proposals and referenda in the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Tech savvy KILT community members may check the changes to the runtime that are being voted on. This can be done by going to the KILT GitHub page where the open-source code of KILT Spiritnet is hosted, and <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/mashnet-node/compare/1.1.1...1.2.0">comparing the changes</a> in the raw code. Afterwards, you could potentially <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/srtool">build the WASM runtime yourself from the source code using the SR-Tool</a> that prints out the hash of the WASM blob. If this is the same as the codeHash on Polkassembly and the corresponding extrinsic on the KILT blockchain, you could verify that the authorized changes are in line with the description of the referendum. The following screenshots show the codeHash on Polkadot.js and the log of the WASM&nbsp;build.</p> Democracy in&nbsp;Action <p>KILT Protocol has been designed to enhance privacy on the internet for decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Governance is key to KILT, allowing it to run as a decentralized blockchain with the facility to evolve and be self-sustainable. All KILT Coin holders are encouraged to actively participate in this process. See <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/how-to-vote-on-a-kilt-referendum-2a9e167a24f0">here</a> for a step-by-step guide to voting on KILT. Still have questions?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Mike Small</a></p><p>Over the past few weeks since this vulnerability was made public much has been written by many on what your organization should do about it.&nbsp; This is not the end of the story; Apache has already released 3 patches for related vulnerabilities, and you need to be ready for the next one when it arrives. With the beginning of 2022 now is the time to step back and review how well your organization met the challenges that this posed.&nbsp; What will your new year’s resolutions be? In this blog, I will outline some of the questions that you should ask yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How well did your cyber incident plan work?&nbsp;</p>
<p>New vulnerabilities are discovered all the time – you need to be prepared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Were you able to assemble the incident response team in good time?&nbsp; 
 How did you decide on the business risk that this posed?&nbsp; 
 What was the business objective of your response and was it achieved?&nbsp; 
 
<p>Could you identify systems at risk?&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can only protect what you know you have: do you have a complete inventory of your IT assets?&nbsp;</p>
 
 How easily were you able to identify the applications, systems and devices that could have this vulnerability?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Did your software vendors inform you of the status of their components and provide recommendations?&nbsp; 
 Did your vulnerability scanning program identify the systems at risk in a timely manner?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 How easily were you able to identify the business criticality of the applications, systems, and devices affected to make an informed decision on the next actions to take?&nbsp; 
 What action did you take for vulnerable components (remove, block, suspend, patch, or ignore), and how well were these actions implemented?&nbsp; 
 Did you involve any partners and if so, how well did they perform?&nbsp; 
 
<p>How well did your SOC perform?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your SOC should be able to detect threats – how well did it perform?&nbsp;</p>
 
 How well did your SOC perform – did you detect any active threats or exploits of this vulnerability?&nbsp; 
 Was your SOC able to monitor for evidence of traffic indicating the existence of the CVE?&nbsp; 
 Did you actively hunt for evidence that this CVE existed and was being exploited?&nbsp; 
 Did your SOC discover any at-risk applications, systems, and devices that were not otherwise known?&nbsp; 
 How well were you able to contain, recover, and restore impacted services?&nbsp; 
 
<p>Do you need to Review your Policies?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most organizations are using third-party components – what are your policies around the risk associated with these?&nbsp; These include the use of Open-Source software, the use of common libraries as well as bespoke software developed just for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you need a software dependency catalogue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a catalogue of software dependencies helps to quickly identify which systems are at risk when a new vulnerability is discovered.&nbsp;</p>
 
 For internally developed software, do you have an up-to-date software dependency catalog that includes a clear record of all software components?&nbsp; 
 For vendor-provided software and services, does the provider:&nbsp; 
 State which external (such as Open-Source) components form part of their product?&nbsp; 
 State the level of support that they provide for these components?&nbsp; What action they will take when vulnerabilities are discovered and within what timescales?&nbsp; 
 Note that these include IaaS, PaaS (such as managed databases) and SaaS?&nbsp; 
 State their liability for damage caused as a result of these components?&nbsp; For example, insurance against cyber damage caused through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in these components.&nbsp; 
  
 
<p>What level of Software assurance do you have?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What level of software assurance is right for your business-critical applications? Depending upon the business criticality of the system/application/devices, consider the level of assurance required.&nbsp;</p>
 
 For critical applications require <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/50341.html">ISO/IEC 15408</a> Software Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Other forms of independent certification (such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, ISO, etc.)&nbsp; 
 
<p>Do you implement Secure Software Development?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does your internally developed or commissioned software process identify and remove common vulnerabilities based on at least those catalogued by <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK®</a>, <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">CVE</a>, and <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks</a>?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which of the following best matches your internal software development?&nbsp;</p>
 
 Use Secure Software Lifecycle Development Methodologies&nbsp; 
 Use code scanning tools – including code from Open Source&nbsp; 
 Use dynamic vulnerability scanning – including for externally provided libraries&nbsp; 
 Use external penetration testing&nbsp; 
 Use formal evaluation based on ISO/IEC 15408

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>KuppingerCole Analysts pay close attention to all topics at the intersection of identity and security. Decentralized technologies often cross paths with these domains and, since it is a dynamic and potentially disruptive influence on “business as usual”, we have compiled a few predictions about developments in 2022:</p>
 The decentralized identity market segment will continue to grow:  
<p>Decentralized identity solutions are one of the strongest use cases with solutions already on the market. There have been some interesting <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/bailey/avast-to-acquire-evernym-consumer-cybersecurity-meets-decentralized-identity">acquisitions</a>, <a href="https://northernblock.io/bridging-ssi-to-iam-partnership/">partnerships</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/security/business/identity-access-management/verifiable-credentials">investments</a> over the past two years, which promise interesting product releases in the future. Use cases include both consumer and workforce IAM, with a focus on enabling the individual to hold and consent to sharing identity info, while still enabling organizations to manage the access policies for credentials that they did not issue themselves. If you’re curious about this market space, then read <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80064/decentralized-identity-blockchain-id-self-sovereign-identity-solutions">this Market Compass</a>.</p>
 Overlap between identity fraud prevention and decentralized technology will continue to develop:  
<p>An increased interest in identity verification solutions was clear this past year, as integrating identity verification into onboarding and authentication processes can mitigate risks of several different identity fraud attacks. Decentralized technology brings some unique capabilities to identity verification, especially the ability to create a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity">reusable, verifiable identity</a>. As both trends for reusable identities and verified identities grow, these two market segments will become more tightly-woven. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80521/providers-of-verified-identity">This report</a> goes into more depth, but you can expect more research on this in 2022.</p>
 The potential of Life Management Platforms will become more lucrative:  
<p>Personal security is as important as ever, and was sometimes a heavier burden to shoulder over the past two years as people worked from home on personal devices and networks, and enterprises were not always quick to secure these dynamic environments. Privacy and management of personal information is essential from the enterprise perspective as well, and enterprises do have a vested interest in handling information of employees, customers, consumers, and partners with extreme care. Decentralized technologies have always held privacy as a priority, and have had the technological methods to back it up. The market is ripe for interesting vendors to meet these needs, but will take time for the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/bailey/privacy-seekers-are-really-looking-for-life-management-platforms">Life Management Platform</a> market to mature.</p>
 Decentralized finance will have another bumpy year or rapid growth:  
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the natural home of decentralized technology, beginning with Bitcoin and continuing to the current investment for future use cases. Use cases like transacting, proving ownership, and storing digital assets are all made possible in a peer-to-peer setting, managed with decentralized technologies. But governing them to mitigate the unwieldly side effects of anonymous Ransomware demands, unregulated cryptocurrency trading and speculation, and exchanges with insufficient KYC procedures will continue to pose challenges next year. This market already has a high value which will continue to increase at a rapid pace, with concepts such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/bailey/the-future-of-exchanging-value">Central Bank Digital Currencies</a> learning from DeFi projects.</p>
<p>Overall, 2022 will see increasing maturity in some markets like decentralized identity, and volatile growth in others like DeFi. However, decentralized technologies will continue to capture the attention of individuals and collaborative communities, which we hope will lead to more published and agreed upon standards to propell promising use cases forward.</p>

 When it comes to security, there seems to be a disconnect in gaming. Where other industries have embraced an all-for-one and one-for-all approach to combating security threats, most gaming and entertainment companies seem largely happy to go it alone.

<p>When it comes to security, there seems to be a disconnect in gaming. Where other industries have embraced an all-for-one and one-for-all approach to combating security threats, most gaming and entertainment companies seem largely happy to go it alone.</p>
 
 
<p>This isn’t just conjecture. At Okta, we were curious about how developers and gaming companies approached security, so this past autumn we decided to take advantage of the return of PAX West, Penny Arcade’s iconic gaming conference and game culture exposition.</p>
 
 
 Voices from the lobby track at PAX 
 
 
<p>We went to the show to get a feel for developer attitudes towards protecting not only the development and content of the games, but also their customers' experience and data. We wanted to know how gamers felt about the handling of their information and how they play games. We interviewed developers and gamers, passed out surveys, and live-streamed the entire event in order to get a person-on-the-street perspective.</p>
 
 
<p>What we heard is directly reflected in the opening lines of the report you’re looking at now. Among gamers and developers, there’s no clear consensus on who is responsible for security. Among the developers we spoke to, there’s no clear standard for how to handle security, or even a common bar for the importance of security in development.</p>
 
 
<p>This report is by no means an exhaustive omnibus of the problems the game development world faces, and isn’t meant to be a hands-on guide to fixing the problems we discussed. Instead, it’s an attempt to pull back the curtains and say: "Hey, we all see these issues. We need to think about them, discuss them, collaborate, and work towards solving them."</p>
 
 
<p>So before we jump into the findings, I’d like to thank you, the reader, for taking the time to explore. I believe it’s an important first step to bringing the games community together, and making the work we love and the games we love to play safer for everyone.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Welcome to the wasteland 
 
 
<p>Let’s start by exploring a set of questions aimed at sussing out the answer to one overarching question:</p>
 
 
<p>How confident are you that gaming, from development to gameplay, is secure?</p>
 
 
<p>While answers varied, this single quote from the survey responses sums them up nicely: "It’s a free-for-all wasteland."</p>
 
 
<p>Overwhelmingly, respondents were neutral at best. Almost half of the answers reflect that when it comes to security in developing and interacting with games, confidence isn’t high. An additional 14% said they’re not very confident, and 6% had little-to-no assurance that the systems they use every day are secure. More importantly, every game developer who answered the survey felt neutral or negative about the security of their development process and the end product they create.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>For gamers, part of that lack of confidence may correlate to the responses we received to another question: Who is responsible for gaming security?</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Anecdotally, many of the developers we talked to both on- and off-camera felt that security was the responsibility of the platforms hosting their games or of the players themselves. In contrast, most of the attendees we spoke with felt that security was the responsibility of gaming companies, developers, and regulatory bodies. That split is reflected in the survey results, too, where respondents were able to select who they felt was responsible for security from a list.</p>
 
 
<p>Developers gave three common reasons for the lack of confidence in game security:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>I don’t have access to the tools I need to secure my development and my code.</p>
 
 
<p>I don’t have the budget I need to get those tools.</p>
 
 
<p>There are no standards that I can look to as a baseline to build from.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In reality, we’re all responsible for security, from company executives to gamers themselves (or if they’re young enough, their legal guardians). According to our survey data, and validated by our conversations on the ground, both producers and consumers (players) of games are concerned about a lack of control, an ongoing lack of security, and little consensus on how to address these issues.</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>As a gamer you have to put a lot of trust into the developers and publishers because there is limited control by gamers.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
— Gamer
 
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>I feel like there’s not a whole lot I can control on my end if someone picks a bad password for their account.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
— Game Developer
 
 
 
<p>A key takeaway: It’s a little bleak out there in the gaming ecosystem. No one is happy with the way things are right now. Gamers know there’s only so much they can do on their end to secure their data. They’re frustrated by a lack of common standards for accessing the games they play, and they’re scared of throwing their personal information into a dark well of EULAs that leave them with little to no recourse if something goes wrong. From their perspective as builders, developers too are frustrated by the lack of standards, from authentication and security methodology to common toolsets.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Steps to secure the future of gaming 
 
 
<p>In the end, our findings from PAX West this year suggest that everyone is feeling the pain, and looking to others for the solution. Game developers and players alike would benefit from an open discussion of the security features and standards the industry aims to evaluate and implement. Here at Okta, we care deeply about security and identity. With this report, we’d like to jumpstart a dialogue, and engage all industry participants in a conversation around making gaming better and more secure for everyone.</p>

<p>New mobility is all the rage these days with finding the fastest and easiest way to get from A to B. People want conveniency paired with cost savings, and they want to be able to know all their options. With <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-fueling-demand-convenience-mobility/">new mobility trends on the rise</a> such as car-sharing and micro-mobility, there are plenty of choices for consumers, but how can they find the best based on their immediate needs?</p>



 Mobility as a Service—Your One-Stop Traveling Shop 



<p>Enter Mobility as a Service (MaaS)—a one-stop shop, which takes every type of transportation into account and provides its users the best optimized route to their destination. A fairly new concept focusing on a “bundled service model”, consumers are in a sense buying into mobility, instead of investing in transport equipment.</p>



<p>But what does this mean exactly for users and operators? Well, for one it means the importance of data. In order to provide what consumers are looking for data must be shared. However, according to a study from Intelligent Transport, 57 per cent of respondents would not mind sharing their personal data in order to get a better transport service.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite this optimistic percentage, security concerns arise from both the consumer and operator and could keep MaaS from growing. Consumers fear the attractiveness this service would be for fraudsters, while also doubting the legitimacy of ID verification platforms. On the other hand, operators worry about the challenge of proper driver’s license verification and preventing minors/fraudsters from using their services.</p>



<p>In a way, the root of the problem is the lack of security on both ends and the possibility of the mishandling of data, which would put the fate of MaaS in jeopardy. But there’s really no need to worry because there is a solution.</p>



 The Missing Link: Security through Identification 



<p>The key to this new service is what connects the various modes of transportation and their service operators in order to support MaaS and provide a smooth multi-leg and multi-modal journey for customers. But what exactly is the key? Simple. Digital identity verification.</p>



<p>With all transportation options listed in one area, having a digital identity is crucial so providers know who is using their services. Plus, providers want to offer the best service to their customers (in hopes that you will use them again) and can do that by way of having the digital identities of its users. But consumers also benefit by seeing the digital identities of the providers and what they can offer them. Basically, it’s a two-way street where both parties can be satisfied.</p>



<p>But why exactly is digital identification necessary? Not only does it provide consumers and companies the benefits of this two-way street, but it offers trust, which is the foundation of any relationship.</p>



<p>Because MaaS is a platform displaying various modes of transport, there are some services that will need to know if a customer possesses a valid driver’s license. Additionally, any leasing contracts for car-sharing also can require a qualified electronic signature or proof of bank account. But no matter what they may require, a one-time, less than 10-minute verification is all that is needed.</p>



 







 Convenience is the Goal 



<p>Though still a new concept, MaaS will become more popular in the future due to its main function. It provides convenience for all its users. Mobility doesn’t need to be a hassle or stressful and people don’t want it to be. Instead, it should be easy and smooth. MaaS provides exactly that with the assistance from digital identity verification.</p>



<p>Not only is MaaS convenient, but so is proving your identity. IDnow offers solutions such a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> which requires only a quick photo snap of your ID or driver’s license. Even a qualified electronic signature can be added when necessary. With a process that only requires a few minutes, users can do so from on-the-go, wherever they may be. IDnow is the solution for knowing customers’ true identities.<br><br>Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-fueling-demand-convenience-mobility/">ID Verification—Fueling the Demand of Convenience in Mobility</a></p>



 A Partnership Leading Us into Tomorrow 



<p>In today’s growing mobility sector, having a digital identity is essential for both consumers and businesses. Both want to authenticate the other and feel secure in their relationship. Thus, these digital identities are at the core of MaaS since it is a one-stop shop. It truly is a partnership that will lead us into the world of tomorrow’s transportation.</p>

 A Metaverse built on privacy and trust — with&nbsp;Nuggets <p>The Metaverse represents a new frontier for privacy, trust, and identity. A persistent virtual world where communications, finance, and personal profiles coalesce under one interoperable platform. In the rapidly approaching world of Web 3.0 applications and services that underpin the Metaverse, it’s more important than ever to have a portable and composable digital identity that preserves privacy and provides security. One that won’t just offer proof of who you are and what you can access but also serves as a non-custodial cache for your virtual&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Nuggets delivers on that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>A multi-award-winning, self-sovereign verified digital identity and payment platform, Nuggets provides a persistent, interoperable, and verified digital identity for Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and the Metaverse. Nuggets facilitates trusted transactions through verified digital identities, a personal cloud vault, and auditable nuggets of&nbsp;data.</p> New world. New&nbsp;standard <p>The Metaverse is already upon us. People are working and building in virtual reality; billions are being spent on virtual land and rare avatars to establish a base for new online identities.</p><p>Identity authentication will be as crucial in the Metaverse as it is in the meatspace — if not more so. As such, regardless of the virtual form you take, you’ll still need to demonstrate that you are who you say you are behind the&nbsp;avatar.</p><p>Moreover, an unavoidable consequence of an open metaverse is that problems on Web 2.0 — such as fraud, data breaches, social engineering, and theft — will also exist in the Metaverse. To verify identity and avoid becoming a target for malicious actors, users must embrace the privacy and security of Self Sovereign ID (SSI). The stakes in the Metaverse will be too high to allow for today’s poor standards of privacy and security. Nuggets eliminates the attack vectors inherent in Web 2.0, protecting against fraud and ensuring that users can’t even send funds if it’s not to the correct person or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Nuggets Identity achieves this by implementing real-world identifiers that can be trustlessly linked into the virtual world through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKProofs). A core of Nuggets’ technology (and philosophy), ZKProofs allow one party to verify data to another party without revealing any information beyond the ability to verify the data in the first place. Leveraging this novel tech alongside other protocols, such as W3C verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and the encrypted communication standards of DIDComm, Nuggets provides an SSI that is fully interoperable and can be utilized globally — both in the Metaverse or the meatspace.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity is intrinsically tied to underlying ideals of Web 3.0 and the broader Metaverse. While Web 2.0 can be neatly summarized as a centralized monopoly of big tech firms harvesting user data, Web 3.0 turns that model on its head. Instead, the next evolution of the internet — and indeed, the Metaverse — is one where participants can tangibly claim ownership to digital assets, inclusive of their personal data and identity.</p><p>Within the current Web 2.0 environment, it’s impossible to use your Google identity in an Apple-owned service; the same rings true for numerous other centralized services. The Nuggets platform entirely bypasses this issue by providing a non-custodial and platform-agnostic identity solution. This means you no longer have to input personal information, time and time over, to access different spaces and services.</p> More than just a digital&nbsp;ID <p>Beyond its use as an SSI, Nuggets also offers a multi-asset wallet. Users can carry their non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital collectibles across to other realms or even sell them on a myriad of secondary markets. This also allows users to prove their age, or that they have sufficient credit to afford a tract of virtual land, take out a loan — all without having to reveal their actual balance, or disclose personal information.</p><p>Nuggets digital vault ties cryptocurrencies, bank accounts, and digital collectibles directly to a user’s digital identity, rendering an unfalsifiable and comprehensive payment&nbsp;method.</p><p>Purchases can be made through any retailer or peer in just one click, and you’ll only have to enter your information once, and that data can be kept entirely private. This level of privacy is crucial in a transparent by-design system, where anyone can see a time-marked history of every transaction ever made via a public&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>By employing trusted identifiers, users can securely transact in the digital economy, creating, buying, and selling goods without compromising data. With Nuggets, you can attach a single, persistent portable identity to various avatars and inventories, no matter the platform or&nbsp;realm.</p><p>The Metaverse promises to entirely transform how we interact, rendering a more streamlined method of sending and storing value and information. To succeed, however, this new frontier needs to be safer and more empowering than its web 2.0 predecessor — and that’s precisely what Nuggets stands to offer the coming Metaverse.</p><p>If you share our vision for a safer and more private webspace and want to get involved or learn more about our SSI solution, we’d love you to <a href="http://nuggets.life/">get in&nbsp;touch</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/a-metaverse-built-on-privacy-and-trust-with-nuggets-c6c78627800e">A Metaverse built on privacy and trust — with Nuggets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="http://trent.st/">Trent McConaghy</a>, Co-Founder of Ocean Protocol on the structure of Data Marketplaces, the evolution of Data NFTs and&nbsp;DAOs</p><p>In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we candidly talked with Trent McConaghy, Co-Founder of Ocean Protocol. During this discussion, he explains how Data Marketplaces work, the concept of Datatokens, Data NFTs, and the road ahead with OceanDAO and Ocean V4. Here are edited excerpts of the full&nbsp;<a href="https://anchor.fm/dataeconomy/episodes/Trent-McConaghy--Data-Tokens--NFTs-and-DAOs-e1boc8i">podcast</a>:</p><p>The rabbit hole of Data Economy and Data Marketplaces</p><p>At a high level, the aim or ideal situation for people and organizations is to reclaim their data sovereignty where they can own, control and manage their data while preserving privacy. To facilitate this, you want to have a data economy that facilitates buying and selling of data. If you can have platforms that connect possible buyers with sellers, these platforms are marketplaces- but that, of course, on its own would be centralized. But different marketplaces would deal with different verticals or shapes or sizes of data. Trent&nbsp;says,</p><blockquote>“We saw that instead of one data marketplace, what if there were 1000 different data marketplaces? What does it take to get to 1000 different data marketplaces to bloom? We already have the ‘web’ for pure open data sharing where there aren’t any permissions or anything. The World Wide Web is a data-sharing protocol itself. But it doesn’t have anything about the buying and selling of&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p>What if you could layer on top of that? This brings us to the concept of blockchain.</p><p>The four benefits of blockchain</p>  It’s decentralized: Instead of being controlled by a single entity (for example Facebook). Thousands of people can control&nbsp;it.  It’s immutable: You have the provenance trail of buying and selling- and all of that is on the blockchain. It’s immutable.  You can own assets: If you own one Bitcoin, you own a private key, just like a password. Ownership is the possession of that private key. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin or&nbsp;data.  It offers incentives: Bitcoins are a piece of software that initially, one team or one person wrote. This somehow grew into a global phenomenon with 1000s of people running nodes. It is worth more than a trillion dollars now and spawning a whole new industry. And that was just with one chunk of code that evolved over time. And the core of this is that its growth is based on incentives.  <p>What are Datatokens?</p><p>How does one rewire the world for new rules around data? How do we let NFTs in the marketplaces bloom? How do we make the data marketplace even more interoperable with other blockchain tools out&nbsp;there?</p><blockquote>“When we began building Ocean V3 (about a year and a half ago) crypto was already a huge industry but hadn’t really hit a trillion yet. There were all these tools such as crypto wallets: Metamask, Trust, etc. Then there’s also a bunch of tools around, DAOs, groups of people managing assets, and exchanges, buying and selling these assets, whether centralized or decentralized. We thought about how we can leverage some of these concepts to make Ocean more interoperable? And we realized something very straightforward in the world of data. If I publish a data set, then there might be thousands of people who want to license that data set; they want to use it. So that’s a fungible concept.”</blockquote><p>The vast majority of tokens follow the standard. Let’s say you published a dataset for your DNA. What if that DNA got its own datatoken? Its own ERC 20 tokens? So it’s following the standard. Basically, that is the idea of a datatoken. An ocean datatoken is a fungible token following the ERC 20 token standard, and with benefits in terms of interoperability and simplicity. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">Read Trent’s blog post on datatokens.</a></p><p>Ocean market is a data marketplace, where people can publish their data assets to create these fungible token contracts. They can buy and sell data sets and under the hood — it’s using decentralized exchange technology from Balancer.</p><blockquote>“We’re able to leverage off-the-shelf technology that has been developed for crypto, and we are leveraging it to solve long-standing problems in the world of&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p>Use cases of Ocean Marketplace and Ocean V4: Rug Pulls, Data NFTs, and Monetizing the Community</p><p>Ocean V1 solved data sovereignty; Ocean V2 solved data privacy through privacy-preserving AI and Ocean V3 solved a few things at once. It said: How do we make things simpler? How do we have really crazy interoperability for custody and management of data? How do we automatically price&nbsp;data?</p><blockquote>“What we are doing for Ocean V4 is solving rug pulls and getting into data NFTs. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-posts-413b2dd33e8f">Ocean V3 </a>added better data management with sovereign data with wallets, automatic data pricing, and simplicity. Ocean V4 adds three specific things: solving rug pulls, Data NFTs, and help the community monetize.”</blockquote><p>The target for Ocean V4 is mid-January 2022.</p><p>What are Data&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>A pragmatic definition of ownership is having a “bundle of&nbsp;rights”.</p><p>What was the motive of<a href="https://www.ascribe.io/"> ascribe?</a> The idea behind it was to give everyone more control over their work: for the first time in history, creators could break the lock on content, distribution, and licensing of the entrenched players. When you publish your initial digital art, you’re claiming that you have all the rights around it– either copyright, which is the main thing you get as a creator, which means all other rights derived from that baseline copyright, or all the rights to sublicense. It’s a similar thing for&nbsp;data.</p><p>Say when you publish a CSV file holding your DNA, you are claiming that you have copyright on that. For example, you publish the DNA data that you own– you should have all the rights — it creates a fungible datatoken. This means everyone gets a license whenever you send them the&nbsp;license.</p><blockquote>“What Ocean V4 does is, when you publish just this claim initially, that is a single NFT. It’s a non-fungible token because you can’t make copyright fungible; there’s only one entity that has control of it. So we’re going to explicitly have it where it’s represented as a token, rather than implicitly with whoever published the contract, and that’s what Ocean V4 does. But what that also does, you can still have the sublicenses against that, the fungible&nbsp;tokens.”</blockquote><p>Trent adds&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“In 2021, NFTs took off, mostly entities for digital art, which makes me very happy, like artists are getting paid. Hurray. Artists are getting paid and tooling around NFT’s is exploding too. There are way more wallets that have really good support for these NFTs. More exchanges are buying and selling NFTs. If we actually explicitly represent ‘copyright’ as an NFT, then now there’s really great wallet support for this too. So Data NFTs, thanks to the explosion of NFTs, have great support for wallets, exchanges.”</blockquote><p>OceanDAO</p><p>OceanDAO is a critical piece and is the foundation of a fully decentralized Ocean ecosystem.</p><blockquote>“Over time, we keep iterating, with our users and with their community and learning about what makes sense and what doesn’t make sense. As we were going on the path of designing V3, we saw that we also had an opportunity, not just to simplify how we did data sharing but to improve the macro-level token design of Ocean itself towards long term sustainability”</blockquote><p>This is where <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO</a> comes into the picture. That is how Ocean itself gets more and more decentralized. Teams can get grants, but also people that are in the teams, as well as others in the community can participate in these working groups to help to grow the Ocean ecosystem in various ways that suit their skills and&nbsp;passion.</p><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>2.00 to 10.38: Trent’s journey from AI research to Founder of Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>10.38- 27.28: What is a Datatoken?

             December 2021   
	 
		 
			<p>Towards the end of the year, we’d like to thank you on behalf of Tokeny for your continued support throughout 2021. Without you, we would not be where we are today. We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watch our video and meet the team behind Tokeny:</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We are frequently asked what our predictions are for 2022. Naturally, we tend to answer quickly that it will be the year for institutional adoption of digital assets. However, that already happened this year in many ways, for example:</p>
 
 El Salvador accepted a cryptocurrency as a legal tender; 
 The European Investment Bank issued a tokenized bond on a public blockchain; 
 Large custodians (e.g. State Street) and banks (e.g. Citi) launched digital assets divisions and are now hiring hundreds of people; 
 Institutions tried to leverage DeFi lending protocols to beat low interest rates and inflation; 
 More than $30B of securities have been compliantly tokenized. 
 
<p>Do we think that 2022 will be the year of DeFi, Metaverse, NFTs, cross-chain protocols, stablecoins or decentralized identity? Our answer is that it will be the year for all of these “keywords” and trends, because we are now dealing with a complete blockchain ecosystem, with the Web 3.0 revolution.</p>
<p>With financial institutions, governments, and millions of daily users now recognizing the industry, the upcoming year will bring even more innovation and, for sure, the acceleration of the mass adoption of crypto-assets will continue.</p>
<p>I hope that market standards for tokenized assets and self-sovereign identities will soon be recognized by large players so that we can address one of the major challenges of the next decade: guaranteeing ownership of digital assets.</p>
<p>And you, what are your predictions for 2022?</p>

<p>Two-factor authentication has become the de-facto method for authorization. Currently, the best-known and well-used second-factor authentication methods&nbsp;are:</p><p>1. Email 📧 (proof of email ownership)</p><p>2. SMS 📞 (proof of phone number / SMS ownership)</p><p>3. Time-based one-time passwords TOTP 🕐 (mostly through Authenticator mobile applications, as Google Authenticator, Duo Mobile,&nbsp;etc).</p> How do TOTPs&nbsp;work? <p>In the third option, a server creates a secret for your account. When your device connection is established, it shares that secret set of numbers/characters (usually in the form of a QR code or as a URI) with the Authenticator application. In turn, this application uses that secret and timestamp-based counter to generate the&nbsp;OTP.</p><p>When a user enters the OTP generated by the Authenticator application, the app that is authorizing the user sends this OTP to the server to verify it. This is the same as the application (since both have the same shared secret) and it just checks if the result is the&nbsp;same.</p><p>SMS, in the current state, is considered to be deprecated due to several weaknesses (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/questionsand-buzz-surrounding-draft-nist-special-publication-800-63-3">NIST post on&nbsp;this</a>).</p><p>While the authenticator applications may seem like a better alternative to SMS, they also have many limitations, not to mention the potential for attacks as well: Also, there’s a possibility for the secret generated by the server to get hacked or&nbsp;leaked.</p><p>Further, the backup option services often offer backup codes instead of requiring saving that secret and this means that accessing the backup codes can compromise the authorization process.</p><p>Given these limitations, DID could be a good option as a second factor of authentication instead of SMS and&nbsp;TOTPs.</p> DID as a Second Factor Authentication <p>You can use your DID as second-factor authentication.</p><p>How?</p><p>First off, you can provide your DID instead of disclosing your phone number or email ID as the second factor of authentication. In the second step of verification, you will have to prove that you are the owner of that DID provided during the initial&nbsp;setup.</p><p>To make this happen, the service on the second step of verification can provide a challenge for your user/did using the URI structure.</p><p>For example, it can be something like&nbsp;this.</p><p>didauth://signature?challenge=auth_pmhibhlsjqfjaorz4ja9&amp;ttl=30&amp;callback=https://github.com/multifactor-auth-did</p><p>Where:</p><p>1. `didauth` is the name of the protocol/standard (so an app/wallet will know what to do and accordingly, support&nbsp;it).</p><p>2. `signature` is the type which the Client/Wallet has to&nbsp;prove.</p><p>3. `challenge` — is the challenge for the Client to use (in this case — sign). `auth_` prefix value is designed to prevent a possible&nbsp;misuse.</p><p>4. `ttl` — is the “time to live” of this challenge and is expressed in&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>5. `callback` — is the server endpoint to which the proof must be&nbsp;sent.</p><p>This URI could be presented as the URI itself or as a QR code for the user on the web verification step&nbsp;screen.</p><p>In your identity wallet app, you can scan this QR/post the URI, so the wallet will be able to recognize the protocol, sign the challenge, and send it back to the server callback URL. The server will verify if the signature for the challenge is done by the proper public key of did, and if yes, it lets the web user log into the&nbsp;system.</p><p>That’s it!</p><p>With this approach,</p>  You can use your one digital identity/DID as the second factor auth for any service. (no need to setup/add each service separately)  The services are not storing your secrets (It is only keeping your web3 wallet safe at your end&nbsp;device).  No secrets are shared to set up the connection.  No backup OTPs (In this case you need to backup only your&nbsp;DID).  Low cost to add support at the service side and become crypto/web3 friendly at the same time (potentially to get even more traction from&nbsp;users).  <p>Thus, a simple, yet effective way to authenticate your&nbsp;users!</p><p>What do you&nbsp;think?</p><p>Reach out to us in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">discord </a>if you have any questions.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://denispopovengineer.medium.com/">Denys&nbsp;Popov</a></p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/using-did-as-a-second-factor-authentication-198630db4a1c">Using DID as a Second-factor Authentication</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Aside from promoting innovation and growth (for which read ‘business models based on data surveillance’), the UK Government is justifying its proposed data protection ‘reforms’ on the need to address ‘consent fatigue’.</p><p>It’s quite right to raise this issue. Consent in relation to the collection and use of personal data is in a mess, which needs sorting, most visibly and annoyingly with cookies. The question is, how best to sort this&nbsp;issue?.</p><p>The UK Government’s cynical solution is to simply abolish consent in all but name; to replace citizen rights over their data with corporate rights. But a different, better solution is possible.</p><p>This, the fourth blog in our series prompted by the Government’s proposed data protection ‘reforms’, explores how the consent mess came about and how to clear it&nbsp;up.</p> How we got&nbsp;here <p>Our current problems with consent are caused by a combination of philosophical, regulatory and administrative factors. We need to understand them all to see a way&nbsp;forward.</p> Philosophical differences <p>Two philosophical differences underlie the great consent debate: what sort of thing is personal data, and what’s the most appropriate way of treating&nbsp;it?</p><p>What sort of thing is personal data? Some simply see personal data as a ‘resource’ like any other: to be mined, extracted, processed and monetised. Others see personal data as something that is highly personal — an extension and expression of a human&nbsp;being.</p><p>The heart of the UK Government’s approach is to treat personal data as a thing — a resource whose value is to be extracted and maximised by ‘innovating’ corporations: treated like rats in a lab, to be observed and manipulated, and like sheep in data fields, to be herded and shorn of their valuable data wool. Hence the Government’s goal of ‘securing the UK’s status as a global hub for the free flow of personal data’ where personal data is treated as a commodity like any&nbsp;other.</p><p>Others, including Mydex, see personal data as an extension and expression of a human being, which therefore needs to be treated with the respect that we would afford another human&nbsp;being.</p><p>This isn’t just a warm, fuzzy sentiment. It has practical implications. It means operationalising, in rules and processes, respect for human beings’ agency (the desire to pursue goals), their autonomy (their freedom to do so), and their dignity (their right to have their views and feelings taken into account rather than being treated as a thing and therefore ridden over roughshod). Ultimately, it boils down to the Golden Rule: Treat others as you would wish to be&nbsp;treated.</p><p>In each case, these different forms of respect should manifest themselves in two key areas: having rights a) over how our data is collected and used (which includes ‘consent’), and b) over what it is used&nbsp;for.</p><p>What’s the most appropriate way of treating it? Current data protection law (e.g. GDPR) opts for a rights based approach (a plus point). But it muddies the waters by mixing the pure assertion of rights with treating personal data as a subject of a contract negotiation.</p><p>At one level, consent as a contract negotiation fits with the notions of human agency, autonomy, dignity and mutuality as above. People agree to contracts if there is mutual benefit in&nbsp;them.</p><p>But contract law is based on an absurd fiction: that there are two equal parties negotiating with each other. That an individual citizen and a global titan such as, say, a Google, Facebook or Nation State are both equals in the negotiation.</p><p>Contract law is also based on the mythologies of ‘rational economic man’ that underpin modern economics, which tell us that individuals are (or should be) ‘rational’ in their decision-making. This may sound harmless, but economists use the word ‘rational’ to mean something completely different to its meaning in everyday language.</p><p>In economics-land&nbsp;, a ‘rational’ decision maker always assesses every detail of information there is about their decision, weighing pros and cons that ricochet indefinitely into the future with exact probabilities, and does so with every decision, big and small, in an instant, without any cost in terms of time or&nbsp;effort.</p><p>According to this view, 60 pages of small print legalese to accompany an attempt to access a service is entirely ‘rational’: to make a rational decision the individual has to be ‘fully informed’.</p><p>And, thanks to the mythology behind contract law, it is assumed that an individual presented with 60 pages of small print legalise when seeking to access a service is perfectly free to sign the contract or not. They are free to walk away if they want&nbsp;to.</p><p>And if they sign it, it is their responsibility to face the consequences because they freely decided to agree to&nbsp;it.</p><p>But as we all know, in the real world, fully understanding acres of small print is a burden and interruption that gets in the way of our doing the things we want to do. We don’t always want to be ‘fully informed’ — often, we would simply prefer not to have to think about it. And we’re not really free to walk away if we want to access the service in question. So we end up signing contracts we have not read — signing our rights away, in a way which is deemed perfectly lawful.</p><p>This is how consent became a stick to beat citizens with — where ‘consent’ is used to get citizens to ‘agree’ to all manner of things that they don’t really want, and where they are blamed for the result because ‘you agreed to&nbsp;it!’</p> A regulatory mess <p>Once the regulations were set up in this way, with this unclear mixture of rights and contracts, three things happened. First, risk averse corporate lawyers started using ‘consent’ as a blanket protection for their corporate employers.</p><p>Aside from consent, European data protection laws established five other grounds for lawful processing of an individual’s data: Contract (e.g. use of data for performance of a contract e.g. delivering a service), Legal obligation (e.g. to comply with the law), Vital interests (e.g. to protect someone’s life), Public task (e.g. in the public interest) and Legitimate interests (a vague area which the UK Government is seizing on to deny citizens their data&nbsp;rights).</p><p>Practically speaking, virtually every use of data by bona fide service providers can be, and is, covered by the first five. But ‘consent’ could cover anything, so the lawyers added it in, just to be on the safe side. Very soon, it became the main practical legal ground for the processing of personal data&nbsp;… which was never the intention.</p><p>Second, wily operators on the make saw the opportunity to game the consent system, and game it they did. Knowing full well that the ‘fair contract between free and equal parties’ was a myth, they deliberately constructed terms and conditions and ‘privacy policies’ by which individuals could be asked to consent to all manner of things. Knowing that a) most people wouldn’t read or understand the small print and b) that even if they did, they didn’t have much choice but to agree if they wanted to access the service in question, they used ‘consent’ to open up a data free-for-all.</p><p>The third thing that happened was that with ‘consent’ now being gamed to unleash a tidal wave of abuse, the regulators&nbsp;… did nothing. What else could they do? The law was clear: if someone had freely consented, that was it; they had consented. It was lawful. End of&nbsp;story.</p><p>Finally, recognising this had become a problem, with the introduction of GDPR and related legislation, they sought to tighten the rules surrounding consent. But they did so by going even further down the contract negotiation route, thereby compounding the problem. Hence the ultimate absurdity of cookie pop-ups with mountains of manipulative small print getting in the way of us every time we want to visit a&nbsp;website.</p> Badly designed processes <p>To turn the car crash into a fully fledged motorway pile up, law makers and regulators based the processes by which consent would work on the organisation-centric assumption — that organisations are and always should be the ones controlling individuals’ data.</p><p>Two things followed. Individuals were presented with small print written by the organisation for the organisation. (It never entered anybody’s minds that organisations could or should agree to terms set by the individual.) And individuals had to deal with each organisation separately (because each ‘contract’ was separate), thus multiplying the burden of reading and understanding obscure small print potentially hundreds of times&nbsp;over.</p><p>Result? The ‘consent fatigue’ that the UK Government talks&nbsp;about.</p> A positive way&nbsp;forward <p>The Government’s cynical solution to the problem of consent fatigue is to simply abolish it by expanding organisations’ right to collect and use data without consent so widely that consent becomes irrelevant.</p><p>A different approach is needed, one&nbsp;which:</p>  fully embraces the notion of personal data as an extension and expression of a human being (the philosophy bit)  interprets and enforces the law in a way that practically supports this approach (the regulatory bit)  does so in a way that is safe, easy and efficient (the administrative process&nbsp;bit).  <p>There is a way to do this. Here it&nbsp;is.</p> Getting the philosophy right <p>On the philosophical front, we need to recognise the power imbalances that lie at the heart of contract negotiations between individuals and organisations and discard the fiction that humans are ‘rational economic agents’. We need to design systems that take account of how the real world works and respect the ways that real people&nbsp;behave.</p><p>We humans are ‘cognitive misers’. We don’t want to invest huge amounts of time and effort turning every transaction into a contract negotiation. We don’t want to invest hours of our precious time trying to understand small print unless it’s really necessary. When we buy something in a shop or online, we don’t enter into a contract negotiation about honest, factual descriptions about the product concerned, the safety of its materials and construction, and liability if something goes wrong. We don’t have to worry about these things because we are more or less ‘safe by default’, thanks to a web of protection legislation that was painstakingly constructed over&nbsp;decades.</p><p>We need the same for personal data. When a citizen shares data with a service provider, the citizen should have a right to feel confident that their data (and therefore they) will be kept safe. The philosophical approach that should be adopted is ‘Safe By Default’.</p><p>In this case, there should be a standard (not individually negotiated) assumption that any data that is collected will only be used to provide the service in question; that it will not be shared with anyone not needing to be involved in this service provision; and that the service provider won’t collect more data than is needed to provide the service and won’t hold the data longer than is needed for its provision.</p><p>All of this is already enshrined in European data protection law, and the processing of data on these grounds is already deemed lawful as ‘necessary for the performance of a contract. There is no need to change the law for Safe By Default to become the default. It is already there. It just needs to be enforced.</p> Enforcing the regulations <p>For Safe By Default to work one simple thing needs to happen. Regulators need to stop being spineless: they need to interpret and enforce the law as it was originally intended.</p><p>This would require three things. First, regulators should interpret existing law relating to the six lawful grounds for processing (outlined above) so that ‘consent’ should only be used when there is an exception to the first five. In particular, consent should only be required if an organisation wants to use data for something other than for performance of a contract. Organisations should be punished for using consent unnecessarily — because if the data is genuinely being used in performance of a contract then consent is unnecessary.</p><p>Second, if consent is used, organisations should be required to keep to the spirit as well as the letter of the law. For example, they should not be allowed to bundle different things into the same contract, so that individuals have to agree to things they don’t want in order to access the things they do&nbsp;want.</p><p>Third, the law needs to be enforced. Organisations should be punished for any breaches of data beyond the boundaries of Safe By&nbsp;Default.</p> Reforming processes for&nbsp;consent <p>The processes by which consent is managed need to be reformed.</p>  Individuals should be able to present their own terms and conditions for access to data, which organisations should be able to agree to (thus turning current processes on their head). (This does not require every individual to become a data lawyer. The vast majority of use cases for data sharing fall into a small number of categories (e.g. for insight and research, for advertising, for rent or sale, etc) which can be covered by a small number of standard contracts.)  Individuals should be provided with their own consent management dashboards where they can see and manage all consents from one place (including revoking consents or exercising their rights under data protection law). Organisations should be required to connect to and operate their processes via these dashboards.  These processes should be automated as far as possible. Think of a direct debit. You spend some time setting it up in the beginning (knowing that its subsequent operation will be Safe By Default). Then, once it is set up, it just happens automatically, with the individual remaining in full control because they can always revoke it if they want to. This is how data sharing, and any consent that is needed for such data sharing, should&nbsp;work.   Conclusion <p>The UK Government is right on one thing. The operations of consent and ‘consent fatigue’ are real problems that need sorting. But its cynical ‘so let’s abolish consent’ response is unacceptable. Citizens did not create this problem.

<p>The term “Metaverse” may ring a bell to some. With Facebook rebranding itself as Meta, the term Metaverse has gained immense popularity, attracting many technology companies to further explore the concept. But what exactly is metaverse?</p>



<p>Metaverse is an Augmented Reality (AR) technology that allows an individual to interact with another individual virtually. The term “metaverse” has been around for a while, appearing in Neal Stephenson’s book ‘Snow Crash’ in 1992,&nbsp; which showcased a 3D virtual world where humans interacted via their avatars. Over time the term has developed from Sci-fi into a real-life experience.</p>



<p>The expansion of metaverse covers virtual reality from audio, video, 3D holographic avatars to augmented reality glasses. Essentially, the metaverse is an endless virtual community with possibilities that can adapt to real-life activities, resembling the actual—for instance, daily activities from working, playing, meeting, studying and many more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Big technology companies such as Apple and Microsoft have indulged the advancement of the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take Microsoft as an example: the technology company has experimented with holograms, and the development of augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and the real world with its Microsoft Mesh platform. Other companies such as Epic Games, Nvidia &amp; Roblox are also developing devices to support the realization of metaverse.</p>



<p>One of the leading online gaming companies, Epic Games, who created Fortnite, recently collaborated with Balenciaga (luxury fashion brand) to develop high-end fashion in the virtual world. The partnerships feature Balenciaga apparel to be worn in Fornite to allow players to choose their avatar looks in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Socially, the metaverse opens up the possibility of space’s limitations that can exceed even time. No more time-consuming long-distance travel, it enables individuals to do different activities in different places and ease everyday activities such as online shopping and transactions by using cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShareRing is dedicated to being involved in this ever-evolving space. Recently ShareRing Lab (a division of ShareRing) closed our first ever scholarship grant in Thailand, with applicants submitting their research plans and ideas on the metaverse, and functionality of NFTs beyond the art sector. As a company we are committed to the development of talent, and welcome this gradual transition of day-to-day regular activities into the digital sphere.</p>

<p>2021, and what a year it’s been. Between all the hustle and bustle of pre-Christmas, we took a step back not to send you another flashback article, but to look ahead at what’s coming next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the pandemic taught us anything, it’s that sometimes we cannot plan things. BUT Jolocom has plans and projects for 2022 that are as certain as can be. Let us introduce you to some exciting news as we finish this year and look forward to the next one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Projects&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ve heard a lot about our SDI projects, and they will keep us busy next year too. The two short acronyms of ONCE and IDIdeal are our main projects in bringing the SSI world to the individual here in Germany. The key focus is interoperability and following the same technical standard. In addition to that, we work on different SSI based projects in the public sector as well. Be sure to check in again in a few weeks, when we can tell you more. We also expanded the role of consulting at Jolocom in case you might think of implementing SSI at your organization: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/">https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently we are talking to potential developmental partners about financial and public projects. As our connections and projects are expanding, so is our team. We are happy to see the first real life users and customers for our use cases in 2022 and look forward to bringing the SSI work to the people. This would not be possible without the engagement of a highly motivated team behind Jolocom. If this sounds interesting to you and the outlook of 2022 seems like something that you would like to contribute to, check our open positions: <a href="https://jolocom.io/hiring-product-designer/">https://jolocom.io/hiring-product-designer/</a> . We are hiring and looking forward to getting to know you! Read more about our work in the next Tech paragraph:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tech&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SDI projects will most likely be the focus (from a tech perspective) for the next year. A number of use cases will be piloted as part of these projects (mostly public administration / mobility) as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a tech perspective, in order to satisfy the SDI requirements we are building new features on a few fronts, but the core is the next iteration of our Jolocom SDK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For us, interoperability will remain a very present topic for the next year (<a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/can-we-avoid-a-ssi-babel/">https://jolocom.io/blog/can-we-avoid-a-ssi-babel/</a>). In the context of the SDI projects we have been working (also across consortia) on defining and documenting a set of SSI specifications we can all implement around. This would allow Wallets / use cases developed in different consortia to be interoperable / used with each other. We have shared and refined these efforts together with the wider SSI community (e.g. at IIW 33, as well as the DIF Interoperability Working group, among the SDI consortia, and the German Begleitforschung) on a few occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Events&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2015, Jolocom took part in the Internet Identity Workshop. Since 2018, we also sponsor it. Now we are happy to announce that the next IIW will take place from 26th – 28th April 2022. Jolocom is happy to take part in solving identity issues at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW #34</a>, and, what’s even more exciting, the event is planned to be in person in Mountain View, CA. What exactly is happening at the IIW? As the name suggests, we discuss all things identity with amazing partners from around the world. In dozens of sessions and lunches we have the opportunity to engage with new professional international connections, discussing, working on and learning about Internet Identity today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, that is not the only event we can look forward to. Connecting to like-minded people and organizations is an important part of our work. Therefore, we are happy to join the DWeb Camp, date yet to be announced. Moreover, Berchain is also awaiting us next year. As long time contributors to DIF, we are looking forward to 24th February 2022, when the next DIF event takes place. Since 2021, Jolocom is member of the Steering Committee as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That being said, let us tell you that we are here for you next year, too. Be sure to hear from us on our communication channels. We have exciting stuff planned and already look forward to bringing back our #Wednesdayfacts amongst other. Give us a follow on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/GETJolocom">https://twitter.com/GETJolocom</a> and LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/18169128/admin/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/18169128/admin/</a> if you don’t want to miss out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the Advent Calendar of #JolocomAdvent coming to a close, we would like to thank everyone on twitter who participated in our daily posts and polls. If you have any feedback or wish to see something new regarding the communication campaign, reach out to us on hannah@jolocom.com.&nbsp;</p>

			 Barbel van Spreeuwel is Accounting Administrator at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m Barbel van Spreeuwel, born and raised in Flanders – the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. And I’ve already been working and living in Luxembourg for more than 20 years now…time flies. When I decided to come to Luxembourg to join my fiancé at that time, who is now my husband, I was already working as a Financial Reporting Officer for the Investment Fund Industry in Brussels, so the professional switch to Luxembourg was not too hard. We have two wonderful daughters who keep us entertained at each age, for the moment we are enjoying their teenage period immensely ;-).</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was contacted by Tokeny when they were in need of an extra team member. They had managed to attract a big institutional investor, new internal reporting needs popped up, extra follow-up of the accounting needed to be set up and there are, as always, the day-to-day administrative tasks to take care of.</p>
<p>Daniel and Luc managed to trigger my curiosity about working in a start-up environment (completely out of my comfort zone !) and they kind of immediately gained my trust in their view on the new business opportunities related to tokenization and blockchain technology. It looked like an exciting adventure, and it turned out to be so.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was immediately immersed in Tokeny’s digital way of working, thanks to the support of my (younger) colleagues, I managed to transform smoothly into my new, digital “me”.</p>
<p>Remote working was already possible at Tokeny before COVID messed up our lives, and I really enjoy the combination of remote work and office work.</p>
<p>Even though I don’t have a day-to-day relationship with other departments, thanks to the communication tools and efforts made by our management, I do feel connected to what is happening despite the almost 100% home office experience for the last 18 months.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Healthy food, having a good dinner/lunch in any type of restaurant, interior decoration, fashion, traveling, meeting up with family and friends, music… All the simple things in life (but sports are not in my list I’m afraid :))</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>A very personal one….</p>
<p>It would be fantastic if the eternal Flame of Hope – located in London, Ontario, in Canada – could be extinguished, preferably still in my lifetime, because this means that a cure has been found for Diabetes and people suffering from Diabetes will no longer be dependent on external insulin injections.</p>
<p>My family actively contributes to this search for a cure through our participation in a European research project called INNODIA. Fingers crossed for some great outcome……</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would say that many topics remain to be addressed, but in general, I believe that through technological and scientific advances we will continue to overcome the major problems that we will encounter as human beings.</p>
<p>And on a more emotional/mental level: let’s all be as much open-minded as possible and try to stick to a positive and constructive attitude.</p>

<p>Introduction:2021: A Year Of Progress And Productivity</p>AERGO Has Risen Exponentially In Monetary Valuation And Public Exposure And There Are Many Reasons&nbsp;Why<p>Over the course of 2021, AERGO has made numerous strides in association to garnering partnerships, improving upon technology and consolidating mutual understanding and collaboration with South Korean governmental and media entities. Since the beginning of 2021, AERGO has been on the frontlines from a technological standpoint surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic, as AERGO’s incubated project CCCV has been utilized in South Korea to verify vaccination status among the Korean populace. The project CCCV, develped by Blocko XYZ, a technological partner of AERGO, has allowed for the anchoring of vaccine data on the AERGO public mainnet and this will assist South Korea in a variety of&nbsp;ways.</p><p>As of today, confirmation stickers of vaccine status only exist for people over the age of 65, which creates a huge population gap on understanding who is vaccinated and who isn’t, this is where CCCV comes in. CCCV will target ages under 65 in an effort to monitor the vaccination status of the South Korean population, a major feat that proves AERGO’s technological prowess. Since CCCV’s inception, over 2 million subscribers have joined the platform which not only include vaccination status protocols, but provides users with blockchain digital identity and NFT access as well! In fact, CCCV had their first NFT Exhibition in 2021 which was a huge success, leveraging metaverse technology and NFT’s in a virtual exhibition because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Digital identity in particular has been of great benefit in the ongoing attempt to rectify election fraud and the tampering of the democratic process, which AERGO has been attempting to nullify in South Korea through digitized blockchain voting through its application, Pikkle.</p><p>Pikkle: By The People, For The&nbsp;People</p>Pikkle Has Revolutionized The Notion And Ethos Of Blockchain Voting, Spearheading A New Era Of Blockchain Democracy<p>It is not the voters who decide the election, the counters to; this age old phrase has put the democratic process not only into question, but into jeopardy. Since the inception of democracy in Athens and ancient India, there has been no possible method to nullify and minimize the effects of election tampering; even in the 21st century, we have seen election tampering throughout the entirety of the world. It has become evident that democratic-republicanism is under-threat by tyranny, despotism and elusive election tampering. Throughout the globe, voter fraud has become a prevalent topic of discussion from major political entities to the citizenry. Blockchain technology however, is an immutable system that is immune to fraud and provides users with an innovation that is highly secured, decentralized and anonymized with audible chains of records. Blockchain technology has revolutionized and transformed numerous different industries and now it is time for blockchain to perpetuate the ethos of democracy as the catalyst of the collapse and end of voter fraud. AERGO understood this notion, and knew that it must be stopped, so Pikkle was&nbsp;born.</p><p>Pikkle was created by Blocko and built on the AERGO platform, Pikkle has become a standard application utilized by the Korean Broadcaster’s Association who signed an MOU with AERGO on April 23rd and Pikkle’s inception occurred to prevent a variety of dilemmas that plague election processes because of malicious intent. Pikkle assists in inefficient election costs, resolving voter processes that create substantial costs coinciding with identity verification, voter fraud, ballot lists and check counts. Pikkle aims to mend the public trust of voting paradigms which. Unfortunately, since the advent of social media, it has become evident that votes can be easily manipulated and influenced for the platforms own self-interest, and this is true for all social media platforms, it is not an exclusionary issue.</p><p>The Korean Broadcasters Association aims to utilize Pikkle as the standardized go-to platform for reliable voting services for all users involved. Pikkle collects users information and views and assists in decision making through an application service rather than traditional cold-calling and text voting spams. Pikkle resolves voter fraud by storing data-components of voters such as identification of voters and voting results utilizing blockchain technology; an immutable digital ledger that cannot be hacked, tampered with or corrupted, unlike traditional voting systems. Convenience has become a crucial component of almost every single part of our daily lives so Pikkle encourages the seamless usage of QR codes to participate in voting actions, insured by the public and private trust of blockchain technology. The app’s identity verification service, which eliminates the need for a physical ticket, enables efficient and easy entry into cultural events and festivals, a hallmark of South Korean tradition. Fun fact, the word Pikkle derives itself from two words “pick” and “people”, the people pick the electoral incumbents, not the despots and politicians. AERGO aims to be a progressive company in a variety of ways, and AERGO has recently joined the Cryptocurrency Climate Accord in an attempt to nullify pollution created by blockchains.</p><p>Forward Thinking: Net-Zero Carbon Output Blockchain</p>Prominent Figures Have Criticized Blockchain Because Of The Immense Pollution Output Proof Of Work Systems&nbsp;Create<p>Many powerful and prominent figures within our world, specifically Elon Musk, has shown huge interest in blockchain technology, but have pulled back on their stance because of the unfortunate carbon output many blockchains create. Resulting from this, companies like AERGO joined an organization in 2021 known as the “Crypto Climate Accord”, whose aim is to reach net-zero emissions for their respective blockchains. This organization, including AERGO, has some of the most prominent blockchain projects within this initiative which include Enjin, Ripple, Polygon and Terra. One of AERGO’s fundamental goal for this decade is to be carbon-zero by the year 2030, a forward thinking approach in a backward world surrounding energy consumption. In essence, a healthier planet leads to mainstream adoption through the acceptance from not only the populace, but the environment as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Klaytn And Aergo: Blockchain Partnerships</p>In 2021, AERGO Was Listed On Klayswap, A Decentralized Crypto Asset Finance&nbsp;Protocol<p>AERGO hasn’t stopped in its resolve to garner partnerships and expansion within the private, public and blockchain sectors and their partnership with KLAYswap this year emphasizes such a notion. KLAYswap is a complete and automated on-chain swap protocol that operates and leverages on-chain liquidity pools. Liquidity is guaranteed through automated market making mechanisms. KLAYswap enables on-chain swap services for any KLAY or KCT-type token cryptocurrency to become a liquid provider and earn passive income from transaction fee commissions. For AERGOnauts, this enables AERGO token holders to participate in a passive income paradigm simply by utilizing the KLAYswap platform, which in return can earn them AERGO tokens in a decentralized environment. Resulting from this partnership, AERGO has garnered increased liquidity and immutability, which, in conjunction with passive income mechanisms, is a force to be reckoned with. Not only has AERGO garnered partnerships specifically oriented to blockchain companies and MOU’s signed with government entities, but venture capital firms have taken notice of AERGO as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The Great Noticing: Venture Capitalists Take Notice Of&nbsp;AERGO</p>Notice AERGO In This Diagram With Some Of The Most Well Known And Prominent Projects In All Of Blockchain?<p>AERGO has garnered backing from numerous VC’s within the web of blockchain, and the above chart proves the notion of how far AERGO has come, specifically in 2021. One of the largest blockchain VC firms, Sequoia Capital, invested in AERGO, and Sequoia has invested in other companies you may just be familiar with: Google, Apple, PayPal, Instagram and YouTube are to name a couple. Since AERGO’s inception, other contributors have backed AERGO which include, FBG, GBIC, Arrington XRP, Dekrypt, Rockaway, Neo Global as well as many more traditional VCs.</p>Early Investors Of The AERGO Project, Listed&nbsp;Above!<p>Venture capital investment is one of the prerequisites in searching for a promising project that could revolutionize numerous different aspects of an industry. Since the beginning of 2021, AERGO has proven itself as a dominance blockchain platform through the realization that many of these VC firms see promise, potential and a future for the AERGO project. It would be of a logical conclusion to make that venture capital firms only invest in projects that they believe have not only monetary promise, but a grandeur vision within its own industry, making AERGO an outlier within the blockchain web. One of the latest partnerships, in December, has also been announced as well with a company known as TrustVerse; the emphasis on the inception of partnerships and the expansion of AERGO cannot be overstated.</p><p>TrustVerse And AERGO: Partnerships Upon Partnerships, Expansion Upon Expansion</p>TrustVerse And AERGO On December 2nd, Agreed To Sign A Business Agreement That Will Assist In the Expansion Of The AERGO&nbsp;Platform<p>Even in the final weeks of 2021, AERGO is making numerous strides to garner business agreements and partnerships to expand upon its reach within our world; one recent business agreement that was announced just ten days ago was the AERGO TrustVerse agreement. TrustVerse is a digital financial solution company, and TrustVerse has agreed to add AERGO token and NFT features on TrustVerse’s digital wallet. Simultaneously, TrustVerse will be a representative 3rd Party Wallet of the AERGO project, an outstanding feat. Through this agreement between these two corporate entities, AERGO will be provided with TrustVerse’s MarS Wallet as AERGO’s representative 3rd Party Wallet, which will in return increase its blockchain ecosystem utilization and flexibility. MarS Wallet will add AERGO ERC20 token, AERGO Mainnet token, and AERGO Mainnet NFT assets storage, transmission, and viewing functions, providing AERGO with increased expansion, exposure and availability to expand even further. It is evident that TrustVerse trusts AERGO’s future vision and the scale in which they which to&nbsp;grow.</p><p>Conclusion: Token Valuation Increase Through Corporate Expansion</p>Valuation Increases When Utility And Corporate Expansion Occurs<p>2021 is a year in the history book of AERGO that will be remembered for years to come. Government MOU’s were signed, AERGO’s liquidity increased through Klayswap, CCCV has assisted with COVID certification vaccines and NFTs, Pikkle has conceived of a democratic paradigm that assists in the rectification of voter fraud and election tampering, and this is only the beginning. VC firms have noticed the expansion of AERGO, the Korean Broadcaster’s Association is now familiar with the project and utilizes Pikkle, which proves that AERGO has garnered respect and partnerships in the public, private and blockchain sectors, and this is only in 2021 alone. If 2022 is anything like 2021 for AERGO, it is evident that this blockchain project will become one that will be reckoned&nbsp;with.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>Searching for the best open banking network, or what historically people referred to as financial account aggregators can mean combing through a ton of choices. In fact, when you search for financial data APIs on review site <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/finicity/reviews">G2</a>, you’ll see a whopping <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/financial-data-apis">92 options</a>. How do you parse through so many companies to find the one right for your fintech company’s needs?</p>
<p>Because it can be a difficult decision for fintech companies, we’ve put together this guide to define financial data aggregation and to help identify the features to look for.&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding Financial Data Aggregation 
<p>Account aggregation, also known as financial data aggregation, is a process that collects a person’s financial data in one place. This data can include checking and savings accounts, transactions, investments, credit and tax data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having this data in one place benefits many parties, not only consumers. It also benefits banks, lenders, investors and financial advisors. A lender, for example, can use account aggregation to see all the relevant financial information for a consumer applying for a loan, including their transaction history, employment history, income, assets and more. Individuals and families can use the aggregated data to make better financial decisions and small and midsize businesses can use it to better run their operations or access critical capital. Fintech companies can use it to make better apps for their clients.</p>
<p>At Finicity, a Mastercard company, we believe that true empowerment of consumers comes from giving them full control of their data. Consumers should have total control over how their data is used, how frequently it’s accessed and how long it will be retained. The steps to manage data permissions should be easy, quick, and intuitive. Aggregators and ecosystem participants can work together to ensure the highest level of clarity and accessibility, making it easy for consumers to understand and manage their data permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to pure convenience, financial data aggregation through open banking eliminates the need for each party to update this data manually. This saves time and minimizes mistakes for both companies and their clients. It’s all part of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-banking.asp">open banking</a>—allowing consumers, financial institutions, and third-party providers to access consumer-permissioned data for empowering consumers and small businesses through new and innovative financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does it work? Historically, data has been collected through screen scraping with a secure login. Much of today’s innovation has been built on the foundation of screen scraping. Recently, however, more data aggregators are using direct API connections with a financial institution. Finicity, for example, pulls the majority of its data through direct API connections in the United States. This method provides cleaner data and is more secure because it uses tokenized access instead of consumers’ login credentials.</p>
<p>Data aggregators use bank-level encryption, which safeguards the personal and financial data of consumers. Finicity operates its aggregation platform with a transparent, consumer-first ethos. Consumers should be explicitly informed in plain language how their data will be used and who will be using it.</p>
 What to Look For in Open Banking Providers of Financial Data 
<p>&nbsp;When you’re searching for financial data aggregation services, you’ll want to find one that has wide coverage, core provider capabilities and specialty products for your company’s needs. It should also maintain a good price point, with a user-friendly platform and the assurance of accurate data.</p>
 Coverage 
<p>Does the aggregator have a wide breadth of access to financial institutions, or do you need a depth of coverage in one area? Finicity maintains its connections, which cover more than 95% of financial accounts. This means that anyone who uses our services can be confident that they will get the best possible insights into their client’s financial situation.</p>
 Core Provider 
<p>While there may be many companies that offer data aggregation solutions, many of them are simply reselling data from another aggregator. Finicity is one of a select few aggregators who maintain all of their connections to banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. When errors arise, you want to be dealing with the actual provider of the data, who can make changes. Otherwise, you may be consuming data they’re getting from somewhere else, and never have the ability to make essential adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also want to know where your data is coming from for traceability purposes. Knowing how many different companies touch the data can also be an important piece of the puzzle.</p>
 Specialty 
<p>Does the aggregator specialize in your industry? Whether you’re a lender, financial advisor, investor or private individual, it’s important that your financial data aggregation software be tailored to your company’s needs. For example, if you’re a <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">lender</a>, you’ll need to see assets, income, employment, cash flow, statements, transactions and scoring attributes to ensure that you are making the right decision. Where the data comes from is also important. Does the aggregator connect with the largest investment brokerages or stick to simply banks and credit unions? The source of the data is also an important component of an aggregator’s specialty.</p>
 Cost 
<p>What’s your budget? Where’s breakeven from a revenue and cost perspective? Many financial aggregation companies offer pricing on a <a href="https://www.finicityreports.com/plans?_ga=2.112862980.1461598282.1625012380-386745331.1624463991">tiered</a> basis by volume, which may be something like free trial, pay-as-you-go or enterprise. Determine what your needs and priorities are—maybe you need verification of assets but not verification of income. See which tiers or packages offer your highest priority data and what your expected volumes would be.</p>
 User Friendliness 
<p>Are the APIs readily available for you to use? If fintech companies can’t test out APIs before making a commitment, it’s hard to know if the features and user experience will fulfill their needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The industry has been around for more than 20 years and technologies vary when it comes to working with a modern development team,” said Michael Deleon at <a href="https://tearsheet.co/data/a-buyers-guide-for-data-aggregation/">Tearsheet</a>. “You’ll want to find a match between your firm’s capabilities and the UI/UX of the data aggregation industry.”</p>
 Data Accuracy 
<p>Is the data they’re pulling cross-verified with multiple data sources and bank-validated deposit streams? You want to be confident in the quality of the data. That way you won’t have to do any further cleaning of the data and can plug what you receive directly into your current workflows.</p>
 Why Finicity is One of the Best Financial Data Aggregators 
<p>If you’re one of the many fintech companies looking for a financial data aggregator, Finicity is a great option for you. <a href="https://tearsheet.co/data/a-buyers-guide-for-data-aggregation/">Tearsheet did a handy comparison</a>, and if you’re here you’ve probably already heard about our competitors.</p>

<p>CoinCodex: As an increasing number of developers begin integrating blockchain technology into their applications, a new niche of P2E and NFT games has emerged as the fastest-growing sector within the global gaming market. One of the main reasons behind this success is the players’ complete ownership of any in-game asset purchased, which grant them value in the outside world as well. Bridge Champ has been mentioned in this article as one of 2021’s promising blockchain gaming developments from the Jelurida company. The first-of-its-kind online bridge gaming platform, Bridge Champ, is now in the final phase of development and it will be deployed on Ardor’s main child chain Ignis. It will include an in-game economy for registration and tournaments organization, secure video conferencing, fair gameplay and more.</p>

<p>As we near the end of another year it seems like a great point to reflect on what has come to pass. In today’s fast-paced world, the emphasis tends to be focusing on future plans; what deliverables are in our roadmap, what partnerships are on the horizon, and how we can best structure our team for future success. However, finding time to reflect is also essential as it helps us to understand and analyze what worked well, what didn’t, and our general direction and velocity of travel. With that in mind, this post will look back at what 2021 had in store while offering a brief glimpse into our plans for 2022.</p><p>Rather than give a blow by blow account of each month as it happened, because that would be very boring and tedious, we’ve identified some broad themes that developed throughout the year, these were:</p>  Tech delivery  Shift from engineering to adoption and partnerships  Team scaling  <p>Tech Delivery</p><p>To use a soccer commentator's cliche, 2021 was a “game of two halves”. The first 6 or so months represented a heavy focus on feature development and several upgrades for the Dock Blockchain. The start of the year saw Dock finish what it started in late 2020 with the completion of the token migration, we even <a href="https://blog.dock.io/migration-extension-announcement/">extended</a> this to ensure we brought as many token holders with us from the Ethereum Network over to Dock’s new chain. Approximately, 97.2% or all tokens were migrated (circa 972M) and those that migrated within the first 5 weeks were awarded a token bonus by the Dock treasury. Looking back, we’re delighted with this result. Migrations are highly complex and involve multiple third parties (security auditors, exchanges, legal, etc...), and completing this securely while also keeping other aspects of the roadmap on track is a testament to the dedication and commitment of the team and the support of our amazing community. And the result is certainly worth it, as we describe later in this post the utility the Dock ecosystem derives from our native token is evident in several areas.</p><p>Network upgrades</p><p>Network upgrades continued just as the migration was drawing to a close, and at the end of March, we integrated our mainnet with Parity’s <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier">Frontier project</a> making it possible to deploy smart contracts written in Solidity on Dock. Our specific requirement for this addition was to enable us to integrate Dock’s mainnet with Chainlink’s price feed, enabling network services to be provided to issuers in USD. However, in addition to our initial use case, the integration significantly increases what can be created on Dock, such as; the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which we created a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/eth/tutorials/src/tutorial_evm.md#dao">tutorial</a> for, the issuance of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and decentralized application development.</p><p>Around this time we also released a feature that had come up several times in calls with organizations that were considering using Verifiable Credential platforms, and that is the ability to make Dock’s credentials <a href="https://blog.dock.io/delegatable-credentials-now-available/">delegatable</a>. For example, a government may want to allow private test centers to manage issuance of certain licenses on its behalf. Or a professional organization may delegate the credentialing authority to online learning platforms, so that the members who complete courses on the platforms can receive verifiable credentials that are officially recognized by the organization. This feature was extended a few months later by enabling delegators to publicly attest delegations by adding details of delegation to their Decentralized Identity documents on the Dock blockchain while also enabling credential Verifiers to search for delegation details publicly posted on-chain. Delegatable Credentials is a feature that continues to come up in our partnership discussions and is utilized in pilots, a worthy addition to Dock’s product suite.</p><p>As summer descended on western Europe, Dock released arguably the biggest milestone of our year when we moved from our Proof of Authority network to Proof of Stake. This achievement took many months of planning and execution from the entire team. While Dock engineers worked with security auditors to ensure the upgrade was being carried out securely and successfully launched a testnet before the mainnet upgrade, the operations team recruited and worked with more validator teams as our validator count rose from 11 to 50 during the transition. Quality was certainly the focus and the Dock ecosystem is fortunate to be supported by a number of validating partners including; Ovrhd, Everstake, Stakin, MyCointainer, Ryabina along with a host of independents.</p><p>We also worked with exchange partners to ensure they had updated their wallets to run on our upgraded chain, which is in essence an entirely different network to what we had before. It was not possible to keep the previous chain state and roll it into the new network and we, therefore, had our block explorer, Subscan, host both our <a href="https://dock-poa.subscan.io/">PoA chain</a>, frozen after 7.6M blocks, and our new <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/">PoS chain</a>. &nbsp;At the time of writing the new chain has been running for 160 days uninterrupted and has produced over 4.5M blocks at the time of writing, while 12.4% of circulating supply is currently staked.</p><p>The upgrade to PoS was so important for the network as it further decentralized control by not only increasing the number of validators, as mentioned previously, but also it meant that the Dock Association no longer had any control over deciding who the validators were. Under PoS, Network algorithms now determine who becomes one of the 50 active validators based on the amount of stake they hold. The validator elections take place continually and are held every 12 hours. In addition, we now also have community governance features in place as a result of this upgrade, and recently our first referenda was <a href="https://blog.dock.io/referenda-1-approved-network-rewards-split-to-adjust-to-50-50/">successfully passed</a> increasing the rewards received by the validators and stakers.</p><p>Adoption, growth, and partnerships</p><p>The second theme that emerged through 2021 was adoption and growth. Essentially, now that we have a network in place, how do we maximize its use? The approach we have taken is two-fold, first, what technical things can we build to make the consumption of our network as easy and efficient as possible. The second aspect is operational, what relationships can we build and what processes can we put in place for technical teams to start to build on Dock. In fact, 2021 was a busy year for partnerships, we concluded the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-awarded-contract-to-advise-german-development-agency-on-professional-profile-data-wallet-for-global-learners/">work we had started</a> with German development agency Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), assisting them with the technical architecture and features for a professional profile data wallet for their learning platform. As a slight aside, those who follow Dock closely will know that we released our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/launch-of-the-dock-wallet-app/">mobile wallet</a> into the app stores this month. Not only can community members now store, send, receive, and manage Dock tokens from their mobile device, it will serve as an important gateway to several planned Dock innovations.</p><p>We also <a href="https://blog.dock.io/hackathon-winners-ovrhd-build-solution-on-dock/">worked with Ovrhd</a>, a startup that was using Dock to not only win a Hackathon, but also work with the Dutch Government in the Hague to use Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity to create a tokenized urban ecosystem, in which tokens are used to manage crowds and enable voting procedures within the community.</p><p>Ease of use</p><p>As the year progressed, and the basic features were in place, we started to think about how we can make the network easier to use and the tools we could provide to encourage adoption within this very new yet exciting world of verifiable credentials and decentralized identity. &nbsp;This thinking was developed in conjunction with companies like international identity verification provider, Credenxia, who are <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-leaps-into-the-future-with-docks-api/">collaborating</a> with Dock to build a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials. Our answer was to <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-to-release-verifiable-credentials-api/">build an API</a> (Application Programming Interface) that simplified the development process by taking care of key management and hiding the requirement for Dock tokens to process network transactions (this is managed by Dock) enabling payment for API usage to be made in $USD. Essentially, the API enables less complex and faster integrations and is certainly desirable with almost all companies we have spoken with. This includes <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-partners-with-digital-credentialing-platform-xertify/">Xertify</a> who is integrating with Dock’s blockchain infrastructure and tools to facilitate issuance of their healthcare credentials. At present, Dock has had around 2,500 signups to our API with around half of these identifying themselves as developers, product, and business owners. So demand certainly seems to be strong and as we prepare to enter 2022 we’re very optimistic the volume of issuer partners will grow rapidly.</p><p>It is important to note that the partnerships formed during the year were not just issuers of Dock, growing adoption can take many forms, and late in November, we co-sponsored the world’s <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-co-sponsor-dao-hackathon/">biggest Hackathon</a> focussed on utilizing decentralized tech stacks. At the time of writing over 2,500 participants have signed up and we\re all looking forward to seeing the outcome of the event with Dock’s challenge to participants focussing on; Self-Sovereign Identity, Workforce Training, Know Your Customer (KYC), Learning &amp; Academia, and Health &amp; Safety. &nbsp;We also recently <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-collaborates-with-transak/">completed an integration</a> with leading fiat on/off ramp, Transak, whose service enables the purchase of DOCK via bank transfer and/or card payments in multiple international currencies in over 60 countries.</p><p>Team growth</p><p>It was clear at the start of 2021 that in order to support our aggressive roadmap and ambition we had to increase the number of team members, as well as acquire some additional skills. During the course of the year, the team has grown by around 42% up to our current complement of 14. We have already hired another blockchain engineer who will start in January but we’ll introduce him when the time comes.</p><p>This year we have added a Mobile (React) Developer, Head of Business Development, Solution Architect, Content Marketer, QA and Test Automation Specialist, Project Manager, Support Rep, and a Cryptographic Advisor. Moving forward, we will be looking to add to our mobile development team to increase our development velocity. We have a lot of plans here and we want to bring them to market as quickly as possible, while we will also be increasing our marketing team.</p><p>It is worth noting that on the whole recruitment has been very challenging this year and certainly it is a seller's market. Any blockchain experience in development roles certainly carries a significant cost premium and with many projects with large treasuries and funding pools to draw from the market is very fast-moving and highly competitive. As a result, it took longer than anticipated to recruit for certain roles, even working with professional recruiters. There is no indication that 2022 will be any different.</p><p>Looking forward</p><p>While this is a reflective post, it would also be remiss not to consider what can be expected for 2022. We will continue our drive to keep making Dock easier to use, for issuers but also for the token holder and staking community. We know that the user experience of staking through our <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/explorer">front-end app</a> certainly has room for improvement and we’re going to be improving this in several ways. Our integration with the hardware wallet, Ledger, is at the final stage, and certainly staking through Ledger reduces some of the complexity and the number of steps involved. We’re also going to be integrating staking into our newly launched mobile wallet and soon-to-be-released web wallet. And of course, for those who prefer the simplicity of centralized, custodial staking, this will be available with some of our existing exchange partners soon.</p><p>We’ll also be working to continue our blockchain innovation with features like traceable credentials, range proofs, and we’ll be working to build bridges between Dock and other blockchains to increase utility of the DOCK token while also adding other options for blockchain developers. And finally, we plan on continuing our effort to engage the Dock community through our forums, our governance process, as well as through projects like our newly launched Ambassador program and our up and coming Grants Program. Watch our social channels for more details.</p><p>We’re hugely proud of what we have been able to achieve this year, particularly as a small yet growing team. None of this would be possible without the amazing support of our partners and of course, the Dock community, many of whom give our team members, and the project, backing above and beyond the call of duty.</p><p>Thanks for an amazing year and best wishes to everyone for a healthy and prosperous 2022!</p>

   As we increasingly move towards a digital world, there are many hurdles that emanate from this increased adoption, such as privacy violations, security breaches, and data ownership concerns.  These challenges stem from the perspectives of seeing an entity’s identity as a mechanism of control and a means of monetization, instead of seeing it as something that defines a particular entity and belongs

<p>As we increasingly move towards a digital world, there are many hurdles that emanate from this increased adoption, such as privacy violations, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">security breaches</a>, and data ownership concerns.</p><p>These challenges stem from the perspectives of seeing an entity’s identity as a mechanism of control and a means of monetization, instead of seeing it as something that defines a particular entity and belongs to&nbsp;it!</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">Self-Sovereign identity</a> or SSI, in short, has the potential to change these existing perspectives and to put an entity completely in control of its information.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity — Principles and&nbsp;Benefits <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> is a new framework that enables an entity to control where and how one’s data is stored and with whom it is shared. If you look closely, there are many principles involved in it and they&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602">Selective disclosure</a> — You disclose only the information you choose to share with&nbsp;others.  Decentralized identity management — Since every entity is responsible for its identity, there is no more centralized storage and management of digital identities.  Control — The user has complete control over his/her information and can determine where and how it must be&nbsp;shared.  Transparency — There is complete transparency for the user on how his/her data is being used and by&nbsp;whom.  Interoperability — SSI supports interoperability across different systems  <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</a> — This is a process by which one entity can prove if a statement is true by revealing as little information as required.  Portability — SSI supports the use of data formats that are portable across&nbsp;devices.  Secure — Since it uses cryptography and blockchain, the information tends to be&nbsp;secure.  <p>These principles provide a ton of flexibility and benefits for both individuals and organizations, and the society at&nbsp;large.</p> Benefits for Individuals <p>For individuals, it is a safe and secure way to store and share their information with others, all the while being in control of what is happening with their data. This is a big shift from the existing <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">federated identity</a> and other centralized systems where organizations store and control the way users’ data is shared and&nbsp;used.</p> Benefits for Organizations <p>SSI is beneficial for organizations too, as it streamlines the customer onboarding process and at the same time, enables the organization to comply with the growing privacy and security legislation.</p><p>With SSI, organizations no longer have to spend resources in protecting and managing users’&nbsp;data.</p> Benefits for the&nbsp;Society <p>SSI helps society as a whole by reducing the number of data hacks and by providing a framework for governance. It can provide the much-needed privacy and security that are necessary to enhance the trust factor among&nbsp;users.</p><p>Now that you know the benefits of SSI, how can you leverage&nbsp;it?</p><p>While there are many ways to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/do-you-need-blockchain-for-enabling-ssi-452d62b34890">implement SSI</a>, we will focus on its implementation through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p> Elements of a Verifiable Credential <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> are open standards to represent digital identities. These credentials are expressed using JSON and are digitally signed, thereby making them tamper-proof and machine verifiable.</p><p>Here’s how a VC looks&nbsp;like.</p> {  “@context”: [      “https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",      “https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"  ],  “id”: “http://example.edu/credentials/58473",  “type”: [“VerifiableCredential”, “AlumniCredential”],  “issuer”: “https://example.edu/issuers/565049",  “issuanceDate”: “2010–01–01T00:00:00Z”,  “credentialSubject”: {      “id”: “did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21”,      “alumniOf”: {          “id”: “did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1”,          “name”: [{              “value”: “Example University”,              “lang”: “en”           }, {      “value”: “Exemple d’Université”,      “lang”: “fr”      }]    }  },    “proof”: { … }  } <p>Source: w3.org</p><p>If you look closely at the VC, it contains the following elements.</p> Context <p>The context provides a background to what’s coming and in the case of a VC, it always starts with “@”. This is an ordered set where the first is always the URI — <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1">https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1</a>. This lets the other systems know that this is a VC and will process it accordingly.</p> ID <p>This element helps to identify a particular object or credential and is unique for every VC. Since this ID doesn’t change, it can be used across devices and platforms to represent the thing. This element can take only one&nbsp;value.</p> Type <p>Type is a mandatory field that identifies whether the rest of the JSON code is a verifiable credential or not. Also, it must mention what kind of a credential it is, such as a passport, university degree, driver’s license, and&nbsp;more.</p> Issuer <p>The issuer is the entity issuing the credential and along with the holder and verifier, it forms what’s called a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>.</p> Credential Subject <p>This is the core part of the VC and describes the VC itself. It talks about the holder and can have many properties such as id, name of the attribute, its value, etc. There is no defined format for this part of the VC as it depends largely on the VC&nbsp;type.</p><p>For example, if the VC is a university degree, its attributes would be the name of the university, the degree of the holder, year of passing, etc. On the other hand, if the VC is the holder’s passport, it will contain information such as first name, last name, address, date of birth,&nbsp;etc.</p> Proof <p>This is the last element of a VC and is a mandatory one as it contains the digital signature of the issuer. This is the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">cryptographic part</a> that authenticates the rest of the information in the VC, and this is the attribute that makes the VC tamper-proof and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>You can explore different VC types with <a href="https://schema.affinidi.com/">Affinidi’s Schema&nbsp;Manager</a>.</p><p>Also, visit the <a href="https://build.affinidi.com/">Dev Portal</a> to learn more about SSI and VC, and how you can leverage our tech stack to generate and issue VCs and to build SSI-based apps.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/an-in-depth-exploration-of-self-sovereign-identity-and-verifiable-credentials-1a3eb2296004">An In-Depth Exploration of Self-Sovereign Identity and Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
