 What is Open-World Compute? <p>Serverless computing has been promised as the next big thing™ in computing. There are many advantages: not needing to build and manage complex backend code, and granular billing per invocation means that you only pay for what you use. Many of these systems have adopted workflow systems (e.g., AWS Step Functions, GitHub Actions) on top of batch requests. Unfortunately, the systems to date have serious limitations: they’re locked into cumbersome proprietary APIs, have a finite number of integrations, and often don’t handle partial failure elegantly (e.g., can leave a database in an inconsistent state if something goes wrong in another step). Furthermore, many of the compute offerings today lock developers into an ecosystem, making it difficult to switch to other solutions in the future.</p><p>A more principled generation of workflow systems has developed to address some of these problems. They typically depend on the developer writing their code “correctly” and not doing things that make their code repeat work on multiple calls. This doesn’t play well with many common functionalities: what about when developers want to access time or random numbers? They also often don’t handle rollback out of the box. In short: they’re closed systems that depend on the programmer working hard to ensure that abstract properties are respected. This is a real problem: networks can (and do!) fail. Developers write buggy code (we all do it). It’s an extremely high bar.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, brings content-addressed computation to IPFS using Wasm, PKI, and capabilities. IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability. </p><p>IPVM (and Homestar) takes a different approach. Instead of depending on the developer to be careful, it restricts their programming environment. For example, WebAssembly (Wasm) can be limited to deterministic computation: any code that you compile to Wasm has to have these properties that we want by definition. IPVM also acknowledges that failure happens and pulls from recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-m-b-r-o-s-i-a-providing-performant-virtual-resiliency-for-distributed-applications/">research</a> about hiding that as much as possible by leveraging content addressing and Wasm.</p><p>Fission's vision for open-world compute is highly usable and collaborative. We want an open, multitier system that runs everywhere, connects all the world's users and services, and is substantially better than Web 2.0. Anyone will be able to broadcast a task type on the network, and it will be automatically usable without having to fork the project or ask permission.</p> Key Characteristics <p>There are several key characteristics we're considering as we build IPVM. As mentioned earlier, idempotence and determinism are key to reliable computing, but they can be challenging to understand and implement. </p><p>Wasm allows developers to bring their own language, run computations on a server, in their browser, or even on their phone, and run them in a deterministic environment so that the same inputs always produce the same outputs. </p><p>Furthermore, when we run computations with CIDs, the results output more CIDs. The CIDs do not get recomputed and reproduced each time we run them - they are essentially cached in IPFS. When someone applies that same input, it simply calls back that cached result. No new records are being created, making it idempotent. This comes for free on Merklized data, but we can also Merklize data that's read from anywhere and cache it for later use. </p><p>While pure computation is useful for many applications, you still need mutability in many cases. There are queries (reads) and pure computations, and these can go back and forth as long as we end with mutation. Because we are not giving users the ability to define the order of execution, we can reorder computation so that the mutations happen at the end.</p><p>If we bring these three properties together - determinism, idempotency, and purity, we can achieve virtual resiliency. This gives the developer peace of mind, knowing that, eventually, the computations will work no matter what crashes or curveballs are thrown at the system.</p><p>We also want replayability. The cached computations, or receipts, never have to be re-run. And when we need to make non-deterministic requests or work with time of day or random, instead of losing out on the guarantees of deterministic compute and having to use client libraries, the node can call itself, store the information, and run the RPC call. Then if we run it again, we can have replayability because those previous computations were already saved. This creates a "run once, never run again" system, making it more efficient and scalable. Using capabilities based on UCAN, we can determine who can run different computations. Perhaps one job is better for Bacalhau, another for Fastly, etc. Maybe you only want computation to happen on a cluster of machines that you and your friends run and no others. We let IPVM handle the matchmaking and authorization checking so that different systems can work together to complete the job.</p><p>And the best part is this is all happening behind the scenes! The developer doesn't need to set any of this up. 👍</p> Compute over Data Summit 2023 Presentation <p>Fission Staff Research Engineer <a href="https://github.com/zeeshanlakhani">Zeeshan Lakhani</a> gave a presentation on IPVM and his work on the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">Homestar</a> implementation at the Compute Over Data Summit, which can be viewed below.</p><p>Learn more or get involved by joining the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM working group</a>.</p>

But we know that open source alone is never a solution, and that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401205000393#aep-section-id27">it also requires institutional competency</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/puar.12141">champions</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584918301277">sustainable business models</a>. Without these, <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09593841211232677/full/html">open source software deployments commonly fail</a>. Open source systems also introduce new dependencies — for example on <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/automation/beware-systems-integrator-lock-in-open-source-dependency/d/d-id/754863">companies who integrate new open source technologies into existing systems</a>. In the Philippines, the government has advanced one of the most significant deployments of the open source digital identity platform MOSIP, one of the most developed DPIs — yet the contract for the integrator alone was just under $40m and is <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1514108/psa-eyes-national-id-listup-for-filipinos-abroad-after-may-2022-polls">a ‘crucial’ component</a> of the project. The contract is&nbsp;ongoing.</p><p>Design is key to inclusion: ensuring that DPI meet standards that reflect core values is key — especially around issues such as individual agency, inclusion and protection. We’re currently researching the implications of the design of the EU’s wallet initiatives for migrants, looking at where identity wallets have been implemented — such as <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/estonia-to-trial-mobile-id-app-based-on-ukraines-diia-409191/">Ukraine’s Diia,</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1672385">Pakistan’s Pak Identity</a> or the <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/document/digital-identity-analysis-humanitarian-sector">IFRC’s DIGID</a>. From the humanitarian context we know that many vulnerable populations such as migrants <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/document/digital-identity-analysis-humanitarian-sector">see little value in digital wallets</a>. But while design matters, we shouldn’t expect governments to become technology companies, developing all their own inhouse development capacity. Instead, governments need to be smart customers, with informed procurement practices.</p><p>2. Impact and risk assessment is key: in our research on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-and-management-information-systems-for-humanitarian-and-social-protection-response-b1b25e5623a2">registration and identity systems and management and information systems in refugee and social protection</a>, it’s clear that many deployments lack assessment of impact. For example, while there are broad policy goals of linking humanitarian systems with social protection systems, there are <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2021/6/21/rohingya-data-protection-and-UN-betrayal">widespread concerns about the transfer of vulnerable peoples’ personal data from humanitarian agencies to host governments</a>. While the humanitarian sector has established principles and approaches such as ‘do no harm’ to assess potential danger, there is a <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CWC-Managing-Digital-Risks-To-Refugee-Connectivity-Report.pdf">growing attention to the issue of ‘digital&nbsp;risk’</a>.</p><p>Due diligence and impact assessment tools are key. The UN has established <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/Blog_post_GNI_Blog.pdf">due diligence assessment tools</a> for assessing technology use across the organization. In our work on HR due diligence for tech investors, we developed an assessment tool to support technology investors consideration of rights in their decision making. Impact assessment is key to assessing the design and deployment of a specific system. To address other technologies, systems or wider path of digital transformation, a broader framework is required. A broader framework is also needed to ensure a sustainable, long term solution for countries who wish to manage the range of digital technologies in use within a sovereign jurisdiction.</p><p>3. Governance is the key to safeguarding, protection — and defining the values of digital transformation. A national set of rules of the road for digital technology under a sovereign jurisdiction can set the direction of digital transformation. This can include determining things like procurement rules to establish interoperable, transferable data formats, as well as wider principles such as civic participation, oversight and recourse. With the right rules in place a nation can benchmark systems against agreed standards and rules — and determine whether a particular system meets what we have decided are ‘good’ standards. What should a governance framework look like? Each country’s governance framework will be unique — though it’s important to recognise that its not about new laws/elements but ensuring existing laws are fit for the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>We’re currently working with UNDP to develop a model framework, and in our work so far key elements for this framework include: Legal framework; Capable institutions; Data Protection and Privacy; Policy and system design principles; Facilitating access to services; Procurement &amp; anti-corruption; Transparency and access to information; “Rights, Risk &amp; Inclusion” and Accountability.</p><p>The governance layer enables national sovereignty and interoperability: the governance layer sets out the rules of the digital railroad — ensuring that any digital transformation and technology can meet the goals of DPI. But like a railroad, standards determine whether trains can safely move from one country to another — or not. The governance layer can determine a country’s ability to interact with international partners — such as the digital governance heavyweights of the US, EU and&nbsp;China.</p><p>Governance is key to defining the private sector’s&nbsp;role:</p>  DPI is not just public or government owned tech — financial sector, data brokers and managers.  A sustainable national digital public infrastructure ecosystem requires private sector technology vendors, investors and innovators.  Getting the governance layer right — from data protection laws, procurement regulations and financial reporting — is key to ensuring that private actors and capital can be confident their role and interests will be protected.  <p>These governance frameworks have deeply value laden dimensions — consider the emphasis on individual rights in the EU’s suite of digital regulation (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">DMA</a>, <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package">DSA</a>, <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>) and on national socialism in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/4/13/china-spearheads-ai-regulation-after-playing-catchup-to-chatgdp">China’s AI Act</a>. All <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/117307/">technology systems, regulations and principles</a> reflect values and ideas about the goals that governance is intended to&nbsp;support.</p><p>DPI are technologies — and as such are neither good, nor bad — but never neutral. Governance is the key to determining the impact of digital public infrastructure, and the destination of the resulting digital transformation. Getting governance right will get the right digital transformation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/governing-digital-public-infrastructure-5cd1c985ed22">Governing Digital Public Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, blockchain has emerged as a transformative tool, capable of revolutionizing computational foundations of industries. Among its plethora of applications, one area where blockchain and AI show potential is in the realm of supply chain management.</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2021/10/21/ongoing-supply-chain-issues-are-the-result-of-a-stale-model-heres-why/?sh=63b78c2641e1">Image Source</a></p><p>Ocean Protocol is the privacy preserving, data sharing protocol for data, web3, and AI. The protocol is capable of architecting computational output and a real time data-sharing framework.</p><p>Computation is essential for understanding the world around us. The ability to run computations on sensitive data while preserving its privacy and sensitivity with Ocean Compute is a capability that supply chain and data analysts have never seen. That is, computation on a dataset without revealing the underlying data.</p> Ocean Protocol: A&nbsp;Primer <p>Ocean Protocol sets a standard for digital ownership and access control. OP tools allow people to connect real assets with compute jobs. As humans, we cannot predict the future or guess the aggregate outcome of events…accurately that is. Ocean allows everyone (individuals, industries, enterprise, and governments) to share, monetize, and leverage data while maintaining privacy and control. Ocean’s “Compute-to-Data” feature gives compute access on privately held data, which never leaves the data owner’s premises.</p><p>By leveraging the core functionalities of Ocean’s smart contracts, such as <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/datanft-and-datatoken">data NFTs</a> to represent IP ownership, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-tokens-2-fungible-composable-54b6e0d28293">datatokens</a> to define the rules of IP access, as well as <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">compute-to-data</a> to orchestrate privacy-preserving access to data — users can now build next-generation marketplaces and token-gated applications.</p><p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean-based marketplaces</a> enable monetization of private data while preserving privacy. Ocean brings together open-source blockchain technology, data tokens, AI agents, and advanced access control in a unified, interoperable ecosystem.</p><p>Access to data, computing said data, decentralized data sharing and verifiable time blocks are Ocean Protocol features that outline a foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) designed to enhance and streamline supply chain processes.</p> Decentralized Applications (dApps) in Supply Chain Management <p>Decentralized applications (dApps) are software applications that run on a distributed computing system, like a blockchain (Ethereum Mainnet for example). Unlike traditional web applications, dApps are not controlled by a single entity, providing a level of transparency, security, and efficiency not achievable in traditional, centralized systems.</p><p>In supply chain management, dApps powered by Ocean can leverage Ocean Protocol’s data-sharing capabilities to bring significant process improvement: transparency, traceability, and efficiency. Here are some potential dApps that can be built on the Ocean Protocol for use in the supply chain industry:</p> 1. Traceability dApp <p>One of the most critical issues in today’s global supply chains is the lack of transparency and traceability. A dApp built on the Ocean Protocol could provide a solution to this problem by enabling a transparent, tamper-proof record of product journeys from origin to end consumer (example: farm to&nbsp;shelf).</p><p>Such a dApp could use data tokens to provide access to product data at each stage of the supply chain, including manufacturing details, transportation logs, and quality checks. This data can be shared securely and transparently with all stakeholders, allowing consumers to verify a product’s authenticity and sustainable practices.</p> 2. Smart Contract-Based Automation dApp <p>Ocean Protocol’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">smart contracts</a> library is home to the most advanced smart contract infrastructure available on the web today. Smart contract &amp; blockchain-based structure supports the use of self-executing contracts and AI agents with the terms of the agreement written into code. A smart contract-based dApp can automate various supply chain processes, reducing manual intervention, minimizing errors, and improving efficiency.</p><p>For example, a smart contract could automatically trigger payments upon meeting certain conditions, like the delivery of goods, confirmation to a warehouse, or sale of a shelved good.&nbsp;. This would significantly reduce payment processing times, fees and disputes over transactions.</p> 3. Real-Time Inventory Management dApp <p>Managing inventory efficiently is crucial in supply chain management. A real-time inventory management dApp built on Ocean Protocol could offer a powerful tool for companies to keep track of their inventory in real time, helping to minimize storage costs and prevent stockouts or overstocking.</p><p>This concept dApp can use IoT devices to collect data on stored goods and share it on the blockchain. Stakeholders could access this data using data tokens, providing a real-time, accurate view of inventory levels.</p> 4. Data-Driven Demand Forecasting dApp <p>Understanding and predicting demand is vital for successful supply chain management. A dApp using Ocean Protocol’s data-sharing capabilities could aggregate and analyze data from various sources to provide accurate, data-driven demand forecasts.</p><p>This could include historical sales data, market trends, social media sentiment, and more. Companies could access these insights through data tokens, enabling them to make more informed decisions about production and distribution, reducing waste, and improving customer satisfaction.</p> Ocean Protocol: Blockchain x Supply Chain dApps built&nbsp;Today <p>One example of a supply chain initiative inside the Ocean Protocol Ecosystem is <a href="https://www.transportgenie.ca/">Transport Genie</a>: who aims to make it possible to transport animals humanely through AI powered smart sensors, whilst monitoring livestock from farm to their next destination. Transport Genie offers real-time alerts and uses blockchain technology to keep a digital twin record of activities throughout the transportation value&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.transportgenie.ca">https://www.transportgenie.ca</a></p> Conclusion <p>Ocean Protocol’s decentralized data sharing and compute to data framework offers fertile ground for developing dApps that can revolutionize supply chain management. By providing a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for data sharing and decision making, Ocean Protocol can help the supply chain industry overcome its current challenges and pave the way for a more sustainable and efficient future.</p><p>These use cases of Ocean Protocol highlight the transformative power of combing blockchain, AI and cryptocurrency in reshaping traditional industries.</p><p>From ensuring transparency and traceability to automating processes and enabling real-time inventory management, these dApps could revolutionize the way we manage and monitor supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>The use of data tokens to access shared data can create new economic models within the supply chain, providing incentives for data sharing and collaboration. This can lead to the democratization of data, where every stakeholder in the supply chain, from producers to consumers, can benefit from shared information.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable people to privately &amp; securely publish, exchange, and consume&nbsp;data.</p><p>Follow Ocean on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a> to keep up to date.

<p>Every year on June 8th, World Oceans Day provides a global platform to raise awareness about the value of our oceans and the critical need for their protection. One thing is for certain: oceans are vital to our existence.</p>



 The importance of our oceans and coral reefs 



<p>Oceans cover 70% of the Earth’s surface and is home to up to 80% of all life in the world. Oceans also generate 50% of the oxygen we need, absorb 25% of all carbon dioxide emissions, and capture 90% of the excess heat generated by these emissions. However, <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceanwater.html">according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, increasing greenhouse gas emissions are affecting<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/ocean-impacts"> the health of the ocean</a>&nbsp;(e.g. warming and acidifying seawater), so reducing the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide and safeguard life on the planet.</p>



<p>This year, we are focusing our attention on one of nature’s most amazing marvels: coral reefs. These ecosystems play a vital role in sustaining marine life, capturing CO2 and mitigating the effects of global warming, presenting an opportunity to form part of an enterprise’s overall plan to address its sustainability goals and reduce its impact on the environment.</p>



<p>Why is preserving current coral reefs and building engineered reefs important? Almost one billion people depend entirely on healthy coral reefs for their livelihoods. <a href="https://thereef.company/mission">More than 60% of the global population depends entirely on seafood for all protein intake and more than 25% of all life in the planet’s oceans starts as a direct result of healthy coral reefs.</a></p>



<p>Nowadays, human activities and climate change are pushing these delicate ecosystems to the brink of collapse. <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceanwater.html">If no significant action is taken, 90% of all coral reefs are predicted to be extinct by 2050</a>.</p>







 The responsibility of businesses to reduce global emissions 



<p>To make the greatest impact, we all need to work together, including businesses. Businesses today have greater responsibility than providing a return to investors; they have a role to play in helping reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



<p>According to a recent IBM Institute for Business Value survey, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/esg-data-conundrum">95% of surveyed global executives say their organizations have developed ESG propositions</a>. However, many of these organizations lack a clear pathway to realizing their goals and 41% of surveyed executives cite inadequate data as their biggest obstacle to ESG progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the numerous environmental challenges we face are daunting, we have reason to be optimistic. Technology, when harnessed effectively, can provide innovative solutions such as those that help to protect and restore reefs. We also know that building a more sustainable world will require strong partnerships. One such collaboration exists between IBM and The Reef Company.</p>



 Collaborating for coral reef restoration 



<p>IBM and The Reef Company have recently joined forces signing a joint initiative agreement aimed at bolstering their ocean conservation endeavors. The Reef Company is on a mission to build 2.500 engineered reefs, covering an average area of 50Km2 each, with a total investment of USD 500 Billion. The primary objective of this grand project is to restore and revitalize the marine ecosystem, sustaining the invaluable ecosystem of services nature offers, including carbon capture. Together with IBM’s support, the aim is leveraging data from the ocean and technology, and taking the project to the next level. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Reef Company designs reef modules, which are engineered with low-carbon impact materials and are manufactured locally. These building blocks create the foundation for new underwater habitats, and enable marine life (flora and fauna) to thrive whilst serving as a hotspot for marine biodiversity. The reefs are also equipped with the BluBoxx™ ocean data platform, and can be adapted to different environments to monitor and collect a wide range of ocean data.</p>



<p>The BluBoxx™ solution works with various sensors and cameras, which are fed via surface solar panels, used to measure salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, pressure, and carbon dioxide. BluBoxx™ also enables data transmission from the subsea sensor collection devices to the surface. The data is then uploaded into the cloud platform which extracts valuable insights that are used to support ocean research as well as to serve a broad range of industries.</p>

































<p>IBM Consulting, with its industrial experience and IBM’s cutting-edge technologies, will play a crucial role in supporting The Reef Company reef restoration efforts.</p>



<p>Having a well-designed data architecture and fact-based data can help with understanding performance and measuring progress against broad-based operational and ESG goals. Insights generated from this data can help organizations further their ESG programs as well as drive operational efficiency.&nbsp;Moreover, credible environmental reporting is supported by factual data.&nbsp;These elements support business intelligence and analysis, automation, and AI—all of which can help organizations to quickly seize market opportunities, build customer value, achieve greater efficiencies and respond to risks.</p>



<p>This collaboration creates new opportunities for the two companies to potentially explore leveraging IBM’s AI and data platform &nbsp;and data analytics capabilities, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a> or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sustainability">Sustainability Software</a> solutions like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite</a>,&nbsp;which could assist in the monitoring, reporting and management of these artificial coral reefs.</p>



<p>By harnessing the power of watsonx generative AI capabilities and pre-trained foundation models, IBM could potentially analyze large volumes of data collected from various sources, such as satellite imagery, BluBoxxTM underwater sensors, and historical records, to identify patterns and predict potential threats to coral reefs. This proactive approach could help conservationists take timely action, implement mitigation strategies, and allocate resources more effectively.</p>



<p>The IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, an AI-powered SaaS solution, provides timely and fact-based actionable intelligence that can help organizations and users proactively plan for and manage the impact from severe weather events and climate change events.</p>



<p>IBM’s collaboration with scientists, conservation organizations, and local communities can help drive innovation in coral reef restoration, offering technological solutions that support informed decision-making, efficient resource management, and long-term sustainability of these fragile ecosystems.</p>



<p>This new agreement has the potential to create powerful positive environmental impact, knowledge, employment, academic research, and economic benefits for multiple industries and local communities.</p>



<p>As we celebrate World Oceans Day this month, we are reminded that addressing climate change will take more than any one organization. It will requires companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities, all working together, with the aid of technology, to improve the efficiencies of our activities and operations and to reduce costs, waste and emissions.</p>



<p>By embracing the power of technology, we can gather critical data, accelerate restoration efforts, and promote awareness at an unprecedented scale. However, technology alone is not the solution. We must also address the root causes of reef decline, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, curbing pollution, and promoting sustainable fishing practices.</p>



<p>By combining our collective efforts and leveraging technology, we can help preserve and protect the beauty and biodiversity of healthy oceans for future generations to come.</p>

           <p>Did you know that public blockchain technology will revolutionize supply chain management? From reducing costs to enhancing efficiency and boosting sustainability, the potential benefits are immense.</p>
<p>At UNISOT, we’re at the forefront of this transformation.</p>
<p>These are just 3 keyways the public blockchain can transform your supply chain. Let’s shape the future of Supply Chains together!</p>
       Customers and End Users 
<p>With the public blockchain, customers and end users can be sure about the quality and authenticity of the products they want to buy. It keeps a record of all the important information about the products, such as quality control tests, certifications, and where they come from.</p>
<p>This means customers can easily track and verify the origin and journey of the products, ensuring they are genuine and not fake. Customers can now shop with confidence, knowing that they’re getting the real deal and not counterfeit products.</p>
       Suppliers and Producers 
<p>With public blockchain, suppliers and producers can easily track and trace their goods, raw materials, and components as they move through the supply chain. This gives them a clear view of where everything is at any given time. It helps them stay accountable and ensures that everything is running smoothly. Plus, blockchain’s <a href="https://unisot.com/global-inventory-management/">real-time inventory tracking feature</a> helps them manage their inventory more efficiently. They can now avoid running out of stock by knowing exactly when to restock and can reduce unnecessary costs and waste by keeping just the right amount of inventory on hand. In short, public blockchain helps suppliers and producers streamline their operations, save money, and improve overall sustainability and efficiency.</p>
       Logistics Providers 
<p>With public blockchain, logistic providers can have real-time tracking of their shipments, which means they always know where they are and when they’ll arrive. This helps avoid delays and plan routes more effectively. It makes logistics operations smoother and more efficient. Additionally, the public blockchain allows providers to securely share logistics data with others involved in the supply chain, like suppliers and customers. This means they can collaborate easily and directly, without relying on intermediaries. It simplifies communication and reduces costs. In a nutshell, the public blockchain helps improve logistics operations, save time, and work more seamlessly with other parties in the supply chain.</p>

<p>We’ve all had terrible login experiences. You sign into an app, only to realise you have to log in again to access another system on the same journey, and often supply personal data that you’ve already supplied. It’s frustrating, and doesn’t exactly create a positive impression of the brand – especially as sign up/login is right at the start of the user journey, setting the tone for the continued experience.</p>
<p>Clunky customer experiences lead to abandoned service sign ups, fewer returning users, fewer word of mouth recommendations, and – perhaps worst of all – security risks. When access to a service is complex, users tend to cut corners when it comes to credential management. For example, they may reuse a common password out of “credential fatigue” – a practice that risks data breaches when hackers try credential stuffing. Not to mention the security risks that come from internal workforce inefficiencies when managing several accounts/data silos per user.</p>
<p>It is a far more user friendly and secure experience for users when you offer one simple login to your organisation’s apps and services. The options within this area are varied, and will be tailored to your systems and requirements, but a great place to start is single sign-on (SSO).</p>
 One login with single sign-on (SSO) 
<p>Users want simplicity when it comes to access to your services. Single sign-on is key to achieving it. SSO lets your users log in once to authenticate to all permitted services and apps. This means that moving between different services is transparent, without the need to have multiple accounts and credentials, or input the same data multiple times.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Single sign-on also means single sign-out. Once the user has logged out, or had their account revoked, you don’t need to worry about forgotten access/logged in sessions presenting a security risk.</p>
 Customising SSO 
<p>You might be thinking that SSO sounds simple enough, but what about your unique (sometimes complex) business requirements. Can SSO still simplify your user journey?</p>
<p>Perhaps you have some of your services based on external systems. In these cases, Federation allows single sign-on between two security domains, so you can still reap the benefits of SSO.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of your systems contain more sensitive data than others. You might want to have more assurance over the identity of the user for these areas – likely requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) – but without requiring this step for more basic services. A great solution to these cases is <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/what-is-step-up-authentication/" title="Step-up Authentication">Step-up Authentication</a> – still using SSO with your usual level of authentication, then asking for further verification only when the user is accessing the more sensitive system(s) or completing a higher risk transaction.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have the same users accessing your systems in different contexts – e.g. as a private individual, but also in their work role. With the right identity solution, you can choose to authorise one account to have different permissions depending on the context in which they are accessing the account. For example, where a user may have permission to purchase something on their own behalf, they may not on behalf of their company. So, again, you can still take advantage of SSO and only requiring one account per user.</p>
 How to implement SSO 
<p>SSO is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) staple capability, and can usually be implemented quickly and easily – particularly when installed as part of a SaaS or hybrid cloud/on-premises IAM solution.</p>
<p>Many organisations who are looking to simplify their user journey get started with SSO from an IAM solution stack, which gives them the option to add on further functionality when required. For example, if the user base grows or needs become more complex later on, additional capabilities from the IAM solution stack may be added on. The key here is to choose a flexible solution that will evolve with your business.</p>

<p>In her CoD Summit 2023 presentation, Fission co-founder and CTO Brooklyn Zelenka discusses the need for location-independent compute, and how content addressing and open protocols are making it possible.</p> We're Living in a Server-Centric World <p>Since the invention of the LAMP stack in the '90s, we've been working with a server-centric model. It has led to developers specializing in front-end, back-end, DevOps, Kubernetes, Docker, and more. &nbsp;Over the years, it has become more difficult to train and maintain this complex system.</p><p>Amazon, Microsoft, and Google control the majority of data centers, which has led to further centralization. In places like South America, Central America, and Africa, the lack of compute infrastructure means that users in these areas have less access to resources.</p><p>IoT, compute over data, and LLMs cannot work long-term if we keep sending data to a small number of data centers. It's an overwhelming, massive amount of data. &nbsp;</p><p>We have to bring compute to where the data is produced, closer to the user.</p> Building a New Compute Stack <p>We know we need location-independent compute and data, but to do this in production, you first need location-independent auth.</p><p>A capability-based model like <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-ucan-decentralize-auth/">UCAN</a> removes the authorization server, simplifying permissions handling. We no longer need pristine APIs for everything and can pass around auth as necessary.</p><p>The direction and the layout of the requests become the flow of authority.</p><p>Not only is it more efficient and energy-saving, but it's also more resilient because there is no central server that can bring the rest of the network down if it goes offline.</p><p>Now that auth is handled, we can solve for location-independent compute.</p><p>We started with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> because you can write in any language you want, and it runs anywhere and deterministically. </p><p>When running a computation, we take arguments and apply them to a Wasm function. This outputs a <a href="https://proto.school/content-addressing/04">CID</a> or content identifier. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. </p><p>This means we can compute over that content-addressed data without needing a centralized server! &nbsp;</p><p>We can roll all of this and a scheduler up into a task and run it, and when it executes, it returns a receipt. The receipt includes pure values (EX: 1 + 1 = 2), effects (something you want to happen next that needs to take resources off the network, like sending an email), and metadata.</p> Input Addressing <p>With content addressing, we take data, hash it, and use that data as the key value. </p><p>Here, we're introducing input addressing, where we get a receipt as the value, and the input is the hash of the instruction (the description of what you want to have run).</p><p>Instead of validating with a hash, we validate with a receipt, making it fully deterministic!</p><p>Finally, we use an invocation (a signature) and build a workflow (by authorizing multiple computation requests at once). </p> Benefits of Wasm Compute   The distributed runtime can decide the most efficient way to run tasks in the network by handling the matchmaking for the user.  The more returned receipts, the fewer computations we'll need to run. We can skip steps and reuse receipts because they've been deterministically run already. &nbsp;  If the system crashes, you can always pick up where you left off by following the CID trail.  Reverse lookup allows the user to check if a certain input ID has been entered. If it has, they can retrieve the computed result without running the task again. This is especially helpful when running AI language models over the same data or cryptographic operations.

<p>As organizations continue to expand their digital footprint, new vulnerabilities are constantly emerging that can put them at risk. Among the most prominent new examples is attacks that exploit the growth of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">application programming interfaces (APIs)</a>, which work to connect applications and systems to facilitate the exchange of data. Along with the ease of interaction that APIs provide, however, comes potential new entry points for bad actors to gain access to organizations’ resources and data.</p>



<p>According to Gartner®<a>[1]</a>, “The explosive growth of APIs is expanding the attack surface of organizations, giving malicious actors new breach and data-exfiltration opportunities.” <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api-management">API management</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-are-api-gateways/">API gateways</a> can play an important role in how you consistently create, secure and control access to your APIs. According to “<a href="https://nonamesecurity.com/api-security-trends-report">The 2022 API Security Trends Report</a>” by 451 Research and commissioned by Noname Security, this is proving to not be sufficient, and more advanced security is needed to protect APIs across their lifecycle.</p>



 Introducing Noname Advanced API Security for IBM 



<p>Against this backdrop, IBM has collaborated with Noname Security to help companies shore up their API lifecycle against malicious activity. Noname Security’s technology extends the capabilities of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/api-connect">IBM API Connect</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/datapower-gateway">IBM DataPower Gateway</a> solutions to help cover the spectrum of API usage, including discovery, posture management and runtime protection. This new collaboration—<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/noname-advanced-api-security">Noname Advanced API Security for IBM</a>—aims to further enhance the strength of solutions for monitoring and locking down APIs from evolving threats.</p>



The partnership with Noname Security expands IBM’s API security capabilities for more comprehensive coverage of the API lifecycle



<p>The collaboration arrives at a critical time for businesses. The use of APIs can be increasingly integral to companies’ digital transformation, facilitating better connections with their customers and enhancing the management and ownership of data. This has led to an explosion in the deployment of APIs, and a recent survey commissioned by Noname Security showed the average organization now has over 15,000 APIs in use, with a growth rate of 201% over the past year.</p>



<p>That’s a lot of APIs for organizations to monitor, and without proper insights into this digital connective tissue, cybercriminals can potentially gain access to sensitive data through methods like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ddos">distributed denial of service (DDoS)</a>, injection attacks, authentication hijacking, and man-in-the-middle schemes.</p>



 Outsmarting threats 



<p>Noname Advanced API Security for IBM, now generally available, allows organizations to expand their API usage while keeping close tabs on potential threats. The solution is designed to do the following:</p>



 
 Automatically discover managed and unmanaged APIs. 



 Provide insights into their behavior. 



 Monitor for adherence to industry practices and policies. 



 Systematically detect potential malicious activity and use user-configurable policies to block attacks that may transpire. 
 



<p>The collaboration harnesses the power of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to help organizations quickly apply data classification and context-aware analysis to APIs in their estate. With this inventory, the technology can analyze and assess each API for misconfigurations, vulnerabilities and alignment to industry practices. It can even provide suggested remediation steps for APIs that appear susceptible to attackers.</p>



 Get started with Noname Advanced API Security for IBM 



<p>Standing strong against the never-ending evolution of cyberattacks requires bold innovation on the part of security solution providers. The IBM-Noname Security collaboration is just that—a union to help address one of the fastest-growing threats.</p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The words “blockchain” and “energy” usually make uncomfortable reading as people think of the <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/05/04/cryptocurrency-energy/">outsized</a> energy and environmental costs that come with using cryptocurrencies; recently, however, blockchain technology is being seen — and being adopted — to do the opposite and drive sustainability in the energy industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a recent article in Finance Magnates <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/the-use-of-blockchain-technology-in-the-energy-industry-to-promote-sustainability/">reports</a>, blockchain is driving sustainability initiatives “by improving energy traceability, facilitating peer-to-peer energy trading, streamlining supply chain management, and decentralizing energy infrastructure.”</p>
<p>It all makes for fascinating reading; but, we draw attention to it mostly because it’s a timely reminder that not all blockchain is crypto, and that distributed ledger technology can be used to do lots of beneficial things without using much energy at all, let alone draining the grid.</p>
<p>Simply put, the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x">energy intensive computation</a> required to validate bitcoin transactions — known as “proof of work”— is unique to that activity; other uses of a blockchain, such as to support verifiable credentials for decentralized identity, do not.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
 
 A distributed ledger for identity uses signatures rather than mathematical computation to generate proof. No complex mathematical processes are needed. You either accept the signature or you don’t. 
 A write to the ledger (and one write can be the basis for millions of identity credentials) or a look up on the ledger uses no more energy, and possibly less, than browsing a web page. 
 A decentralized network using a blockchain-based distributed ledger means you can use <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DIDs</a> to move most “transactions” and their cryptographic proofing off the ledger. As no personally identifying information is written to the public ledger identity blockchains don’t need to do any ledger transactions at all. 
 
<p>Although harder to quantify, the energy saved from using a technology that enables you to trust information is also something that should be taken into account. You can build seamless, frictionless processes to take advantage of data that can immediately be verified and acted upon. This is what is happening in the energy industry use cases described in the Finance Magnates article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this saves time and money and mitigates error and fraud. So remember, when you hear the word “blockchain,” it’s not just about bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are excited to inform our clients and partners that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/storage-defender">IBM Storage Defender</a>, part of our IBM Storage for Data Resilience portfolio, is now generally available.</p>



<p>Enterprise clients worldwide continue to grapple with a threat landscape that is constantly evolving. Bad actors are moving faster than ever and are causing more lasting damage to data. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">According to an IBM report</a>, cyberattacks like ransomware that used to take months to fully deploy can now take as little as four days. Cybercriminals keep trying to find their way into an organization one way or another, and early detection and timely response are more critical now than ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Storage Defender, announced earlier this year, aims to work across the various silos that exist in an organization’s IT landscape to provide a holistic view of its data security posture. It is also engineered to help enterprises detect sophisticated threats earlier and orchestrate data recovery to help get a minimally viable enterprise operational by coordinating with existing SecOps workflows. With IBM Storage Defender, IBM Storage software capabilities covering inventory, threat detection, data protection, Safeguarded Copy and recovery orchestration are available to clients with simple consumption-based credit licensing.</p>



 Mitigating risk with a holistic view 



<p>Building resiliency for data against threats from bad actors, insiders or unsuspecting users is a team sport. It takes collective intelligence and collaboration—usually between teams fostered by alignment, standards and a shared understanding. A management platform like IBM Storage Defender with a single pane of glass optimized for personas based on their specific roles (e.g., data, security, infrastructure or governance) can bring the right groups together to converge on the recovery plan.</p>



<p>IBM Storage Defender is designed to be able to leverage sensors—like real-time threat detection built into <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/ibm-storage-more-value-in-store">IBM Storage FlashSystem</a>—across primary and secondary workloads to detect threats and anomalies from backup metadata, array snapshots and other relevant threat indicators. With IBM Storage Defender, clients can cut through data silos and devise an action plan to strengthen their data resilience. For example, a client could air-gap copies of the most sensitive data, hold it off-premises and periodically test for recoverability. Doing this is designed to help reduce the threat exposure window and proactively safeguard data from vulnerabilities.</p>



 Credit-based licensing to break down silos 



<p>All our new IBM Storage Defender capabilities going forward will be available as credits called Resource Units (RU). Our existing capabilities can continue to be consumed under current licensing agreements or as RUs going forward. Customers can procure RUs and redeem them against any underlying capabilities within IBM Storage Defender. They will be able to size the RUs they need based on the capabilities they plan to consume. Credits are like coins; they can be used to consume any service within IBM Storage Defender. This construct gives our clients more flexibility to consume IBM service capabilities and only pay for what they use. &nbsp;</p>



 Comprehensive data resiliency to address needs of modern workloads 



<p>The IBM Storage for Data Resilience portfolio is designed to help clients protect their most valuable asset—their data—against sophisticated threats like ransomware, exfiltration, insider attacks and inevitable events, such as natural disasters and common user errors.</p>



<p>IBM continues to evolve its IBM Storage for Data Resiliency solutions with mission-critical enterprise applications, virtual machines and an increasing footprint of cloud and container-native applications.</p>

<p>Give consumers a priceless asset: more time. Endless errands, work tasks and countless obligations big and small chip away at their free time and fill their schedules. Applying for a loan shouldn’t add to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To power a faster, better mortgage experience for consumers,&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">Freddie Mac’s Loan Product Advisor&nbsp;asset and income modeler (AIM)</a>&nbsp;continues to evolve, now including paystub data in addition to direct deposit data for income assessment. These cost-saving efficiencies provide increased rep and warrant coverage while continuing to meet Freddie Mac’s strong credit underwriting standards.</p>



 Open banking drives new mortgage capabilities 



<p>Using consumer-permissioned data from trusted third-party providers like Mastercard (with some services delivered through Finicity, a Mastercard company), direct deposit plus paystub increases the confidence in income calculations by matching digitized paystub data to borrower direct deposit history sourced from trusted providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Mortgage Verification Service</a> (MVS)&nbsp;supports this new AIM capability by providing direct deposit transaction data paired with digitized paystub&nbsp;data to fuel this innovative, data-driven approach. It identifies&nbsp;the income stream that matches the paystub, delivering accurate risk assessment results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assets, income and employment verifications are vital to mortgage lenders looking to verify borrowers’ finances. However, between unreliable results, miscommunications and paperchases, verifying assets, employment and income can be cumbersome. MVS helps borrowers get faster approvals with fewer conditions up front, allowing them to close and move into their homes faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“Partnering with Mastercard ensures we can deliver the best tools and insights the industry has to offer. This collaboration will assist lenders with quickly and easily obtaining income verification.”</p>Daniel Miller, Freddie Mac Single-Family Director of Strategic Technology Partnerships</blockquote>



<p>MVS can help lenders:&nbsp;</p>



 
 More easily assess borrower capacity/automate income calculations.&nbsp; 



 Reduce frustrations caused by paper submissions and re-asking for documentation to verify assets, income and employment.&nbsp; 



 Remove subjectivity and manual&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/docs/pdf/digital-innovation-drives-loan-quality.pdf">errors in processing and underwriting</a>.&nbsp; 



 Lower risk and probability of fraudulent activity.&nbsp; 



 Increase referrals by providing a better borrower experience.&nbsp; 
 



 Efficient assessment&nbsp; 



<p>AIM leverages consumer-permissioned data from open banking providers like Mastercard to better identify pay deposits using accurate and verifiable data that meets Freddie Mac’s underwriting standards. Lenders can automate the manual processes of assessing borrower assets, income and employment. This can improve the success rates for identifying income and employment by reading information provided on a paystub and verifying income transactions within a borrower’s bank account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Partnering with Mastercard ensures we can deliver the best tools and insights the industry has to offer,” said Daniel Miller, Freddie Mac Single-Family Director of Strategic Technology Partnerships. “This collaboration will assist lenders with quickly and easily obtaining income verification.”&nbsp;</p>



 How it works&nbsp; 



<p>Previously, direct deposits to a consumer’s bank account would qualify for rep and warrant assessment. With enhanced direct deposit and paystub capabilities, a borrower or a loan officer can upload a paystub and the technology will match the data on that paystub with the deposits from the borrower’s asset report, boosting the rep and warranty success rates and income gross-up.</p>



<p>The asset report can include 24 months of direct deposit transactional history and also includes income streams identified by the open banking platform. Now, with the added paystub capability, Mastercard can add a paystub report that can provide greater success assessing income through direct deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paystub report generated through MVS has two sections; the top section includes digitized paystub information. The bottom section is up to 24 months of income stream credit transactions only. These income streams are reconciled with the deposits shown on the asset report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an added bonus, the reduced cost of implementing MVS is reflected directly in the balance sheet. On average,&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/docs/pdf/digital-innovation-drives-loan-quality.pdf">up to 7&nbsp;days</a>&nbsp;can be cut off the processing time for each loan. The hours formerly spent by loan officers chasing down borrower documents are invested in higher-return work activities such as marketing and sales to drive additional loans.&nbsp;The new AIM capability will be available to Freddie&nbsp;Mac-approved Sellers using Loan Product Advisor beginning June 7, 2023.&nbsp;MVS is available via direct integration and ecosystem integrations including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com">ICE Technology</a>&nbsp;and Order Reports Service in the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/client-hub/">Client Hub</a>&nbsp;today. </p>

<p>As organizations and their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> embrace hybrid cloud deployments, they have a rapidly growing number of vendors and workloads in their IT environments. The proliferation of these vendors leads to numerous issues and challenges that overburden IT staff, impede clients’ core business innovations and development, and complicate the support and operation of these environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Couple that with the CIO’s priorities to improve IT environment availability, security and privacy posture, performance, and the TCO, and you now have a challenge that is insurmountable for many clients.&nbsp; In fact, according to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52059">the clients IDC surveyed</a>, 62% reported that multivendor environments caused more downtime issues than a single source. However, capital may not be available for the support renewal of OEM estate, service scope improvements, or the refreshing of end-of-life products.</p>



 What is an integrated data center support strategy? 



<p>Clients following an integrated support strategy engage a trusted advisor to support most, if not all, of the products across the data center. Over the coming years, IT data center solutions will become increasingly sophisticated—further complicating the challenges articulated above. This will require clients to elevate their infrastructure support model from hardware-centric systems to complete workload-enabling solutions, integrating hardware and software in a solution-support model.</p>



<p>Clients following this strategy choose the level of service and tasks that they want their support vendor to handle across the lifecycle of their infrastructure products. That includes the choice between standard or proactive support. Support vendors can also handle services like cross-platform orchestration, management of vendors and IT assets, and availability management (to name a few).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Data center support lifecycle powered by TLS Support Insights.



 The benefits of consolidating support across the data center 



<p>Leveraging IBM for support across the data center provides crucial benefits. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-49246">The Forrester Total Economic Impact of IBM Hybrid IT Support report</a>, commissioned by IBM, demonstrates these benefits based on surveys with 277 of our clients and 5 deep-dive interviews. Let’s look at the benefits and what is driving them:</p>



 
 25% reduction in maintenance and support spending: Consolidation under a single vendor can have significant cost savings for organizations. Often, clients divert budget and resources to other initiatives, including digital transformation and cloud migration. 



 20% reduction in time spent on hardware support tasks: IT staff spend a significant amount of time on day-to-day support tasks, such as managing inventory, troubleshooting, managing incidents, and installing and updating equipment. With IBM’s hybrid IT support, a single point of contact will provide remote and onsite support, parts logistics and billing. The contact will troubleshoot issues and assist with problem resolution. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/support-insights">IBM Support Insights</a>, a cloud-based service that identifies current and potential system issues, delivers risk scores and recommendations for actions to reduce unplanned downtime and avoid service gaps. It provides product-level recommendations for IT systems, devices and software by integrating and analyzing inventory exposure, lifecycle and contract data from multiple IT vendors. 
 



 
 21% reduction in mean time to resolve hardware outages: With a single point of contact for managing incidents and IBM Support Insights to provide a view into potential incidents before they occur, clients with IBM’s hybrid IT support are reducing downtime. The increased accuracy of inventory is also a major factor along with the recommended proactive code updates and patches and the elimination of support gaps. It’s important to note that beyond actually reducing the time to resolve incidents, organizations avoid, on average, seven hardware incidents/outages annually by leveraging IBM for their consolidated data center support strategy. 
 



 
 22% reduction in time spent on vendor relationship management: Having a single point of contact to manage vendor relationships frees up additional time for IT staff.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us on new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity and I’m super happy to bring a former guest back, she is joining for the second time. One reason is that there has been released, super interesting results on her research. Especially in a vast country like Canada.</p>
<p>So, our guest today is Joni Brennan. She is the president of the Digital I.D. and Authentication Council of Canada, DIACC. Building on more than 15 years of experience in identity and access management, innovation adoption and industry standards development. Joni helps the DIACC to fulfil its vision by delivering the resources needed to establish a digital identity ecosystem that accelerates the digital economy, grows Canada’s GDP and benefits all Canadians.</p>
<p>Joni builds diplomatic and impactful relationship and formalises strategic partnerships. She has participated in influential committees from organisations including SCC Data Governance Initiative, OECD, IEEE, OASIS, the ISO, among others.</p>
<p>Hello, Joni.</p>
<p>Joni Brennan: Hello, Oscar. Great to be back.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, welcome back. Super nice having you. So again, we are here to talk about digital identity. Even though some of our listeners might have heard you before, I think four years back. Please tell us about yourself and this journey that you have to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Joni: Well, thank you so much for the invitation. In terms of my personal journey in the world of digital identity, I think it’s been just a bit over 20 years now, working in this space. And really starting in the, and all of this career, in the non-profit sector. Working with private sector and public sector, helping to develop standards and frameworks. Particularly focusing on risk management frameworks now, that help to contextualise the way that standards and open source have been implemented. To help to manage risks and help decision makers and adopters to make better decisions about which kinds of solutions they would like to adopt.</p>
<p>So, it certainly has been a journey moving from classic identity federation and single sign on now to web3 and distributed ecosystems. So, there are some things that have changed, but then there are also some core foundational concepts and thematics that have stayed the same. It’s great to be here to discuss the topics with you today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. As I said, one of the main reasons to discuss is that there is a very interesting report. Actually, I have it here in front of me, it’s the – title; Canadian Digital Identity Research 2022. Of course, I am sure it has taken a few years to gather and process all this information. It is a very nicely designed document and also many of those findings were like, ‘Wow’. Super interesting how things are going in Canada and I’m sure some of these findings will be similar in some other countries as well.</p>
<p>So, we’d like to hear more deeply a few of these findings and what we can learn. If we start telling us some of these key findings from this report.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, thanks so much. I find the research to be interesting as well. The research – we’ve developed four consecutive years now of research, and so the latest report is the data from 2022. So, some things that are interesting about that, as well, is that we began to perform this research; before COVID happened, during COVID, and now arguably, I would say post-COVID or the next phase. So, it’s been interesting to see both kind of how the space is developed and how people’s perceptions have developed over that period of time. </p>
<p>One of the reasons that we’ve done this research is that we found that in the Canadian ecosystem there wasn’t this kind of ‘perspectives research’. We spend a lot of time working together as practitioners, whether we’re working with policy, technology or business processes. We’re often speaking with practitioners that are in the space. So, to have the opportunity to better understand and quantify the perspectives of people, who may not be practitioners. Maybe they do understand the space, maybe a little bit, maybe not so much. So, to have the ability to have a better perspective on what people are thinking, about the work that we’re doing, this is very valuable. And of course, putting people at the centre of the work that we do is a priority. So having these perspectives is quite important.</p>
<p>Because we’ve done this research annually over the course of four years. What we have done as well as we’ve asked some questions each year to have baseline, to have trend lines. To know, how has the perception changed, year over year, over the course of four years? Or maybe that perception has not changed, maybe it’s stayed the same over the course of four years. So, we’ve seen that timeline. That’s been an interesting feature. And then each year we have also customised some of the questions. So that, we could ask the questions of the participants that were, maybe, more specific to what was happening in the world at that time. So, I think it’s a great opportunity to see what people are thinking, both at a point in time and in over time.</p>
<p>Now, how did we perform the research? Well, the research has been developed through a third-party research firm, so they manage the sample, the participation sample. To make sure that it has diversity and that it’s really asking questions to Canadians across our country, from one side to the other. As well as, we have two official languages in Canada, French and English, so as well as making sure both official languages have been consulted. So, we’ve had some regional findings as well, as we’ve gone forward.</p>
<p>With that, maybe I’ll share some of the key findings from the survey.</p>
<p>So, what I would say is that when we started this survey four years ago, this research. We asked people, first of all, do they understand the words ‘digital identity’? And I can say that for the first three years, people did not. Less than half felt that they had somewhat understanding of the words ‘digital identity’. So, without assistance, they could produce a kind of, a definition of digital identity. Now, last year, the fourth year of our research, for the first time, we’ve seen more than 50% feel that they have some understanding of digital identity without being assisted.</p>
<p>So, while the findings, I would say, are arguably low. Meaning less than 50% had some understanding for years, one, two and three. There is a sign that education, and knowledge, and awareness has been growing over each year. Now with just over half understanding. So, it’s a good trend line, meaning that education and awareness has grown. So, I think that’s interesting. It also helps us to know what kind of language we should be using when we’re speaking with people, what they might understand or where more education.</p>
<p>Now, this year we also saw in 2022, we also asked people what was their perception of the impact that digital identity could have on their lives. And I think positive news, the impact more than 55% of respondents felt that digital identity had a positive impact on their lives. And really, this was to manage records, to be able to have electronic boarding passes, things that were really around convenience and doing business anywhere and everywhere. So, this is great news. So, people feel that there is a positive impact, more than half.</p>
<p>Now, that said, 23% do remain unsure about the type of impact that digital identity has on their life. And so now we see that the 23% this is a group that we need to focus on. So, they don’t know if digital identity will help them or if it will harm them. So, there we see – okay, this is a place where we can educate that 23% on; What are the privacy impacts? What are the security impacts regarding digital identity? And how can that improve their lives for the better? So that’s a place to spend some time for education.</p>
<p>Now, the remainder felt that digital identity had a negative impact on their lives. And we do know, of course, people are free to have perceptions, positive, unsure, negative, as they so choose. But we do know as well in the Canadian ecosystem, there has been quite a bit of misinformation and disinformation, mal information. And primarily that type of information is moving in what I would call unauthenticated spaces. So, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, places where information can become viral and sometimes that information isn’t verified. Sometimes it’s being spread by mistake and sometimes it’s being spread with bad intent. So, we know that that’s been a challenge in the Canadian ecosystem and that maybe part of the group that feels a negative impact in their lives.</p>
<p>So, our focus will be on the 23%. To help them to better understand the space so that they can make better decisions about their perception of the type of impact that digital identity can have on their life.</p>
<p>Now, we have also seen, year over year, for four years, we’ve collected some demographic information about the types of people who are responding, and the types of people who are most interested, and feeling the benefits most, and most interested to use digital identity or most interested to also learn more about digital identity. And year over year, the people who are most interested and most looking forward to the benefits that digital identity brings are what we call the caretakers. So, the caretakers tend to be parents who are taking care of children alone or dependents in their home. So, this could also be senior caretakers. Whether they’re in the home or outside of the home. So, these are people who are taking care, really caregiving in all aspects of their life as well as taking care of themselves.</p>
<p>So, these people have the most interest to use digital identity to help to manage their care, so primarily tracking health care records and school and government registrations, for example. These are seen as the primary benefits. And these are the people who are most feeling pressure to manage data, to manage access to data, and really need that extra help, that these types of technologies can provide people. The conveniences and the security that can provide people in their life. These are the people that I think is a great area of focus for the work that we do. Caregivers are also workers. Caregivers are also students. And so, in all aspects of their life, they feel that this is something that can help.</p>
<p>In the Canadian ecosystem as well, we do have some, what I would call paradoxes. Meaning we do also each year, year over year, ask people their willingness to share personal information online if it makes their life more convenient. And what we’ve seen over time is there has been a slight rise in people’s willingness to share their personal information. And so, for example, in 2021, 75% were willing to share information, personal information for convenience. That went up to 78% in 2020 to be willing to share personal information if it meant that they would have more convenience in their lives.</p>
<p>Now, that said, again paradoxically. The same amount of people just around 75% between 73 and 75%, also having the highest concerns about personal information being compromised. So, yes, while people are willing to share information for their convenience. They’re equally concerned about their information being compromised through identity theft or through hacking and through other means. So, we need to be aware that people are both feeling the desire for convenience, but they’re also very concerned along the way.</p>
<p>So, when we think about that 23%, again, who are unsure about digital identity. We can help them to better understand where digital identity can help people to manage their information and get convenience while protecting themselves online. I would say that this is a paradox, but also something that we can help. And we can support by working together with more education.</p>
<p>Now, year over year, for four years, we have also asked people about their preferences regarding the way forward on digital identity. So, what we’ve asked them is basically three options. Would people prefer public sector and private sector to work together on a framework? On an approach, a collaborative approach of public sector and private sector. We’ve also asked them would they prefer government to move alone and take the lead? Or would they prefer private sector to move alone and take the lead?</p>
<p>And I can say that year over year and in fact, we’ve seen growth to 71% of respondents. They believe that collaboration is the best way forward of the public and private sector. And their thoughts on that for why is because they felt that public sector and private sector, by working together, would have more checks and balances on each other. To make sure that each was behaving with the best interests of the client, the customer, the citizen. They really like that collaborative approach, and that’s grown over time up to 71% in the last year.</p>
<p>Now, typically year over year, the people who prefer only government to take the lead or only private sector to take the lead has been a bit of a split. Tends to be around 17% wanting one or the other to go the pathway alone. And in this year, this last year we actually saw a little bit of a change in that research where, for the first time, the preference for public sector was private sector.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of a lower preference this last year for public sector to go alone. So, the finding was 12% prefer the government only to take the lead, with 17% preferring that private sector only take the lead. And I think this is actually – if people have reviewed the Edelman’s Trust Barometer and trust overall as a trend globally in the public. There does seem to be an erosion of trust in large institutions and in new technologies as well, we should say. So, seeing the trust in government a bit lower this last year, I think maps as well with the global trending lines that we’ve seen in the Edelman Trust Barometer research as well. So not entirely surprising and common with what we’ve seen around the world.</p>
<p>Now, unsurprisingly, we’ve also since as we started, we’ve done this research before COVID, during COVID and now post-COVID ecosystem. And while we were in the middle of the pandemic challenges, we asked people if the requirements of the pandemic made people feel that it was more important for them to have access to digital identity that was secure and trusted and privacy enhancing. And people felt absolutely, 66%/67%, over the two years that we asked that question. People thought; Yes, COVID was driving a need for that secure and privacy enhancing digital identity capabilities. So, of course, we think about working from home and social distancing, so people absolutely connected the benefits of digital identity with the things that we were going through at the time.</p>
<p>We also have asked some questions, and I’ll share actually what I think is one of my favourite findings right now. And then we’ll talk a little bit more about some specific capabilities. But I think for me my favourite finding over the last two years has been we asked people ‘do they want to have access to personal information that’s issued and collected about them by public sector and private sector, and do they want the ability to use that information?’ So, we’ve asked that question for two years now, and actually we’ve seen the highest numbers we’ve ever seen on our research over four years regarding this question.</p>
<p>And so, people responded overwhelmingly, 92%, that they want to know and have access to data that’s issued and collected by our federal government and by our provincial or jurisdictional governments in Canada. And so, what this says to me is that – while the words ‘digital identity’ are challenging for people to understand. What exactly does this mean? When we asked people, do they want personal data control and transparency right away without a lot of education, very high number, 92% want to have access control to personal data.</p>
<p>That was followed very closely by 87%. So, they want that same access and control, 87% of data that’s collected by the private sector. So, I think, again, right away, emotionally, people understand personal data control. It’s something they demand no matter what their background, their culture, their politics, their region. Everyone wants to have transparency and control to data about themselves. So, I think that’s just a fantastic finding. And rarely have we ever seen in fact, never have we seen numbers that high in our research.</p>
<p>Now, I share this finding because I think it very much sets up some specific capability finding around digital wallets, something that’s an emerging space. So, whether we’re thinking about the concept of the digital wallet or a trusted container of some sort. Over the last two years, we’ve asked questions specifically about digital wallets, concepts around digital wallet to work. There’s a degree of personal information sharing and personal information control that has to happen. So that’s why I wanted to set that up with that primary finding.</p>
<p>So, over the course of the last two years, we have seen the familiarity of the concept; What is a digital wallet? We’ve seen that rise. And so, the first year that we asked it was 54%. And it’s actually gone up to 59% in the last year of the research. So, people are understanding the concept of the digital wallet. What it is, what it means and why it’s important to them. When we’ve asked people about their use of digital wallets in 2021, we saw around 38% of people reported that they were using some kind of digital wallet and that rose to 41% in 2022, of respondents saying that they were actually using digital wallets.</p>
<p>And so, of those digital wallets, the highest usage recorded was of the Apple wallet. And so, in 2022, roughly a quarter, 24% were using the Apple wallet, with the remainder of the usages on wallets being spread, Samsung Pay was the next highest and then third-party wallet providers after that.</p>
<p>Why are people using digital wallets? They really like contactless payment, less clutter and less concerned about losing their cards, their plastic or physical cards. They feel that these are the benefits of using a digital wallet. So again, the setting up this ecosystem for personal data control. So, whether it’s the type of wallet that we might be familiar with, on the phone or some kind of trusted container or network. This all requires the ability to share information and to have data control. This is something that people are demanding without a lot of education.</p>
<p>So, all in all for the audience, I would say is – be aware that your customers and your clients, they may be challenged to understand, what those words ‘digital identity’ means. They may have different ideas. Among them, what the words ‘digital identity’ means. And so, there’s some education that can be done likely with your audience, and particularly for us, for our ecosystem. Again, we’re focusing on that 23% and really educating them about the privacy and the security protection that can be found, that can be achieved by using digital identity capabilities. And so that’s the place that will focus as we continue to move forward in our ecosystem in Canada.</p>
<p>And I think it’s reasonable to say that it’s probably a similar finding around the world. We might see some differences for countries that are a bit more advanced. But I do think we’re going to find some commonality, in each region around the world. And even within our customers, whether we’re thinking about their personal lives and their personal transactions. Or the way that they manage their data at work or at school. I think these findings are very valuable no matter what the lens or the ecosystem that we’re looking at.</p>
<p>So hopefully the audience will find that information helpful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, quite revealing many of the very useful facts that you have. Just share with us. Actually, one of the first one, the understanding or awareness of the concept itself of digital identity. Is quite revealing that you have evidence that it has grown. So people are understanding more. The concept is getting more familiar.</p>
<p>So, I don’t know how you ask them, but I guess you ask them to elaborate, right? So, you understand – ‘What is digital identity – and people have to elaborate in their own words.</p>
<p>Joni: We just ask them; What do you think digital identity is? So, we ask them to try to produce a definition that the research asked them. And then we measure, were they very confident, were they are able, with their definition, accurate. Or were they not confident and did they need some help? And so, at that point in the research, depending on their ability to answer the question about what they believe digital identity is. There would then be a degree of assistance. If they weren’t sure they’d be provided with a definition, so that they could then move forward in the rest of the research with a common understanding as they answered more questions going forward.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very well done. And the other thing you mentioned one paradox, so people are more willing to use the digital identity solutions, but at the same time, I’m more concerned about the privacy issues or protecting their data. So that’s also very interesting is good in old census because people are using more tools, but at the same time consciousness is increasing.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, I think for me at least, I think that this finding really is part of a call to action to say identity management practitioners who are working together to identify the risks, to mitigate the risks, to provide better solutions for citizens, clients, customers and residents. We really are responsible to move forward together in this space in a way that’s designed around people where benefits, managing their risks and their needs.</p>
<p>Because without the work that we’re doing, they’re going to take part anyway. Maybe they’re going to take pictures of their driver’s license or send me an email. And I know I have you’re not supposed to do this. But sometimes when you need to get what you need to get to on the other side of the transaction, you do what you have to do, right? So, I think we’ve all been there. So, I think this is a call to action for us to continue to work together to provide people with the option so that they can do what they need to do in a safe and secure way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. In Canada, there is a major public sector within Canada, actually there are two tiers of public sector, right? Provincial and the federal government. So, I understand that each of them makes their own solutions, and there is a private sector. So, there are like, let’s say three main developers, the creators of details in these solutions. Have you found solutions that were not properly designed and what was the effect of those?</p>
<p>Joni: In the Canadian ecosystem we do have jurisdictional governments. We have our federal government, which is a collaborative, all of us working together. And then we have provincial governments and territorial governments as well. Then of course as municipalities. So, we have the different layers of the governments and then we have the different private sector industries. And some of those industries are federally regulated like finance, and some are not.</p>
<p>So, what makes that space interesting as well is that when it comes to your legal instantiation for who you are, this is really spread out in Canada. And so, if you’re born in Canada, your legal instantiation for who you are is with your jurisdiction where you were born. If you immigrated to Canada, your legal route of your identity sits with the federal government.</p>
<p>So really the federal government is in fact a very large customer of digital credentials or digital verification. Unless you’ve immigrated. But if you’ve not emigrated like the majority of Canadians, then the federal government is a customer there to know who you are. So there does need to be a collaborative. And I would say that both in the public sector and in the private sector. It’s very important to focus on all of the element’s – trust and risk management, convenience of use. And if solutions are poorly designed, then it leaves people not happy with the experience and not trusting the experience.</p>
<p>So, whether we’re using a solution from public sector or private sector, it’s also very important to do the user testing and the alpha testing and the launch to see how were people experiencing the service? Were they able to produce the information that they needed to produce to take part in this service?</p>
<p>Because that user experience, we only have a small opportunity to create a delightful, secure experience with the people that are using the services. So poor design or in fact, it may be great design from a technical perspective. But without doing that user experience testing and finding that people’s – their emotion and how they felt while they were using the service wasn’t there. That can lead to a low adoption, low trust, and people will feel that and they will sense that and maybe they don’t come back to the solution again. Or maybe they feel, ‘oh, this was terrible’ and they tell other people.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it can’t be stressed enough that as you’re designing, public and private sector, to really work with your small set of users to see; how are they experiencing the solution? In addition to, of course, the priorities. Making sure that it’s safe and secure and using data minimisation. And all of those techniques that we would want to use for privacy and have in service.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes and related to that, and checking now the picture. We can see that they said the majority of Canadians believe that both government and private companies should work together to create a digital I.T framework. And I can see in the three years where this survey has been executed, it keeps growing. That’s the feeling of the public. That the collaboration needs to be strong. So how is that resonating with the ones who create the data services?</p>
<p>Joni: It is an interesting finding, right? And I do think it’s interesting to how people seem to hold the governments a little bit more accountable. The higher percent. So, 91-92%, they want that access to that data. I was in fact surprised that it’s a little bit lower expectation for the private sector. Around 87%, still close but a little bit lower.</p>
<p>And I think what that means is something that we all experience ourselves as well, where one person, no matter what, you know, in our lives, we Oscar is Oscar and Johnny as Johnny. Sometimes our person is work business, school, sometimes we’re a patient with our doctor. So, we have these different experiences within our lives. We are the centre of all of them. Us being at the centre is a priority to making sure that as we move through these different solutions and services, we are the constant. And we can then use data and present data as we’re moving through those contacts of the type of transaction that we’re trying to provide. And so, while let’s say for example, quite often we’re asked to show government issued ID.</p>
<p>Now, we know that we need to be able to authenticate, we need to have a verified identity and we need to be able to authenticate in a verified way to government to say, okay, this is data about us, and we want to use that data. Yes, but quite often we don’t log into government necessarily, maybe every day. Maybe if we’re at a certain phase in our life or a certain time of the year, yes, we do authenticate the government, but more often than not, we’re using that government issued data, that government issued credential to open a bank account or to go onto an aeroplane or check into a hotel.</p>
<p>So, the areas where the data about us that has different levels of verification, whether that’s our driver’s license, which for us is a provincial or territorial credential. Or a passport, which is a federal credential. Or maybe something like a verified address for the bank that we’ve been banking with over the last five or ten years.</p>
<p>Where becomes very interesting is, again, the constant in all of those equations is that there’s one person at the centre of them. And so having that collaborative, it’s very important to bridge the gap to not only are you, as a government, solving the primary use case, that is your most priority. Maybe it’s how do I authenticate the government or you as a bank are solving your use case. How do I authenticate you to access your financial information? Really, people need to traverse across both of those contexts and across many different contexts.</p>
<p>So, collaboration is the way forward and people do get that sense. And as you said that desire for collaboration has really grown over time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay, excellent. So, you are having, say, perceiving that – I’m sure you talk very often with people from all the governments. Plus, people from the private sector then, in the country. So that’s something you are already perceiving.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, absolutely. And of course, each group of stakeholders. If it’s a good government or like finance or credit networks or other. Each group has their priority use cases. And one of the things that we look at in our ecosystem in the DIACC is what are those common use cases we’re most concerned with. Really, where those ecosystems work together. Where we’re using government issued credentials to open a bank account, for example. That’s a great use case because the financial institutions want to lower their Know Your Customer anti-money laundering costs. We bring these types of government credentials into a physical bank all the time. So how can people use those credentials digitally? And how can each party be sure that the right level of risk is managed? And that’s where we focus on DIACC.</p>
<p>So, for us, use cases that centre around Know Your Customer anti-money laundering, they’re very powerful use cases. There is a global framework on Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering, and this is a place where we always see collaboration between public and private sector is an important feature. That’s one of the areas where we see a lot of commonalities, for example. Not the only area, but definitely one of the areas where that commonality exists.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, this research is super fascinating indeed. I will ask you a final question, for all the business leaders that are listening to us now. What is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Joni: I would say that this research should be used as an additive tool. It’s all available. And so, if you’re an English speaker or a French speaker, it’s available in our website, DIACC.ca. I would also say that one of the things that we focus on within the DIACC. Because we are not developing the technical standards or the technical open-source code for the methodology for how to move forward. What we’ve developed is a very high level and prescriptive risk management framework. And so, one of the things that we see in our ecosystem is that; a single solution that is one size fits all doesn’t map to the ecosystem, really. Ecosystems are living things and sometimes there’s more security needed, sometimes less. There are different conditions. </p>
<p>So, I would say for one activity for people, business leaders who are listening today is to; try to evaluate your risk. Maybe you already have. Evaluate the types of risk that you have within your ecosystem. And then look at something like our Pan-Canadian Trust Framework or risk management framework to determine, be sure that you are managing the risks that need to be managed to ensure that there is a duty of care that is set out. How do your customers expect to be cared for? How do your partners expect to be cared for? When they’re interacting with a solution or service. And then make sure you’re mitigating those risks.</p>
<p>We provide one tool, The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework. As a tool to help people measure and make sure that they’re mitigating risks in a verifiable way. And this helps decision makers to then adopt solutions today, while looking forward to knowing where and how these solutions might interact. Should I interact with another ecosystem? Are they managing risk in the same way that I am?</p>
<p>Whereas the technical solution for; Do I need to transform this data model? The software engineers I have all the confidence and the software engineers to solve. How do we transform from one data model to another? And using tools like risk management frameworks, like the pan-Canadian trust framework. Can help you to know, should you be looking at how you interact with different sets of credentials or different solutions or different ecosystems?</p>
<p>So, know your risk, manage your risk. Do your duty to care for your customers, clients, citizens and residents. And the rest of the ecosystem will evolve as it does. And we’ll continue to work together to make sure that people are at the centre. Privacy is enhanced and that people have transparency and control in this evolving and emerging digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent and for our listeners, we’re going to put in the show notes, the links to this research. So you can find it from there, from the show notes. Thanks a lot, Joni, it was a really interesting conversation. So let us know how people can follow this conversation with you or find more information all the work you’re doing.</p>
<p>Joni: Thanks so much, Oscar. Yeah, it’s been a real pleasure. I’m so glad to be back. I really appreciate the work that you’re doing with this podcast, having very interesting and insightful conversations. For people who would like to continue the conversation with us. You can find us at DIACC.ca. That’s our website. And then we do a lot of sharing and conversations in our LinkedIn group. Which you can find us at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mydiacc/">The Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada</a> in our LinkedIn Group, which is quite active.</p>
<p>So, we’d love to connect with you and continue the discussion from today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay. Fantastic. Again, thanks a lot, Joni. All the best.</p>
<p>Joni: Thanks, Oscar.</p>

<p>Fission co-founder and CTO <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a> shares how UCANs simplify authorization while keeping it decentralized and preserving user agency.</p><p>When we think about authorization, an image of a central authority determining what a person is and is not allowed to do comes to mind. In technology, this translates to authorization servers checking a list to see if the person has the correct permissions to access a service.</p><p>Even on the decentralized web, this still occurs. For example, if a user is on a machine that isn't running an IPFS node, or the IPFS node they are trying to access is asleep, the only way they can access the namespace that that IPFS node is managing is to log in through some other mechanism. The same goes for many edge apps or dapps. They create a point of centralization, even in a mostly distributed system.</p><p>But what if we got rid of the authorization server entirely? What if the user acted as their own auth server? Then we would have decentralized auth. This is where UCAN comes in.</p> Capabilities <p>There are two ways to handle authorization - access control lists and capabilities. </p><p>Access Control Lists are designed for when users are sharing a terminal. Think of a shared computer register where each sales associate logs in and out of the machine to tie their transactions to their individual profile. </p><p>Properties:</p>  Stateful Auth - There is a user, a gatekeeper, and a service. The gatekeeper determines if the user can access the service according to the list.  Pro - There are three clear stages in the process.  Con - Neither the user nor the service is in control. They have no agency, and all the data is centralized in one list.  <p>Capabilities are designed for networking.</p><p>Properties:</p>  Stateless Auth - There is a user who has an address (pointer) to the service they are trying to access and a cryptographic token that says that they can access the service.  Pro - The user and service are in control.  Pro - All the required info is in the token. We can make copies of the token, share those copies with others, and revoke access to copies if we choose. Access can also be set to expire after a certain timeframe has elapsed.    UCANs vs DIDs - DID you know UCAN have both? <p>How are UCAN tokens different from DIDs?</p>  DIDs are building blocks inside of UCANs!   DIDs say who you are. They give you a public key, and you can prove you're allowed to sign (AuthN - authentication)  UCANs say what you can do (AuthZ - authorization)   The UCAN Token <p>The UCAN comprises three main components: The JWT Header, the Payload (which includes the issuer / a DID - and proofs / CIDs), and the Signature (which must match the DID in the issuer).</p><p>The proofs demonstrate what capabilities the user has access to. The capabilities include a resource (for example, a path to a document), read or write access, and other extensible fields, like an email address.</p><p>The best part, we can delegate authority without sharing keys, making the process much more secure!</p> What UCAN do with UCANs <p>Authorized Data Retrieval - When you make your files shareable, UCAN ensures no unauthorized users can request them. In other words, unless you have a valid UCAN, you can't download a content address.</p><p>Apps - UCANs are used to delegate write access in <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">WNFS</a>, and WNFS, in turn, is used in many different apps like FxFotos and Fission Drive to manage files.</p><p>Authorized Channels - If you'd like to set up a group chat or gossip with specific peers, you will want a way for folks to prove that they are allowed to be in that channel so they can be admitted. Giving peers a shared capability provides them with that proof. </p><p>Decentralized Compute - We're using UCANs in <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a> to power distributed pipelines and collaborative processes.</p> IPFS Thing 2023 Presentation <p>Watch Brooklyn's full presentation below:</p><p><a href="https://noti.st/expede/Ykh5xH/ucan-decentralize-auth#sSWVwVc">Brooklyn's Presentation Slides</a></p><p>If you'd like to learn more, UCAN visit the <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">GitHub working group</a>, check out the UCAN validator on the <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">community site</a>, or even play a fun <a href="https://ucan.lol/">adventure game</a> to see UCANs in action!</p>

  How Web5 is going to transform parental controls

<p></p><p>Recently on the blog we talked about why<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers"> decentralized identifiers </a>(DIDs) are a practical solution to real problems. <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/practicality-of-decentralized-identifiers">In that post</a> we discussed some high-level concepts behind how and why DIDs could solve many of the identity and data problems we face today, but today let’s dive deep on a specific problem set DIDs could solve: parental controls and minors’ digital security.</p><p>It’s an inescapable reality for parents today that their kids will be online. There’s no avoiding the reality that minors are going to consume a diverse array of content and interact with others on the internet, but parents do want to have a say in what’s put in front of their children. Digital safety is already incorporated by some services - such as Netflix - and platforms - like iOS - but universal parental controls and safety monitoring don’t presently exist. That could change, however, via DIDs and a concept known as DID controllers.</p><p>Before we dive into how DIDs can facilitate universal parental controls, it’s fair to acknowledge that giving adults the ability to have such control over minors may represent a potential risk to those minors’ freedoms. While that is absolutely a valid concern, it’s also true that regardless of DIDs or Web5, as a society we are pushing forward towards a future with more sophisticated parental controls. Federal lawmakers recently <a href="https://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHhYEbJQr-2FOms0-2Budh-2FjizGqQjBZ-2F-2Fr1OqtAW5Vk-2Fh5nDTBbGXewV1rTmTAQ8J-2FnHutGze-2FZdRujL0z-2BT7TPQq2rMPP57Ry7H581UcM0jJNpbmEdo_JY5fc7bPIFJAvDYWnO7d4p-2FX8FAV-2BsZ9F4kAeTjyMnD-2BG0K2bZ0-2FUf-2BuopiaAntAAkVBHDuQJAFvEBGYqFHT51-2FSOTDJz-2B8jhQIBwTwwfjU6PpsWQkmsRZ-2FHGMwJynKK9gXf8AtDP1YE6sEYYtMtmmDlG6CvQMea0rUNVpY-2FTuOKnGNSHlL9NK2Jk0q4-2FRpQ-2BbFtdlnhiQK67JNVXPiMBWqgHoT-2FNCfxxr-2F4bbdre3UHJXnBVp4xhgpxhidBEbUjonDeOsX9WuX1m9sAXLuuDylpr6dFaUbCX7V9cjRoJcnvuSBxBCwsyz0eXjWABCQjrAy9oqfdT13fwQv3bIrZGwi4hMa7GsMULwMU-2BKacfPI2kJLSHpJVUvTj0CZluT9SEPpZc9wYkLrSqv2BgqnbOZJ7IEA2ZR7oNF91e94HvIaC4j-2BaatuJDdofN1Qyqph57vfWyKDAUWfEKruDuKv7ecdo-2BsRt4-2B7nt9ljpyuTRmSS458UlBFpp4g2s9qHyc0FXVVo4C3KZLpSWPmsT58L-2BObuk46zQ4wSPr-2B7SqxnCCx-2BoK4Ttt0AhCjjxnitNriSjzZgupScdseXH00RSO3rOmi1G295urhUXfGvnevAqZh2CKf-2F3fPEn5uA9-2BNDOSVhZB-2BUEqZmRd8ND43TkEmHRQ-3D-3D">introduced</a> a bipartisan bill that seeks to establish a national minimum age for posting on social media, signaling this direction in public policy. The “Protecting Kids on Social Media Act'' would ban platforms like TikTok, Snap, and Instagram from letting kids younger than 13 create accounts — and require platforms to get parental consent to open accounts for users under 18. </p><p>With things like government-run age verification and limitations on tracking minors, it’s very clear that minors will experience restrictions and the infrastructure to enforce those restrictions is coming. In this post, we’ll cover how Web5 could provide the implementation of that system.</p> DID Controllers and the Controller Paradigm<a title="Direct link to DID Controllers and the Controller Paradigm">​</a> <p>Every DID is a string representation of an entity - the subject - that is described by a DID document enumerating things like cryptographic public keys and delegate/controller patterns. Those patterns allow for another DID, the controller, to make changes to the DID document. So what does this all mean for parents?</p><p>Minors are constantly interacting with new digital and physical services that carry age restrictions or limitations. For example, it’s generally viewed as a good thing when platforms censor certain content from being viewable to those under 18. While these types of constraints are generally tied to age and state-issued licenses, those forms of identification can be forged and circumvented and offer no entry point for parents to intervene. A DID controller model, however, allows for parents to intervene at an identity level to place appropriate restrictions on their children.</p> Parents of a DID Child: A Case Study<a title="Direct link to Parents of a DID Child: A Case Study">​</a> <p>Imagine Alice and Bob welcome their new daughter Carol into the world, and at birth she’s assigned a DID over which Alice and Bob are made controllers. Immediately, whenever anyone tries to resolve Carol’s DID and obtain her DID document, they’ll see that Alice and Bob’s DIDs are controllers over her DID. As Alice and Bob check their daughter out of the hospital, there’ll be a million pieces of paperwork to fill, but proving their identity will be easy so long as they provide proof that they own the DIDs that are controllers over Carol’s DID.</p><p>As Carol starts to take her first steps, Alice and Bob enroll her in daycare. Wanting to be certain only Alice, Bob, and their parents can pick up Carol from daycare, Alice and Bob edit Carol’s DID document to ensure that the “daycare” or “supervision” <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/protocols">protocol</a> only allows for Carol to be picked up by the specified DID-holders.</p><p>With Carol growing older, she may begin to want to explore more shows and media than the educational programs her parents put on for her. Alice and Bob may want to allow Carol to explore the internet on her own a bit, so they give her access while restricting her usage. For now, she’s only allowed to visit YouTube with some strict parental filters they’ve set at her DID-level, so that even when they graduate her to more websites she does not accidentally stumble onto content they don’t want her seeing. Additionally, because they’re controlling her DID and not just her account on a single service, any service that accepts that DID and communicates over the protocols that they’ve specified will honor the restrictions they’ve placed on their daughter. For example, let’s say Alice and Bob want to always restrict videos that contain violence from being viewable by Carol, and do so by specifying that videos with violence should be blocked according to a universal video content moderation protocol. Then, all content platforms that respect the universal video content moderation protocol should automatically block that content!</p><p>With her teenage years coming on, Carol may be tempted to stay up late and message her friends, but mom and dad know that Carol needs her sleep. Bob and Alice could, as controllers, restrict her access to her texts after 10pm with the exception of a few critical family members.</p><p>Finally, when Carol does age out of her parents’ home, they can relinquish their controllership or even set it to expire at a given date. This parental use case is perfect for Web5 as it showcases how open, universal protocols, a decentralized web, and DID controllership enable improved and seamless experiences over our currently fractured, standardless web.</p><p>If all of this sounds interesting to you, join us in building Web5 by checking out our <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub</a>, including our growing <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/">web5.js SDK</a>, where you can find and collaborate on the tools we’re creating to build the next web.</p>

  MiCA aims to regulate crypto, but its stand on DeFi remains&nbsp;unclear.  “Compliant DeFi” is becoming a topic on the rise while user security becomes a priority.  The regulatory applicability of MiCA varies based on the degree of decentralization in DeFi services.  <p>Markets in Crypto Assets, which is popularly known as MiCA, came as a proposal from the European Commission on 24th September 2020 with an objective to bring crypto-asset issuers and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under one regulatory framework. After significant deliberation and consultation between EU member states, it has been finally voted to enter into force as of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>On 16th May 2023, the council introduced an EU-level legal framework by adopting a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/05/16/digital-finance-council-adopts-new-rules-on-markets-in-crypto-assets-mica/">regulation</a> on Markets in Crypto Assets. The new rules covered utility token issuers and the issuers of asset-referenced tokens and “stablecoins.” Additionally, it took trading venue providers and crypto-asset wallets under its ambit. However, no specific mention of the DeFi crypto-assets.</p><p>The EU-wide regulatory framework that MiCA aims to introduce as of next year is rather broad in its scope and requires a rather thorough understanding.</p> Crypto-Assets and Businesses Covered by&nbsp;MiCA <p>In assets, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">MiCA</a> applies to asset-referenced tokens, including commodity-backed or currency-backed stablecoins, e-money tokens, and other tokens, including utility ones. E-money tokens are usually stablecoins backed by a single fiat currency, while utility tokens include protocol tokens, access tokens, loyalty tokens, and community tokens.</p><p>In businesses, MiCA applies to crypto asset service providers who deal in custodial wallets, exchanges, crypto-asset advising firms, and crypto-portfolio management agencies or managers involved&nbsp;therein.</p><p>A custodial wallet is a virtual asset wallet that stores both the users’ assets and private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>MiCA might also apply to NFTs if the NFT — by its founding nature — is similar to the asset types that MiCA covers. Many NFTs serve as utility tokens or financial instruments at their core. MiCA might also consider large-series NFTs to be fungible and ask for authorization.</p> Crypto-Assets and Businesses Not Covered by&nbsp;MiCA <p>In May 2023, a document came into public titled “Remaining Regulatory Challenges in Digital Finance and Crypto-Assets after&nbsp;MiCA.”</p><p>As requested by the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), the document said that, in principle, MiCA applied where the overall financial services regulation did not apply. It led to the non-applicability of MiCA to crypto-assets that qualified as financial instruments and were regulated by other EU financial law instruments. Such assets include security tokens or electronic money (excluding e-money&nbsp;tokens).</p><p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/740083/IPOL_STU(2023)740083_EN.pdf">ECON document</a> also highlighted that “partially decentralized” finance services came under MiCA’s scope, while “fully decentralized platforms” that acted without intermediaries fell outside the scope of&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>However, the ECON document could not yet decide how to deal with gaps where solutions like DeFi came under conditional supervision. And it is where the need arises for a deeper understanding of MiCA’s intricate relationship with DeFi solutions and instruments.</p> DeFi and MiCA: An Intricate Relationship <p>Whether MiCA is fit to regulate DeFi is a contested topic. DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is not a legal or technical term.</p><p>According to researchers, Decentralized Finance may include multiple elements of multiple tenets, including decentralization, distributed ledger technology, smart contracts, disintermediation, and open&nbsp;banking.</p><p>Decentralization is seen as a countermodel to traditional finance, where power centralized in the hands of a few powerful intermediaries would be replaced by technology.</p><p>However, whether DeFi comes fully under the ambit of MiCA is a function of the decentralization status of the DeFi solution.</p> Compliant DeFi: A Notable Development <p>As discussions about the intersection of DeFi and regulation unfold, the notion of “Compliant DeFi” has garnered increasing attention. This term refers to DeFi systems designed with regulatory considerations in mind, aligning decentralized protocols with existing legal frameworks.</p><p>While the essence of DeFi rests on decentralization and democratization, it doesn’t inherently resist regulatory structures. The objective remains to construct an equitable and accessible financial system. For some, this mission could involve adopting regulatory measures to safeguard participants and uphold the integrity of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>In the context of Compliant DeFi, protocols might integrate mechanisms to align with guidelines related to Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, and other regulatory criteria, while upholding the decentralized nature of blockchain-based systems.</p><p>It’s crucial to note that the emergence of Compliant DeFi doesn’t mandate a particular direction for the evolution of DeFi. It represents a trend, not a dictate. It is one of the diverse paths that DeFi innovation might take, combining traditional financial safety measures with DeFi principles.</p><p>However, the broader DeFi ecosystem continues to explore a variety of solutions, each with unique perspectives on the intricate balance between decentralization, democratization, and regulatory compliance.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/compliant-defi-the-way-out-of-commingling-clean-and-illicit-funds-in-a-decentralized-finance-economy">Compliant DeFi — the way out of Commingling Clean and Illicit Funds in a Decentralized Finance&nbsp;Economy</a></p> Fully or Partially Decentralized: That is the&nbsp;Question <p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/740083/IPOL_STU(2023)740083_EN.pdf">ECON document</a>, which is the latest to come out from the most appropriate authorities in this regard, explains the current situation by saying that “partially decentralized services are in scope of MiCA, while MiCA exempts (only) fully decentralized services in crypto&nbsp;assets.”</p><p>Afterward, it points towards an anomaly, where legal entities claim themselves to be fully decentralized to avoid transaction risks but “develop and maintain, directly or indirectly, the platform and market its services.” However, the legal entity continues to serve as an “infrastructure provider and sales intermediary.”</p><p>In this regard, the ECON document analysis poses a crucial question, “is this intermediary function sufficient to apply&nbsp;MiCA?”</p> Is the Rationale Driving Regulatory Leniency for “Fully Decentralized Services” Adequate? <p>There are ‘fully decentralized’ lending platforms that create an asset pool from various users prior to lending. It could be seen as liquidity centralization, similar to what a trad-fi institution — such as a bank — does.</p><p>Fully decentralized platforms also see a concentration of influence at a governance level. While studies point towards evidence of developers and founders retaining control over their protocols after the Initial Token Offering, there are developers who receive compensation for their stack development and maintenance efforts.</p><p>Keeping these inconsistencies in mind, the ECON document advocated for “including fully decentralized platforms in the scope of EU financial regulation and harmonizing thresholds across EU financial, legislative acts.”</p> Regulatory Challenges of Decentralization <p>Be it partial decentralization or full, intensified decentralization, some challenges exist.</p><p>Concepts related to private ordering must possess legal certainty. These include concepts pertaining to property rights, title-based asset separation, segregation, tracing, and lawsuits. The current EU financial regulations also lack legal certainty in these&nbsp;aspects.</p><p>There is also a lack of clarity concerning the functioning and governance of crypto ecosystems. The final barrier arises in the form of cross-border enforcement and supervisory cooperation issues.</p> The Road&nbsp;Ahead <p>Effectively incorporating decentralized services into the MiCA regulatory framework necessitates a thorough understanding of the intricate concept of decentralization.</p><p>Given the diversity and novelty inherent in fields like decentralized finance, it is crucial to comprehend the associated risks.</p><p>A risk-based approach, focusing on mitigating potential harm to users, is more productive than an approach merely targeting the nature of the service. Whether platforms are partially or fully decentralized, risks associated with technological incompetence could emerge. Accordingly, regulation should address root causes rather than merely managing the symptoms or outcomes.</p><p>Various risks may arise depending on the level of decentralization. These could include issues related to leverage in crypto lending or crypto staking and risks that AML/CFT provisions must mitigate.</p><p>Consequently, it would be both prudent and efficient to focus less on the degree of centralization in a DeFi solution and more on identifying and eliminating risks at their&nbsp;source.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Data is the lifeblood of successful organizations. Beyond the traditional data roles—data engineers, analysts, architects—decision-makers across an organization need flexible, self-service access to data-driven insights accelerated by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). From marketing to HR, finance to supply chain and more, decision-makers can use these insights to improve decision-making and productivity enterprise-wide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But most businesses are behind. Essential data is not being captured or analyzed—an <a href="https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/our-story/rethink-data/files/Rethink_Data_Report_2020.pdf">IDC report</a> estimates that up to 68% of business data goes unleveraged—and estimates that only 15% of employees in an organization use business intelligence (BI) software. Companies with a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/journey-to-ai/2022/06/deliver-on-your-data-strategy-with-a-data-fabric/">modern data architecture</a> and robust BI adoption not only gain immediate competitive advantage, they are positioned to move even further ahead by adopting <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/the-data-differentiator/data-strategy">real-time decisioning</a> practices and predictive analytics, the next steps in digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Providing trusted, self-service BI access to a broader range of stakeholders is predicated on three important factors. First, the underlying data must be <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/protect-against-model-drift-and-bias-to-ensure-your-ai-is-accurate-explainable-and-governed-on-any-cloud/">sound and unbiased</a>, and managed according to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/a-step-by-step-guide-to-setting-up-a-data-governance-program/">clear governance standards</a> that ensure it is secure, private, accurate and usable. Second, any AI models that inform decision-making and forecasting must be <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/guides/predict/trustworthy-ai/">explainable and transparent</a>. Lastly, the BI system must connect to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-intelligence">wide variety of data systems</a> across business functions and be usable by those who are not professional data analysts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is an EU law regulating electronic payment services within EU states and the European Economic Area (EEA). </p>
<p>As economic ties between the EU member states become more binding, it is important that citizens and businesses in these regions have laws to help streamline banking, eCommerce, and security. </p>
 The Evolution of PSD2 and Financial Security Regulations in the EU 
<p>Developed in 2018, this regulation was intended to streamline payment security and tech development throughout the regulated area. </p>
<p>PSD2 compliance follows its predecessor, the First Payment Services Directive (PSD1). PSD1, adopted in 2007, established modern rules applicable to all payment services in the EU. The goal was to make cross-border payments standardized and simplified without sacrificing security.</p>
<p>PSD1 was a step in the right direction but had several limitations. It did not cover all payment services or implement effective customer authentication or identity verification methods. The development of PSD2 introduced new consumer protections and promoted innovation in security and the open banking movement.</p>
<p>Some of the key parts of PSD2 compliance include:</p>
 
 Open Banking: Under PSD2, banks must provide access to open APIs so that third-party banking providers (TPPs) can build additional financial services on top of that infrastructure.  
 Third-Party Providers (TPPs): Speaking of TPPs, PSD2 introduces new types of regulated service providers that can manage payments or mediate interactions between cardholders and payment processors.  
 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA): PSD2 also introduces more rigorous requirements for customer authentication during electronic transactions. This process is known as Strong Customer Authentication, which generally requires at least two independent authentication elements from the customer. 
 Increased Consumer Rights: PSD2 also enhances consumer rights in several areas, including reducing liability for non-authorized payments, introducing an unconditional refund right for direct debits in euros, and banning card surcharges. 
 
 Who Has to Follow PSD2? 
<p>PSD2 compliance applies to various organizations, including traditional banks, credit institutions, electronic money institutions, payment institutions, and certain fintech companies. The directive introduces rigorous requirements for these organizations, such as enhanced customer authentication measures and the need to open access to customer account data for third-party providers (with the customer’s consent).</p>
<p>Some of these organizations include:</p>
 
 Banks and Credit Institutions: Traditional banks and credit institutions must comply with PSD2 regulations. This includes providing access to account information and payment initiation services to third-party providers (TPPs) where the customer has given explicit consent. 
 Payment Institutions: This refers to institutions that have been granted permission to provide payment services but which are not necessarily banks. These institutions might offer services such as money remittance, execution of payment transactions, and issuing/acquiring payment instruments. These include TPPS, Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) and Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs).  
 Card Issuing and Acquiring Institutions: Organizations that issue debit or credit cards to consumers or process payments for merchants must also comply with the PSD2 regulations. 
 Other Financial Institutions: Other institutions involved in the processing or receipt of payments, including money transfer operators and certain types of mobile network operators, may also have to comply with the directive. 
 
 What Can Happen When You Don’t Comply with PSD2? 
<p>PSD2 compliance is mandatory for all applicable entities operating within the EEA, marked into law by the EU and participating countries. Organizations that fail to comply with the PSD2 risk financial penalties of up to 4% of annual returns.</p>
<p>Note that PSD2 applies to transactions where both the payer’s and payee’s service providers are located within the EEA using EU currency. </p>
 How Can Organizations Meet PSD2 Requirements? 
<p>Meeting PSD2 requirements often involves significant changes to an organization’s operations, technology, and business model if they still need to be prepared to implement secure payment technologies. </p>
<p>There are a few key areas where organizations can focus their efforts to maintain PSD2 compliance:</p>
 
 <a>Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)</a>: SCA requires that authentication use two independent factors related to MFA verification: something the customer knows, something the user has, and something the user is.  
 Open APIs: Banks and other financial institutions must provide access to their customer’s accounts via open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to allow third-party providers (TPPs) to develop new services. These APIs must enable TPPs to retrieve account information (if the customer consents) and initiate payments directly from the customer’s account. 
 Transparency and Communication: Organizations need to provide clear information about all transactions, ensuring complete transparency with the customer about any applicable fees, charges, and the timeframe for transactions. This includes information related to incidents of fraud. 
 Data Security and Privacy: Organizations must protect data confidentiality and integrity, including implementing rigorous data security measures and ensuring PSD2 compliance with other applicable laws and regulations, such as GDPR. 
 Registration and Licensing: Certain organizations, such as PISPs and AISPs, must register with their national financial regulator and may need a license to operate. 
 Fraud Monitoring and Reporting: PSD2 requires service providers to establish a framework for the monitoring and reporting fraudulent transactions. 
 
<p>It’s also worth noting that EU member states may have slightly different laws, requiring different applications based on the jurisdiction.</p>

 In recent years, soft mobility has seen explosive growth, particularly in major cities as a means of urban transport. Whether it’s electric bikes, scooters or self-service electric scooters, micromobility is seen as an environmentally-friendly and practical alternative to traditional modes of transport. However, the way it is regulated is being called into question. Some countries now require age verification of users for greater safety. 



 The future belongs to soft mobility. 



<p>Walking, cycling and even electric scooters are increasingly popular means of transport in major cities, and are referred to as “soft mobility” or “active mobility.” Why is this so? Soft mobility is seen as a solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion and promoting health and well-being.</p>



<p>Many cities around the world are turning to soft mobility or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">shared mobility</a> to meet these challenges. Dedicated self-service vehicles have appeared in urban centers in recent years. Governments and companies are also encouraging this transition to more sustainable modes of transport by offering tax incentives, subsidies and user benefits.</p>



<p>Although people are increasingly turning to these modes of transport and services are improving all the time, there are still challenges to be overcome if soft mobility is to become widespread.</p>



 What are the challenges for soft mobility? The example of electric scooters in Paris. 



<p>One of the main challenges facing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">shared mobility is safety</a>. Users of these modes of transport are more vulnerable to road accidents, particularly in urban areas with heavy traffic. Cyclists and users of electric scooters are often confronted with obstacles, so it is crucial to regulate the use of these services. For example, by ensuring that a user is not too young to hire an electric mode of transport, or that they <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">actually have a driver’s license</a> to use a scooter.</p>



<p>The laws and regulations governing the use of micromobility services vary considerably from one country to another, and even from one town to another. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/parisians-vote-on-banning-e-scooters-from-french-capital">Scooter use in Paris</a> is a concrete example of how the lack of clear regulation can undermine the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/micromobility-and-the-future-of-transportation/">future of micromobility</a>. Since the arrival of self-service electric scooter operators in the city, streets have become more congested, raising safety concerns for pedestrians and other road users. In response to these challenges, municipalities have introduced stricter rules for operators, including limits on the number of scooters available and parking requirements. However, it is not certain that this will be enough.</p>



 
   
     
                     The state of micromobility regulations in 2023 
                     Industry leaders debate the current regulatory framework for micromobility and the best ways of balancing safety with innovation and accessibility. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/state-of-micromobility-regulations-in-2023/">Watch now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


 Age verification: what do European regulations say about the use of electric scooters and bicycles? 



<p>There are currently no specific EU regulations for micromobility. However, the European Commission is encouraging coordination between Member States to develop harmonized rules and ensure responsible use of these modes of transport. Some countries have already adopted specific national regulations for micromobility, while others have incorporated these modes of transport into their existing legislation on motor vehicles.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F35470/0_0?idFicheParent=F308&amp;lang=en#0_0">France and Belgium adopted specific regulations in 2019</a> to govern the use of self-service electric scooters. These include speed and age limits for users, as well as insurance and parking requirements. It stipulates that <a href="https://www.connexionfrance.com/article/French-news/France-raises-minimum-age-for-using-an-electric-scooter">users must be at least 14 years old to use a service</a>. Spain subsequently applied the same framework in 2020.</p>



<p>Although electric scooters are considered to be motorized vehicles in many European countries, in the same way as cars and motorbikes, it is not currently necessary to have a driver’s license. Only an identity document may be required to ensure that the user is of legal age to use the service. However, with the ever-increasing number of accidents and non-compliance with parking regulations, it is conceivable that the rules will eventually be tightened.</p>



 What resources should be put in place to provide a better framework for soft mobility services? 



<p>To rent a scooter or electric bike in Marseille, you will now need to scan your identity card and perform facial recognition. The ID card will be linked to the credit card used on the user’s account, thereby helping to combat credit card fraud and provide a better framework for the use of these services. If users are easily identifiable, they will be less inclined to break the parking rules (e.g. don’t use sidewalks, don’t leave your scooter in a red zone, etc.).</p>



<p>Remote identity verification is increasingly seen as an effective solution for supervising micromobility services, but also for ensuring the safety of users by reducing dangerous behavior such as drinking and driving or speeding. By having information on users, operators can inform the authorities in the event of an offense.</p>



<p>In the long term, it is conceivable that a driver’s license could be required as a supporting document when subscribing to a micromobility service, as is currently the case for car-sharing or car-pooling services. Operators need to be on the lookout for new regulations and ensure that their services are compliant and safe for their users.</p>

			<p>June 6th, Luxembourg – <a href="https://defactorlabs.com/">Defactor Labs</a>, a trailblazing DeFi lending platform for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), proudly announces the launch of tokenizing $100 million worth of Alpha Bonds, using the ERC3643 token standard to enforce compliance on the Polygon Network, to lend capital to SMEs using real-world assets (e.g., receivables) as collateral.</p>

			<p>SMEs are often subject to the same stringent lending criteria as large corporations by traditional banks. This can impede their ability to secure funding, limit their potential for growth, and hinder their competitiveness. Defactor Labs aims to address these challenges via tokenized Alpha Bonds to bridge the $1.5 trillion USD global funding gap to ultimately better cater to SMEs’ funding needs worldwide.</p>
<p>In traditional investment practices of bonds, the transparency surrounding traditional bond instruments has often been obscured, accompanied by lengthy settlement cycles and cumbersome manual processes. On the contrary, the Alpha Bonds create unparalleled transparency, efficiency, and instant settlement through tokenization. Moreover, the Alpha Bonds are compliantly distributed to a global network of audiences to allow eligible investors to digitally subscribe and purchase these digital bonds with an e-commerce-like experience that leverages the benefits of tokenization.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the secondary trading of Alpha Bonds is enabled due to them being issued on the ERC3643 standard. With ERC3643, the compliance rules are embedded into the digital securities, where investors have the opportunity to achieve liquidity by trading their Alpha Bonds with eligible counterparties without a middleman — a possibility that has historically been unattainable. This increased liquidity further strengthens the appeal and viability of these innovative investment instruments.</p>
<p>Defactor Labs, in collaboration with <a href="https://cms.law/">CMS</a>, a globally renowned law firm with 78 offices across 40 countries, have chosen Luxembourg as the jurisdiction to issue the digital bonds. While CMS provides legal guidelines and documentation, <a href="https://blackmanta.capital/">Black Manta Capital Partners</a> provides a BaFin broker-dealer license and marketplace, powered by <a href="http://tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>‘s ERC3643-based tokenization engine for Defactor Labs. These partnerships streamlined the launch of the Alpha Bonds to allow Defactor Labs to focus on their core businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, the effectiveness of the Alpha Bonds has already been proven through their pilot projects. These projects have already facilitated $30 million in transactions and successfully financed $2M in the past three months, emphasizing the practical viability and reliability of their approach, with no defaults recorded.</p>

		 
	 
    Launching Alpha Bonds is a monumental milestone for not only us at Defactor but for the worldwide network of SMEs. Our goal has always been to create a truly inclusive global economy with access to liquidity for all. With this partnership with Tokeny and Black Manta Capital Partners, they are the missing pieces we needed to ultimately fulfill our goal. We are excited to officially launch Alpha Bonds and allow investors to earn a return, while at the same time helping SMEs to grow around the world.  Alejandro GutierrezCEO and Co-Founder of Defactor Labs       Tokeny, as the technology partner of Defactor Labs, is excited to contribute to bridge traditional finance to DeFi through the launch of 'Alpha Bonds'. By leveraging the ERC3643 standard to tokenize $100 million worth of bonds, Defactor Labs aims to not only allow institutional investors to compliantly access DeFi, but also provide them with liquidity options in an open network thanks to ERC3643 protocol’s on-chain compliance nature.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny       Traditional finance is in a constant state of transformation, and we at Black Manta Capital Partners believe that an important part of the financial market will be permissioned decentralized finance. The ‘Alpha Bonds’ project, as Europe’s first institutional grade DeFi product, lays the foundation for bringing real world assets into the DeFi space, and we are delighted to be working with Defactor Labs and Tokeny to bring this innovative product to market.

<p>New services and checks for use cases regulated by the FCA and UKGC</p>



<p>Munich, June 6, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, announces the expansion of its platform to include fully automated document liveness capabilities, data checks and Financial Risk Checks as well as new fraud prevention features. The platform expansion will also include a central, no-code workflow management tool.</p>



<p>Document liveness checks to combat the most sophisticated fraud attempts</p>



<p>The automated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">document liveness check</a> relies on IDnow’s expertise in video analysis and requires the end user to record a video of their ID document, thus enabling an automated check on the visible security elements of the document, such as holograms. This feature helps companies in their fight against the rising risk of fraud through forged documents.</p>



<p>Fully automated KYC and AML services with data checks</p>



<p>IDnow’s new fully automated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) services, the latter of which screen against multiple global <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> and Sanction lists, ensure real-time AML compliance at the onboarding stage while allowing ongoing&nbsp;monitoring to confirm compliance post-onboarding.​ Fintechs, crypto providers and more traditional financial service providers can benefit from a complete alert management functionality and audit history&nbsp;with tailored alert matching.</p>



<p>The new data checks enable a frictionless KYC process&nbsp;which takes just a&nbsp;few&nbsp;seconds, particularly&nbsp;for&nbsp;use cases regulated by the UK’s&nbsp;Financial Conduct Authority (<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">FCA</a>) or by the UK Gaming Commission (<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/">UKGC</a>). However, they also add&nbsp;an additional layer of security&nbsp;to protect businesses around less regulated use cases, for example, in the mobility industry.</p>



<p>Additionally, the latest platform expansion also includes Financial Risk Checks that use public third-party and self-declared data.&nbsp;These provide gambling companies with insight into affordability indicators which protect online gamblers and comply with the latest updates to the UK Gambling Act, helping businesses to avoid potential fines and reputational damage. The public and third-party data allows for ongoing monitoring of changes in player circumstances and verification of reported income without the need for additional documentation.</p>



<p>A single platform to access data sources and orchestrate KYC workflows in real-time</p>



<p>These new data check capabilities are added to IDnow’s single platform, thus allowing customers to orchestrate both data checks and document- and biometric-based identity proofing workflows. Data checks are required by the responsible regulatory bodies, document and biometric checks can be added for other sensitive use cases for an extra layer of security.</p>



<p>The AML services and real-time data checks are easily configurable via the online self-service orchestration portal which offers complete control to IDnow’s customers. It lets them tailor and optimise data checks and document-based identity verification in one intuitive dashboard via drag-and-drop functionality, thus providing a single entry point for all the new integrated services.</p>



<p>Proprietary fraud prevention technology and a high level of compliance</p>



<p>To detect single and serial fraud attempts, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">IDnow’s platform</a> uses proprietary fraud prevention technology that collects risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources. In addition, IDnow regularly collaborates with law enforcement agencies, providing the company’s dedicated fraud team with the latest knowledge of fraud techniques and methods from around the world.</p>



<p>Bertrand Bouteloup, Chief Commercial Officer at IDnow, said: “With the help of our AI-powered engine, which employs the latest fraud prevention capabilities, we can combat the most advanced fraudsters and allow our crypto, fintech and financial customers to grow their businesses with confidence and be a strong partner for large financial institutions at the same time. Our document liveness feature is clearly a game changer in this market.”</p>



<p>“We are pleased to be able to enhance our platform offering, specifically in the UK, to help our customers fight fraud, achieve compliance and build trust across Europe and beyond. Thanks to these new functionalities and our strong regulatory expertise, our customers can easily expand their services and rely on a&nbsp;platform that achieves&nbsp;compliance according to the&nbsp;most rigid regulatory&nbsp;requirements within the UK, the EU and beyond.”</p>

  <p>Supporting developers is my modus operandi. I’ve been with Okta for three years, formerly as a Developer Support Engineer and now as a Developer Advocate.</p>

<p>Before joining Okta, I graduated from Hackbright Academy, an all-women boot camp based in San Francisco. I learned to think like a programmer through coding in Python and Javascript. My full-stack capstone project was a web application that tracked sugar intake, inspired by the community health service volunteer work I had done with AmeriCorps, San Francisco.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As a Developer Support Engineer, I supported admins, developers, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), and partners as they integrated with Okta workforce products. These integrations include OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0, External IDPs, Social IDPs, SCIM, OIN App Submission, Okta SDKs, Okta Sign-in Widget, Token Inline Hooks, and Terraform. I formed alliances with Customer Success Managers, Product Teams, Engineering, and Solutions Engineers and Architects in this role.</p>

<p>In support, I enjoyed listening to and interacting with developers through problem-solving cases. I was often curious about how they ended up in interesting situations; this then gave me some insight into where Okta could improve. I extended the conversation by gathering feedback, and this is precisely what dev advocates do! I’m especially looking forward to applying my experience in support to help developers avoid common problems entirely.</p>

<p>Lately, I have been thinking about my “ikigai” - a Japanese concept/way of life which translates to “a reason for being.” Ikagai names the overlap between what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. Although working in support offered some of these qualities, transitioning to Developer Advocacy allows me to do more of what I love: building a strong sense of community with developers and helping them achieve a goal while learning something new. I’m genuinely grateful for the opportunity and my past and current teams, who have supported my career journey thus far.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>I’m excited to put my creativity to work to advocate for developers and build community with my favorite programming language, Python. And with that, I am reminded of a principle set forth by Zen of Python:</p>

  <p>“Now is better than never.”</p>

<p>I can’t wait to co-create, collaborate, and slay code dragons with you! Connect with me via my social media platforms and let me know how I can advocate for you!</p>

   The work order management process shows how a work order will move through the maintenance process, from task identification to post-completion analysis. 
 The post 7 steps for managing the work order process appeared first on IBM Blog.

<p>Work orders are the driving force behind any organization’s asset management apparatus. Whenever a person or entity submits a service request, the maintenance team that receives it must create a formal paper and/or digital document that includes all the details of maintenance tasks and outlines a process for completing the tasks. That document is called a work order.</p>



<p>The primary purpose of a work order is to keep everyone within the maintenance operation abreast of the workflow, which ultimately helps the organization organize, communicate and track maintenance work more efficiently.</p>



 Managing the work order process 



<p>The work order management process describes how a work order will move through the maintenance process, starting with maintenance task identification and wrapping up with post-completion analysis.</p>



 Phase 1: Task identification 



<p>In the first phase of the process, a person or organization identifies the tasks that the maintenance staff needs to complete. The tasks will also help the recipient determine whether the maintenance tasks qualify as planned maintenance (wherein the jobs will be easily identifiable ahead of time) or unplanned maintenance (where the scope and specifics of the job will require an initial assessment). &nbsp;</p>



 Phase 2: Work request submission 



<p>Once the initiating party identifies the maintenance issues, they should lay out the details in a maintenance request form and submit it to maintenance for review and approval. Work requests can arise from any number of circumstances—from tenant requests to preventative maintenance audits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Phase 3: Work request evaluation 



<p>The maintenance department (or maintenance team) is responsible for evaluating work requests once they are submitted. Ideally, the department will review the details of the work request to determine the feasibility of the work and then determine personnel and resource needs. If approved, the work order request is converted to a work order.</p>



 Phase 4: Work order creation 



<p>Once the maintenance team or supervisor approves the work request and allocates the materials, equipment and staff they need to complete the jobs, they will create a new work order. The work order should include all the necessary details of the job, as well as the company contact information and an indication of the priority level and completion date. To streamline this process, organizations can standardize the work order format using a template.</p>



<p>In this stage, maintenance will also identify which type of work order they will need. If, for instance, a company relies on a proactive maintenance approach to anticipate and reduce equipment downtime, they will likely utilize a preventative maintenance work order. On the other hand, if a piece of equipment has already failed or the organization uses a more reactive maintenance program, the maintenance team will probably create a corrective maintenance work order or an emergency work order.</p>



 Phase 5: Work order distribution and completion 



<p>At this point, the team/supervisor will assign the necessary maintenance activities to a qualified maintenance technician who will complete the checklist of tasks on the proposed timeline. If the organization uses <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-cmms">computerized maintenance management system (CMMS)</a> software, the job will be automatically assigned to a technician.</p>



 Phase 6: Work order documentation and closure 



<p>Maintenance technicians are responsible for documenting and closing a work order once they complete all the assigned tasks. Technicians will need to indicate the time spent on each task, list any materials/equipment they used, provide images of their work and include notes and observations about the job. A manager may or may not need to sign off on the completed work order and provide guidance about next steps and follow-ups before moving on to the final phase.</p>



 Phase 7. Work order review/analysis 



<p>Reviewing closed work orders can provide valuable insights about maintenance operations, so organizations should try to review closed work orders as frequently as possible. Analyzing closed work orders can really help organizations identify opportunities for improvement in the work order process. Post-completion analysis also helps team members identify any tasks they missed or need to revisit.</p>



 Optimizing your work order management process 



<p>As an organization grows, it can become untenable to rely on paper work order management systems (or even Excel spreadsheets) to manage ever-evolving data needs. Larger organizations and those with more complex needs should consider investing in computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) software, a type of work order management software.</p>



<p>A high-quality CMMS will automatically plan, create, track and organize service requests, work orders and routine maintenance, eliminating excessive task planning duties for maintenance managers and supervisors.</p>



<p>Using CMMS software also allows your organization to store large amounts of data electronically, in a centralized location. With all your work order data living in one place, your management team can get real-time access to work orders as they move through the work order lifecycle. CMMS platforms with accompanying software for mobile devices push access a step farther, allowing users to track work orders and access maintenance activities remotely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, a good CMMS can aggregate and display work order data according to the department’s specific needs. Maintenance teams can build and view customizable reports, visualize trend data and metrics/KPIs, and monitor asset functionality to make troubleshooting and inventory management simpler.</p>



<p>While adopting a CMMS can be a complex process, integrating CMMS software into your maintenance operations can help your organization reduce costs, increase data access and visibility, reduce backlog and human error, and streamline your facilities management systems.&nbsp;</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 22nd May to 4th&nbsp;June <p>Welcome to the latest edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, keeping you up-to-date with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency regulations.</p><p>In the last fortnight, we’ve seen global bodies and economies make strides in crypto regulation.</p><p>IOSCO has proposed the first global crypto-asset market regulation, whereas the World Economic Forum is advocating for regulatory cooperation, illuminating the complexity of the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>In the face of these changes, Georgia, too, is bolstering its crypto-friendly reputation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong and UAE’s central banks are uniting to push the envelope in digital currency and fintech cooperation.</p><p>Let’s not wait any further and dive straight&nbsp;in.</p> A Global Journey Towards Unified Crypto Asset Regulation <p>The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is steering the ship toward the world’s first unified regulation of crypto asset markets. This move, catalyzed by the collapse of the FTX exchange, aims to quell a wide spectrum of industry issues, from market manipulation to customer protection.</p><p>The call for a harmonized regulatory framework resonates across the crypto industry, compelling regulatory bodies such as the US SEC, Japan’s FSA, Britain’s FCA, and Germany’s BaFin to rally alongside IOSCO. As these bodies collaborate and invite public feedback, a clear regulatory vision may begin to&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>Elsewhere, the European Union has recently concluded its comprehensive crypto regulations, nudging nations like the United States and Britain to follow suit. And amid regulatory uncertainty, India is hedging against potential risks, having implemented a new tax policy on crypto&nbsp;gains.</p><p>Amid all these, an intriguing alliance has formed between the Central Banks of Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates, united by a shared vision for crypto regulation and fintech development. Notably, Hong Kong granted retail investors access to crypto trading services on June&nbsp;1st.</p><p>Echoing these global movements, Georgia strides ahead with new crypto regulations, setting the stage for compulsory supervision of Virtual Asset Service Providers from September 2023. This initiative is part of the country’s aspirations to become a global crypto hub and fortify against money laundering.</p><p>From the think tank realm, the World Economic Forum has recognized the urgency for global coordination in crypto asset regulation. Through a paper exploring the inherent challenges and suggesting best practices, they add another layer to this global dialogue on crypto regulation.</p><p>Now, let’s analyze two of the biggest news from the world of crypto regulations over the last two weeks and decode their impact on crypto users and the broader ecosystem.</p> Decoding The World Economic Forum’s Take on Crypto Regulation: A Mixed Bag for the Crypto Ecosystem? <p>The World Economic Forum, in collaboration with its Digital Currency Governance Consortium, recently published a paper articulating the urgent need for global cooperation and regulation of crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>While emphasizing the avoidance of regulatory ambiguity and inconsistent enforcement, the paper sheds light on the challenges the current regulatory framework faces, particularly its failure to align seamlessly with the crypto ecosystem’s unique characteristics.</p><p>The paper’s analysis of the issues is meticulous, exploring the complexity added by crypto mixers, self-hosted wallets, and decentralized exchanges. It asserts that such elements, when coupled with the crypto sector’s growing interconnection with traditional finance, escalate the potential contagion risks, necessitating a robust regulatory response.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1662148287875498012?s=20">Image Source</a><p>The paper also breaks down regulatory frameworks into understandable categories, such as outcome-based regulation and risk-based regulation, and highlights the emergence of an “agile regulation” approach involving a multi-stakeholder effort.</p><p>Illustrating this, the paper cites Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority’s agile regulatory practices.</p><p>However, the paper does critique the “regulation by enforcement” approach prevalent in the United States, arguing that it obstructs meaningful dialogue around the regulatory framework.</p><p>So what does all this mean for crypto users and the wider ecosystem? A global regulatory framework might offer clarity for crypto users and businesses, simplifying cross-border operations. Agile regulation, in particular, could nurture continued innovation and growth in the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Global cooperation and the sharing of best practices could simplify the regulatory landscape, offering a fair playground and increasing overall stability. This could lure traditional investors and institutions, encouraging mainstream acceptance of the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>On the flip side, the push for regulation could clash with the crypto community’s privacy values. Regulation might also stifle innovation, especially for smaller entities struggling with regulatory compliance.</p><p>A global regulatory framework risks centralizing power, contradicting the decentralization that many crypto assets champion. Striking a balance between fostering innovation, maintaining user privacy, and ensuring market stability is the challenge at hand. This crucial juncture for the crypto ecosystem will shape its future direction.</p> Banking on Crypto Regulations: The Cross-Border Partnership Between Hong Kong and the&nbsp;UAE <p>The collaboration between the central banks of Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) promises to enhance financial cooperation, particularly in cryptocurrency regulations and fintech development. This partnership has wide-ranging implications for crypto users and the overall ecosystem.</p><p>With harmonized regulatory measures, investors could gain confidence due to stronger consumer protection and reduced risk of fraud. This cooperative approach might encourage other countries to develop aligned rules, promoting regulatory consistency for global investors.</p><p>At the same time, tighter regulations can pose challenges. Crypto creators might find a complex regulatory environment daunting, possibly resulting in slower growth in the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Additionally, new rules could conflict with the basic principles of decentralization and anonymity that define cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The central banks’ commitment extends beyond regulation to fostering fintech development. Joint initiatives and knowledge-sharing could stimulate innovation, creating a positive cycle that advances the industry.</p><p>Through this collaboration, both Hong Kong and the UAE can draw on each other’s strengths to enhance their financial ecosystems.</p><p>Still, there could be potential pitfalls. Development might lean towards the strengths and interests of these two countries, limiting the breadth of fintech innovation and possibly restricting the applicability of these solutions in other&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Navigating the complex landscape of cryptocurrency and fintech, the partnership between Hong Kong and UAE central banks offers an intriguing case&nbsp;study.</p><p>The outcomes will likely have a profound influence on how these areas evolve in the future, not just within these countries but potentially on a global&nbsp;scale.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan to Enforce Crypto Travel Rule from June&nbsp;1st</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">MiCA Paving the Way: From Liability to Transparency</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1664701122714521601?s=20">May Monthly&nbsp;Overview</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

With the power of AI and machine learning, financial institutions can leverage predictive analytics, anomaly detection and shared learning models to enhance system stability, detect fraud and drive superior customer-centric experiences. As we step into 2023, the focus has shifted to digital financial services, encompassing embedded finance, generative AI and the migration of super apps from China into a global phenomenon. And all this while balancing the adoption of a hybrid multicloud strategy. For banks to stay relevant and competitive in this new world, it is imperative for them to adjust to new trends, understand the importance of open finance and transform their core systems. Ultimately, banks must start with modernizing their core through technologies like hybrid multicloud and AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Generative AI: unleashing new opportunities&nbsp; 



<p>Generative AI, exemplified by the explosion in advanced large language model solutions on the market and seen most recently via the launch of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">IBM watsonx</a>, offers exciting possibilities in financial advisory and data analysis. While the unexplored future of generative AI poses opportunities in deterministic financial environments, configuring these models properly can simplify complex financial concepts and enable easier understanding for customers. Financial institutions must carefully leverage generative AI to strike the right balance between innovation and ethical usage. This is why IBM puts all of its AI technologies through rigorous processes and protocols to offer trustworthy solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In such a highly regulated industry like banking, it is that much more important for clients to have this access to the toolset, technology, infrastructure, and consulting expertise to build their own — or fine-tune and adapt available AI models — on their own data and deploy them at scale in a more trustworthy and open environment to drive business success. Competitive differentiation and unique business value will be able to be increasingly derived from how adaptable an AI model can be to an enterprise’s unique data and domain knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



 Embedded finance: redefining customer experiences&nbsp; 



<p>Embedded finance has emerged as a rapidly growing trend, revolutionizing the way customers interact with financial products and services. Banks now have the opportunity to seamlessly integrate financial capabilities into various contexts, such as online commerce or car buying and emerging digital ecosystems, without disrupting customer workflows. By embedding financial services into everyday activities, banks can deliver hyper-personalized and convenient experiences, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.&nbsp;</p>



 The rise of super apps: transforming digital ecosystems&nbsp; 



<p>Super apps, popular in China, have the potential to reshape the financial services landscape globally. By consolidating multiple applications and services under a single entity, super apps offer customers a comprehensive ecosystem that seamlessly integrates digital identity, instant payment, and data-driven capabilities. As embedded finance gains traction and open banking APIs become more prevalent, the vision of super apps is becoming a reality. Financial institutions need to adapt to this emerging trend and actively participate in the evolving digital ecosystems to deliver enhanced value and cater to evolving customer expectations.&nbsp;</p>



 Open finance: accelerating the API-driven economy&nbsp; 



<p>Open banking has been a topic of discussion for several years, with PSD2 regulations driving initial progress. Now open finance, an extension of PSD2, is set to open up even more services and foster an API-driven economy. With open finance, banks are compelled to open up additional APIs beyond payment accounts, enabling greater innovation and competition in the financial sector. This shift toward data-driven economies places embedded finance at the core of financial services. Forward-thinking banks are not only complying with regulatory requirements but also proactively leveraging open finance to distribute their services efficiently and reach customers wherever they are.&nbsp;</p>



 The critical need for modernizing core systems and the role of hybrid cloud&nbsp; 



<p>In this new paradigm of AI-powered digital finance, modernizing core systems becomes imperative for banks to deliver seamless experiences, leverage emerging technologies, and remain competitive. Traditional legacy systems often lack the flexibility, scalability and agility required to support the integration of embedded finance, generative AI and open finance. By transforming core systems, banks can create a solid foundation that enables the seamless integration of new technologies, facilitates efficient API-driven ecosystems and enhances the overall customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hybrid multicloud plays a crucial role in facilitating the shift. It allows banks to leverage the scalability and flexibility of public cloud services while maintaining control over sensitive data through private cloud and on-premises infrastructure. By adopting a hybrid multicloud approach, banks can transform their core systems, leverage AI and machine learning capabilities, ensure data security and compliance and seamlessly integrate with third-party services and APIs. The hybrid cloud provides the agility and scalability necessary to support the rapid deployment of new digital services, while also offering the control and customization required by financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>



 Modernization starts at the core&nbsp; 



<p>However, transforming core systems and transitioning to a hybrid cloud infrastructure is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Each bank has unique requirements, existing technology landscapes and strategic goals. It is crucial to align the technology roadmap of fintech solutions with the overall bank strategy, including the digital strategy. This alignment ensures a competitive advantage, sustainability and a seamless convergence between the two roadmaps. Collaboration between banks, fintech providers and IBM can facilitate this alignment and help banks navigate the complexities of digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial services industry is undergoing a profound transformation driven by AI, digital innovation and the shift toward digital financial services. Embedded finance, generative AI, the rise of super apps, and open finance are reshaping customer experiences and creating new opportunities for financial institutions. To fully leverage these transformative trends, banks must transform their core systems and adopt a hybrid multicloud infrastructure. This transformation not only enables seamless integration of new technologies but also enhances operational efficiency, agility and data security. As banks embark on this journey, strategic alignment between the technology roadmap and the overall bank strategy is paramount.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Customers and users want the ability to schedule scans at the timing of their choice and receive alerts when issues arise, and we’re happy to make a few announcements in this area today:</p>



 
 Scan frequency: Until recently, the IBM Cloud® Security and Compliance Center would scan resources every 24 hours, by default, on all of the attachments in an account. With this release, users can continue to run daily scans—which is the recommended option—but they also have the option for more flexibility. Users can now choose to evaluate their resources weekly, monthly or just on-demand. Additionally, users can create an attachment without enabling a scan as they set up their account and then enable the scan to run at a later date. 



 Enhanced notifications: Previously, scan notifications were set at an account level. By default, users were notified if 15% or more of their controls failed in a single scan. While the threshold percentage was customizable, it didn’t always provide the granularity that users are looking for. Now, users will have the ability to set the threshold for each attachment. Additionally, users are able to pick up to 15 specific controls that they can be notified for if they fail. These capabilities are independent, which means that if the threshold percentage isn’t met, but a specified control fails, the user is still notified for the control. If the user is in the process of setting up the account, notifications can be disabled and then re-enabled when ready. This capability allows for users to have the more granular control that they are looking for in notifications. 
 



 How do I get started? 



<p>Before you get started, be sure that you have the proper permissions and prerequisites to create an attachment and view results in the Security and Compliance Center.</p>



 
 You must have the Editor platform role or higher to create an attachment. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-access-management">Assigning access</a>. 



 You must have an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage">IBM Cloud Object Storage</a> bucket in which to store your results. To connect your bucket, you must have a service-to-service policy in place that enables communication between the Security and Compliance Center and Cloud Object Storage. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-storage&amp;interface=ui#cos-storage">Configuring storage</a>. 
 



 Step 1: Set up an instance of Event Notifications 



<p>To receive notifications for the Security and Compliance Center, you must have configured the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/event-notifications">IBM Cloud Event Notifications</a> service to send them. To get started, you can use the following steps:</p>



 
 In the console, click the Menu icon &gt; Security and Compliance. 



 In the Security and Compliance Center navigation, click Settings. 



 In the Event Notifications section, click Connect. 



 In the side panel, review the source details for the connection. Optionally, provide a description. 



 Select the resource group and Event Notifications service instance that you want to connect.If an IAM authorization between the Security and Compliance Center and Event Notifications doesn’t exist in your account, a dialog is displayed. Follow the prompts to grant access between the services:
 
 To grant access between the Security and Compliance Center and Event Notifications, click Authorize. 



 In the side panel, select Event Notifications as the target service. 



 From the list of instances, select the Event Notifications service instance that you want to authorize. 



 Select the Event Source Manager role. 



 Click Review. 



 Click Assign. 
 
 



 To confirm the connection, click Connect. A success message is displayed to indicate that the Security and Compliance Center is now connected to Event Notifications. If you need to disconnect from Event Notifications later, you can use the options menu &gt; Disconnect to remove the Security and Compliance Center as a source service in the Event Notifications instance. 
 



 Step 2: Configuring a scan 



<p>When you set up a scan, you have two options: recurring and on-demand. On-demand scans are useful as you are working toward a specific compliance program and you are frequently making changes but recurring scans will help to continuously monitor for compliance.</p>



<p>To start scanning your resources in the Security and Compliance Center, you must create an attachment to target your resources. To create an attachment, you can use the service UI:</p>



 
 In the Security and Compliance Center navigation, click Profiles and select the profile that you want to evaluate. A profile details page opens. 



 On the Attachments tab, click Create:<br> 



 Target your attachment by selecting a Scope and identifying any resources that you want to Exclude. Then, click Next. 



 Optional: Customize the underlying evaluations in your scan by editing the default parameters to match your specific use case. 



 Click Next.
 
 Toggle scanning to enabled to start scanning. 
 
 



 Select the frequency at which you want to evaluate your attachment. Options include every day, every 7 days and every 30 days. If needed, you can pause scanning at a later date:<br> 



 Optional: Configure notifications:
 
 If you want to receive notifications, toggle Notify me to On. 



 By default, when notifications are enabled, you are alerted when 15% or more of your controls fail in a single scan. You can change this by adjusting the Threshold percentage. For example, if you have a profile with 100 controls and you want to be notified if 5 of them fail, you would select 5% as your threshold:<br> 



 Select specific controls that you want to be notified about:
 
 If there are high-priority controls that pertain specifically to your job role, you might want to be notified every time they fail. You can identify up to 15 controls per scan that you can receive individual notifications for. These notifications are sent regardless of whether the threshold identified in the previous step has been met. 



 Click Select control. 



 Select the controls that you want to be notified about by checking the box next to the control. 



 Click Ok:<br> 
 
 
 
 



 Review your choices and click Create:<br> 
 



<p>When you create your attachment, a scan is scheduled. When the scan completes, your results are available in the Security and Compliance Center dashboard. To initiate an on-demand scan, you can select Run scan on the overflow menu in the row of the profile that you want to evaluate.</p>

 At Identiverse 2023, the narrative around removing the password has reached inevitability: it’s not if or how, it’s when. Unsurprisingly, passkeys were a common theme because they’ve achieved the two requirements for finally pushing the 62-year-old password into retirement: They’re faster than a password and they are easier for the user.

<p>At Identiverse 2023, the narrative around removing the password has reached inevitability: it’s not if or how, it’s when. Unsurprisingly, passkeys were a common theme because they’ve achieved the two requirements for finally pushing the 62-year-old password into retirement: They’re faster than a password and they are easier for the user.</p> 
<p>In the recent <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-security-report">State of Passwordless</a> vol 3, we showed that 45% of Security decision makers think that improving the user experience is the reason to go passwordless. Users have discovered an incredible number of ways to get around security they find irritating (I’m looking at you,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vaydeer-Undetectable-Multi-Tracks-Simulate-Realistic-dp-B093WN48SD/dp/B093WN48SD/ref=dp_ob_title_ce"> Mouse Jiggler</a>).&nbsp;</p> 
 Adding Pain With Number Matching  
<p>Given Microsoft’s recent announcement that Authenticator will now mandate<a href="https://www.itpro.com/security/cyber-attacks/microsoft-authenticator-mandates-number-matching-to-counter-mfa-fatigue-attacks"> number matching</a>, we’re likely to see even more focus on the experience. The new policy requires that the numbers in a user's password match exactly with those on their registered mobile device. (You can see a video demo<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhyRpB5xv-A"> here</a>.) This has led to a layer of complexity in the authentication process. Users now have to remember not just a password, but also ensure that certain numbers correspond to those in their personal devices. While<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf"> CISA’s guidelines</a> for moving to phishing-resistant MFA respect number matching as one way to get to phishing-resistance, the experience is pretty challenging.&nbsp;</p> 
 Adding Pain With Complexity?  
<p>We’re going to see another level of complexity added to passwords with the implementation of the 2024 PCI requirements. Password length and complexity requirements drive users nuts. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) 2024 password length requirement is a perfect example of how security measures can impact user experience. With the updated requirements requiring a minimum of 12 characters for passwords, users are being forced to remember more complex and lengthy credentials. While this might enhance security, it will also lead to frustrated users, increased password reset requests and significant account lockouts. Fortunately, the PCI 2024 requirements also acknowledge FIDO and that this can serve as one or more of the factors required for authentication.&nbsp;</p> 
 FIDO and Passkeys to the Rescue  
<p>So where does this leave us given that both of those changes are designed to address the ability of hackers to use automated attacks <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">to bypass traditional authentication systems</a>? This is why FIDO has developed so much market momentum, particularly around passkeys. First off: a passkey is any FIDO credential. If you’ve been using FIDO for years, you’ve been using passkeys, it just has a new name.</p> 
<p>Passkeys offer a more streamlined experience for users by reducing the need for remembering complex passwords. The good news is that with Apple, Google, Microsoft and a number of the password management solutions offering to support synchronized passkeys, it’s increasingly easy for companies to adopt passkeys and for consumers to use them. It’s soon going to be as natural as anything that we do to authenticate on our phone today.&nbsp;</p> 
 The User Experience Holy Grail  
<p>From a user experience point of view, passkeys can help us to achieve the holy grail: having an authentication experience that is simpler and faster than passwords. HYPR not only supports passkeys through our app, we also provide what Apple, Google and Microsoft don’t — the servers and infrastructure required for organizations to authenticate based on passkeys. Beyond that, we also offer Enterprise Passkeys: passkeys bound to a single device with the controls that enterprises need to feel confident that they have control of their credentials and authentication strategy.</p>

 Neighbourhood Warmth — Month Notes (no.&nbsp;1) <p>This is the second in a short series of month notes about our Neighbourhood Warmth project. It has also been crossposted on the blog of our project partner, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/category/climate/">mysociety</a>.</p>Rodborough Common,&nbsp;Frome Month 1 <p>We wrapped up <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2023/03/30/neighbourhood-warmth-monthnotes/">our first instalment of monthnotes</a> with thoughts on how to tackle our overarching enquiry:</p><p>“How can we support communities to organise locally around a simple and achievable home energy&nbsp;action?”</p><p>Since then we’ve been sculpting <a href="https://neighbourhood-warmth.staging.mysociety.org/">the skeleton of a digital service</a> that we’re planning to test in June. Currently it outlines the benefits of collaboration and enables neighbours to connect with each other, by forming&nbsp;teams.</p> Questions lead to questions <p>You may have noticed that our timescales have slipped a bit! After an initial burst of brainstorming we spotted an impending crunch and decided to extend our partnership for another month. This provided breathing space to organise workshops. And it allowed us to unpack a few questions that are bubbling up as we revisit the drawing board and&nbsp;iterate.</p><p>Here’s a&nbsp;flavour:</p>  How can digital technology facilitate purposeful connection, and on what basis (eg proximity, housing type, tenure, existing relationships or motivations)?  What mechanisms enable teams to form, evolve and progress together?  How strongly do we want to encourage a particular sequence of&nbsp;actions?  <p>As we crumble these and related questions into more granular design decisions, we’re regularly referring back to the research questions in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u46mfXRYYdzpxWi5d40-Yb-f86FxL5z8AT_zEhyPegM/edit#heading=h.u9dfvp64qkns">our plan for this Alpha phase</a> to maintain focus. We’ve made strides on the first three, and our attention is now turning towards the remaining two:</p>  How a service like this could signal demand to the council or to retrofit organisations, to help build the supply of retrofit finance and services in an&nbsp;area.  How a service like this could connect residents with suppliers for services across parts or whole of the retrofit&nbsp;journey.   I’m gonna get myself connected <p>We’ve also been laying <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVhoGaWMBPpVNND2AXnu4gvdM4OTVnPhyFi6eJmru8Y/edit?usp=sharing">foundations</a> for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LWGJJz3P3Hl17DdO2VOp8xaSb3kQ-lz2VOno8KC0Faw/edit?usp=sharing">co-design workshops</a> that we’ll use to test and learn with communities in Frome, Birmingham and hopefully at least one more location. Due to their distinctive characteristics, these communities allow us to run parallel experiments.</p><p>In Balsall Heath, John Christophers is at the heart of a community-led effort to make the most of government funding that involves <a href="https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/">Birmingham City Council</a>, <a href="https://www.mecctrust.co.uk/">MECC Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.midlandsnetzerohub.co.uk/">Midlands Net Zero Hub</a> to name a&nbsp;few.</p><p>And in Frome, thanks to funding from <a href="https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/funding/programmes/climate-action-fund-programme">The National Lottery’s Climate Action Fund</a>, the town council has partnered with the <a href="https://www.cse.org.uk/">Centre for Sustainable Energy</a> so that <a href="https://www.frometowncouncil.gov.uk/mayor-of-frome-welcomes-free-energy-advice-home-visit-session/">its Healthy Homes team can advise residents</a>.</p><p>We’re interested to see how people’s perspectives on Neighbourhood Warmth may be shaped by these diverse contexts, histories and experiences. By shining light from different angles, we hope their responses will help us to resolve some of the questions that we’re still grappling with.</p><p>Thanks to generous engagement with fellow travellers on the road to community-led retrofit, our thinking continues to be stimulated in the meantime. Thanks to everyone who read and shared our previous monthnotes, and made time to meet in the&nbsp;interim.</p><p>In relation to the research questions above, we’re honoured to have been invited to drop in to the <a href="https://ukgbc.org/">UK Green Building Council</a>’s local authority retrofit forum. This is a golden opportunity to share our work with council officers. We’re curious to know how a richer picture of home energy action could bolster their efforts to support residents. If Neighbourhood Warmth provided a clearer view of demand, how could that help in the development of local supply chains? And zooming out a bit further, we’re exploring the potential for knock-on benefits at regional and national levels with the <a href="https://www.wmca.org.uk/">West Midlands Combined Authority</a>.</p><p>As always we’re all ears. So if you have thoughts please get in touch via <a href="mailto:climate@mysociety.org">climate@mysociety.org</a> and <a href="mailto:info@darkmatterlabs.org">info@darkmatterlabs.org</a> and spread the word so that we get more feedback.</p>

 We sat down with our Sales Director, Olivier Artus, to discuss the PVID framework, its impact on the financial market, its evolution over time and its implementation at IDnow. 



 What will the PVID certification mean for the financial market in practice? 



<p>The PVID certification offers a clear and precise reference for all remote identity verification players on the French market. It allows financial market players to integrate a certified solution of substantial level into their process, which will make the entry into a relationship consistent with a face-to-face equivalent. This is the first time that the French authorities that regulate the financial services market have proposed a solution, integrating biometrics, that is 100% compliant with the Monetary and Financial Code (CMF), without having to add any additional measures other than ID and biometrics.</p>



 What will the PVID standard add to the remote identity verification process? 



<p>The real difference is the instant compliance of the entry into the relationship. Until now, the use of biometrics in a transaction, although secure, had no substantial value, i.e. was not recognized or certified by an authority. Thanks to PVID, we finally have a solution that offers a face-to-face equivalent, in line with the requirements of the regulators.</p>



<p>In addition, the PVID standard makes it possible to offer online access to unbanked populations. Thanks to the certification, it is no longer necessary to add additional measures such as the first payment by bank transfer, for example, which is less inclusive and often a source of failure or even cost. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">use of biometrics</a> is now recognized as a full complementary measure.</p>



<p>The rules imposed by traditional financial institutions for opening an account have made the entry into a relationship a real challenge. If we had had a PVID standard at the time of the health crisis, for example, traditional banks would have been able to do even more business securely and therefore more transactions.</p>



 Will all players in the financial sector be affected by this certification? In particular the crypto players, the fintech world… will everyone be on the same page? 



<p>All players subject to <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr/">ACPR</a> and <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/regulation/regulation-homepage">AMF</a> regulations will now be able to include a biometric entry path in their solution: credit institutions, personal and capital insurance, fintech, payment institutions, etc. Some other sectors will not be immediately affected by PVID, such as property and casualty insurance, which does not have a KYC obligation as it is not considered a risk area.</p>



<p>Other sectors of the financial sphere such as issuers of prepaid products and so-called credit FinTechs will obviously be interested in the development of such solutions to enhance trust when entering into a remote relationship.</p>



<p>As far as crypto is concerned, the AMF in France has defined the PSAN status (Service Provider on Digital Assets) in order to better supervise the market players and requires for this the implementation of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">complete KYC path</a>, including identity verification. This is equivalent to the PVID process for banks. More globally and in order to harmonize the European crypto regulatory landscape, it is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets)</a> regulation that will enter soon, still with the objective of protecting investors and preserving financial stability.</p>



<p>The first beneficiaries of the PVID standard will therefore be banks, neo-banks, payment institutions and credit players. What is important to remember is that players who are not directly concerned by PVID will be able to accelerate their insertion into the market and strengthen confidence in the construction of a customer relationship, thanks to this type of standard.</p>



 What will be the benefits of a PVID certification for financial market participants? 



<p>The last two years have seen a significant increase in cases of online identity fraud. In our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">latest Identity Fraud Trend Report</a> we found a 144% increase in the use of fake identity documents between November and December 2021. PVID certification strengthens traditional remote identity verification solutions, and improves the fight against identity theft through the use of biometrics.</p>



<blockquote><p>Beyond the fight against fraud, the challenge of the PVID standard is to fight against financial crime during remote identification, and therefore money laundering. This involves identifying the origin of funds and the destination of funds. The PVID process completes the financial institution’s AML/CFT system.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



 Do you think that the arrival of PVID will increase confidence in the market? 



<p>Of course. The primary objective of PVID is to strengthen the trust between the financial institution and the customer when subscribing to a service or opening an account.</p>



<p>The end customer will go through a process that is based on a public repository published by a recognized government agency, which represents an additional element of trust for him. For its part, the financial institution will rely on an expert company that provides it with a solution certified by the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ANSSI</a> to a substantial level with regard to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">European eIDAS regulation</a>, in order to verify the authenticity of the identity of the customers it deals with.</p>



<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/solution-pvid/">PVID standard</a> adds control points to identity documents. The dynamic capture of the document allows the detection of security features that cannot be verified in static mode. Then, a manual analysis completes the automated verification of the captures. It is carried out by operators trained in fraud who check, correct and give a final verdict on the user data in less than 5 minutes.</p>



 What, in your opinion, are the challenges to encourage the adoption of this new type of standard? 



<p>The first challenge is the user experience, which must be simple, intuitive, fast and perfectly integrated into our customers’ acquisition flow. The use of a mobile phone in the context of a long-distance relationship can be a barrier for less technophile users. For this reason, we offer an omnichannel pathway (on smartphones, tablets and computers). Our PVID certified pathway offers an intuitive, step-by-step guided experience to simplify the identity verification process for the user, for high conversion rates.</p>



<p>Furthermore, citizens are becoming increasingly vigilant about the handling of their personal data. Here again, our solutions are compliant with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Our solutions and all processed data are securely hosted in Europe and we have our own infrastructure. Thus, we guarantee the complete confidentiality and protection of all shared data and analyses performed.</p>



<p>In addition to the user aspect, we also have a duty to support financial institutions in learning how to use the solutions and optimize their processes.</p>



 In terms of geography, who will be affected by PVID? And in your opinion, will this certification evolve? 



<p>From a technical point of view, the solution will initially apply to the entire French market under the aegis of the ACPR. As France is a recognized financial center, it is likely that the PVID process could also be recognized as compliant in other EU countries in the context of remote entry.</p>



<blockquote><p>It can be assumed that this regulation will continue to exist and that it may evolve from a functional point of view. Optional modules may be added to the solution to suit different countries and local regulators.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



<p>In the context of the emergence of digital identity and identity wallets, our near future will be to rely on a PVID certified solution for the creation of a recognized digital identity of substantial level.</p>



 What is the status of certification at IDnow? 



<p>We have never been so close to being PVID certified. We are at the end of the certification process, so we hope to be able to announce this very soon.</p>

A SAID is uniquely and cryptographically bound to a serialization of data that includes the SAID as a component (or field) in that serialization.</p><blockquote>Note 1: Serialization is defined as a process of translating a data structure or object state into a data format that can be stored, transmitted, and reconstructed at a later&nbsp;time.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: In KERI, all identifiers are SAIDs. For example, Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) are SAIDs of their associated key inception events. Identifiers of Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs) and their schemas are also&nbsp;SAIDs.</blockquote> Content-Addressability <p>An identifier that is content-addressable is based on an encoded cryptographic digest and is, thus, cryptographically bound to the content that it identifies.</p> Self-Reference <p>An identifier that is self-referential appears within the content that it is identifying.</p> SAD (Self-Addressing Data) <p>SAD (Self-Addressing Data) of a SAID is defined as a representation of data content from which the SAID is derived. The SAID is both cryptographically bound to (content-addressable) and encapsulated by (self-referential) its&nbsp;SAD.</p><blockquote>Note: the example SAID above starts with the character “E”. This is a CESR character code that specifies that the SAID is generated using a Blake3–256 digest.</blockquote> SAID Protocol <p>A “naive” cryptographic content-addressable identifier is not self-referential. This is because the naive cryptographic derivation process of a content-addressable identifier is a cryptographic digest of the serialized content. Changing one bit of the serialization content will result in a different digest. Therefore, a self-referential content-addressable identifier requires a special derivation protocol.</p><p>The generation and verification protocol of a SAID—which makes it both content-addressable and self-referential—is outlined with an example&nbsp;below:</p>  Here is an example of a python dict with the empty field&nbsp;“said”.   {<br>  "said": "",<br>  "first": "Sue",<br>  "last": "Smith",<br>  "role": "Founder"<br>}   Serialize the data into JSON with no extra whitespace.  Replace the “said” field value in the serialization of data with a dummy string # of the same length as the to-be-generated SAID. Here, we use a Blake3–256 digest with 44 characters.   {"said":"############################################","first":"Sue",<br>"last ":"Smith","role":"Founder"}   Compute the digest (Blake3–256) of the serialization that includes the dummy value for the “said”&nbsp;field.   EJymtAC4piy_HkHWRs4JSRv0sb53MZJr8BQ4SMixXIVJ   The value of the “said” field is now replaced with the computed and encoded SAID to produce the final serialization with embedded&nbsp;SAID.  The final serialization may be converted to a python dict by deserializing the&nbsp;JSON.   {<br>  "said": "EJymtAC4piy_HkHWRs4JSRv0sb53MZJr8BQ4SMixXIVJ",<br>  "first": "Sue",<br>  "last": "Smith",<br>  "role": "Founder"<br>} <blockquote>Note: The SAID protocol preserves the insertion ordering of its content. That is, it preserves the order in which elements are added to a data structure</blockquote> Advantages of Using&nbsp;SAIDs <p>Here are some advantages of using SAIDs over other types of identifiers:</p>  SAIDs facilitate greater interoperability, reduced ambiguity, and enhanced security in the management of&nbsp;data.  A cryptographic commitment—such as a signature, digest, or another SAID—to a given SAID is essentially equivalent to a commitment to its associated serialization.  Any change to the serialization invalidates its SAID thereby ensuring secure immutability and evident reasoning with SAIDs about serializations or equivalently their&nbsp;SAIDs.  SAIDs facilitate immutably referenced data serializations for applications such as Verifiable Credentials and Ricardian Contracts.   ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) <p>An ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) is a variant of the Verifiable Credential (VC) that is designed to be used with other protocols in the KERI ecosystem.</p><p>ACDC or Authentic Chained Data Container has the following meaning:</p>  Authentic: ACDCs are authentic using digital signatures that are signed and verified by keys associated with&nbsp;AIDs.  Chained: ACDCs may be chained together as a directed acyclic&nbsp;graph.  Data Container: A data container is a serialized data structure of label-value pairs. That is, it is a way of bundling together data&nbsp;items.  <p>A Data Container is a way of bundling together data items. An Authentic Data Container (ADC), therefore, is a data container that provides cryptographic verifiability of the integrity and source of its bundled data. In other words, that data is both tamper-proof and is non-repudiably attributable to its source. Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs) are ADCs that are chained/linked together to provide granular proof-of-authorship (i.e., authenticity) of their contained data as a directed acyclic&nbsp;graph.</p><blockquote>Note: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of vertices and edges, with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed&nbsp;loop.</blockquote><p>As a variant of the VC, ACDCs share the same fundamental properties as traditional VCs. However, ACDCs are specifically designed to work with the KERI protocol and consequently benefit from its best-in-class security properties. Unlike W3C VC, ACDC also provides normative support for credential chaining. The features that distinguish ACDCs from traditional VCs will be discussed in detail later in this&nbsp;blog.</p><blockquote>Basically, you can think of ACDCs as VCs on steroids!</blockquote><blockquote>Note: As defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credentials">W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model v1.1</a>, a verifiable credential is a set of tamper-evident claims and metadata that cryptographically prove who issued it. This definition also applies to&nbsp;ACDCs.</blockquote> Simple ACDC&nbsp;Example <p>Here is an example of an ACDC from an issuer to an&nbsp;issuee:</p> {<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON000113_",<br>  "d": "EFprJkdpcJSet8aLY9PaMicyyUkEFnVjrIRZTmftmhkg",<br>  "i": "EmkPreYpZfFk66jpf3uFv7vklXKhzBrAqjsKAn2EDIPM",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EgveY4-9XgOcLxUderzwLIr9Bf7V_NHwY1lkFrn9y2PY",<br>    "i": "EQzFVaMasUf4cZZBKA0pUbRc9T8yUXRFLyM1JDASYqAA",<br>    "dt": "2021-06-09T17:35:54.169967+00:00"<br>  }<br>} <p>Here, each field has the following description:</p>  “v” is a version string that provides protocol type (ACDC), version (1.0), serialization type (JSON), the size of the ACDC in the lowercase hexadecimal notation (00113 = 1*16**2 + 1*16 + 3 = 275 characters), and the terminator character (_).  “d” is the SAID of the&nbsp;ACDC.  “i” is the AID of the&nbsp;issuer.  “a” is the block of attributes (claims) of the holder (i.e. the data subject).  <p>There are the following fields inside&nbsp;“a”:</p>  “d” is the SAID of the nested “a”&nbsp;block.  “i” is the AID of the&nbsp;holder.  “dt” is the date-time of the issuance.  <blockquote>Note 1: The primary field labels in ACDCs are compact, i.e., having only one or two characters. This design choice was made so that ACDC can support resource-constrained applications such as those in supply chains and&nbsp;IoT.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: an ACDC may be untargeted, that is an ACDC without a holder. An untargeted ACDC provides an undirected verifiable attestation or observation of a piece of data. For example, a thermometer may make verifiable non-repudiable temperature measurements and publish them as&nbsp;ACDCs.</blockquote> Naive Conversion to a W3C&nbsp;VC <p>The example ACDC above may be converted to a W3C Verifiable Credential (W3C VC) in a “naive” manner as&nbsp;follows:</p> {<br>  "@context": [<br>    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",<br>    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"<br>  ],<br>  "issuer": {<br>    "id": "EmkPreYpZfFk66jpf3uFv7vklXKhzBrAqjsKAn2EDIPM"<br>  },<br>  "validFrom": "2021-06-09T17:35:54.169967+00:00",<br>  "credentialSubject": {<br>    "id": "EQzFVaMasUf4cZZBKA0pUbRc9T8yUXRFLyM1JDASYqAA"<br>  }<br>} <p>This conversion is naive since some security properties of the ADCD are lost during the conversion. For example, the SAIDs of the ACDC and its attribute do not appear in the W3C&nbsp;VC.</p><p>A more secure conversion standard between ACDC and W3C VC is currently being developed by Kevin Griffin from GLEIF in this draft specification:</p>  <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/vc-acdc/">https://weboftrust.github.io/vc-acdc/</a>  <blockquote>Note: Unlike W3C VC, an ACDC does not have a “proof” section. A digital signature is attached to the ACDC using the CESR Proof Signature protocol.</blockquote> Distinguishing Features of&nbsp;ACDCs <p>ACDCs have features that distinguish them from traditional VCs. Some of the major distinguishing features&nbsp;include:</p>  The security model that is derived from&nbsp;KERI,  Compact formats for resource-constrained applications  Composable JSON&nbsp;Schema,  Support for credential chaining,  Support for Ricardian contracts,  Support for chain-link confidentiality, and  Support for graduated disclosure.   1. KERI Security&nbsp;Model <p>An ACDC inherits its security properties from the KERI protocol that enables the ACDC to be used in a portable but securely attributable, fully decentralized manner.</p><p>A security property that I would like to emphasize here is the one that emerges from using SAIDs as identifiers. In fact, all identifiers in ACDCs are SAIDs or URIs that contain SAIDs. Hence, a digital signature on an ACDC provides a cryptographic commitment to the ACDC itself as well as to all the data from which the SAIDs in ACDC were derived. Examples of SAIDs in an ACDC&nbsp;include:</p>  the top-level identifier of the ACDC itself and the identifiers of nested data blocks inside the ACDC: Using SAIDs as identifiers enable a compact but secure representation of the ACDC and associated blocks.  the identifier of ACDC’s issuer and holder: The identifiers of the issuer and the holder (i.e., the issuee) are autonomic identifiers (AIDs), which are SAIDs of the inception events of their key event logs (KELs). A digital signature on an ACDC can be verified using the issuer’s KEL while the holder may cryptographically prove its holdership over the ACDC using their&nbsp;KEL.  the identifier of the ACDC’s status registry: The status of an ACDC is determined by a status registry, called a transaction event log (TEL). The issuance and revocation events of an ACDC are recorded as TEL entries that are anchored to the KEL of the ACDC’s&nbsp;issuer.  the identifier of the ACDC’s schema: The schema of an ACDC is a JSON schema where the schema id field ("$id") is the SAID of the schema. This ensures that the ACDC schema is static and verifiable to the&nbsp;SAID.  <blockquote>Note: With the use of the SAID protocol, the schema of an ACDC is static, i.e. immutable. This makes the ACDC protected against the schema malleability attack where an adversary attacks the source that provides schema resources.</blockquote> 2. Compact ACDC&nbsp;Format <p>An ACDC may be expressed in multiple ways including in compacted or uncompacted formats. Simple examples of the same ACDC that is expressed in compacted or uncompacted formats are given&nbsp;below.</p> # Compacted ACDC variant<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON000119_",<br>  "d": "ECh56mUZGxTZtpiTrxaB7wZlQtRsD4N5pY5adc_B1748",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",   <br>  "ri": "EMrPQvNVXag7MtTXVNtOBtUmjBWj6QLpPH8QBqBITUH_",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": "EBkbsuJIH_8aCUKNFFpRjT5G5_YsQ6_pZrcrCVQFnzC3"<br>}  # Uncompacted ACDC variant<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON00018c_",<br>  "d": "EDycvNBB5c1cqvgOnCmwBPmcrk80bYyRVfc-G_351kO9",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "EMrPQvNVXag7MtTXVNtOBtUmjBWj6QLpPH8QBqBITUH_",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EBkbsuJIH_8aCUKNFFpRjT5G5_YsQ6_pZrcrCVQFnzC3",<br>    "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T00:30:16.261184+00:00",<br>    "name": "Jane Doe"<br>  }<br>} <p>Here two more fields are introduced:</p>  "s" is the SAID of the JSON Schema that is used to produce the&nbsp;ACDC.  "ri" is the identifier of the ACDC’s status registry.  <p>In the compacted variant, the value of "a" is the SAID of the attribute section, which is equal to the value of the digest "d" inside "a" of the uncompacted variant.</p><p>Compact ACDCs are useful in resourced-constrained applications where the receivers/verifiers of ACDCs may cache some piece of data with their SAIDs. Other uses of compact ACDCs will also be discussed in later sections of this&nbsp;blog.</p> 3. Composable JSON&nbsp;Schema <p>The schema used by ACDCs is the JSON Schema. The JSON Schema supports composable schema that enables the use of any combination of compacted and uncompacted sections and subsections in an ACDC. With this property, the ACDC’s verification protocol allows the same ACDC to be expressed in multiple forms while still being verifiable using the same digital signature from an&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>For the above examples of compacted and uncompacted ACDC, the schema of their attribute section "a" may be constructed with the keyword "OneOf" as&nbsp;follows:</p> {<br>  "a": {<br>    "oneOf": [<br>      {<br>        "description": "Attributes block SAID",<br>        "type": "string"<br>      },<br>      {<br>        "$id": "ELpLieummE-O6FzaQ7RW-yPV__x36x6XkmdFBr6ua7ec",<br>        "description": "Attributes block",<br>        "type": "object",<br>        "properties": {<br>          "d": {<br>            "description": "Attributes block SAID",<br>            "type": "string"<br>          },<br>          "i": {<br>            "description": "Holder's AID",<br>            "type": "string"<br>          },<br>          "dt": {<br>            "description": "Issuance date time",<br>            "type": "string",<br>            "format": "date-time"<br>          },<br>          "name": {<br>            "description": "Name",<br>            "type": "string"<br>          }<br>        },<br>        "additionalProperties": false,<br>        "required": [<br>          "d",<br>          "i",<br>          "name"<br>        ]<br>      }<br>    ]<br>  }<br>} <blockquote>Note: If an ACDC schema allows for multiple variants, the issuer of such an ACDC must digitally sign the most compacted variant. A verifier who subsequently receives an uncompacted variant may convert it into the most compacted variant before verifying it against the digital signature.</blockquote> 4. ACDC&nbsp;Chaining <p>Unlike the W3C VC data model, the ACDC specification provides normative support for credential chaining. Chaining between ACDCs forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the ACDCs are nodes in the graph. The directed edges between ACDCs are represented by field "e", which specifies the relationships between the connected ACDCs. A simple example is given below where an edge represents a mother-son relationship between Ms. Jane Doe and Mr. John&nbsp;Doe.</p> # An example ACDC that attests to the identity of Ms. Jane Doe.<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON00018c_",<br>  "d": "EDycvNBB5c1cqvgOnCmwBPmcrk80bYyRVfc-G_351kO9",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "EMrPQvNVXag7MtTXVNtOBtUmjBWj6QLpPH8QBqBITUH_",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EBkbsuJIH_8aCUKNFFpRjT5G5_YsQ6_pZrcrCVQFnzC3",<br>    "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T00:30:16.261184+00:00",<br>    "name": "Jane Doe"<br>  }<br>}  # An example ACDC that attests to the identity of Mr. John Doe. <br># The edge section indicates that Ms. Jane Doe is his mother. <br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON000203_",<br>  "d": "EFh8dlxwT2EjhknxNAP5xIhYmiurtGbeDQ-pS5jOaOlE",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "ECHkWfh71fLmkeJpeMvic6RQp5P73PizTGQelXB7ZNEE",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EFFD47E5Ev1zJF3zIagGEM7kbTI9DoT3scItzDPq9Jnm",<br>    "i": "EKW8xHilZH8-CetHzBOddWpG0bS_vJlphrK3zh95u0zF",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T01:07:44.885411+00:00",<br>    "name": "John Doe"<br>  },<br>  "e": {<br>    "d": "EE12DuT-V4IPumKmRsirulOeroO38aCEb4mjKy8SlE0m",<br>    "mother": {<br>      "n": "EDycvNBB5c1cqvgOnCmwBPmcrk80bYyRVfc-G_351kO9"<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>The edge section "e" is the representation of the directed edge that originates from the embedding ACDC. Inside the edge section, the fields have the following meanings:</p>  "d" is the SAID of the edge&nbsp;section.  "n" is the SAID of the ACDC to which the edge is directed, i.e., the SAID of Ms. Jane Doe’s&nbsp;ACDC.  <blockquote>Note: The edge section may also be compacted using the section’s SAID.</blockquote> 5. Ricardian Contracts <p>An ACDC may consist of a rule section "r" to provide a Ricardian Contract. To satisfy the properties of a Ricardian contract, the rule section may be hierarchically structured into sections and subsections with named or numbered clauses in each section. The labels on the clauses may follow such a hierarchical structure using nested maps or&nbsp;blocks.</p><blockquote>Note: A Ricardian contract is a type of digital contract that combines legal and financial terms with computer-readable code. It aims to create a machine-readable representation of a legal agreement by embedding the terms of the contract within a digital document. This approach allows both humans and machines to interpret and execute the contract.</blockquote><p>An example of an ACDC with a rule section for warranty and liability disclaimers is given&nbsp;below.</p> # An example ACDC with a rule section<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON0003e0_",<br>  "d": "EKZ0qdcyz2Mpl9QNuP0p1Sd0vr1Ov4g4wsDeZ7DJqGh6",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "ECHkWfh71fLmkeJpeMvic6RQp5P73PizTGQelXB7ZNEE",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EDhg1jZaNPJdYpiNwQRsjlZMiXF6XYAzlNhgkGBfXwMb",<br>    "i": "EKW8xHilZH8-CetHzBOddWpG0bS_vJlphrK3zh95u0zF",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T01:14:49.919153+00:00",<br>    "name": "John Doe"<br>  },<br>  "r": {<br>    "d": "ENyB1FGejfsC2MoYXJO9WOFJttmB3lw5NC0y_dSBPlq0",<br>    "usageDisclaimer": {<br>      "l": "Usage of a valid, unexpired, and non-revoked credential does not assert that the holder is trustworthy, honest, reputable in its business dealings, safe to do business with, or compliant with any laws or that an implied or expressly intended purpose will be fulfilled."<br>    },<br>    "issuanceDisclaimer": {<br>      "l": "All information in a valid, unexpired, and non-revoked credential is accurate as of the date the validation process was complete. The credential has been issued to the person named in the credential as the subject."<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>In the rule&nbsp;section,</p>  "r" is the rule section of the&nbsp;ACDC.  "d" is the SAID of the rule&nbsp;section.  "l" is the text of a Ricardian contract&nbsp;clause.  <blockquote>Note: A rule section and its subsections may be compacted using the section’s and subsections’ SAIDs, respectively.</blockquote> 6. Chain-Link Confidentiality <p>One of the most important features of ACDCs (using their rule sections "r") is support for Chain-Link Confidentiality that imposes contractual restrictions and liability on a recipient (i.e. a disclosee) of confidential information. This property provides a powerful mechanism for the protection of personal data and confidential information.</p><p>The concept was first coined by Woodrow Hartzog and is defined as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>“A chain-link confidentiality regime would contractually link the disclosure of personal information to obligations to protect that information as the information moves downstream. The system would focus on the relationships not only between the discloser of information and the initial recipient but also between the initial recipient and subsequent recipients.”</blockquote><blockquote>[Woodrow Hartzog. “Chain-link confidentiality.” Georgia Law Review 46 (2011):&nbsp;657.]</blockquote><p>This approach links recipients of information in a chain, with each recipient bound by the same obligation to protect the information. These chain contracts would contain at least three kinds of&nbsp;terms:</p>  obligations and restrictions on the use of the disclosed information,  requirements to bind future recipients to the same obligations and restrictions; and  requirements to perpetuate the contractual chain.  <p>An exchange of an ACDC compatible with chain-link confidentiality starts with a disclosure offer from a discloser to a recipient. This offer includes a metadata ACDC with the information to be disclosed such that the recipient can agree to those terms. Once the recipient has accepted the terms (with a non-repudiable digital signature) then full disclosure of ACDC may be&nbsp;made.</p>A simple example of chain-link confidentiality. 7. Graduated Disclosure <p>A discloser of an ACDC may choose not to reveal the entire content of the ACDC in their initial interaction with the recipient. Instead, the discloser may opt to partially or selectively present the information contained within the ACDC that is needed to further a transaction with the recipient—i.e., revealing only the information that is necessary for the recipient to continue the interaction. Subsequently, the discloser would disclose further information only after the recipient agrees to the terms established by the discloser. This process may involve multiple steps, where the discloser progressively reveals more information as the recipient consents to additional terms. This process is called graduated disclosure.</p><blockquote>Note: Here, “graduated” means “arranged in a series” or “divided into different levels.”</blockquote><p>ACDC leverages graduated disclosure that enables adherence to the principle of least disclosure, which is expressed as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>The system should disclose only the minimum amount of information about a given party needed to facilitate a transaction and no&nbsp;more.</blockquote><p>ACDCs employ three types of graduated disclosure mechanisms, including compact, partial, and selective disclosures. Different types of disclosure may be defined as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Compact disclosure: Compact disclosure of an ACDC discloses the SAID of its content (blocks or sections of the ACDC). Both partial and selective disclosure rely on compact disclosure.  Partial disclosure: The content of an ACDC can be partially disclosed via the exchange of only the SAID of a given content block, i.e., using compact disclosure. The SAID of a content block provides a cryptographically equivalent commitment to the yet-to-be-disclosed content. A later exchange of the uncompacted content is verifiable to an earlier partial disclosure. Another type of partial disclosure is the disclosure of metadata about the&nbsp;content.  Selective disclosure: In selective disclosure, the set of attributes is provided as an array of blinded blocks, where each attribute in the set has its own dedicated blinded block. A selectively-disclosable attribute section appears at the top level using the field label A, which is distinct from the field label a for a non-selectively-disclosable attribute section.  <p>To give an example that demonstrates the difference between partial and selective disclosure, let’s consider the following attribute block&nbsp;a:</p> # An example of an attribute block "a"<br>"a": {<br>  "d": "EA5Fm9mP5tWreQTw2xjiXYDDGzuPVtqyfekYIz6y2jMY",<br>  "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k",<br>  "name": "Jane Doe",<br>  "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, USA"<br>} <p>With selective disclosure, the attribute block may be transformed into a selectively-disclosable attribute block as&nbsp;follows:</p> # An example of a selectively-disclosable attribute block "A"<br>"A": [<br>  {<br>    "d": "EJ1FZBKhdVcAiaZS6eHAHMrL_ANysjLkyyOXTyAEA-lb",<br>    "u": "0AAJ1MJgB3aqLHNencIF-CcH",<br>    "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k"<br>  },<br>  {<br>    "d": "EL1EbFKUR_brFCt3knKOW92STd67AuNbRfmUzgplV12G",<br>    "u": "0ABLGaIT_A5yLMDEBUCCPaF7",<br>    "name": "Jane Doe"<br>  },<br>  {<br>    "d": "EN-gWdH5AWQwfdyGmK6CSA5ciXKZbvTYEvKXaSE-74rL",<br>    "u": "0AAlI8guN7866YoSeK7cZR5M",<br>    "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, USA"<br>  }<br>] <p>where each selectively-disclosable block has its own SAID d and a random universally unique identifier (UUID)&nbsp;"u".</p><p>By using random UUIDs for each selectively-disclosable block, an adversary—which possesses both the schema of the attribute block and its SAID—is not able to discover the remaining contents of the attribute block in a computationally feasible manner by using, e.g., a rainbow table attack. Therefore the UUID "u" field of each attribute block enables the associated SAID "d" field to securely blind the block’s contents.</p><blockquote>Note 1: The field labels of the selectively disclosable attributes are also blinded because they only appear within the blinded block. This prevents un-permissioned correlation via contextualized variants of a field label that appear in a selectively disclosable block.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: The primary difference between partial disclosure and selective disclosure is determined by the correlatability with respect to its encompassing block after its disclosure. A partially disclosable field becomes correlatable to its encompassing block after its disclosure whereas a selectively disclosable field does not. After selective disclosure, the selectively disclosed fields are not correlatable to the so-far undisclosed but selectively disclosable fields in the same encompassing block.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e">KERI jargon in a nutshell.

<p>With <a href="https://www.govtech.com/biz/data-suggests-one-third-of-state-it-systems-are-old-and-broken.html">68% of child support enforcement (CSE) systems aging</a>, most state agencies are currently modernizing them or preparing to modernize. More than <a href="https://www.govtech.com/biz/data-suggests-one-third-of-state-it-systems-are-old-and-broken.html">20% of families and children</a> are supported by these systems, and with the current constituents of these systems becoming more consumer technology-centric, the use of antiquated technology systems is archaic and unsustainable. At this point, families expect state agencies to have a modern, efficient child support system.</p>



<p>The following are some factors driving these states to pursue modernization:</p>



 
 Current systems are developed on mainframe-based systems using an antiquated, scarcely available technology stack. 



 The unavailability of a skilled workforce makes these systems expensive to operate, manage and enhance. 



 Child support programs are focusing on pioneering a new, holistic and family-focused delivery perspective to make families feel included, listened to and empowered. 



 Modernization will free caseworkers’ time to focus on and collaborate with families, rather than focusing on navigating an aging system. 
 



<p>To fulfill these ever-increasing citizen expectations to consume state-provided child support services, statewide child support systems need do the following:</p>



 
 Empower families to get help when, where and how they need it, including virtual and real-time communications. 



 Provide quick and transparent services to ease stress and frustration in times of need. 



 Be intuitive, user-friendly and cut down on manual effort. 



 Automate routine tasks to free up time to provide personalized services and build relationships with families. 



 Empower caseworkers with online tools to collaborate with colleagues and access knowledge repositories. 
 



<p>Existing systems simply are not able to provide the capabilities needed to realize this family-centered approach of service delivery and need to be modernized, immediately.</p>



 Every U.S. state is different 



<p>Core system requirements—such as new case initiation, providing location and establishment services, enforcing orders, handling financial transactions, etc.—are mandated by the <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ocse/certification_guide_2017_final.pdf">Office of Federal Child Support Enforcement (OCSE)</a>, making many state child support enforcement (CSE) systems similar.</p>



<p>Despite this commonality, every child support organization is unique, and each needs a tailored modernization approach that supports its vision and understands the reality “on the ground.” For example, the core systems technology landscape for each state could be a mainframe legacy system with varying degrees of maturity, portability, reliability and scalability.</p>



<p>States’ existing investment in modernizing ancillary systems (e.g., improved document management capabilities, web portals, mobile applications, data warehouses, enhanced location services, etc.) might negate the need for modernization for these systems. This, along with the overall maturity of CSEs, uninterrupted service requirements, state budget, timing, staffing, and other factors mandate a comprehensive modernization approach to pull in these investments.</p>



 IBM Consulting’s Accelerated Incremental Mainframe Modernization 



<p>Legacy applications, while being the current crown jewels of states’ IT ecosystems, hinder business agility and are expensive and complicated, therefore making any rebuild, refactor or integration attempts risky.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting">IBM Consulting’s</a> pioneering Accelerated Incremental Mainframe Modernization (AIMM) approach focuses on legacy modernization with a lens of incremental transformation, rather than just translation. Our approach focuses on business data domain-centric initiatives that can deliver value in the short term and create a development ecosystem conducive to incremental optimization—instead of a risky big-bang application and infrastructure update.</p>



<p>As highlighted in the graphic below, AIMM’s approach focuses on starting with a business and technology map alongside the client-specific IT ecosystems, instead of only a code conversion.</p>



<p>This helps us create a client journey with the co-existence of legacy and incrementally migrated functionality to the new digital core, eventually strangulating and sunsetting the legacy platforms.</p>



<p>The approach leverages <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-liberty/zos?topic=overview-zos-connect">IBM’s zOS connectors</a>, allowing us to shift the focus from application to data, move mainframe data in mainframe format into cloud storage (with near real-time, bidirectional data sync), and leverage new and modern cloud data management services. With its proven tools and processes, AIMM meets clients where they are in the legacy modernization journey, analyzing (auto-scan) legacy code, extracting business rules, converting it to modern language, deploying it to any cloud, and managing technology for transformational business outcomes. Ultimately, this helps states to realize their business goals and deliver value faster.</p>



A proven methodology, IBM assets, tools, cloud provider services and our ecosystem of partners and alliances drive IBM’s end-to-end mainframe modernization approach and deliver business value.



<p>The following are some of the industry-leading methodologies, tools and assets used by AIMM:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage">IBM Garage</a> brings together industry best practices, technical expertise and knowledge, client collaboration and partnership, cloud service providers, and the IBM Consulting teams to deliver accelerated outcomes. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/cloud-accelerator">IBM Consulting Cloud Accelerator (ICCA)</a> recommends client journeys without deep engineering knowledge, covering execution and modernization steps that take a workload from a source to a cloud destination. 



 IBM Asset Analysis Renovation Catalyst (AARC) automatically extracts the rules from the COBOL application source code and generates a knowledge model, which is then deployed into a rules engine like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/operational-decision-manager">IBM Operational Decision Manager</a>, Pega, etc. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/operational-decision-manager">IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM)</a> enables businesses to respond to real-time data by applying automated decisions, enabling business users to develop and maintain operational systems decision logic. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/ibm-expands-business-automation-portfolio-with-open-source-process-and-decision-automation">IBM’s open-source automated workflows</a> provide cross-cloud, AI-powered software designed to accelerate application modernization with pre-integrated data, automation and security capabilities, enabling business and IT teams to build and modernize applications faster. 
 



 Why IBM Consulting and AWS? 



<p>IBM is a Premier Consulting Partner for AWS, with 19,000+ AWS certified professionals across the globe, 16 service validations and 15 AWS competencies—becoming the fastest Global GSI to secure more AWS competencies and certifications among Top-16 AWS Premier GSI’s within 18 months. At re:Invent 2022, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/announcing-the-2022-regional-and-global-aws-partners-of-the-year/">IBM Consulting was awarded</a> the Global Innovation Partner of the Year and the GSI Partner of the Year for Latin America, cementing client and AWS trust in IBM Consulting as a trusted partner of choice, when it comes to AWS.</p>



<p>AWS has the biggest cloud infrastructure services vendor market share worldwide, averaging around 33% as of Q4 2022. AWS provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/">AWS GovCloud (US) Regions</a>, a flexible, pay-as-you-go pricing model, reliability, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp/">FedRAMP</a> compliance and flexibility of compute. This makes AWS a great choice for federal and state agencies looking to achieve operational efficiencies and innovate on demand to advance their mission across the nation.</p>



<p>As more states are finding new ways to leverage mainframes as part of their modernization strategy with hybrid cloud, IBM is leading the way and <a href="https://papers.govtech.com/How-State-and-Local-Governments-Can-Carve-Their-Own-Modernization-Path-141506.html">working with state and local governments</a> across various sectors, helping deliver more responsive services, digitize their operations, and advance equity and access.</p>



<p>As an example, IBM Consulting worked with the Department of Children and Families of a U.S. state to modernize their highly complex legacy application systems—comprised of 200 databases and 72 application modules into a strategic enterprise AWS cloud platform, resulting in 200M lines of Java code.</p>



<p>Leveraging <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage">IBM Garage Method for cloud</a>, IBM Consulting teams executed a proven factory-based approach (process, skills, tools) to do the following:</p>



 
 Deliver throughput and consistency in migration and rationalization. 



 Standardize on a core set of platforms, infrastructure and tools across environments—spanning multiple agencies and service providers. 



 Empower end users with self-service catalog management. 
 



<p>This resulted in a 50% reduction in annual operating costs, improving application response time by 3.5x, benefiting end-user experience, and moving the state to a “pay-as-you-go” model for a reduced upfront commitment. </p>



<p>In 2022, IBM Consulting leveraged AIMM and worked with another major U.S. city agency serving 19M citizens. They led the modernization and migration of 29 user-facing applications, developing standardized DevOps, technology, and quality-assurance processes while modernizing and migrating three legacy applications to AWS by Q1 2023.</p>

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>Throughout the past several decades, modern technology has evolved at amazing speeds, with the latest innovation being introduced as ‘Web3’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of these changes is to enhance the benefits that cutting-edge technology already brings us. However, as we enjoy the new technological trends, it’s important to understand the concept of Web3 at its core, with the good and the bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps most individuals are accustomed to the internet in its Web2 form, because it has been the most common platform for years now. Despite its convenience and familiarity, the centralized nature of Web2 limits its capabilities. Because of this, Web3 was designed with a focus on decentralization, individuality, and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These concepts align with SelfKey’s visions of a decentralized future, in which individuals may be able to exercise their SSID rights, as well as engage in a more secure, privacy-oriented environment. Web3 could be a network that may allow individuals the freedom to truly own their domains, ideas, and digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While all of this may be true, it’s important to recognize the risks which may come with the adoption of Web3 in our daily lives. It’s no longer a secret that cybercriminals lurk at every corner of these digital spaces, with victims ranging from common folk to large, seemingly powerful systems.</p>
<p>Given this, it’s important for individuals to stay informed with technology’s fast-paced evolution, the advantages and especially the challenges which come with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide on what Web3 is, how it works, the benefits it brings compared to Web2, as well as the risks. Additionally, we will discuss SelfKey’s proposed decentralized solutions which may enhance privacy and security as we step into Web3.</p>

 The Dark Side of Web3 
 Web3 and SelfKey 
 Conclusions 
 
 An Introduction to Web3&nbsp; 
<p>Evolution is natural in many aspects of life. With modern technology, however, it’s especially beneficial when networking and artificial intelligence can considerably enhance the way society functions. Let us discover the concept of Web3, what it is, and how it can affect our daily lives.</p>
 What is Web3? 
<p>Web3, or Web 3.0, represents a new vision for the next phase of the World Wide Web. It aims to integrate principles like decentralization, blockchain advancements, and token-driven economies.</p>
<p>The range of emerging technologies and projects it encompasses include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 decentralized finance (DeFi) 
 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 
 decentralized applications (dApps) 
 
<p>At its core, Web3 envisions a future where individuals have greater sovereignty over their digital lives. Where trust and transparency are built into the very fabric of the internet.</p>
 Web2 to Web3: How different are they? 
<p>Web2 is the current version of the internet, encompassing all the technologies and projects people are accustomed to nowadays. While Web2 has proven to be an inclusive and dynamic form of the web, it has its limitations due to its centralized nature. In this context, Web3 aims to enhance user freedom, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>There are many differences between Web2 and Web3. For now, let us explore two of the most prominent aspects which set them apart:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
<p>Web2 platforms and services are predominantly centralized, meaning they rely on centralized servers and intermediaries to operate. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon control and manage user data and have the authority to set rules and policies. Because of this, users have limited control over their data and are dependent on these centralized entities.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, emphasizes decentralization. It operates on peer-to-peer networks and blockchain technology, where data is distributed across multiple nodes. Users have greater control over their data and can interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) without the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts and consensus mechanisms enable decentralized governance models where the community collectively makes decisions, instead of relying on a single authority.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>In Web2, user data is often collected, stored, and controlled by centralized platforms. Users typically agree to terms and conditions that grant these platforms the right to use and monetize their data. Privacy concerns arise due to the potential for data breaches, surveillance, and unauthorized access to personal information.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, prioritizes user ownership and control over data. With decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain technology provides transparency and auditability, which may reduce the risk of unauthorized manipulation or access. Users have the ability to grant and revoke access to their data on a case-by-case basis, enhancing privacy and data sovereignty.</p>
<p>All in all, these differences highlight the shift from a centralized and controlled web to a more decentralized, user-centric, and economically empowering Web3 ecosystem.</p>
 Web3 Benefits and Opportunities 
<p>Due to its decentralized nature, and not only, Web3 can offer a multitude of benefits and opportunities. Let’s examine a few:</p>
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 Economic Empowerment 
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
<p>Web3 aims to decentralize power and eliminate the need for intermediaries by leveraging blockchain technology. This can result in a more trustless and transparent online environment. Users may interact directly with each other and verify transactions without relying on centralized authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to be a decentralized and trustless digital environment, due to its emphasis on limited data sharing.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>One thing that Web3 prioritizes is user ownership and control over personal data. This is also known as <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereignty</a>, and it aims to reduce the risk of data breaches by enabling individuals to be the sole owners of their data.</p>
<p>Through decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data. They can selectively grant access to their data and have more control over how it is used and shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shift towards user-centric data ownership may enhance privacy and empower individuals to protect their personal information.</p>
 Economic Empowerment 
<p>Another advantage of Web3 is that it introduces new economic models enabled by cryptocurrencies and tokens. This may allow individuals to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, where they can lend, borrow, and invest without relying on traditional financial intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization and the concept of ownership over digital assets may open new opportunities for creators, artists, and content providers to monetize their work directly. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, Web3 could potentially create more equitable economic systems.</p>
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
<p>Web3 aims to promote interoperability between different blockchain networks and protocols. This means that users may seamlessly interact with various decentralized applications (dApps) and move assets across different platforms without facing barriers or restrictions.&nbsp;It allows for a more connected and cohesive ecosystem where users may access a wide range of services and functionalities.</p>
<p>To aid this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a decentralized solution which may enhance digital privacy and security as individuals operate in these platforms.&nbsp;</p>
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
<p>Finally, Web3 enables decentralized governance models through mechanisms like smart contracts and decentralized <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">autonomous organizations (DAOs)</a>. This allows users to have a say in the decision-making processes of the platforms they engage with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can participate in voting, propose changes, and contribute to the development and evolution of the platforms they use. And this fosters a sense of community ownership and collaboration, empowering users to shape the direction of the platforms and protocols they rely on.</p>
<p>All in all, these benefits highlight Web3’s potential to transform the internet into a more user-centric, transparent, and inclusive ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that Web3 is still an emerging concept. Therefore, its actual realization and impact will depend on the development and adoption of relevant technologies and applications.</p>
 The Dark Side of Web3 
<p>While Web3 brings potential benefits, it also presents certain risks and challenges that need to be considered. It’s important to be aware of these challenges in order to take preventive measures and remain vigilant.</p>
<p>Here are five potential risks that may occur with Web3:</p>
 
 Security and Privacy Concerns 
 Bots and Maliciously-used AI 
 User Responsibility and Risks 
 
 Security and Privacy Concerns 
<p>As Web3 relies heavily on blockchain technology and decentralized systems, it introduces unique security and privacy considerations. Although blockchain is renowned for its robust security, vulnerabilities and exploits can still occur.</p>
<p>Additionally, decentralized storage and peer-to-peer networks may face privacy challenges. Therefore, they require careful attention to encryption, data protection, and identity management to ensure user privacy.</p>
 Bots and Maliciously-used AI 
<p>In Web3, identity and reputation systems can be compromised by bots through <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/sybil-attack/#:~:text=A%20Sybil%20attack%20uses%20a,of%20influence%20in%20the%20network.">sybil attacks</a>. Bots can create multiple fake identities to gain influence, voting power, or access to certain resources within decentralized networks. This can undermine the trust and fairness of the system.</p>
<p>Bad players can also program AI to distribute spam messages or engage in phishing attacks within decentralized communication platforms. These attacks aim to deceive users into sharing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links, compromising their security and privacy.</p>
 User Responsibility and Risks 
<p>Web3 shifts more responsibility onto users, as they have greater control over their digital assets and interactions. With increased control comes increased risk, as users are solely responsible for managing their private keys. This includes securing their wallets, and avoiding scams or fraudulent activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>User error or negligence can result in irreversible loss of funds or unauthorized access to personal data, necessitating heightened user awareness and education.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize these risks and address them proactively. One can do this through responsible development, regulatory frameworks, user education, and sustainable practices. The purpose is to maximize the promising benefits of Web3 while mitigating potential downsides.</p>
 Web3 and SelfKey 
<p>Web3 could considerably enhance the internet as we know it. Through decentralization and user-centricity, it could become a digital space in which users may engage with one another without limitations to their privacy and individuality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This aligns with SelfKey's focus on privacy and individuality, as well as its aim to develop decentralized solutions that may increase privacy and security. The goal is for individuals to enjoy the benefits Web3 may offer, without having to constantly worry about the safety of their private data.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few of SelfKey’s proposed decentralized solutions which may enable individuals to operate in Web3 more securely.</p>
 Self Sovereign Identity (SSID) 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">SSID</a> is an innovative method of managing online identities, which aims to put the user in control of their digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey aims to incorporate SSID into its decentralized solutions, which may ensure that users have complete autonomy over their personal data at all times. Enabling individuals to fully own and manage their private information may significantly diminish the risks associated with data breaches and identity theft.</p>
<p>The absence of third-party involvement allows users to have complete visibility and control over the storage and accessibility of their data. And this may enable them to make informed decisions regarding its usage and sharing.</p>
 SelfKey DAO 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to be a trustless and decentralized digital environment, which may enable individuals to exercise their SSID rights. By limiting the private data which they share, individuals may reduce the risk of data breaches and identity theft, and this may enable them to operate in the DAO more confidently.</p>
<p>Another of SelfKey DAO’s main purposes is to treat individuals with fairness, equality, and transparency. It aims to take every member’s propositions, thoughts, and opinions into consideration, to facilitate a decision-making process which is responsive to users’ needs.&nbsp;</p>
 SelfKey ID 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> was designed with SSID in mind, with a strong emphasis on digital privacy and security. Not only that, but individuals may use it for accessing both Web2 and Web3 projects and applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey provides <a href="https://selfkey.org/a-guide-to-using-selfkey-id-for-digital-identity-verification/">a guide</a> on how SelfKey iD may be used for online identity verification, as well as the benefits it may bring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with increased privacy and security, SelfKey iD also aims to enable individuals to truly express themselves in current and future online spaces. By attaching a <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">Normie</a> to SelfKey iD as a profile picture, users may showcase their personality, hobbies, and uniqueness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is to promote individuality, so that users may be able to confidently show their originality in cyberspace, without divulging sensitive or personal information.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Whether we’re talking about Web2, Web3, or any other future version of the internet, it’s important to always keep privacy and security in mind. These innovative online spaces can be quite disarming due to their immersive nature and the illusion of choice when it comes to the safety of our personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this reason, SelfKey aims to develop decentralized solutions which may offer the convenience of centralized systems, with the benefits of decentralized systems. In the meantime, it’s vital to remain informed about the potential risks, and take preventive measures to avoid putting our digital identities in danger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By prioritizing security and privacy, SelfKey strives to empower individuals to embrace technology without sacrificing the safety of their digital identity.</p>

 It’s not about signing; it’s about the use case 
<p>In this two-part blog series we provide an overview of the problems around digitization, specifically on the challenges with remote signatures and some of the options available to limit the risks of fraud and increase confidence in your signing process.</p>
<p>The move to electronic signatures over pen-and-paper ones did not start with the COVID-19 pandemic – in fact, most of today’s laws regulating the use of electronic signatures were published in the early 2000s to facilitate the growing needs of online commerce.</p>
<p>But, it’s fair to say that the pandemic did represent an important transition in the world of digitization and electronic signing: Within the last two years, electronic signatures went from a “nice to have” – and organizations who deployed them were considered innovative – to a must-have that’s here to stay. Electronic signature solutions provide so much more traceability and efficiency than the traditional pen-and-paper version that there is little chance you would think about reverting to print &amp; sign.</p>
<p>What you may be wondering, however, is how to digitize the rest of your signature and other approval processes that still rely on in-person, face-to-face interactions. These processes are typically high-value and considered critical to a business; you may be reluctant to digitize them over fear that using a remote signature would increase risks of fraud, impersonation, document repudiation, nullification, etc.</p>
<p>Signatures are evidence of intent, consent… and identity</p>
<p>The admissibility of an electronic signature very much depends on the law(s) and regulation(s) that apply to your organization, and your local attorney will be best positioned to advise you on the specific requirements for your signatures.</p>
<p>Some industries are good at providing frameworks to enable remote business while mitigating the risk of fraud. For example, the banking sector is known for its strong regulations and standards for identity verification (i.e., Anti-Money Laundering, Know-Your-Customer, etc.) and these can easily be reused as part of a signing process.</p>
<p>But your organization’s industry may not have come up with such standards yet. If you are looking for solutions to ensure that your signatories are properly identified before they sign your documents remotely to limit your risks, there are several options for you to consider – and for which Entrust can help:</p>
 
 ID or passport checking software/service 
 Identity verification services from a publicly trusted certification authority (CA) – or a qualified trust service provider (QTSP) in the European Union 
 Private or national eID schemes 
 
<p>Therefore a good first step toward the digitization of your business-critical processes is to work out which of these options would be suitable for your organization from a security, legal, and compliance point of view. Definitions and requirements for electronic signatures vary across countries and states; this is why electronic signature requirements should always be discussed on a case-by-case basis with your legal department and/or an attorney.</p>
<p>Software and services related to identity verification are ideal when you are looking to fully own and control the process. However, not all solutions in the market are designed to be used as part of a remote signing process, so it’s important to pick the solution adapted to your specific use case(s).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most widely used option for remote electronic signatures that provide strong evidence of the signatory’s identity and consent to sign, is to work with public CAs (and QTSPs if you are in the European Union). These authorities specialize in verifying identities of organizations and people as part of a signing process. The verified identity details are issued in special credentials called digital certificates, which can in turn can be used to generate digital signatures.</p>
<p>Finally, eID schemes are becoming more and more prominent, especially in the European Union thanks to the eIDAS Regulation, but remain limited to certain industries or countries. In the second part of this blog series, we will provide further insights into digital signatures and eID schemes, but you can already <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-signing/digital-signing-as-a-service/remote-signing-service/rss-infographic">check out our Digital Signing 101 infographic</a>, and learn more about our signing-related solutions here:</p>

			 The New Financial World: AI Meets Tokenization 
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain are two groundbreaking technologies that have the potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance and investment. When combined, they can create powerful synergies that enable more efficient and optimized decision-making processes. The prospect of these two potent and transformative technologies intertwining is thrilling, yet somewhat daunting, given their virtually limitless potentials.</p>
<p>Tokeny has always been at the forefront of technology. In fact,&nbsp;in 2018 we started to bridge AI with tokenization. Identity checks of individual investors are already greatly accelerated by the KYC software solutions that are integrated into our onboarding processes. The software compares investors’ identity documents with the information and “liveness” tests by using AI-powered face scans to verify the user matches the photo on authorized documents. Furthermore, our tokenization platform represents these ID verifications on the blockchain with on-chain identities, which makes these certifications actionable. Token issuers, DeFi protocols, and other relevant users can trust these identity proofs to enforce compliance or filter their participants.</p>
<p>However, this example is just the tip of the iceberg. We believe that AI’s ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data with speed and accuracy is invaluable in the financial realm. It can&nbsp;help investors and financial institutions make better-informed decisions&nbsp;by identifying patterns, trends, and correlations that may go unnoticed by human analysts, or simply take too much time to find. AI algorithms can analyze market data, news articles, social media sentiment, and other relevant information to generate real-time insights and predictions on markets and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>One area where AI excels already is in portfolio optimization. By utilizing advanced algorithms, AI can identify optimal investment strategies based on an investor’s risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. It can analyze historical market data, perform risk assessments, and make dynamic adjustments to portfolios, ensuring they remain aligned with the investor’s objectives. This already exists and is continually evolving at an outrageous speed.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;without a programmable financial infrastructure, it would be too complex for AI applications to take action&nbsp;based on their conclusions, and achieve the goals requested by its owner. An AI agent cannot easily open a bank account, move money, buy and sell assets, or anything in that nature.</p>
<p>Here is where blockchain technology comes into play: Blockchain networks provide a programmable and secure infrastructure that enhances the transparency, integrity, and trustworthiness of financial transactions, and enables programs to access valuable financial resources. By leveraging blockchain, AI systems can access real-time, tamper-proof market data and execute trades directly on decentralized protocols.</p>
<p>Indeed, smart contracts, a key feature of blockchain technology, enable the automation of financial agreements and transactions. AI algorithms can leverage smart contracts to autonomously execute predefined investment strategies, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs.&nbsp;Artificial intelligence decides, and the blockchain executes.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Our prediction is that the integration of AI and blockchain technologies has the potential to optimize financial and investment decisions in a variety of ways. AI’s data analysis capabilities can provide real-time insights and assist in portfolio optimization, while blockchain networks enhance transparency and automation. Together, they enable more efficient and trustworthy financial services, paving the way for a future where decentralized and AI-powered systems play a central role in optimizing our financial decisions.</p>
<p>Blockchain networks are the programmable financial infrastructure that AI has been missing. Now the technology is there, the only missing part is a large selection of tokenized assets.</p>
<p>What do you think about AI: Opportunity, or the path to apocalypse?</p>

<p><a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-2-2023-bluesky-beta-app">Since our last update</a>, quite a bit has changed. Just a few months ago in February, we only had a couple hundred users, and in April, we crossed 50,000 users. We recently passed 100,000 users, and are excited that so many people have joined us. Our priorities continue to be a focus on moderation and curation to ensure a safe and pleasant environment for users, and protocol work to launch federation.</p>
 Recently Released Features 
 
 Custom feeds. Users can have more ownership over their social media experience by <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">picking the algorithms</a> that power their feeds. So far, third-party developers have created feeds ranging from mutuals only, first posts from new users, cat photos, the #nba hashtag, and more. 
 Blocks and mutelists. Blocks on Bluesky prevent interaction, and organizations and community leaders can maintain shared mutelists for others to subscribe to. 
 More fine-grained content moderation controls. Users are able to select hide, warn, or show for content categories ranging from nudity to impersonation. 
 Custom domains as handles. Both individuals and organizations can set their account handle to their domain, creating a unique identifier across the network. Read our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">tutorial here</a> for how to set this up. 
 Production desktop app. We launched the desktop web app at <a href="https://bsky.app/">https://bsky.app/</a>. 
 Invite codes per account. We added server-level tooling to distribute invites on a regular cadence. Previously, accounts did not have invite codes of their own. 
 Accessibility improvements. We added alt text to images, an improved dark mode, and more. 
 App passwords. We released this as a short-term solution for people to use with third-party apps while we continue to work on Single Sign-On (SSO).

 The AT Protocol Developer Ecosystem 
<p>As the number of beta testers on Bluesky continues to grow, so too does the size of our developer community. Recent updates from our team include:</p>
 
 Open-sourced client. We published the code that powers the Bluesky social app <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app">publicly on GitHub</a> and are accepting community contributions (but please read the rules and guidelines first!). 
 Feed generator starter kit. We published a <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator">GitHub repository with a template</a> for developers to build custom feeds. 
 Community documentation. We’ve published a <a href="https://atproto.com/community">community page</a> on our <a href="https://atproto.com/">protocol documentation site</a> with links to a quick start guide, community projects, and developer groups to join. 
 
<p>To see projects from community developers, you can visit <a href="https://atproto.com/community/projects">this page</a>, or if you have a Bluesky account, check out the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atproto.com">@atproto.com</a> account. Some highlights include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/connect-bluesky-to-flipboard/">Flipboard</a> added Bluesky integration, so now you can browse Bluesky content from within Flipboard 
 Skylink is a <a href="https://skylinkchrome.com/">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://skylinkff.com">Firefox</a> extension that detects if the domain is linked to a Bluesky profile as you browse the web, which really exemplifies the “social internet” 
 <a href="https://bsky.jazco.dev/">Atlas</a> maps the social clusters on the network, and is a fun way of visualizing communities joining the beta 
 <a href="https://skyfeed.app/">SkyFeed</a> surfaced custom feeds even before we released them in the official Bluesky app 
 
 Roadmap and Growth 
<p>A few weeks ago, we intentionally slowed our invite roll-out while we built more moderation tooling and capacity for users on the app. We staffed a content moderation team with shifts that cover a 24/7 schedule, and consulted with trust and safety experts to establish new processes and policies to support a growing userbase. We’ve resumed sending out daily invites to the <a href="https://bsky.app/">waitlist</a>, which is where the majority of users already on Bluesky received their invites. For those who don’t know someone personally with an invite code, the waitlist is the fastest way to receive a code, though please be patient as we work through the list.</p>
<p>We recently shared our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/5-5-2023-federation-architecture">technical architecture for federation</a> and are releasing a sandbox environment for developers to test soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who have used the feedback form within the app; we’ve heard your product feedback over the last few months. In the near future, you can expect these features and improvements as we move towards federation:</p>
 
 Improved labeling, reporting, and related moderation tooling 
 Account portability between servers 
 Updated community guidelines for the app 
 Protocol documentation and specifications 
 
<p>Meanwhile, we’re actively hiring. If you’re eager to join our effort to build the open social web, please apply to one of the listings on our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/join">jobs page</a>.</p>
 Giving Feedback 
<p>When the population of beta testers was even in the tens of thousands, it was still fairly manageable for the team to receive bug reports and requests from tags and mentions directly in the app. However, this method of feedback does not scale, so we’ve implemented some changes to our preferred feedback routes. Please do not tag the entire team’s personal profiles for bug reports or support requests in the app — this makes it difficult to surface important notifications. Instead:</p>
 
 To flag specific posts or profiles for the team’s attention, please use the in-app reporting feature. Our mods review every report we receive. 
 For bug reports or app feedback, please use the feedback form in the app itself (located in the side menu on mobile or the right side on desktop). 
 If you’re familiar with GitHub, you can also file an issue <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social">on our repos</a>, though please read our contribution guidelines in the README first. 
 For support requests, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a>. 
 For security reports, please email us at <a href="mailto:security@bsky.app">security@bsky.app</a> or visit <a href="https://bsky.app/.well-known/security.txt">https://bsky.app/.well-known/security.txt</a>.

This week, users can earn rewards up to 150K OCEAN. In DF Main, weekly rewards will grow to 1M+&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>In DF40 we’re introducing the ability for participants to engage in veOCEAN Delegation via our <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/delegate">df.oceandao.org</a> portal. This enables users with multiple wallets, apy optimizers, and new mechanisms to be built upon Data Farming’s Active Rewards&nbsp;stream.</p><p>The article <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">“Ocean Data Farming Main is Here”</a> has the full details of DF Main. In fact, it’s a self-contained description of Ocean Data Farming (DF), including all the details that matter. It is up-to-date with the latest reward function, weekly OCEAN allocation, and estimates of APYs given the current amount of OCEAN&nbsp;staked.</p><p>DF is like DeFi liquidity mining or yield farming, but is tuned to drive data consume volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem.

How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As a participant, follow these step on how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  Passive and Active Rewards are distributed on Ethereum mainnet. Click “Claim”, sign the tx, and collect your&nbsp;rewards  <p>Rewards accumulate over weeks so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF40&nbsp;Overview <p>DF40 is part of DF Main, phase 1. This phase emits 150K OCEAN / week and runs for 52 weeks total. (A detailed DF Main schedule is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.)</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Some key parameters:</p>  Total budget is 150,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  <p>Active rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>For further details, see the “<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#c9d1">DF Reward Function Details”</a> in DF Main Appendix.</p><p>As usual, the Ocean core team reserves the right to update the DF rewards function and parameters, based on observing behavior. Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 4. Introducing veOCEAN Delegation <p>To continue improving accessibility and composability of Data Farming, delegation has been introduced into the UI, and integrated into Active&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>Starting in DF40 participants can delegate their Allocation Power via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/delegate">df.oceandao.org/delegate</a> to facilitate coordination between wallets, apy optimizers, or to engineer novel mechanisms.</p><p>This is the same implementation as veCRV’s veDelegate mechanism and has been available for a close to 1 year. However it’s delegation mechanism is now woven into Data Farming’s Active Rewards&nbsp;stream.</p><p>Addresses being delegated to will start receiving the rewards generated by participating in Data Farming and helping to curate quality assets that generate DCV (Data Consume&nbsp;Volume).</p> 4.1 Steps to delegate your&nbsp;veOCEAN   Go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/delegate">DF Portal — Delegate</a> and enter or copy the wallet address you wish to delegate to into the ‘Receiver wallet address’&nbsp;field.  Click the Delegate button and sign the transaction. You can view information about your delegation in the My Delegations component.  If needed, you can cancel the delegation to regain your Allocation Power before the delegation expires.   4.2 Steps after delegation. <p>When you delegate, you transfer 100% of your veOCEAN Allocation Power for a limited period. After delegation, you cannot manage your allocations until the delegation expires.</p><p>The delegation expiration date is the same as the veOCEAN lock end date at the time of delegation. If necessary, you can extend your lock before delegating.</p><p>If you extend your lock, you have to update your delegation.</p><p>You can cancel your delegation at any&nbsp;time.</p> Conclusion <p>DF39 has completed. To claim rewards, go to<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF40 begins Jun 1, 2023 at 12:01am UTC. It ends Jun 08, 2023 at 12:01am&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>DF40 is part of DF Main. For this phase of DF Main, the rewards budget is 150K OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>Starting in DF40 participants can delegate their Allocation Power via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/delegation">df.oceandao.org</a> to improve their UX when engaging with Data Farming and Active&nbsp;Rewards.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Flux is a fully distributed, human-centered platform that facilitates social coordination with greater privacy, agency, and flexibility. With a Discord style design for communities to grow on, Flux is customizable open-source software made for Web3 integrations.</p> Flux at a Glance <p>Description: Flux is a fully distributed, Discord style platform.</p>  Website: <a href="https://fluxsocial.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Fluxsocial.io</a>  Developer Docs: <a href="https://docs.fluxsocial.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">docs.fluxsocial.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp?ref=blog.holochain.org">discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/flux_social?ref=blog.holochain.org">@flux_social</a>   Why is Flux being built? <p>When using traditional social media applications you are always restricted by the feature sets that the developers of that specific app have decided to implement. Discord, Facebook, Slack, and others are all implementing features like events, chat, groups, posts etc. The vision for Flux is to become a general purpose platform for collaboration. Community members themselves decide which features they want to install using our plugin store. And any developer can extend their community’s plugins by developing their own.</p> Why did they choose Holochain? <p>Flux is built on AD4M, which is an agent-centric framework for decentralized social applications. The core of AD4M uses Holochain, which makes Flux extendable and customizable while ensuring validation rules are enforced. </p><p>Flux, as a project, grew out of Junto which had set out to build a social media platform using Holochain where people held their own data. As it developed Junto shifted focus to more intimate communities, becoming Flux. The importance of agent-centricity and data ownership remains however. So while there are many p2p technologies out there, Holochain continues to be a key tool for delivering on this vision.</p> Flux Ecosystem Session <p>Get a hands on view of Flux as David Atkinson downloads and uses the app with the Flux team in an ecosystem session.</p> Can you say more about the collaborative potential of Flux? <p>While the collaborative nature of Flux seems apparent in its basic Discord-like features, its true power lies beneath the surface. First, as an AD4M app, Flux is completely interoperable with any other AD4M app — meaning you can see data from Flux in any other UI built over AD4M. This means you could turn chat messages into “to-do” stickies in a different view, without actually duplicating or siloing any data. Because AD4M decouples data from the front-end, it’s super simple to develop new apps or UIs, deploy them, and invite others to use them with you. In this way, Flux is a fully evolvable and extendable platform in which any user can develop new features and put them into play with others. </p> How are they using Holochain? <p>AD4M is a sort of spanning layer that connects lots of different protocols together, from Ethereum to AWS. AD4M uses Holochain to store these connections and ensure their security. While it is designed to connect all of these different protocols together, AD4M needs Holochain to bootstrap everything and make it open, resilient, and scalable.</p><p>In many ways AD4M is an extension upon Holochain, taking the same root ideas of agent-centricity, and giving them access to all of these other systems to interact with. Holochain is the key enabler of this social technology.</p> Can you say a little about your experience developing on Holochain? <p>The way that Flux accesses Holochain through the AD4M spanning layer makes it even easier to build applications on Holochain as the SDK really feels like working with a traditional real time database like Firebase! This is a different way of interacting with Holochain than most developer teams have, but we really think that this is just the beginning of all the ways this technology will be used. We are learning and building alongside Holochain with excitement for the future. </p> How can I get involved? <p>Join the AD4M Discord, where you can connect with us about Flux and other AD4M apps: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp?ref=blog.holochain.org">discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp</a><br><br>Try Flux yourself! First download ad4m (<a href="https://ad4m.dev/download/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ad4m.dev/download</a>), and then connect to Flux (<a href="https://app.fluxsocial.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">app.fluxsocial.io/</a>) and join our test community.</p>

<p>Successful businesses are embracing the power of AI to help streamline operations, generate insights, boost productivity and drive more value for clients. However, for many enterprises, the barrier to entry for integrating trustworthy, scalable and transparent AI remains high. In fact, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4036699">80% of enterprise AI projects never make it out of the lab</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how do businesses that want to incorporate AI move forward when there is such a high level of difficulty? Many have turned to IBM’s portfolio of AI offerings, which provides pre-trained AI models that can be integrated into existing applications to improve process efficiency, enabling organizations to direct their resources to more valuable tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://krista.ai/">Krista Software</a> is an example of how IBM enables business partners to integrate IBM’s embeddable AI software portfolio in their offerings as a cost-effective and risk-averse way to help clients benefit from AI technology without needing to build the infrastructure from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>



 The challenge of staying one step ahead in mobile security&nbsp; 



<p>Dallas-based <a href="https://www.zimperium.com/">Zimperium</a> provides a mobile-first security platform purpose-built for enterprise environments. With machine learning-based protection through a single platform, Zimperium offers customers mobile threat defense and in-app protection. To provide continuous and persistent security for customers, Zimperium relies upon timely software releases to remain one step ahead of emerging threats on corporate and user-owned mobile devices. However, until recently, their software deployment process was time-consuming, requiring a lot of human interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, Zimperium maintains hundreds of software environments on any given day, and their engineers must run multiple releases — which include patches, updates and hard fixes — through an entire deployment cycle for each of those environments. Every release undergoes a rigorous approval cycle that involves high-touch coordination between customer success and pre-sales teams. Once the software is approved, engineers deploy and apply each release to all environments. With thousands of deployments each year, many taking up to 3 weeks, Zimperium turned to Krista Software to help streamline its process.&nbsp;</p>



 Krista Software helps Zimperium automate operations with IBM Watson&nbsp; 



<p>Vamsi Kurukuri, VP of Site Reliability at Zimperium, developed a strategy to remove roadblocks and pain points in Zimperium’s deployment process. He then selected Krista’s AI-powered intelligent automation platform to optimize Zimperium’s project management suite, messaging solutions, development and operations (DevOps). Krista’s platform uses machine learning and IBM Watson NLP, allowing Zimperium engineers to “Ask Krista” for a business outcome, streamlining tasks such as creating IT tickets, sending notifications to eligible team members and sending reminders when approvals are needed, enabling Krista to own the outcome for each deployment cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us/products/krista">Krista platform</a> follows each ticket throughout the development cycle, ensures every step is adhered to, and that the right software is ready to be deployed to the right servers at the right time. Once all parties approve the release, Krista then deploys it. With Krista, Zimperium automated its software deployment process, reducing a 4+ hour manual process to mere minutes, across hundreds of environments. This improvement led to over USD 200,000 in savings and empowered Zimperium’s engineers and developers to focus on what they do best: developing secure software for their clients.&nbsp;</p>



 Powering change: IBM’s embeddable AI software portfolio&nbsp; 



<p>With the support of Krista Software, Zimperium automated its entire scheduling and deployment process in less than two months, helping them release updates faster, address human error and regulatory requirements, improve efficiency and reduce risk with no data science and coding requirements. Zimperium saw significant cost savings and increased efficiency as it helped protect its clients against both known and unknown cybersecurity threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building on the success delivered in less than 60 days, Krista and Zimperium are entering the next phase of the relationship, in which Krista will use IBM Watson to help optimize Zimperium’s order-to-cash process and automate its international customer support. Krista also plans to continue to deepen its work with IBM, including exploring the upcoming <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-05-09-IBM-Unveils-the-Watsonx-Platform-to-Power-Next-Generation-Foundation-Models-for-Business">IBM watsonx AI and data platform</a>, to help clients like Zimperium unlock AI’s true potential.</p>

<p>In preparing to welcome students back to campus at the beginning of each year, semester, or quarter, many higher education institutions struggle with managing the process of registering students. With 80% to 90% of school identification cards printed during a short registration period, it’s not uncommon for campuses to experience long lines of students crammed into small registration offices waiting to receive their credentials. And, with a greater focus on school security and safety, campuses are increasingly adopting secure identification credentials to help mitigate unauthorized access into campus facilities.</p>
<p>With our expert guidance, you can learn how to ensure your card printers perform consistently and produce high-quality student ID credentials while minimizing costs and security risks. These best practices will help ensure your student ID program is ready so you can confidently and seamlessly welcome students back to campus.</p>
<p>Here are three essential tips every campus card office needs to know now:</p>
 
 Ensuring proper maintenance of your ID card printers 
 
<p>To ensure optimal printer performance for your student ID program, it’s crucial that the printer is cleaned according to manufacturer recommendations. We recommend cleaning after every 500 cards are printed or every ribbon change. Cleaning regularly will significantly reduce cost as well as technical cleaning, which requires the services of a technician and can be costly. Additionally, regular cleaning ensures that your printer consistently prints high-quality cards every time, that your credential administrators have a better user experience, that printer downtime as well as service calls are minimized, and that the life of the printer and printhead are extended.</p>
 
 Minimizing costs 
 
<p>You can do several things before the next school year begins that will help reduce future maintenance and service costs. As mentioned above, if you clean your printer with care, you will reduce the number of service requests and calls, as well as waste. This also helps extend the printhead life, which means fewer replacements to pay for. We also recommend testing your card stock and card technology to ensure they are compatible with your printer. Another thing to look at is your supplies inventory to prevent last-minute purchases. Do you have everything you need to start the school year strong? Finally, follow the printer User Guide’s storage and shelf-life recommendations to extend the printer’s life as long as possible.</p>
 
 Reducing security risks 
 
<p>ID credential issuance manufacturers often release updates regularly to enhance security. Take advantage of each update – don’t ignore them; they are there for a reason. It’s also important to follow through with any recommended software driver and firmware updates to minimize the possibility of security breaches. Ensure you have the latest version of Instant ID software to resolve any existing software and hardware issues.</p>

     <p>Stablecoins have been featured as another controversial topic across 2020, and the G20 looks set to keep the debate a hot one into 2021.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>This week, finance ministers from the G20 countries <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfgeneral/documents/g20-riyadh-summit.html">issued a statement </a>that included remarks on stablecoins. The statement notes that technological innovation is critical in light of the COVID-19 crisis, but it stresses that the G20 will remain alert to risks from new financial technologies and singles out stablecoins.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>According to the G20: “No so-called ‘global stablecoins’ should commence operation until all relevant legal, regulatory and oversight requirements are adequately addressed through appropriate design and by adhering to applicable standards.”</p> 
     <p>While not necessarily a new position from the G20, underscores the concerns that&nbsp; financial policymakers have about innovations such as Facebook's Diem, formerly known as Libra, which <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebooks-controversial-libra-cryptocurrency-could-launch-in-january/">news reports suggest may launch as soon as January</a>. As the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Virtual-Assets-FATF-Report-G20-So-Called-Stablecoins.pdf">also highlighted in a report this year,</a> financial watchdogs are concerned that the international financial system could face new systemic financial crime risks if stablecoins are launched at a global scale rapidly. The G20’s statement also coincided with the release of a report by the <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work905.pdf">Bank for International Settlements</a> examining the risks of stablecoins and potential policy responses.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>At Elliptic, we feel the financial crime risks from stablecoins are ultimately manageable and don’t require a heavy-handed response. Our blockchain analytics solutions enable cryptoasset businesses to <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/cryptoasset-coverage">monitor transactions in stablecoins</a>, ensuring regulatory compliance and management of financial crime risks.&nbsp;</p>

      Crypto.com Gets the Green Light from Regulators in Malta  
     <p>Don’t worry, it’s not all controversy out there! This week also saw positive “firsts” for the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>Hong Kong-based Crypto.com <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-com-malta-financial-services-authority">became the first cryptoasset business to receive conditional approval for a license in Malta.</a> In 2018, the European island country <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2018/07/05/maltese-parliament-passes-laws-that-set-regulatory-framework-for-blockchain-cryptocurrency-and-dlt/">launched a cryptoasset legal framework </a>that many claimed would make it a sought-after destination for crypto businesses from around the world. In fact, progress in implementing the regime has been slow. The Malta Financial Services Authority has taken its time in rolling out its licensing process – <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/as-malta-delays-regulatory-clarity-fewer-firms-remain-on-blockchain-island">leading some crypto businesses to leave the island rather than wait for license approval</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>The MFSA’s conditional approval to Crypto.com is a sign that things may be changing. Importantly, the licenses they're due to receive could allow Crypto.com to be grandfathered into the European Commission's proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a> framework, which would greatly expand regulatory requirements for European crypto businesses in the future.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>We hope the news about Crypto.com’s progress in Malta is a sign of good things to come there. If your crypto business is looking to obtain regulatory approval in Malta, <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/schedule-demo">contact us </a>to learn more about how Elliptic's blockchain analytics solutions can assist you in gaining regulators’ confidence.&nbsp;</p> 
      France’s Crypto Registration Deadline Looms  
     <p>In France this week, regulators issued an important warning to cryptoasset businesses: get your registration applications in, or else!</p> 
     <p>The Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF) and the Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/fr/actualites-publications/communiques/communiques-de-lamf/lamf-et-lacpr-rappellent-que-la-periode-transitoire-pour-exercer-une-activite-sur-actifs-numeriques">issued a statement</a> this week reminding cryptoasset exchanges and custodians they have until December 18th to register with regulators if they have already been operating in France. Those who fail to register by the deadline face two years’ imprisonment and a fine.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>The statement shows that the AMF and ACPR are serious about enforcing the <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/news-publications/news/towards-new-regime-crypto-assets-france">cryptoasset framework France first proposed in spring 2019</a>, and that formally rolled out in December 2019. At that time, cryptoasset exchanges and custodians already operating were given one year to register with the AMF – and that deadline is fast approaching.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>To date, <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/professionals/fintech/my-relations-amf/obtain-dasp-authorisation-1">five cryptoasset exchanges have had their registration successful approved by the AMF</a>. Any cryptoasset exchange or custodian operating in France needs to have a robust compliance program in place if it wants its registration approved by the AMF. That includes having in place a <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/crypto-aml-compliance">strong blockchain analytics solution</a> to enable you to detect high risk wallets and transactions.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p><a href="https://www.elliptic.co/schedule-demo">Contact us</a> to learn more about how we can assist your cryptoasset business in meeting the AMF's requirements.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/analysis/crypto-regulatory-affairs-iran-and-russia-exploring-cross-border-stablecoin-settlements" title="">  </a> 
  
  
   
    
     
      
     <p>In a move that could have significant implications for sanctions evasion utilizing cryptocurrencies, local Russian news outlets are <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/iran-and-russia-want-to-issue-new-stablecoin-backed-by-gold">reporting</a> that Russia and Iran are considering collaboration to skirt financial and economic restrictions imposed by the US and other countries.</p> 
     <p>On January 16th, reports emerged from Russia indicating that the country intends to partner with Iran to create a stablecoin for use in cross-border trade settlement. The reports suggest that the stablecoin would be gold-backed, and would enable Russia to pay for shipping imports from Iran in the face of severe banking restrictions that both countries face due to sanctions.</p> 
     <p>The move would not mark the first time a new cryptocurrency was created to enable sanctions evasion; in 2018, the government of Venezuela launched the petro, a cryptocurrency it created to settle oil imports in the face of sanctions, while reducing reliance on the US dollar.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>The news has not yet been confirmed by sources outside Russia, and it is not clear whether the proposed move has been officially given its blessing by either country’s government. The reports also suggest Russia would not undertake such a move until it has finalized a proposed legal and regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, which is still making its way through the legislative process.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>However, if true, the reports would hardly come as a surprise. As Elliptic’s previous research has shown, Iran has since 2018 used its vast energy reserves to engage in Bitcoin mining to circumvent sanctions, <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/how-iran-uses-bitcoin-mining-to-evade-sanctions-and-export-millions-of-barrels-of-oil/">generating as much as $1 billion in revenue</a> in the process. Last year, Iran acknowledged that it has used Bitcoin to pay for imports – a form of settlement that allows it to transact outside the banking system.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>Russia, for its part, has had a mixed history with crypto, and at one point leaned towards banning it. However, following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent imposition of expansive sanctions, Moscow has taken a more open stance – setting out a proposed regulatory framework that would allow crypto to be used in international trade settlement. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also stated publicly that the country could establish a competitive advantage in Bitcoin mining owing to its energy reserves, which would allow it to take a page from Iran’s playbook. In April 2022, the <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/news/russia-ukraine-conflict-daily-update-april-22nd-2022/">US Treasury sanctioned BitRiver</a>, an Russian mining company, in an apparent effort to preempt Russia’s efforts to rely on mining to evade sanctions.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>Based on these developments, a prospective Russia-Iran stablecoin settlement project is hardly far-fetched. Any such attempt would undoubtedly be met with a response from the US, which in March 2018 issued sanctions prohibiting US citizens from dealing with the petro in response to Venezuela’s attempts to evade sanctions with crypto.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>Whether or not a gold-backed, Russia-Iran stablecoin comes to fruition, the news is an important reminder for crypto exchanges and financial institutions of the need to undertake proactive sanctions compliance. At Elliptic, our crypto wallet screening solution Elliptic Lens enables exchanges and FIs to identify wallets associated with entities in sanctioned jurisdictions such as Iran and Russia.</p> 
     <p>By equipping themselves with blockchain analytics solutions, businesses can protect themselves from exposure to prohibited entities and transactions – an essential risk management tool, particularly in light of increasingly large penalties the US Treasury has levied on crypto companies for failing to ensure sanctions compliance.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>Contact us to learn more about how we can assist your business in sanctions compliance for crypto. In the meantime, read our report on <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/reports/sanctions-compliance-in-cryptocurrencies-2022/">Sanctions Compliance in Cryptocurrencies</a>.</p> 
      FinCEN Identifies Bitzlato as a Primary Money Laundering Concern  
     <p>For the first time, the US Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has identified a crypto exchange as a Primary Money Laundering Concern.</p> 
     <p>On January 18th, the US Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury announced a major international enforcement action against Hong Kong-registered crypto exchange Bitzlato, and the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/founder-and-majority-owner-bitzlato-cryptocurrency-exchange-charged-unlicensed-money">arrest</a> of its founder and majority owner Anatoly Legkodymov – a Russian national – for money laundering.</p> 
     <p>In an <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Order_Bitzlato_FINAL%20508.pdf">order</a> related to the action, FinCEN labeled Bitzlato as a “Primary Money Laundering Concern” under Section 9714 of the Combating Russian Money Laundering Act to disrupt its catering to known criminal activity tied to Russia – in particular, its connections to Russia-connected darknet market Hydra, as well as ransomware attackers. Covered US financial institutions – which includes cryptocurrency exchanges and banks – must cease transacting with Bitzlato, or with any account or crypto addresses it uses.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>The designation was made under Section 9714 of the Combating Russian Money Laundering Act, which has a similar effect to a FinCEN 311 Action under the USA PATRIOT Act – an authority used only on a select number of financial institutions over the past 20-plus years involved in egregious and major money laundering.</p> 
     <p>A Primary Money Laundering Concern designation is one of the most severe actions the US Treasury can take against an entity it accuses of involvement in financial crime. FinCEN’s action against Bitzlato may be the first time it has labelled a crypto business as a primary money laundering concern, but it is unlikely to be the last.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>In announcing the action, US Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1193">stated</a> that “we are prepared to take action against any financial institution – including virtual asset service providers – with lax controls against money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit finance”.</p> 
     <p>Immediately after the FinCEN announcement, the Elliptic team was quick to conduct research and update our monitoring tools, so that customers could immediately identify exposure to this entity.</p> 
     <p>Compliance teams at crypto exchanges and financial institutions should take immediate steps to ensure they can adhere to these requirements set out in FinCEN’s order on Bitzlato. Because the prohibitions on dealing with Bitzlato include not only crypto transfers but also fiat currency transactions, banks and other financial institutions must ensure that they can detect exposure to Bitzlato among their fiat currency transactions, and reject any inbound transactions that involve the exchange.</p>

      Nexo Settles With SEC For $45 Million Over Lending Product  
     <p>On January 19th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-11">announced</a> that crypto exchange Nexo had agreed to pay $45 million in penalties related to a crypto lending product it offered. According to the agency, Nexo offered a product it called its Earned Interest Product (EIP), which the SEC deemed to be a security because it allowed users to earn high returns with funds the exchange used at its discretion.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>Under the settlement agreement, Nexo will pay $22.5 million to the SEC for failing to appropriately register EIP as a security, and another $22.5 million to state regulators. The firm has also agreed to stop offering EIP to its users in the US. As we noted in <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/crypto-regulatory-affairs-hong-kong-to-open-up-limited-retail-crypto-trading/">last week’s regulatory update</a>, Nexo is reportedly also the subject of an investigation in Bulgaria related to fraud and money laundering issues.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>The Nexo settlement is the latest in a series of news underscoring the SEC’s enforcement focus on high yield crypto lending products. On January 12th, it <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/crypto-regulatory-affairs-hong-kong-to-open-up-limited-retail-crypto-trading/">charged</a> US crypto firms Gemini and Genesis with engaging in an unregistered offering of securities through their offering of a similar lending product to Nexo’s. As Elliptic’s research has shown, US regulators have issued <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/us-crypto-enforcement-actions-exceed-3-3-billion-and-reach-180-million-so-far-in-2022/">more than $3.3 billion</a> in enforcement penalties on crypto firms to date – a trend that underscores the importance of proactive regulatory compliance.</p> 
      MiCA Faces Two-month Delay&nbsp;  
     <p>New crypto rules in Europe will face a slight delay. The final vote in the EU Parliament on the Markets in Cryptoasset (MiCA) regulation has been <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/european-parliament-postpones-mica-vote-until-april/">delayed from February to April</a> – a postponement that will shift the implementation timeline for the measures back two months as well. MiCA – <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/eu-council-approves-mica-here-s-what-you-need-to-know/">a comprehensive piece of regulation</a> aimed to promote sound market practices among crypto firms and stablecoin issuers in the EU and to protect consumers – has generally been welcomed by the crypto industry because it offers a clear regulatory pathway forward for crypto businesses in the bloc.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>The slight delay means that MiCA’s provisions will likely come into effect between May and November 2024. The two-month shift in timelines, however, should not lead compliance teams to become complacent. It remains critical to start preparing for complying with MiCA now, so that your business can get ready for the significant incoming changes.&nbsp;</p> 
      Finnish Lawmaker Calls For EU DAO Framework  
     <p>In other news from Europe, a senior lawmaker from Finland has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/17/finnish-minister-calls-for-eu-law-to-recognize-daos/">called for</a> Europe to pave the rise of the metaverse and web3 by providing a legal framework for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>At the recent annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Timo Harakka said that the EU should provide a harmonized legal framework for DAOs – a move that would position a leader in web3 innovation, and would ensure a common approach across the bloc. Regulators around the world have been wrestling with the question of how to address the risks and legal issues around DAOs, including in the US, where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has petitioned the courts to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cftc+judgement+ooki&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enGB1023GB1028&amp;oq=cftc+judgement+ooki&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l3.2787j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">issue a judgement on a DAO</a> that the CFTC alleges violated US futures trading rules.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>These moves are hardly surprising. In our recent <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/resources/regulatory-outlook-report-2023?utm_content=231470876&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;hss_channel=lcp-5027267">Regulatory Outlook Report</a>, we predicted that regulators would focus increasing scrutiny of DAOs across 2023.&nbsp;</p> 
      Thailand Sets Out Crypto Custody Requirements  
     <p>Thailand has published <a href="https://www.sec.or.th/EN/Pages/News_Detail.aspx?SECID=9827">regulatory requirements</a> for crypto custody businesses in the country. On January 17th, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued regulations clarifying standards that businesses engaged in crypto custody must adhere to for securing customer funds.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>The measures include requirements for custodians to have risk management frameworks in place for managing customers’ funds, ensuring they have policies in place to securely store private keys to wallets, and developing contingency plans and testing to manage potential compromise of wallets and keys.</p> 
     <p>The SEC’s regulations are designed to protect consumers from loss, including the risk of having their funds lost in cybercriminal hacks.

				  Your product or service lives and dies by your brand. So how can you make sure your brand is remembered and leaves a good impression? It all starts with user experience. In this article we’ll look at how UX impacts your brand, a few tips and tricks, and look at Indicio’s approach.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>It is typically said that you only get one chance at a first impression. Unfortunately, when it comes to new technologies, that often means it can’t just “work;” it also needs to look and feel enticing enough to the end user to get them to try it in the first place — and come back for more.</p>
<p>In the decentralized identity space, many companies are working on creating digital wallets to store digital identities using verifiable credentials that are held on the end user’s mobile device. Unfortunately, given the sheer number of options people have with apps on phones, it’s not a surprise that a recent survey found roughly 25% of apps are used only once after being downloaded.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Percentage of apps used only once by year</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Chart credit: <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271628/percentage-of-apps-used-once-in-the-us/%20">https://www.statista.com/statistics/271628/percentage-of-apps-used-once-in-the-us/&nbsp;</a></p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>So how do we make sure that digital wallet apps don’t suffer this fate? Verifiable credentials have to be useful. The more useful they are, the more people can do with them in everyday life, the more they will be used. But that alone isn’t a guarantee of success. Digital wallets and verifiable credentials have to be easy to understand and easy to use. That’s obvious, right? But even that is not enough: They must be visually attractive. A <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265002981_Visual_Appeal_vs_Usability_Which_One_Influences_User_Perceptions_of_a_Website_More">2009 study</a> examined the effects of visual appeal and usability on user satisfaction found that user satisfaction was higher when using websites with high visual appeal and low usability than when using a site with low visual appeal but high usability. That first impression counts — but it’s often the last thing teams will think about when creating innovative technology. If you’re wondering how long that first impression lasts, according to research done by Google you have just <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/38315.pdf">17 milliseconds</a> to “hook” someone. The secret sauce to doing that is providing a combination of low complexity and high prototypicality (basically what the user expects to see — most users will have an assumption in their mind of what an ecommerce site or blog should look like and how they can interact with it).</p>
<p>When it comes to UI/UX, Indicio employs a simple, clean design. “We want someone to be able to pick up this technology and be able to use it without having to put a lot of thought into it,” says Indicio’s VP of Operations Scott Harris. While we have a step-by-step guide for our Holdr+ app (our version of a digital wallet) and other customer-facing products, we recognize that users are busy, or simply don’t want to read an exhaustive manual (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article-abstract/28/1/27/2363584?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">only 25% of people read manuals</a> for consumer products), the shortest learning curve is the path to success.</p>
<p>If you’re building a decentralized identity solution and would like to review your UI/UX or discuss best practices, Indicio is happy to help. You can get in contact with our team <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">here</a>. And if you are just looking for a plug-and-play solution we can easily adjust <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a> or <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a> to fit your needs.</p>

<p>Detecting stolen and synthetic identities at the very front end of new account origination for every type of user can pay huge dividends but too often, tightening fraud controls can deliver an alienating experience to legitimate customers and impact employee onboarding. Recent reports reveal that identity fraud remains an escalating issue, resulting in annual losses exceeding $24 billion (USD). Consequently, the significance of accurate identity verification and robust fraud prevention measures cannot be overstated, as they directly impact your business’s profitability.</p>
<p>The digital landscape of our economy introduces vulnerabilities to the process of identity verification, necessitating organizations to fortify themselves against these threats. The digital identity verification arena is swiftly adapting to counter the expanding menace of fraud. Emerging tools and technologies are empowering numerous companies to validate a consumer’s true identity in real-time, prior to finalizing any transaction. Today, we explore six prevailing trends in the realm of identity verification.</p>
 
 Addressing Challenges with Hard-to-Verify, Underserved Populations<br>
Identity verification professionals are encountering difficulties in authenticating the identities of hard-to-verify populations, such as young adults and recent immigrants. These groups often lack conventional forms of identification or a presence in traditional data ecosystems, making their verification challenging. To tackle this issue, identity verification professionals are exploring <a href="https://www.enformion.com/alternative-credit-data-vital-information/">alternative data providers</a> that can facilitate better verification of these populations’ identities. 
 The Surge in Identity Theft and Synthetic Identity Fraud<br>
	The rise in identity theft and <a>synthetic identity fraud</a> poses a growing concern for identity verification professionals. Losses from synthetic identity fraud are projected to exceed $2.42 billion in 2023, emphasizing the crucial role of identity data in detecting fraudulent activities. Criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods, making it difficult for traditional identity verification solutions to detect fraudulent behavior. Consequently, there is a heightened focus on security and compliance as businesses strive to safeguard themselves and their customers from the financial and reputational damages resulting from identity theft. 
 Leveraging Identity Verification for KYC and KYB<br>
Identity verification for <a>know your customer (KYC)</a> is gaining importance as businesses strive to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations. Identity verification professionals are utilizing advanced technologies like machine learning and blockchain to enhance the identification and verification for KYC, assisting businesses in maintaining compliance and avoiding financial and reputational harm. 
 Mobile Identity Verification – The Rise of Phone-Based Identity Verification<br>
	Phone-based identity verification, also known as mobile identity verification, is gaining popularity as a means of verifying individuals’ identities. The increasing number of mobile users and the convenience of using mobile devices for identity verification are driving this trend. Identity verification professionals are harnessing the capabilities of mobile devices, such as Face ID and Touch ID, to enhance identity verification and detect fraudulent activities. This trend is expected to continue as mobile devices become even more ubiquitous and powerful. 
 Integration of Biometrics<br>
	Businesses are turning to biometrics integration to aid in identity verification. By utilizing biometric technologies, companies can verify client identities through fingerprints, facial recognition, and <a>LiveID</a>. With the prevalence of fingerprint and facial recognition technology in many mobile phones, more consumers are adopting these methods. In most cases, businesses can combine multiple biometric methods to increase the accuracy of identity recognition. 
 Consumer Concerns Driving the Need for Change<br>
44% of American consumers consider banking fraud and identity theft to be their top concerns according to a <a href="https://www.fico.com/en/newsroom/fico-survey-us-consumers-fear-bank-fraud-and-id-theft-more-terrorist-attack">report by FICO</a>. Financial institutions are also deeply worried about identity theft, given the annual losses of approximately $16.8 billion. Hence, there is a clear demand for action against identity theft.

<p>Finance is one of the most tightly regulated sectors in the Western world, and not without reason. It forms the foundation on which modern welfare states are built on. Historically, it has been one of the most fragmented sectors within the European Union, as each of the member states had spent centuries co-evolving with their local finance providers. Each has adapted to local needs and has been shaped by local histories.</p>
 European Monetary Union 
<p>Slowly but surely, the European Commission is seeking to accomplish a true monetary union within the member states, mimicking the formation of the largest contemporary federal republic – the United States of America. The process has been far from a walk in the park, and there is still considerable work required before the “United States of Europe” becomes a sovereign superstate.</p>
<p>Adopting the Euro as a common currency was a major accomplishment towards the goal. Another important aspect, hidden from plain sight, is unifying the regulation between the member states. For the traditional banking sector, one of the most important regulatory frameworks is called the <a href="https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/index.htm">Basel Framework</a>. Now in the third iteration of the framework, it is often referred to as <a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm?m=">Basel III</a>. Banks are currently implementing the latest updates after the previous iterations, Basel I and Basel II.</p>
<p>Following the delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Commission has published its long-awaited proposal on implementing the final Basel III reforms. These reforms were required to be implemented in European law by January 1st, 2023.</p>
 What is the Goal of the Basel Framework? 
<p>The end goal has been clearly stated since the Basel I agreement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Taking a major step towards European unification by completing an EU-wide finance union and trying to prevent a continent-wide economic collapse by strengthening bank capital requirements, increasing minimum capital requirements, mandating the holdings of high-quality liquid assets, and decreasing bank leverage dynamically.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This has proved to be controversial from the start. To address the presented concerns, the Commission is expected to launch a public consultation on the review of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), and the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD).&nbsp;The implementation of the Basel III reforms is another major milestone towards the goals of the Commission.</p>
 Ongoing Issues in Implementing the Basel Framework 
<p>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the persistent inflation stemming from the extremely stimulatory monetary policy practiced by the European Central Bank (ECB) since the 2008 financial crisis, is far from over. It is likely to fuel arguments in favour of allowing more divergence in European law from the Basel III standard. For example, Nordic banks are currently operating at noticeably lower risk levels than major French and south European banks.</p>
<p>The Nordic banks have more of their assets tied to mortgages that are already stress-tested to 6% Euribor rates, instead of holding large quantities of sovereign debt from highly indebted southern European countries. In addition, the mortgages are typically valued at 70% of their face value, compared to 100% of the face value of sovereign debt. This is because the current regulation allows the assumption that a sovereign state cannot become insolvent – until of course one does, like Sri Lanka recently. EU-wide <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/nordic-banks-would-outperform-eu-peers-in-stress-test-worst-case-scenario-66008634">stress tests</a> clearly reflect the difference in resilience. If this difference will not be reflected in the regulatory environment, then banks that have historically operated at higher risk than their competitors – by, for example, not diversifying their assets clearly across asset classes – could gain an unfair advantage. We will see whether the inevitable Basel IV will address these concerns.</p>
<p>For private investors, not all of the changes have been positive. For example, artificially limiting access to non-EU markets and financial instruments helps to keep the fees of European brokers at much higher levels than their American and Asian counterparts. In addition, some EU countries continue to blatantly ignore both European law and national one-to-one agreements on taxation, instead pushing all the burden to correct double taxation to the private investors themselves. They are now faced with complex legal procedures in foreign languages with little to no help from the national authorities – who were supposed to handle everything automatically already, years ago.</p>
 Remote Identity Proofing 
<p>Many could argue therefore that the changes have been without a net benefit so far, but there is one positive change on the horizon. This change is about allowing one to create a strong digital identity via remote connection, without already possessing a strong electronic ID (eID). This is called remote identity proofing, and it could potentially change the fintech landscape dramatically throughout the whole European Union, by allowing its more than 300 million residents to utilise financial services in all of the 27 member states, without having to physically travel. </p>
<p>The identity verification process is necessary to fulfil the legal requirements of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) legislation. Despite the common misunderstanding, identity verification does not, by itself, represent any kind of trustworthy relationship between the end user and the organisation. Unlike the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable LEI</a>, for example.</p>
 How Remote Identity Proofing Works 
<p>The verification would traditionally be carried out in person, by verifying a physical identity document and comparing the photograph of the holder of the document to their face in real life. For remote identity proofing, the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/">European Telecommunications Standards Institute</a> (ETSI), an independent organisation that standardises norms at the European level, has created a standard framework for remote identity proofing.</p>
<p>The standard recognises identification through video in a live stream, with the recording of the entire process, as the only way that remote identity proofing can have the same level of legal compliance as a physical face-to-face verification. This repeats what is already stipulated in the eIDAS regulation for the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI, often referred to as EU ID or EUID). This is as opposed to using still photographs or selfies, which have high fraud rates and therefore are not eIDAS compliant.</p>
<p>The first national launches of the EUDI are scheduled for 2024, and a continent-wide rollout will hopefully follow soon after. That will bring strong individual identities to the masses, then it’s time for the other half: strong organisational identities.

<p>Consumer demand for intuitive digital services has changed the way we approach everything, including banking. We are moving from a primarily in-person service model to an anytime, anywhere model where consumers can manage their accounts and cards on their own conveniently on their mobile banking app or online portal. This digital transformation is a journey that requires making decisions that not only provide consumers with the convenience and flexibility of self-service capabilities, but also time to value for the financial institution.</p>
<p>One digital tool gaining in popularity among consumers is digital wallets. In fact, the use of digital wallets made up 48.6% of 2021’s <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/news/payments-trends/digital-wallets-and-push-provisioning-enlarge-banks-payment-options-151920/">ecommerce transaction value</a>. Banks that want to compete and satisfy consumer expectations must better support these popular digital wallets. Yet, as convenient as these apps are, the ability to enroll a payment card into the wallet can be frustrating if not fully supported properly. Currently, cardholders can either choose to enroll their card in Apple Pay manually or via a bank enabled push provisioning.&nbsp; Manual entry of card details for wallet enrollment can be a time-consuming and complicated process. Push provisioning can be done right within the banking app with a click of a button; however, not all banks have enabled this process. To offer an additional enrollment option for cardholders, Apple Pay has now issued a mandate requiring participating banks to offer more simplified options for provisioning to their wallet.</p>
<p>In response to this mandate, Entrust has launched a new in-app provisioning extension to the Digital Card Solution, from within the Apple Pay app. Coupled with the in-app push provisioning feature Entrust already offers, banks are now enabled to offer two ways of automatically enrolling cardholder cards into Apple Pay:</p>
 
 from the banking app 
 from the Apple Pay app 
 
<p>How the Entrust Digital Card Solution in-app provisioning extension works</p>
<p>If a bank enables the Entrust Digital Card Solution in-app provisioning extension, the cardholder will follow the first steps of manual card entry in Apple Pay, but will benefit from a more seamless experience:</p>
 
 Within the Apple Pay app, the cardholder will click on the “+ Icon” in the top right corner. 
 On the “Add to Wallet” screen, they will select a section called “From Apps on Your iPhone”, with their bank. 
 The cardholder will then authenticate to their banking app. 
 From there, they then click on the card they want to enroll and will confirm enrollment. 
 The cardholder will then accept the terms and conditions. 
 
<p>After this short process, their payment card is enrolled and ready to use.</p>
<p>With this new feature within the Apple Pay app, the cardholder does not have to manually enroll the card by entering sensitive information (like the card number and the PAN). Instead, the cardholder will see their bank card already proposed for enrollment. This occurs because Apple Pay will pull the information from all banking apps installed on the phone to show the cards eligible for provisioning into the wallet. Cardholders also benefit from full tokenization and security, thanks to the authentication process that has already taken place in the bank app.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience for the cardholder is like the in-banking app enrollment but is initiated directly in the Apple Pay wallet.</p>
<p>And the benefit to banks? It will allow banks to promote the enrollment to Apple Pay even further. The bank also gains additional visibility within the Apple Pay app. Ultimately, adding this enrollment option will lead to higher usage and help banks reach and/or maintain top of wallet status.</p>
<p>Existing Entrust Digital Card Solution customers can easily add the new in-app provisioning extension to their offering, as this feature can be enabled thanks to the already implemented Entrust SDK.</p>
<p>Existing customers can reach out to their account executive to learn more. Those who are interested in this new feature, and push provisioning to Apple Pay in general, can contact us <a href="https://www.entrust.com/contact/sales">here</a>.</p>

 Collaboration increases IDnow’s document checking capabilities in the air travel industry 



<p>Munich, May 31, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, announces its participation in the <a href="https://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)</a> Public Key Directory (PKD) pilot program to further enhance its document checking capabilities in commercial air travel. First established in 2007, the ICAO PKD is a central repository for exchanging the information required to authenticate electronic Machine Readable Travel Documents (eMRTDs), such as ePassports and electronic ID cards. </p>



<p>Today covering 90 issuing authorities worldwide, the <a href="https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/PKD/Pages/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20ICAO%20Public%20Key%20Directory,cards%20and%20Visible%20Digital%20Seals.">ICAO PKD</a> offers an effective means for countries to upload their own technical data related to ePassports and electronic ID cards and download that of other issuing authorities, thus eliminating the need for bilateral exchange of this data. Essentially, the ICAO PKD takes on the role of a central broker for this technical information while also helping to ensure that the information adheres to the necessary technical standards (i.e., ICAO 9303 specifications) to maintain interoperability.</p>



<p>Security is a top priority in air travel</p>



<p>By joining the time-limited ICAO PKD pilot, IDnow has received temporary permission to read out the data stored in the NFC (Near-field communication) chip of ePassports and electronic ID cards and to use this data in their commercial solutions in the air travel domain.</p>



<p>“Security and facilitation are a top priority in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">air travel</a>, and identity verification plays a crucial role in any travel security equation nowadays,” says Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow. “We are therefore very pleased to participate in the ICAO PKD pilot. Being part of this program allows us to verify the authenticity of an electronic ID document and its rightful origin. In addition to our advanced in-house fraud fighting measures, we are thus able to verify that the data on the document’s chip is authentic and that the issuing authority is the one it claims to be. Furthermore, we can extract the embedded portrait photo of the document holder from the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">NFC chip</a> and use it for biometric verification, knowing that it has not been tampered with,” he adds. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p>Manually granting access to entitlements and access reviews is not easy. Organizations are shifting focus towards learning and discovering capabilities. Automation tools such as policy mining are being introduced to reduce the burden of governance for granting access and reviewing access. Policy-based provisioning of access and access reviews can help to reduce the efforts of reviewing fine-grained or coarse-grained access by automating these processes.  In this whitepaper, we will take a look at Tuebora’s model for mining provisioning policies, the importance of birthright provisioning, and automatic access to entitlements.

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the latest <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a> feature that allows issuers to conveniently send credentials directly from the platform to recipients’ emails and Dock Wallet. Now, issuers can enjoy a streamlined process that saves time, improves efficiency, and ensures secure delivery of important credentials.</p><p>When you issue a credential by using the recipients’ decentralized identifiers (DIDs), they will immediately receive the credential in their <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Digital Identity Wallet app</a>.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identifiers?ref=blog.dock.io">decentralized identifier</a> is a unique digital identifier that you fully own and control through your ID Wallet. DIDs enable you to securely receive and present their credentials in a privacy-preserving way.</p> Steps for Sending the Credential by Email <p>Let’s say the Nursing Licensing Authority wants to send each nursing graduate their credential by email. They will now see a field in Dock Certs to add the recipient’s email whenever they issue a credential.</p><p>1. The Nursing Licensing Authority enters Clarissa Olson’s email in Dock Certs.</p><p>2. The Nursing Licensing Authority previews the credential and selects Send credentials.</p><p>3. Clarissa will receive the credential by email as soon as it is issued from Dock Certs.</p><p>4. Clarissa scans the QR code with her Dock Wallet to import it on the app. She then gets a wallet notification saying she received a credential from the Nursing Licensing Authority. The QR Code becomes voided after Clarissa imports the credential.</p><p>Free trial users can only send themselves a &nbsp;Credential and will need to choose a plan in order to email it to other people. <br>See the complete <a href="http://www.dock.io/guides/dock-certs-user-guide?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs issuer guide</a> on how to use all of the features.</p> Send a Credential by DID <p>With our latest feature, an issuer can send a credential directly to a recipient's Dock Wallet by simply entering the recipient’s DID in the Subject ID field in Dock Certs. If, for example, an employer wants to send an employee a job status credential, the employer would simply enter the staff’s DID in Dock Certs and they will receive the credential directly in their Dock Digital Wallet. This feature is powered by our DID Relay Service.</p>  The Nursing Licensing Authority sends the credential by using Clarissa’s DID.  <p>2.

  Japan’s enforcement of the Crypto Travel Rule from June 1st, 2023, marks a significant step in tightening cryptocurrency regulations.  The new regulations, while promising increased transparency and trust in the market, may also pose challenges to privacy and operational changes.  Shyft Veriscope, with its strategic partnership with Sygna, emerges as the best frictionless Travel Rule Solution, balancing regulatory compliance, cost-efficiency, and user&nbsp;privacy.  <p>In the world of technology and innovation, Japan has always been a front-runner, setting trends that many&nbsp;follow.</p><p>With a unique blend of technological adeptness and a robust economy, the country continues to maintain its global significance, and its latest move in the cryptocurrency domain is no exception.</p><p>Starting June 1st, 2023, Japan will enforce stringent Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations to further refine and intensify the oversight of cryptocurrency transactions while supporting the crypto&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Announced by the Japanese parliament on May 23, this decision exemplifies the nation’s proactive efforts to align with global crypto regulations more effectively and exhibits the state’s adaptability to the evolving financial regulatory requirements.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">The Most Googled Questions on FATF Travel Rule&nbsp;Answered</a></p> Work in Progress Since March&nbsp;2021 <p>In a regulatory journey spanning over a year, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) received a request in March 2021 from the Financial Services Agency (FSA) to introduce self-regulatory rules concerning the “crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.”</p><p>This was followed by the JVCEA incorporating these rules in April 2022, which further led to the enforcement of the crypto Travel Rule through an amendment to the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds (APTCP) in December&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Later, to clarify how the “crypto Travel Rule” applies to Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), the FSA initiated a consultation process on these guidelines, signifying its intent to uphold transparency and dialogue within the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>And by March 2023, the FSA concluded its public consultation on APTCP guidelines, and now, in June, the Travel Rule will soon be officially enforced in Japan. In a country where cryptocurrencies have been adopted legally, the implications of these new AML regulations are far-reaching.</p> The Impact on Crypto Ecosystem <p>The enforcement of the Travel Rule in Japan is set to cast a wide net of implications across the cryptocurrency landscape. For starters, it may infuse a greater degree of trust in the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>By taking stringent measures against potential illicit activities, the rule can effectively alleviate some of the concerns existing and potential users might have about the crypto industry. This could increase crypto use and investment, lending greater liquidity and stability to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Moreover, the Travel Rule brings the promise of heightened transparency. The mandate for exchange providers to share crypto sender and receiver information allows for a more open view of transaction flows. This could significantly reduce fraudulent activities and make it difficult for malicious actors to exploit the system, fostering a safer trading environment.</p><p>Despite these positives, there are some contradictions not to be&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>For instance, for many crypto users, the allure of cryptocurrencies lies in the anonymity they&nbsp;offer.</p><p>But with the new regulations in place, this veil of anonymity gets partially lifted, potentially dissuading some users and investors. This loss of anonymity could slow down the growth of the crypto market in Japan, at least in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that the effect of the Travel Rule on users’ privacy and businesses’ operations will largely depend on the nature of the platform and the Travel Rule solution they&nbsp;employ.</p> Choice of Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution <p>The choice of a Travel Rule solution can substantially impact the user experience and the level of privacy maintained in these transactions.</p><p>One promising approach is the adoption of a fully automated, peer-to-peer Travel Rule solution, like Shyft Veriscope. It allows for the necessary data exchange between VASPs without storing any sensitive user information on its servers. This approach not only mitigates the risk of data breaches but also restricts any third-party access, thereby adding an extra layer of privacy protection.</p><p>Moreover, Shyft Veriscope’s fully automated nature ensures that user experience remains positive and seamless, an essential factor that could influence users’ decision to continue engaging with the crypto market amidst these regulatory changes.</p><p>Ultimately, the choice of the Travel Rule solution becomes a critical determinant in striking the right balance between adhering to regulatory standards and preserving user privacy and experience. This will be a key factor in shaping the impact of the new regulations on both users and businesses in the crypto&nbsp;sphere.</p> CEX vs DEX: How do They Fare Under Japan’s Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>For Centralized Exchanges, which already have strict Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols in place, the impact may not be substantial. After all, these platforms already possess much of the required information about their users, minimizing the effect of these new regulations on their operations and user experience.</p><p>On the other hand, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms, known for their anonymity and less stringent KYC procedures, may face a greater challenge. The enforcement of the Travel Rule could disrupt the degree of privacy users enjoy on these platforms, potentially affecting their appeal to a certain user&nbsp;base.</p><p>So, while this regulatory change is undoubtedly transformative, it’s also diverse in its impact, affecting different areas of the crypto ecosystem to varying degrees. This difference, in effect, underscores the importance of a Travel Rule solution that can navigate these challenges while preserving user privacy and experience.</p> Comparatively Higher Threshold <p>Another noteworthy aspect of Japan’s enforcement of the Travel Rule is the transaction threshold set at $3,000. This means the rule will only apply to transactions exceeding this limit. This is a significant figure, higher than many other countries’ thresholds for applying similar AML regulations.</p><p>This relatively high threshold could have important implications for the crypto market in Japan. Smaller, everyday transactions, which constitute a large volume of crypto activity, will remain largely unaffected by these new regulations. This allows a significant portion of crypto users to continue enjoying the benefits of anonymity and ease of transactions they are accustomed to.</p><p>However, for larger transactions, the enforcement of the Travel Rule will necessitate more stringent information-sharing and verification processes. While this could potentially slow down transaction times and complicate the process for some users, it will also provide added security and transparency, helping to protect users against fraud and other illicit activities.</p><p>For crypto businesses, compliance with the Travel Rule means embracing operational changes. As such, the rule necessitates significant investments in infrastructural upgrades and personnel training to meet the new regulatory standards. This could impose a heavy burden on smaller businesses and startups, which might struggle to keep up with these requirements.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/demystifying-the-fatf-travel-rule-your-most-googled-questions-answered-part-2">Demystifying the FATF Travel Rule: Your Most Googled Questions Answered — Part&nbsp;2</a></p> How Should VASPs&nbsp;Comply? <p>With the impending enforcement of the Travel Rule in Japan, VASPs are faced with the challenging task of choosing a Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>Although the FATF doesn’t advocate for a specific compliance solution or method, VASPs have a moral duty to choose a solution that seamlessly navigates the intricate compliance requirements while preserving user privacy and experience. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Shyft Veriscope</a> ticks all the&nbsp;boxes.</p><p>Not only does Shyft Veriscope demonstrate cost-efficiency when compared to other available options in the market, but it is also a one-of-a-kind solution. As we highlighted above, being a Peer-to-Peer Travel Rule Solution, Shyft Veriscope blends efficiency and regulatory compliance without infringing upon user experience or&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope’s appeal in the evolving Japanese crypto market is further strengthened by <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/sygna-and-shyft-veriscope-partner-to-enhance-crypto-travel-rule-interoperability-and-compliance">Shyft’s strategic partnership with Sygna</a>, a well-regarded name in the realm of crypto AML compliance services with a robust presence in&nbsp;Japan.</p><p>The result is a solution that moves beyond mere compliance, addressing the “sunrise issue” of the Travel Rule and nudging the crypto industry closer towards full interoperability.</p><p>More details here: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Shyft Veriscope — The Critical Infrastructure Underpinning FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> Frequently Asked Questions on Japan Enforcing Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule  Q1: When will the Crypto Travel Rule be enforced in&nbsp;Japan? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule will be enforced in Japan from June 1st. The Japanese parliament announced the decision on May 23, aligning Japan more effectively with global crypto regulations.</p> Q2: How will the Crypto Travel Rule impact crypto users in&nbsp;Japan? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule will inject more trust and transparency into the cryptocurrency market, potentially increasing cryptocurrency usage and investment. However, the rule may also deter some users and investors as it partially lifts the veil of anonymity associated with cryptocurrencies.</p> Q3: What does implementing the Crypto Travel Rule mean for crypto businesses in&nbsp;Japan? <p>For crypto businesses, the Crypto Travel Rule means they will need to undergo operational changes to comply with the new regulations. This includes significant investments in infrastructural upgrades and personnel training to meet the new regulatory standards.</p> Q4: What is the role of the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in implementing the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Japan? <p>The FSA is the primary regulatory body overseeing the implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule in Japan. It works in collaboration with self-regulatory entities such as the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) and the Japan Security Token Offering Association (JSTOA) to develop policies and rules that shape the cryptocurrency landscape in the&nbsp;country.</p> Final Note <p>The Travel Rule brings a significant shift towards a safer and more transparent crypto market in Japan, but not without impacting some of the very elements that made cryptocurrencies attractive to a certain segment of users and businesses.</p><p>As the industry adapts to these regulatory shifts, the long-term implications will largely hinge on the evolution of this new paradigm and the ensuing global&nbsp;trends.</p><p>However, amidst this sea of changes, one thing remains crystal clear: Japan, the “Land of the Rising Sun,” is taking a proactive and exemplary stance in tackling regulatory challenges.</p><p>Therefore, as countries across the globe grapple with the intricacies of crypto regulation, they can look towards Japan’s progressive strides for valuable insights and guidance.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>This week Simon and David review the recent <a href="https://heliview.com/identity-access-management/">Heliview</a> IAM Conference that took place in the Netherlands. The main topic for the day was the rise of the identity fabric (or mesh) and how this can enable the modern organisation with a range of agile IAM components that supports both business and security use cases. Simon presented a <a href="https://www.thecyberhut.com/heliview-identity-access-management-conference-netherlands/">keynote</a> on the future of IAM - using some research from The Cyber Hut focusing on where IAM may look like in 2028 and beyond...</p>
<p>They also discussed the need for people, process and technology integration, in order to map the existing IAM landscape to future investment and metrics.</p>
<p>They finish off by discussing the rise in cyber threat reports that have emerged in the past month that all have a very strong reliance on IAM - and why ITDR is a process not a product. </p>

<p>Any type of asset can be easily and compliantly represented on-chain using our platform, with the freedom for the issuer to select their preferred blockchain network.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in May 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>We started Tokeny with the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to effortlessly purchase and trade financial products they are eligible for. With our&nbsp;network-agnostic tokenization platform, supporting multi-chains,&nbsp;we enable enterprises to turn this belief into a tangible reality.</p>
<p>Any type of asset can be easily and compliantly represented on-chain using our platform&nbsp;with the freedom for the issuer to select their preferred blockchain network.&nbsp;We cater to institutions seeking to tokenize assets, empowering them to benefit from direct securities distribution, automated subscription processes, and diverse liquidity solutions (<a href="https://tokeny.com/dvd-transfers/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">DvD transfer</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/new-feature/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">CEX feature</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">Billboard</a>, etc.), regardless of the underlying blockchain network.</p>
<p>Our T-REX tokenization platform acts as a&nbsp;data aggregator&nbsp;that harmoniously aggregates relevant information from blockchains, ensuring data on the platform is always synchronized with the selected blockchains. With a user-friendly interface, it facilitates efficient&nbsp;smart contract management, streamlines operations, and enables ERC3643 token trading. Moreover, it provides seamless&nbsp;connectivity&nbsp;to both external platforms and the DINO distribution network, covering centralized and decentralized trading platforms within the same blockchain network that the securities were issued.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>In the realm of digital securities, the <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC3643 token standard</a> brings compliance and control by only allowing transfers when both the investor rules (via ONCHAINID, digital identity smart contracts) and offering rules are met. While this standard is open-source, its implementation is considerably more intricate compared to the permissionless token standard ERC20.&nbsp;Building a functional platform from scratch demands a significant amount of time, resources, and expertise.</p>
<p>With an extensive track record spanning 6 years, our team of 20 experienced developers has built an end-to-end platform covering the entire lifecycle of ERC3643 tokens. Our value proposition revolves around&nbsp;expediting time-to-market for institutions to increase their market share with proven solutions.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that our SaaS platform and API are&nbsp;technically capable of supporting all EVM blockchains, which constitute a dominant share of on-chain activities (94% as per DefiLlama, a DeFi data aggregator). Our solutions have been meticulously optimized for three prominent networks: Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. Notably, the presence of key multi-chain components, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/from-start-up-to-scale-up-how-tokeny-prepared-for-large-scale-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">indexer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/gas-tank-on-polygon/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">gas tank</a>&nbsp;smart contracts, allows us to efficiently add new EVM networks to our platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, issuers have the flexibility to&nbsp;move digital securities from one chain to another as well as<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-v4/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">&nbsp;upgrade their smart contracts</a>&nbsp;via our solutions. This dynamic future-proof solution allows issuers to confidently begin asset tokenization in response to any evolving circumstances. By providing a catalyst for tokenization adoption, we ensure a secure and reliable foundation for issuers to embrace this transformative trend.</p>

 How on-chain KYC and the Lightning Network will take the industry to the next level. 



 



<p>The future of crypto within the European Union (EU) is a complex and ever-evolving topic. The good news is that the EU is finally setting some ground rules for the crypto market. The bad news is that it has taken, and is likely to take, a long time to implement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, there has been a growing sense of urgency to create a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework, partly due to the increasing popularity of crypto assets, as well as concerns about their potential to be used for illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the beginning of the year, I have been traveling around Europe, attending events and meeting with industry insiders and thought leaders, and one thing’s for sure: the crypto market is certainly moving in the right direction. Of course, there’s always been buzz – both positive and negative – surrounding the industry, but what with upcoming regulatory frameworks like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed crypto regime</a>, there appears to be more confidence and excitement from operators, regulators and consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two recent developments, in particular, have really captivated the imagination of the industry: on-chain KYC and the Lightning Network. In fact, I recently moderated a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/crypto-on-chain-kyc-lightning-network/"> fascinating roundtable discussion</a> on how they’re both set to revolutionize the market. Before we delve into these topics, it’s important to know what decentralized finance (DeFi) is, and why I think it is crucial to the development of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



 Centralization is a risk. Why DeFi is the way to go. 



<p>There has been a lot of talk about the ‘perils’ of DeFi, with many assuming the recent failure of the likes of<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/coinbase-crypto-winter/"> FTX</a> could indicate the technology doesn’t really work. But, I think the opposite is true, and that the recent events have just emphasized that we actually need DeFi, and cannot be dependent on certain authorities. Centralization is actually a risk in itself. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Events such as the failure of FTX spark innovation and improvements, as well as regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi refers to a set of financial applications and platforms built on blockchain technology that aim to provide open, permissionless, and inclusive financial services. Unlike traditional centralized financial systems such as banks, DeFi eliminates intermediaries and enables direct peer-to-peer transactions and interactions through smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



 Why is DeFi integral to the future of crypto?&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralization: DeFi operates on blockchain networks, which are decentralized and distributed across multiple computers or nodes. This decentralized nature eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks, enabling users to have more control over their funds and financial activities.</p>



<p>Accessibility: DeFi platforms are generally open to anyone with an internet connection, allowing individuals from around the world, including the unbanked or under banked, to access financial services. This inclusivity promotes financial empowerment and can provide opportunities for economic growth in underserved regions. By removing barriers like geographical limitations, high fees, and strict regulations, DeFi can empower individuals to take control of their finances, access capital, and participate in global markets.</p>



<p>Transparency: DeFi operates on public blockchains, making all transactions and activities transparent and auditable. This transparency can help build trust among users as they can independently verify and audit the underlying code, smart contracts, and transactions.</p>



<p>Another important reason why DeFi is the future, is programmability. The technology utilizes smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts automate financial processes, reducing the need for manual intervention and enabling the creation of innovative financial products like decentralized exchanges, lending and borrowing platforms, prediction markets, and more.</p>



<p>DeFi offers various opportunities for users to earn yields on their crypto assets. Activities like liquidity provision, staking, lending, and yield farming enable individuals to earn passive income on their holdings, potentially outperforming returns from traditional financial instruments.</p>



<p>While DeFi has gained significant attention and adoption, it’s important to note that the space is still evolving, and there are significant risks involved, such as smart contract vulnerabilities, regulatory challenges, and market volatility. However, many believe that with further development, innovation, and user education, DeFi has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by offering more accessible, efficient, and inclusive financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn more about the role of KYC in a decentralized world in our blog, ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/decentralized-finance-defi-kyc-contradiction/">Can Defi and KYC ever peacefully co-exist?’.</a></p>



 



 
 
 

 
 
 



 Why is MiCA so important? 



<p> Amidst the ongoing development and regulatory considerations surrounding DeFi, it is worth examining recent regulations in the crypto space within the EU. One notable example is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA regulation</a>, which was approved by the European Parliament in April 2023. This ground-breaking regulation marks the world’s first comprehensive framework specifically tailored to crypto assets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MiCA introduces a range of requirements for crypto businesses to adhere to, including:&nbsp;</p>



  Registration with national authorities<br>  Compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CTF) regulations&nbsp;<br>  Provision of clear information to consumers about the risks of crypto assets&nbsp;  



<p>MiCA provides legal clarity by defining and categorizing different types of crypto assets and activities within the EU. It sets out clear rules and definitions for crypto assets, such as cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and stablecoins, which helps reduce ambiguity and promotes regulatory certainty for businesses and investors operating within the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also introduces a licensing framework for crypto service providers. Businesses such as crypto firms, wallet providers, and custodians must obtain authorization from competent authorities within the EU. This authorization requirement aims to enhance consumer protection and ensure compliance with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/combating-financing-of-terrorism-cft/">Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF)</a> regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to safeguard the interests of investors, MiCA requires issuers of certain crypto assets to provide comprehensive and accurate information. MiCA also aims to promote market integrity and stability by setting standards for the operation of crypto exchanges and trading platforms. It includes provisions for orderly trading, transparency of prices, and measures to prevent market abuse and insider trading. These measures contribute to building trust and confidence in the crypto market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While MiCA is undoubtedly an important step toward regulating crypto in the EU, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK is still debating how to move forward</a>. However, it’s important to remember that MiCA is not a complete solution to the EU’s crypto problem, as it doesn’t address on-chain KYC. &nbsp;</p>



 What is on-chain KYC? &nbsp; 



<p>On-chain KYC refers to the process of verifying the identity of a crypto user by analysing their on-chain activity. This can be done by looking at things like the addresses they use, the transactions they make, and the tokens they hold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a valuable tool for law enforcement and regulators, as it can help them to identify and investigate suspicious activity, as well as track down criminals who use crypto to launder money or finance terrorism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On-chain KYC is necessary to protect businesses and consumers, while preventing crime. If your crypto platform doesn’t cover on-chain KYC, then how well do you really <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On-chain KYC is set to revolutionize DeFi and this cannot be ignored. Now let’s discuss the Lightning Network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is the Lightning Network important to the future of crypto?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol that runs on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows for faster and cheaper payments and is becoming increasingly popular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The protocol is very important as it addresses one of the biggest challenges of Bitcoin: scalability. Although Bitcoin is a very secure and decentralized network, it is also very slow and expensive to use. The Lightning Network solves this problem by allowing for off-chain payments.&nbsp;</p>



 How does the Lightning Network actually work? 



<p>The Lightning Network operates through the use of payment channels, where two participants open a payment channel by creating a multi-signature transaction on the underlying blockchain. This transaction serves as the funding transaction for the channel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lightning Network allows participants to route payments through a network of interconnected payment channels. This routing capability makes it a scalable solution. Participants can, at any point, close a payment channel and settle the final state on the underlying blockchain. The final settlement transaction reflects the net result of all the off-chain transactions that occurred within the channel. By ultimately settling on the&nbsp; blockchain, participants ensure the security and immutability of the transactions.&nbsp;</p>



 What is driving the development of the crypto industry?&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralization, security and transparency are driving the evolution of the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leading blockchain protocols are decentralized and are not subject to government control or control from financial institutions. This makes them an attractive proposition to people concerned about privacy and censorship. Cryptocurrencies are secured by cryptography, which makes them difficult to hack, and a more secure store of value than traditional fiat currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, most blockchains are transparent, meaning all crypto transactions are recorded on a public ledger. This is not the case with traditional financial systems.&nbsp;</p>



 Challenges and opportunities in the DACH region.&nbsp; 



<p>Although they each have their specific challenges, Germany, Austria and Switzerland are great markets for crypto businesses to enter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the key challenges are the lack of regulation, as the crypto industry is still in its early stages there. Their comparatively high taxes can also make the markets a less attractive proposition to investors. And while there is a growing community of people who are aware of crypto, vast swathes of the general public in those countries don’t fully understand the topic, let alone want to be involved. However, this presents a great opportunity to both educate people about the benefits of crypto, while attracting new users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The German government is considering a more innovative regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, which could create a more favourable environment for crypto companies. A strong talent pool can be helpful in developing new products and services, and the DACH region has an abundance of skilled developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at the future of crypto, I am reassured by the state of play in Europe. Yes, there are a number of challenges, but there are also a number of opportunities. The future of crypto in Europe will likely depend on how the industry addresses these challenges and capitalizes on the opportunities arising from DeFi, on-chain KYC, and the Lightning Network to create a safe, transparent, decentralized and trustworthy environment for customers.</p>

 What is Online Identity? 
 A brief definition 
<p>The concept of online identity refers to a persona which people establish for themselves on the internet. Also called internet identity, online personality, or internet persona, it may be used in online communities and websites. It can also be a way of intentionally showing and representing oneself.</p>
<p>Although some people choose to use their real names online, some internet users prefer to be anonymous. They identify themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, an online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Identity vs Digital Identity 
<p>Even though online identity and digital identity are often found in the same context, there is a notable distinction between them. The difference between online identity and digital identity lies in their scope and focus.</p>
<p>Online identity specifically pertains to the persona and representation of a person in the online realm. It encompasses the social identity an individual establishes in online communities, websites, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>It includes elements such as:</p>
 
 Usernames and profiles. 
 Personal information. 
 Digital footprints. 
 
<p>All in all, it is the perception others have of the individual based on their online presence.</p>
<p>Digital identity, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses the information and attributes associated with any entity, not limited to individuals. It extends beyond just personal online presence and encompasses a wider range of entities and their attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes organizational identities, system identities, device identities, and more. It focuses on how entities are identified, authenticated, and represented in the digital domain.</p>
<p>In simple terms, online identity refers to how a person appears and acts online, while digital identity is a broader concept that includes representing any entity in the digital world, such as people, organizations, apps, and devices.</p>
 Digital Footprints 
<p>While navigating the internet, it's important to remember that our online actions can have lasting effects on specific websites. These effects are referred to as digital footprints.</p>
<p>Digital footprints are the marks or records of our online activities and interactions that remain after using digital devices and platforms. They can include different types of data, like personal information, online behaviors, communications, and contributions.</p>
<p>Some examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Social Media Posts 
 Web Browsing History 
 Online Purchases 
 Email Communication 
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
 
 Social Media Posts 
<p>Any content shared on social media platforms, including photos, videos, comments, and likes, contributes to a person's digital footprint. These posts can provide insights into their interests, opinions, and activities.</p>
 Web Browsing History 
<p>Every website visited and the search queries made leave a digital trace in the form of browsing history. It can include information about the types of websites visited, articles read, products searched for, and online services used.</p>
 Online Purchases 
<p>When making online purchases, individuals leave a digital footprint through transaction records. This can include payment information, shipping addresses, and product preferences. This data can be collected and analyzed to understand consumer behavior and tailor personalized advertisements.</p>
 Email Communication 
<p>Emails sent and received, including attachments, provide a digital trail of personal and professional conversations. The content of these emails can reveal information about relationships, affiliations, and communication patterns.</p>
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
<p>The creation and maintenance of online profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, dating websites, or gaming communities contribute to a person's digital footprint. These profiles often contain personal information, employment history, educational background, and connections. And they form a digital representation of an individual's identity.</p>
<p>It's important to note that digital footprints can have implications for privacy, security, and reputation management. The data accumulated over time can be used for various purposes, including targeted advertising, data analysis, and even potential misuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s vital that individuals take extra caution when browsing the internet, especially when sharing private information. Even websites that appear trustworthy may be at risk of data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
 How Online Identity Works 
<p>On a daily basis, individuals rely on their online identities to access various applications. Certain websites play a pivotal role in everyday work, communication, and education. However, there are also online domains that serve as sources of entertainment or offer delightful distractions.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples in which people make use of their online identities:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Social Media 
 Online Gaming 
 Professional Networks 
 Online Communities and Forums 
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
 
<p>Now, let's take a moment to briefly discuss them.</p>
 Social Media 
<p>On platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, online identity is built through the creation of profiles. This may also include sharing personal information, posting content, and engaging with others. For example, a person's online identity on Instagram might include their username, profile picture, bio, and the photos or videos they share.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Gaming 
<p>In the realm of online gaming, players often create unique usernames, avatars, and profiles that represent their gaming persona. Their online identity in this context is influenced by their gaming achievements, playstyle, interactions with other players, and reputation within the gaming community.&nbsp;</p>
 Professional Networks 
<p>Platforms like LinkedIn focus on professional networking and career development. Online identity on LinkedIn is shaped by an individual's professional experience. This can include work experience, education, skills, recommendations, and professional achievements. It allows professionals to establish their expertise, connect with colleagues, and showcase their qualifications.</p>
 Online Communities and Forums 
<p>Though online communities and forums centered around specific interests or hobbies, individuals have the opportunity to participate in discussions, ask questions, and share knowledge. Online identity within these communities is built based on the content contributed, expertise demonstrated, and the respect gained from other community members.&nbsp;</p>
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
<p>When engaging in online shopping, individuals create accounts and profiles on e-commerce platforms. Online identity in this context involves personal information, purchase history, reviews, and ratings given to products or sellers. It influences the trustworthiness and credibility of an individual as a buyer or seller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each of these contexts, online identity is constructed through the information individuals share, their online activities, and the interactions they have with others. It plays a role in shaping how others perceive them and how they navigate various online spaces.</p>
 The Benefits of Having an Online Identity 
<p>Because the wide majority of the world has already adopted modern technology, having an online identity has become a necessity. However, there are a multitude of benefits which come with having an online identity, namely:</p>
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
 Professional Opportunities 
 Networking and Collaboration 
 Personal Branding 
 Access to Resources and Information 
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
<p>Having an online identity allows individuals to extend their reach beyond physical boundaries. It provides a platform to share ideas, expertise, and creativity with a global audience. And this may potentially lead to increased influence and impact.</p>
 Professional Opportunities 
<p>An online identity can open doors to various professional opportunities. It allows individuals to showcase their skills, accomplishments, and qualifications to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It acts as a digital resume, making it easier for others to discover and connect with them.</p>
 Networking and Collaboration 
<p>An online identity facilitates networking and collaboration by connecting individuals with like-minded people, professionals in their field, or communities of interest. It provides a platform to engage in meaningful discussions, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects, fostering valuable connections and relationships.</p>
 Personal Branding 
<p>Online identity enables individuals to shape and manage their personal brand effectively. They can curate their online presence to reflect their values, expertise, and unique qualities. This branding can help individuals stand out, establish credibility, and create a positive perception among peers, potential clients, or collaborators.</p>
 Access to Resources and Information 
<p>Having an online identity grants individuals access to a vast array of resources, information, and opportunities available on the internet. It allows them to tap into online communities, educational platforms, industry-specific websites, and research databases. This empowers them to stay informed, learn, and grow in their personal and professional pursuits.</p>
 Online Identity Risks and Challenges 
<p>As with any innovation, having an online identity does not come without risks. It’s important for people to be aware of these negative aspects and to take precautions to avoid becoming victims. Even more, it’s equally important to spread awareness and educate as many people as possible about these matters.</p>
<p>If proper security measures would be in place, the following situations could be prevented:</p>
 
 Identity Theft 
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
 Online Reputation Damage 
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
 
 Identity Theft 
<p>Online <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> occurs when someone gains unauthorized access to personal information and uses it for fraudulent purposes. For example, a hacker might gain access to an individual's online banking account and use their identity to make unauthorized transactions or steal funds.</p>
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
<p>Phishing is a tactic used by cybercriminals to deceive individuals into sharing sensitive information such as passwords or credit card details by disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity. For example, a person may receive an email appearing to be from their bank, asking them to click on a link and provide login credentials. Hackers may use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the victim's accounts.</p>
 Online Reputation Damage 
<p>In the digital age, a person's online reputation can have significant consequences. Negative or inappropriate content shared online, whether by oneself or others, can harm one's personal or professional reputation. For instance, a controversial tweet or a compromising photo shared online without consent can damage an individual's reputation and have long-lasting consequences.</p>
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">Data breaches</a> occur when sensitive information is accessed, stolen, or exposed due to security vulnerabilities in online systems. This can lead to the compromise of personal information, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, or financial data. An example is when a major retail company experiences a breach, resulting in the theft of customer credit card information from their database.</p>
<p>These risks and challenges highlight the importance of maintaining strong online security practices, being cautious with personal information sharing, and being vigilant about potential threats to online identity.</p>
 How SelfKey May Improve your Online Identity Management

<p>In this vlog, our COO, Huzefa Olia, is joined by Kevin Shanley, Principal at Amazon Web Services Identity to discuss bringing verified identity and passwordless to the masses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Hello and welcome. Hi Kevin, how are you?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Hey, Huzefa. I’m doing great, thanks and yourself?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Wonderful. So you are new to this particular vlog our so would love for you to introduce yourself first to our audience.</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Absolutely. My name is Kevin Shanley. I lead go to market for AWS consumer identity services. And while I’m relatively new at AWS, I’ve actually been an IM for over 25 years.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Thanks for the intro. Now, in your world today you see so many different types of identities that are coming in. What are the different challenges that you see with respect to authentication?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Well, in three words, passwords, friction, and passwordless. If we double click on passwords, they’re difficult to make both complex and to remember. And this makes them susceptible to being these weak, easy, remember simple passwords that are often reused at different sites. And then that next problem becomes friction. So as we try to add security to passwords, we add friction, you make it harder for those legitimate users to actually authenticate.</p>
<p>And then the solution to that is passwordless and this is where everyone wants to go, we all want to go passwordless but that really brings it own set of problems. You may not have hardware that supports passwordless. You may not be a tech savvy person and know how to use passwordless. And so while passwords may not be very secure, at least everyone knows how passwords work, it’s just a known quantity. So that question becomes how do we get to passwordless?</p>
<p>And so well, it can brings up a couple of other points. Huzefa, can you explain how bringing a user’s true identity into authentication enhances both the security and mitigates risks?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Kevin, very interesting question. When you talk about passwordless, there’s so many different ways to get to passwordless in the market today, and most of them always take into the equation what a user’s device is.</p>
<p>But what is important is also to know who’s the user behind the device. You need to know if the user is authorized to access that particular device and the user is in fact the one that you provisioned or you created the account for. At the end of the day, identity and access management has to work together and identity has to be brought in into any kind of an access or a sign on scenario.</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Thanks, Huzefa, that’s great. And so I guess what specific strategies or technologies can be employed to incorporate a user’s true identity into authentication?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Often when we look at any kind of access, we always looking at how do I register a user’s device and then give them access?</p>
<p>What we advocate is when you bring on a user, right, already you, onboard a employee, contractor, customer of yours, do identity proofing or identity verification, and there are various different standards, the most prominent one being the NIST 800-63. So you have a guideline to how to proof and verify a user as well. But the result of that proofing and verification can be not just a verified user, but also using the user’s biometrics to authenticate them.</p>
<p>So today, when you look at any connect for passwordless access, you can essentially ask a user to prove who they are by taking their live biometrics or their live selfie to access various different systems and mainly critical systems as well where you no longer are requiring an OTP, you’re no longer requiring a user just to use a push notification but actually validate themselves by looking at the camera and us identifying if that’s the same user who registered for the service as well.</p>
<p>So hopefully that gave you some context, but now let me ask you this question, Kevin, right? When you see this flow of an identity based authentication, right? How do you think that would benefit? Which industries would benefit from this kind of an authentication?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
So, well, AWS especially, it’s really anything you care about securing, any industry that cares, cares about securing your site, financial services, healthcare, commercial sites. I mean even social networking because you’re concerned about data mining.</p>
<p>This point, bad bot traffic is now the majority of traffic on the internet. And what are these bots doing? They’re creating fake accounts, they’re attempting to break into existing user accounts. And so I mean, why do they even create these fake accounts and how can they create them? It’s because for the most part, nothing is actually verifying that there’s a real person on the end of the line and that that’s a real user identity.</p>
<p>And as we kind of pivot over to identity verification, identity proofing and stronger authentication, passwordless, that’s where we start to really close the loop on that and that’s both, it’s going to mean that you’re going to have real accounts actually in your databases. You’re going to see real traffic and real metrics and not have it all abstracted with a bunch of bad bot traffic and you’re going to end up as well as saving money because you’re not going to have to pay for that bot traffic that are taking up your monthly user accounts and such.</p>
<p>And so I guess from your perspective Huzefa, what steps can an organization take to successfully roll out an identity based authentication for the masses?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Simple answer to this would be to include any kind of identity proofing and verification into your onboarding flow. And your onboarding flow can be depending on the persona of the user, if it’s an employer or contractor, when you’re creating them as a new user. If you have customers when you’re registering them, for example, for financial services, if you’re doing a KYC or if you’re in retail and if you need to know for any kind of offer sensitive transaction that needs to be done, know who the user is, do the proofing and verification that is required, which will have all the added benefits of reducing fraud like you mentioned Kevin. And then not just do this one time, but use this identity template that has been accumulated for that specific user to use that into their authentication as well.</p>
<p>So all of, our companies have worked together to put 1Kosmos and the AWS solutions. Where do you think this collaboration with 1Kosmos and AWS will contribute to the market?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Oh, great question. So well, coming from the AWS side and how I see it, AWS is the leading cloud provider and AWS identity and access management services were recently given a top customer choice award from Gartner. In fact, AWS IM handles hundreds of millions of API calls per second, which is just a crazy number. I mean hundreds of millions of API calls per second. So we go big, we do identity well, but we can’t be everywhere. We can’t do everything.</p>
<p>And as an agile startup, 1Kosmos has both, I think the technical depth and focus to really innovate in identity-based authentication. And together I think we bring that targeted innovation together with the stability, scale availability, and cost-efficient computing to drive identity over to all to the masses.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Thank you. Thank you for that, Kevin. This is very, very insightful and I’m sure our audience wants to learn a little bit more about this. So you are going to Identiverse, you will be speaking at Identiverse. Can you tell our audience where will you be?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Yeah, absolutely. So, at Identiverse, I’ll be speaking with Mike Engle in Las Vegas. The title of our session is Bringing Verified Identity and Password List to the Masses, and that’s going to be running at 4:30 PM on Thursday, June the 1st.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Awesome. Look forward to. I’ll be audience as well.</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Great. Looking forward to seeing you there.</p>

				  Vital records&nbsp;— such as your birth, death, marriage, and divorce certificates&nbsp;— are going digital. The only question is how. In this article, we explain why verifiable credential technology offers the best solution.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>As we look to modernize legacy systems and create digital equivalents of our most important and personal documents, it is important to get this transformation right. As a leading developer of verifiable data solutions using open-source decentralized identity technology, Indicio would like to offer the following recommendations for governments looking into turning vital paper records into vital digital records.&nbsp;</p>
 Do 
<p>Build on open-source technology</p>
<p>To put it simply, don’t tie yourself to proprietary technology when technology is evolving at a rapid pace. Plus, there’s the risk of not being able to interoperate with other identity and data ecosystems unless you go down the path of costly and complex direct integrations. With open source you own your solution and can develop on it as you see fit. You also benefit from the innovation generated by a vibrant open-source community. Community-developed code tends to be more resilient code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make use of decentralization technology</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technology allows people to hold their own data and share it in a way that the authenticity and integrity of the data can be verified without having to check in with or create a direct integration with the issuer of the information. This means that a vital record can be immediately trusted and easily shared across different systems. Sharing records through a peer-to-peer encrypted channel further enhances privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide verification methods for partners and stakeholders</p>
<p>When it comes to vital records, digital copies will only be as useful in proportion to their adoption and verification. To have a successful solution businesses and organizations must be able to easily recognize and verify a vital digital record as an acceptable document.</p>
<p>More partners and stakeholders also bring their own points of view, priorities, and use cases; they may have ideas for adoption and use cases that you haven’t thought of yet!</p>
<p>Start somewhere</p>
<p>You need to make something. Excitement over an idea can spread easily, but progress cant happen until you have a prototype or proof of concept. Even if it’s not perfect, it drives feedback from stakeholders, customers, or partners.</p>
 Don’t 
<p>Get locked into a proprietary solution</p>
<p>Even if it’s a solution from a big name there’s alway the risk of loss of support or costly upgrades. Open-source code provides longevity—it’s something you can fully own, develop on as you see fit, or draw on new features being added to the codebase by other users. This is why governments are increasingly requiring open-source solutions in RFPs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait for the perfect solution</p>
<p>Several states have already implemented virtual driver’s licenses. The technology is mature and has already been deployed by many governments. As the technology evolves incremental changes are possible to keep your solution up to date.</p>
<p>Build a siloed solution</p>
<p>Interoperability is important to creating a vital record that is widely recognized. Building and testing your solutions with other compatible solutions guarantees your records will be easily verifiable.</p>
<p>A key takeaway here is that this technology is not difficult to integrate into current systems. All this data is already available in government databases. The addition of verifiable credentials allows people to better manage their own documents and have an extra layer of security and verification.</p>
<p>The effort to move vital records from paper file cabinets to digital wallets or files is both nuanced and exciting to the team here at Indicio. If you found these tips helpful or would like to pick our team’s brain about a specific project you are working on please feel free to reach out to us <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">here.</a></p>

<p>Anonyome Labs’ CTO and Co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley recently gave Australian students studying advanced topics in security 7 insights into how&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;(DI) is rapidly solving the global&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data privacy crisis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He gave the lecture at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/">The University of Queensland</a>, a leading provider of education in cyber security, cryptography and blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley’s lecture explored how DI is the new approach to identity management on the internet and&nbsp;the biggest privacy breakthrough of the next decade.&nbsp;</p>



 Dr Ashley’s 7 insights were: 



 
 We need to improve privacy in the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">surveillance economy</a>. Data breaches have eroded consumer trust in organizations that collect and store their personal data and users urgently need to regain control. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/inside-the-massive-projected-growth-in-the-decentralized-identity-market/">Decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;enables selective disclosure around digital proof of identity, and we’re already seeing rapid uptake of this in government uses such as licenses and everyday applications such as gym memberships. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">Verifiable credentials</a>&nbsp;(VCs) have quickly become the “killer feature” of DI because they’re making selective disclosure of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">PII</a>&nbsp;possible and will drive DI’s&nbsp;ubiquity across the internet in the next decade.&nbsp; 



 The rise and rise of VCs has led to the widespread need for the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallet</a>, a massive growth area. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">Blockchain</a>&nbsp;is the anchor of&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in decentralized systems, and therefore DI is one of the most important use cases for blockchain technology.&nbsp; 



 DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity/">standards</a>&nbsp;are rapidly evolving to drive interoperability of DI solutions across the internet.&nbsp; 



 Block’s&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/tbdex/">tbdex decentralized exchange protocol</a>&nbsp;is a useful case study for organizations interested in this space.&nbsp;

<p>Many organizations are turning to passwordless authentication solutions to secure their systems and remove vulnerabilities from identity management.</p>
<p>Discover magic link authentication—a secure, passwordless login method that simplifies user access and enhances security through unique URLs.</p>
 What Is Magic Link Authentication? 
<p>Magic link authentication is a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">passwordless authentication</a> method that allows users to log in to a website or application using a unique, one-time-use URL sent to their registered email address.</p>
<p>When users want to sign in, they enter their email address, and the system generates a “magic link,” which is then emailed to them. The user clicks on the link and is automatically logged into the website or application.</p>
<p>Magic links, like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/one-time-password/">one-time passwords</a>, are often time-sensitive, expiring after a certain period or once they have been clicked. This helps enhance security and reduces the chances of unauthorized access. Using magic links simplifies the login process but relies on the user’s email account, which could be a potential point of vulnerability in case of phishing attacks or email service issues.</p>
 How Does Magic Link Authentication Work? 
<p>Magic link authentication uses a “magic link,” or one-time-use URL sent to a user’s registered email address. This link facilitates specialized and time-based authentication that doesn’t rely on passwords.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:</p>
 
 User Access: Users who want to log in to a website or application enter their email address and request a magic link. 
 Link Generation: The system checks if the provided email address is associated with a registered user. If so, the system generates a unique and time-sensitive link that contains a token specific to that user and session. 
 Delivery: The system sends an email containing the magic link to the user’s registered email address, assuming only the user has access. 
 Token Validation: When the user clicks the link, the website or application receives the token via the user’s web browser and validates it across several criteria, including user credentials, time (has it expired?) or use (has it already been validated?). 
 Authentication: If the token is valid and corresponds to the correct user, the system logs the user in, granting them access to their account without requiring a traditional username and password. 
 Token Expiration: If the magic link is used for authentication or if a predetermined time passes, the token is invalidated. Any future attempts to use the link will result in rejection. 
 
<p>Some magic link authentication systems will use SMS alongside or in place of email. However, these are rare in widely-adopted consumer platforms (although they might be more realistically implemented in enterprise systems).</p>
 Are There Drawbacks to Using Magic Link Authentication? 
<p>This process seems relatively straightforward and, ideally, secure. It removes the necessity of using passwords which, as we’ve talked about in previous articles, removing passwords can significantly reduce an organization’s attack surface.</p>
<p>While magic link authentication offers several benefits, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider:</p>
 
 Dependency on Email: Magic link authentication relies on the user’s email account, which can be an issue if the email service is down or the user loses access to their email account. It also requires users to access their email whenever they want to log in, which might only sometimes be convenient. SMS can provide an alternative to circumvent this issue. 
 Vulnerability to Phishing Attacks: If users become more comfortable clicking links in emails, they may mistake phishing attacks for authentication emails. Therefore, it’s also critical that organizations offer training and education around technology. 
 Context-Specific Security: Magic link authentication might not be ideal for specific situations, such as when a high level of security is required or when compliance and regulations call for a specific approach to authentication. Magic links also do not support identity verification independently and can open up issues when such proof is required. 
 Delays: Users might experience a delay in the authentication process since they have to wait for the magic link to be delivered to their email inbox. The email containing the magic link may also be misidentified as spam and end up in the spam folder, complicating the login process. 
 Token Management: The server-side implementation of magic link authentication requires proper management of tokens, including generating, storing, and verifying them securely. This adds complexity to the system and could introduce vulnerabilities if not done correctly. 
 
<p>While magic link authentication has advantages, these drawbacks should be considered when deciding whether it’s the best choice for a particular website or application.</p>
 How Does Magic Link Authentication Support Passwordless Login? 
<p>Magic links support passwordless authentication by providing a secure and convenient alternative to traditional username and password combinations. Instead of relying on passwords, users authenticate themselves using unique, one-time-use URLs sent to their registered email addresses. Here’s how magic links enable passwordless authentication:</p>
 
 Simplicity: Magic links eliminate the need for users to remember, manage, and enter passwords, making the authentication process more straightforward and user-friendly. 
 Security: Since magic links are time-sensitive and generated on-demand, they offer a secure authentication method. They expire after being used or after a predetermined period, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. By not requiring users to enter passwords, magic links also help mitigate the risks associated with weak passwords, credential leaks, or password reuse. 
 Improved User Experience: Magic link authentication streamlines the login process, making it faster and more efficient. Additionally, if the user has access to their email via a mobile device (or they use SMS-based authentication), they can essentially authenticate themselves wherever they are. 
 Reduced Reliance on Passwords: Magic links reduce the dependence on passwords, which can be problematic due to forgotten or reused passwords and the need for regular password updates. Passwordless authentication through magic links can also reduce the burden on users and IT support. 
 
<p>With magic links, passwordless authentication offers a more convenient and potentially more secure method for users to access their accounts without relying on traditional passwords. However, it is essential to remember that this method depends on the user’s email account, which could be a potential point of vulnerability in case of phishing attacks or email service issues.</p>

The overall goal of the collaboration is to look with fresh eyes at the challenges and opportunities presented by an equitable decarbonisation of Europe’s land and buildings. We are heartened by the response that this blog series has generated so far and we will incorporate the insights into our future thinking and work. If you have any thoughts or reflections on this final blog (or on blogs <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">one</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-961744d2cb36">two</a> or <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada">three</a>) then please share them to progress this critical just transition conversation.</p> Part 4 (of 4): Network building: strategies to support and amplify the network of innovative organisations operating within Europe’s built environment  Boldly inviting a more regenerative and inclusive future to be discovered <blockquote>“It is exceptionally easy to become adjusted to catastrophe” — Adrienne&nbsp;Buller</blockquote><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada">Blog 3</a> of this series, we highlighted some inspiring examples of actors innovating in the social and ecological spaces of Europe’s transition. These sparks of fierce hope must be celebrated and bolstered, but we must also challenge ourselves to recognise and lean into the strategic gaps between them. If we want to move from lifeboats and beautiful exceptions to enduring social and spatial justice, we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent.</p>Mapping the density of alternative housing and land models in&nbsp;Europe<p>The gaps and inadequacies in the more intangible aspects of our political economy, have been surfacing with increasing frequency across many aspects of our work. Despite this initiative being focused on the specific context of Europe’s built environment, some institutional and social intelligence gaps are pervasive across all sectors. In our recent conversations we have started to think about these insufficiencies in terms of three strategic themes, as summarised below:</p><p>(1) A new cultural&nbsp;logic</p><p>In our view the current cultural logic for how we share and use assets and spaces in our cities is outdated and unjust. In the future, how can we think about creating a new Use Justice Economy, to unlock fundamentally different ways of coexisting in Europe’s built environment? The melting pot of our physical constraints and social thermodynamics is forging a new political landscape that we are ill equipped to navigate. We must therefore begin constructing the inclusive, everyday politics for a post-abundant yet just society. This will require designing and testing new generative public engagement processes, together with facilitating the R&amp;D that will be needed to support and evolve&nbsp;them.</p><p>(2) An interconnected understanding of civic&nbsp;value</p><p>The dominant economic theory of value is stifling appropriate adaptation and mitigation responses. Outdated accounting frameworks are no longer capable of capturing and presenting the intangible value of buildings and land (for example, the reduced levels of depression that are associated with co-housing models). They also ignore many of the associated risks and liabilities (such as the negative shared impacts on air quality of privately owned buildings continuing to be heated using fossil fuels). In reality, there are entire classes of assets that are missing from our investment and scenario plans; why for example are intangible public assets like preventative health still considered as a cost rather than an investment in governmental budgets? It is becoming apparent that the accounting, legal and investment frameworks of a just future are missing, whilst the existing versions will become increasingly obsolete as the constraint pressures escalate.</p><p>(3) Next generation institutions</p><p>As we have been writing these blogs a constant nagging question is the yes but…..How will many of the pathways we are suggesting be given the legitimacy and teeth to be impactful at the city, regional or country level? There is a clear need for an entire suite of next generation institutions; agile, multidisciplinary governance and decision-making vehicles, capable of building strategies and responses for the years of transition and beyond. Examples might include city land trusts (to collectively own and regulate the real estate prices), public-city banks (to receive and allocate funding on behalf of residents) or carbon and material city guardians (to measure and regulate the use of limited resources).</p> People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw&nbsp;stones <p>It is very easy to sit behind a screen, talking and writing about the opportunities and challenges of a just transition. We might leave our comfort zone at times, sharing our models for feedback and inviting others to critique and improve our thinking, but the consequences of our actions are limited. Yet what would our response be if we were actually held to account? If Dark Matter Labs was somehow granted carte blanche over EU decision making for a day, what policies or interventions would we introduce? Let’s suppose we had a large endowment; how would we allocate those funds and why? Or, if we were asked to play an orchestration role in coordinating the transition landscape, how would we&nbsp;proceed?</p><p>In reality, any strategy is restricted by the quality of the inputs that shape it. If we had the required resources and authority, we would therefore seek to rapidly increase the number and diversity of people who are able to interact with the problem space. Many people have an intuition of what could and probably should be happening, but having the time or resources to engage deeply with such ideas is a privilege reserved for the minority. We are well aware that writing blogs such as this one, is a well-intentioned yet wholly inadequate contribution towards democratising the response dialogues. In our view, socialising the constraints and implied response strategies, together with actively engaging citizens from across Europe in their design, is an absolute priority. If we had the agency we would co-create a playbook for the future, a kind of break glass in case of emergency set of policies, designed by the citizens of Europe for our shared&nbsp;futures.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@isawred?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">iSawRed</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> The evolving funding landscape: opening a space for collaborative dialogue <p>From a funding standpoint, our instinct is that any collectively intelligent strategic response could (and in fact should) include varied and co-existing approaches. If we start from a constraints frame and fan out towards an ecosystem of desired outcomes, there is the potential to build coherence across the system without limiting the scope of imaginative possibility. It seems likely that there are areas of interest, geographical points of focus, or thematic investments that can be interwoven to support the overall transition. Or, perhaps by collating narratives, ideas, case studies and conversations we could encourage new connections to form that are beyond our current perception. It feels important that we move beyond conversations about distributed power, to open space for aspects such as the equity and inclusivity of who is included (and / or centred). In our experience, there is a delicate balance between the desire to be regenerative by design and the constrictive arrogance that can be contained within that aspiration. This is an interesting point of tension that we aim to respect without surrendering our agency or accountability.</p><p>Encouragingly, we have recently observed an increasing appetite amongst funders to discuss and coordinate their strategies. This is an exciting and emerging area of our wider work and is explored in depth in our BeyondTheRules publications (for example in this <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/grantmaking-beyondtherules-8dfc752df3da">grantmaking provocation)</a>. At this point however, it is important to acknowledge that all the funders we interact with, already have deeply thoughtful and considered strategies in place. The following four groupings are therefore solely offered as prompts for discussion and reflection:</p><p>(1) Horizontal knowledge networks</p><p>How can we think about building the deep expertise needed to reimagine core components of the built environment? An example would be Community Land Trusts which have the potential to fundamentally change the unjust economic logic of land speculation. Encouragingly, the <a href="https://www.clteurope.org/">European CLT Network</a> will launch in June 2023 (with support from <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/">Laudes Foundation</a> and <a href="https://world-habitat.org/">World Habitat</a>) with the aim of scaling and deepening the impact of the CLT model across Europe. Despite this potential many challenges remain; for example, what kind of legislative changes will be needed across different geographies to support their wider uptake? How can we ensure they are not co-opted or exploited in the future? Will we need new accounting methodologies to represent their holistic&nbsp;value?</p><p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.youngfoundation.org/">Young Foundation</a> partnered with the <a href="https://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/">Community Land Trust Network</a> to bring together a group of researchers, to highlight barriers and opportunities in relation to diversity and inclusion in the CLT movement¹. A similar idea would be to analyse international best practice to identify existing and potential future pathway gaps. For example, a strong collaboration might be between the <a href="https://groundedsolutions.org/strengthening-neighborhoods/community-land-trusts">Grounded Solutions Network in the US</a>, <a href="https://www.communitylandscotland.org.uk/">Community Land Scotland</a> and a university research&nbsp;team.</p><p>(2) Moving from new economic demonstrators to full system demonstrators</p><p>System demonstrators intersect at multiple levels of the system; from mapping available land to designing new forms of finance or advocacy, thus shifting the boundaries of political possibility. If we think about eliminating vacant space in cities, what kind of actors would be needed to create viable operational models? How could they be replicated (or adapted) for varied geographies and contexts? How can we ensure robust knowledge sharing is built into their blueprint?</p><p>We conceive a system demonstrator to represent four intersecting elements:</p>  The physical, tangible demonstration of a new way of organising. For example, innovative multipurpose space use in a central district;  The system innovations that service it, such as holistic (multi-value) business plans and care agreements (as opposed to transactional contracts);  The market making infrastructure that will enable scaling (e.g.<a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/publications/public-common-partnerships-building-new-circuits-of-collective-ownership"> public-commons institutions</a> or inclusive planning&nbsp;laws);  The cultural conversations that are necessary to expand the Overton window and shift market dynamics.  <p>The coordination of these different threads is nuanced and complex. The space for creative divergence needs to be balanced with supportive, committed orchestration to drive the overall mission forwards. This is a critical area of collective capability which we believe will only be realised via deeply rooted place-based experimentation, combined with the development of technical tools and institutional reforms. Laudes currently supports some specific demonstrator projects, for example the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/press-releases/eit-climate-kic-and-partners-collaborate-with-laudes-foundation-to-advance-madrid-and-milan-sustainable-urban-approach-across-europe-2/">EU Cinco collaboration</a> which is showcasing projects for bio based and circular construction in Madrid and Milan. In the future, could we think about connecting demonstrators relating to different scales and contexts, to systemically amplify alternative visions and cultural attractors?</p><p>(3) Coordination / orchestration hubs</p><p>There is a vital requirement for actors who can play system facilitation roles in the built environment. Developing system capabilities is deep, complex work (with infinite unfolding directions and feedback loops) and thus requires reimagining our networks of governance. How can we begin designing and testing new types of highly agile institutions and equitable decision-making processes for this sector? For example, could cities with strong administrative innovation capacity (e.g. <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/innovation/">Amsterdam’s Innovation Unit</a> or <a href="https://www.stadtwohnen-chemnitz.de/arbeitsbereiche/">Chemnitz</a> in Germany) be facilitated to support hubs in emerging locations (e.g. <a href="https://ekyl.ee/en/">EKUL</a> in Estonia or <a href="https://restartukraine.io/">Restart Ukraine</a>)? Similar existing examples are the <a href="https://urbact.eu/who-we-are">EU EUBACT</a> that supports cities to coordinate and share knowledge and the <a href="https://www.alt-bau.eu/en/">ALT/BAU Transfer Network</a> that connects cities to activate unused and decaying housing&nbsp;stock.</p><p>(4) Distributed communities of practice and geographical hubs</p><p>Is there an opportunity to focus on core organisations who are centred on the inclusivity of ownership (e.g., CLTs, cooperative housing, other shared equity models) and support them to make the pathways for their operations (e.g, materials, governance, legals) and scaling (e.g, publicity, finance, policy) both more inclusive and regenerative? An example could be to look at the inclusivity of materials used in retrofitting and whether nature-based solutions could (a) improve the outcomes for low income groups in hot countries by reducing the costs of cooling (b) make the buildings more sustainable through carbon capture. Or, a cooperative housing network such as <a href="https://moba.coop/">MOBA</a> could potentially collaborate with an organisation in the same region (such as <a href="https://fundacjabrda.org/en/">Brda </a>in Poland) to improve the equitable and regenerative elements of their material procurement processes. In some cases this network could be enabled across contexts as a type of distributed community of practice. In others, a geographical capability hub might be more effective. In both cases the goal would be to strengthen or create the support pathways needed, for inclusive and regenerative scaling of the anchor&nbsp;model.</p><p>Alternatively, organisations who are creating these pathways could be supported individually, on the assumption that they will be needed for the future development and scaling of any collaborative housing models (including those that do not exist yet). These foundational pathway organisations could be conceptually clustered by theme; for example to address specific constraints (e.g. dematerialisation), or by leverage points in the system such as inclusive financing models.</p>Tracing potential networks of coherent collaboration The end comes before the beginning and the beginning comes after the&nbsp;end <p>At times during this project, looking for organisations who are working at the intersection of economic, ownership and governance issues, whilst concurrently striving for social inclusiveness and a regenerative future for Europe’s built environment, has felt like looking for a needle in a haystack. This is strangely reassuring! If the responses needed were clear and neatly packaged, we would most likely have missed the point. We are living through a complex, epoch-making moment that demands a planetary level of collective intelligence. In many respects, our understanding of the scale of Europe’s just transition challenge is only beginning to crystallise as we conclude this 4-part blog&nbsp;series.</p><p>We are grateful and honoured to be part of this community and look forward to continuing the conversation. Some immediate steps to move this work forwards are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  We will write a follow-up blog to respond to challenges, thoughts and suggestions that we have received in response to this initial blog&nbsp;series;  If you have an innovative model or idea that requires funding to scale or develop, then Laudes invite you to contact Laudes Foundation via this <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/contact">contact page</a> and address the enquiry to Alice Haugh in the Built Environment team;  Laudes is supporting a group of organisations to develop a collective theory of change to scale up the principles of collaborative housing across Europe: <a href="https://sostrecivic.coop/">Sostre Civic</a>, <a href="https://moba.coop/">MOBA</a>, <a href="https://www.urbamonde.org/?lang=en">UrbaMonde</a> and <a href="https://urbanlabtorino.it/projects/netco/?lang=en">NETCO</a>. This initiative is led by <a href="https://www.odsupport.eu/">ODS</a> and they will be attending the <a href="https://socialhousingfestival.eu/">International Social Housing Festival in Barcelona</a> (7–9th June) and <a href="https://urban-future.org/">Urban Future Festival in Stuttgart</a> (21–23rd of June). If this area of innovation appeals to you and is geographically practical then it could be a good opportunity to connect to this new&nbsp;network.  <p>The Dark Matter project team who co-authored this blog are Emily Harris (emily@darkmatterlabs), Aleksander Nowak (Aleks@darkmatterlabs), Vlad Afanasiev (vlad@darkmatterlabs) and Indy Johar (indy@darkmatterlabs).</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) <a href="https://www.youngfoundation.org/peer-research-network/projects/diversity-and-inclusion-in-community-land-trusts/">https://www.youngfoundation.org/peer-research-network/projects/diversity-and-inclusion-in-community-land-trusts/</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-part-4-89c7683bd2c7">Laudes x Dark Matter Labs: A just transition of Europe’s built environment (Part 4)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Have you been involved with acquiring a software product for your company? If you have, you know that finding and purchasing a solution that meets your specific enterprise needs can be a challenging process. We understand the difficulty that buyers face when trying to match vendor capabilities with business requirements. After reviewing multiple vendor solutions, product web pages, and data sheets, they all start to sound the same. And videos often focus more on the muzak and narration than on educating the viewer on a specific point. Free trial accounts provide rudimentary access to the product that does not give the user the ability to explore more complex use cases.</p>

 We sit down with Martin Lycka, SVP for American Regulatory Affairs and Responsible Gambling at Entain to discuss Brazil’s upcoming gaming regulations, advice for operators, and the importance of integrity in the emerging LATAM market.&nbsp; 



 



 There is a great disparity in global gambling regulations, in terms of scope and severity, how do you compare the European regulatory landscape with emerging markets like LATAM?&nbsp; 



<p>Europe, at the risk of stating the obvious, is way ahead Latin America (LATAM) in terms of gambling regulation. However, despite a few false dawns, Brazil is firmly on the path to regulating sports betting in a near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Columbia is a great example of a very successful LATAM regulatory regime, which has drawn a lot of inspiration from gaming regulation in Spain. I think this is partly because of similarities in language and culture. It’s also worth bearing in mind that although individual jurisdictions are different and follow different kinds of sports and markets, we are talking about sports betting, so basic product mechanics will always be the same to reflect requirements in regulation.&nbsp;</p>



 Which other LATAM countries are currently in the process of regulating the industry?&nbsp; 



<p>Most Latin American countries have already regulated the land-based sector in one way or another, so it really comes down to regulating their online space. Some Argentinian provinces have regulated online gambling, and, like Canada, appear to be taking it province by province. Peru and Chile are also looking into potentially regulating online gambling and I’m hopeful it will happen in the foreseeable future, but as they’re both facing a political crisis, this is unlikely to happen any time soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Peru passed legislation that would permit the regulation of the online gambling sector last year, recent riots have again stalled any developments. In Chile, President Gabriel Boric has stated that he’s keen on revamping the Chilean constitution, but that process failed, and as a result, he’s in the process of picking up the pieces and pondering what to do next.</p>

 Brazil is on the cusp of regulation – when is Brazil’s gaming regulation likely to be passed?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The regulation will go to the Congress as a legislative bill, with constitutional urgency. This means that the Congress will have to debate and vote on it in the next 3-6 months. So, if the bill is approved, it’s likely the regulated market will launch in early 2024. As the bill is at an extremely high level, it authorizes the authorities to kick off the licensing process. There will be an uncapped number of licenses, an open licensing system, which provides for additional taxation measures. Regulation is likely to cover the process of instituting licensing, payment processing, and the requirement for internet service providers to block the internet connection for operators who choose not to become regulated.&nbsp;</p>



 What is your advice to operators based in, or targeting the Brazilian market? How should they prepare for upcoming regulation? 



<p>It should by no means come as a surprise. Brazilian sports betting regulations have been debated since 2018, when the government was authorized by Congress to regulate sports betting. My advice to operators is to keep a close eye on proceedings and start getting themselves ready. In the absence of the final iterations of regulations, however, it’s still advisable to exercise caution until regulations are passed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s very likely that the regulation will require operators to incorporate an entity in Brazil. I would not expect an obligation to locate the actual premises on the ground, as that could effectively kill the industry, but operators should be prepared to provide the Brazilian authorities with access to the data of Brazilian customers in one way or another. This could be remote, or by means of having a data server on the ground. Regarding customer verification, I believe this will be linked to their CPF identification number (a tax number attributed by the Brazilian Federal Revenue to Brazilians and foreigners who pay taxes in Brazil). There is also likely to be a focus on sports integrity, and on responsible gambling, not only because of recent match-fixing scandals that have <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwivjvb-2_z-AhUUa8AKHfvsCo0QxfQBKAB6BAgHEAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2023%2F05%2F11%2Ffootball%2Fbrazil-soccer-match-fixing-investigation-spt-intl%2Findex.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ChG0c4DUmxIfpfi26tQr9">marred Brazilian football</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government and regulator have reviewed existing regulations in other countries, so it’s also likely to take inspiration from those.&nbsp;</p>



 There’s a lot of talk about Responsible Gambling in the<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/"> UK government’s gambling white paper</a>, and it’s likely to feature heavily in Brazilian regulations. What does Responsible Gambling mean to you? How do you interpret it?&nbsp; 



<p>Responsible gambling is critical to the long-term sustainability of this industry. I’ve been personally working very closely with the regulator on responsible gambling standards and fully in intend to continue to do so. When the Brazilian market is finally regulated, that will provide both the operators and authorities with tools to more efficiently address the kinds of match-fixing scandals that we have seen recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The onus is on us as an industry to protect our customers, and, of course, help our customers to help themselves. That still gets sort of underestimated. If customers are beyond the point of being able to do that, that’s where we need to step up even more. The more individual care we can provide problem gamblers the better. Because what works for one person may not work for the other. Just like on the consumer side or promotional side of things: what may not be of interest to you, may be of interest to someone else, and vice-versa. This underscores the need to individualize and personalize care. That’s what I would love to see in the years to come throughout Latin America.&nbsp;</p>



 In a tangible sense, what would these kinds of measures look like? 



<p>In my view, it’s a combination of three critical pillars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Education. We need to find even more efficient ways of educating everyone involved, which goes well beyond our customers. It’s the public at large, including key decision makers, which is why Entain has launched programs here in the States (and in other countries), with the likes of the NFL, MLS, and most recently with the NHL alumni. I’ve also worked with retired athletes such as Charles Oakley and Jayson Williams to serve as responsible gambling ambassadors to convey even more efficient messages about responsible gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prevention. We need to provide our customers with tools to help themselves, and if they cannot do that anymore, we need to step in, take over control of the gambling platform – we call them interceptors. Or even just by giving customers a ring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third pillar is to put customers on a firm path toward healing; a firm treatment path. Again, the onus is on us, the industry.&nbsp;</p>

 Regarding the Canadian gaming sector, do you think it’s only a matter of time before other provinces follow Ontario and open the market to private operators?&nbsp; 



<p>Yes, it is the short answer to that, I expect Alberta to follow suit very soon, and then British Columbia, but I’m not going to speculate as to the timetable. I think if other provinces choose to go down the Ontario route, it would be the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/">most sensible thing to do</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why do you think some countries, for example Canada and Argentina, favor such a province-by-province approach to implementing nationwide regulations?&nbsp; 



<p>It’s a constitutional and legacy issue in both instances. In Canada, for example, back in 85 or 86, the federal government devolved competencies to regulate all forms of gambling, not just online gambling, to individual provinces. That is the setup, which is like the US. New Jersey, where I am based, recently won a very hard-fought for victory to regulate sports betting and online gaming, and it’s the same in Canada.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And today, we’ll hear some new ideas about open finance, open banking and definitely a bit more.</p>
<p>For that, we have our special guest today who is Michelle Beyo. She is the CEO and Founder of FINAVATOR, an award-winning payments and future of finance consultancy. She’s also a strategic adviser to FinTech’s, a Money 20/20 Rise Up alumni, a Global Council Member of Women in Payments, the Membership Chair at Canadian Prepaid Providers Organisation, a Payment Advisor at the National Crowdfunding and FinTech Association of Canada and a Board Member at Open Banking Initiative Canada.</p>
<p>Michelle started for FINAVATOR as she is passionate about payments and financial inclusion. She has 20 years of extensive industry experience, driving innovation across the retail and payments industry. Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>Michelle Beyo: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. I’m really happy to have you here in the show.</p>
<p>Michelle: Happy to be here as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, Michelle, let’s talk about digital identity. I want to start hearing a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I’m happy to share a little bit. I actually spent 20 years in the corporate space. Six years in telco and eight years in online shopping affiliate marketing. Ran Alaska, Lufthansa, Delta, United online shopping mall platforms. I really got to understand the relationship between customer and loyalty infrastructure.</p>
<p>And then I moved into the payment space. Working for the largest prepaid company globally, called InComm, out of their international office for 30 countries. And was running sales and marketing, launched their B2B division, got to see what was happening in innovation across these 30 other countries, including Singapore, Australia, UK. Helped launch WeChat in North America at 711 through the Gift Card rail, QR payment system. And truly realised – a little fearful that my kids were going to end up with Asian banking. Due to the advancements, and how far beyond where we are in North America, that Asia basically was from a banking infrastructure set in 2017.</p>
<p>And I took a leap into the startup world focused on blockchain digital identity at a startup as a Chief Client Officer in 2018. And after a year with them and helping with Bahama digital ID infrastructure and helping consent on blockchain. I actually won Money 20/20 Rise Up. Where they picked out of 500 women, 30 women to come into the Vegas largest payments conference in the world and have a separate accelerated track.</p>
<p>And as soon as I found out that I had won one of this coveted 30 spots, I quit my job at the startup and started FINAVATOR. Which is actually now four years ago in July. And starting this consultancy, did not have any consultancy experience. But did have all of my background, which I felt was touching the future of finance from telco infrastructure to affiliate marketing, online shopping. The move to digital prepaid payment infrastructures, how they were backing all new challenger bank infrastructure, BaaS infrastructure, and then digital ID.</p>
<p>So FINAVATOR truly became my ability to try and help banks, credit unions, FinTechs and corporations move to the future of finance. And really have enjoyed my journey out on my own.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely quite interesting, because you have been involved in several industries that are pretty different itself. So many are, yeah, oriented to interacting with the customer. So, understanding how the customer – what the customer needs, etc. And then just in the last year, you came to identity. So now you have this amazing experience and you’re doing your own consultancy.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, you have been working on a lot of payments and that is leading you to the future of finance. So, the topics we’d like to start addressing today are open banking and open finance. So, if you can give us what are these two terms in a nutshell, what would you say?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. I think, at its simplest point – open banking, which started in the UK in 2017. Is a safe and secure way to share data in an ecosystem. So, thinking of back to my telco days, when I started. You would sign up to one provider for three years, and you couldn’t leave. If you left, there was a penalty, and your number was owned by that telco. So, if you went to a different telco because they had a better service, you’d basically lose your identity, which was your phone number. And have to send an email to all of your friends with your new number. And they would have to reprogram your phone number in their phones.</p>
<p>There was something called Open Telco. Or at least number portability, that was mandated in Canada and many other countries around 2015. And this allowed to empower the consumer to officially own their phone number. So, if I left one telco to go to another, I didn’t have to lose my identity, which I had built for, let’s say, 10 years. As this phone number represents myself. So, I was able to port it to a competitor to get better service.</p>
<p>So, to me, open banking is that same concept of having a safe and secure way to port my data. From one bank to another bank, from one bank to a FinTech, from a bank to a wealth advisor. So really just giving me the freedom that – the information that is mine, that defines me, can be utilised to help me get a better loan. Help me get a better rate, help me get the service that is customised to myself. Based on the data that happens to live with my current bank.</p>
<p>So open banking was a regulated movement that started in the UK to force the CMA 9, which is the nine biggest banks in the UK, to create an API that was standardised. To allow for safe and secure data sharing, that was all based on consumer consent. As well as create competition, by allowing FinTechs or third-party providers to hit a certain bar of the certification to be allowed in the system.</p>
<p>So, let’s say Revolut. If you were a Lloyds customer, and you wanted to go to Revolut. And you wanted Revolut to have these five pieces of data to offer you a different product that maybe had better pricing. You were able to do that through consent through the Revolut app. And that data was then able to safely port from Lloyds to Revolut.</p>
<p>And the biggest point, I think on all of this is – in open banking there is a right to delete your data. So that data can then be deleted and to me, this is creating less data in the world. And having more control over it as a consumer. As well as empowering new services, new offerings, new companies to help serve the underserved and help serve the current market in a better, more efficient way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And I like your analogy. You started talking analogy also in telecommunication in the mobile, consumer mobile networks. The mobile number portability, which is something I think at this point, I’m not sure it’s everywhere in the world. But I think it’s by large in many countries, it’s available and it’s something that today we take for granted. But it was very painful, not long ago, it was very painful as you have described.</p>
<p>So just the idea of having a similar easiness in translated to the to the banks sounds like a dream for the ones who still have not experienced. I have not experienced something like that yet. Yeah, so definitely it sounds like a great thing to keep it spreading. And you have summarised saying that this open banking is in a nutshell is securely sharing data of the consumers. So, one consumer can move from one bank to another, or even a FinTech as you mentioned so.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, and I think the evolution of that is open finance. Which I would say is a hot topic in today’s market. The UK is moving to PSD 3, which is bringing them to open finance. Australia started with open data as a concept through a Consumer Data Right for all citizens across five industries. Which I think is the most concise vision across all countries. So, they started with open banking, moved to open finance, open telco, open energy, and then they’re going to land in open data. And it’s all centred around a Consumer Data Right across all data.</p>
<p>Very empowering vision coming out of Australia, that many countries are just starting with open finance. Turkey, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, just moved to open finance. So just to describe it – it really is, instead of just being banking, FinTech, third-party payments data or bank account data. It’s broadening the spectrum to the insurance, wealth, mortgages. Kind of more of a holistic view of anything that touches your finances. So, it’s really expanding to allow you to port your data from multiple different aspects of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So, the key here in open finance is that you do similar – let’s say portability. We use it, we use the same word between different services. Not necessarily financial services, but as you said, that touch some financial data, correct?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yes. So if you want to use some data from your Lloyds account to help you get a faster, cheaper, better mortgage that’s more customised to you. Maybe that mortgage provider is not a bank, but they’re a licensed mortgage provider that has certified in the system. Then you’d be able to facilitate that data sharing, same example to a wealth provider or an insurance provider.</p>
<p>Oscar: Alright. And besides that, benefits of the portability that we can, I can even visualise on my mind. What are the other benefits that there are for both the consumers and for businesses?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I would say one of the biggest ones is – when you think of FinTechs trying to get certain aspects of data. And not having to get data they don’t need – so only getting the five pieces of data, with clear consent from the customer. And the customer not having to screen scrape this data out of their account without their knowledge.</p>
<p>So, a lot of screen scraping issues are when open banking first came to fruition in the UK. It’s largely because 1 million UK citizens were screen scraping. Which is a service that is being utilised where it looks like you’re logging into your bank. You’re putting in your passcode, and then it’s giving access to that FinTech to look at your overarching account and scrape the whole data. To only grab the five pieces they need to push it into the system.</p>
<p>So, what this does is [A] it’s unsecure. [B] the customer has no idea they’re breaching their bank agreement by using the service. And then the FinTech ends up with all this data that they don’t need, or want. Have to store it safely and securely, when they only needed the five pieces.</p>
<p>So, when you get to an open banking system, they request the five pieces, they get the five pieces in a safe, secure type of API. And then, therefore, they’re able to delete those five pieces of data, because the way that it was coded into the system, if so requested by the customer. So, it’s a data management system, all based on consent.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds pretty good absolutely. Because imagine that all my data that is on my bank is passed to the – let’s say insurance. And then the insurance has the duty to delete whatever they don’t need as well, sounds terrible. Because you know, the less data that is transferred, the less data that is stored somewhere, the lower the risk of so many data breaches that are happening nowadays.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, on the data breach point, I always like to bring up unfortunately Marriott because they had 7.1 million data breach occurrences at one time, and it was an internal issue. They were like layering in some accounting, or loyalty system and it was an internal data breach. And this was back I think in 2018. They didn’t compensate any of the users. But think about anytime you check into a hotel. At this point, they asked for your driver’s license or your passport, plus your credit card. The amount of data a hotel has on you is pretty concerning, considering they don’t have the data security standards that you would have at a bank.</p>
<p>So, if we can get to a world – getting to your digital identity questions. Where a QR check in doesn’t actually have them store any of my data, but just validate I am who I say I am. So that they don’t need to actually hold my actual passport image with all of my sensitive data. In a non-secure, I don’t want to say non-secure, but not highly secure infrastructure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Another good example, obviously, the hotels. They will benefit, both the businesses and the consumers would benefit with open finance. And yes, I start – while you explain this idea, I was, OK, some of the data passes from one, let’s say from the bank to the insurance company. But just a minimum should be passing, so that – also thinking from the identity point of view. I’m imagining the federation, right? So, at this point, what is on your view the role of identity on this paradigm that you just described?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think it’s quite paramount as a base layer to most systems. Because if you can authenticate you are who you say you are, that’s the most important part of any one transaction. Especially a transaction that has to do with your data or has to do with your finances. So, I think it’s quite crucial that we find a way that authenticates ourselves. Especially with AI, and all of this machine learning infrastructure, cybersecurity challenges.</p>
<p>How do we ensure that we are the only entity that is Michelle Beyo and that I can then surely authenticate myself? Before I do a data share from one bank to the other, or before I do a financial transaction. And we’re going to have to layer up from our six-digit code being sent to a phone text to authenticate yourself. As we move forward in the future of finance. So, I think digital identity is crucial. And has to be put into a system, in a way that ensures that there’s only one identity for any one person.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. There has to be some level of strong authentication, that that is a must. And as you have mentioned a bit earlier also, always with a consent, inevitably, data sharing transactions.</p>
<p>Now, moving into what are the standards to also understand – without going into too much detail. You mentioned that this started in UK and in UK, there more implementations. This is really happening in real, but what are the main standards that are making this possible? Or are going to make this even more possible if we think of open finance?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. So you know, what’s interesting is – as you look at the world at the moment, and you look at open banking, open finance. Not all countries have a digital identity infrastructure. So, what that does is makes the open banking infrastructure more complex, harder to authenticate. And I think even more than open banking –&nbsp; real-time rail infrastructure needs the authentication. Digital identity for any type of fraud reduction of authenticating you are who you say you are, and it’s going to an entity who is authenticated. So that we can remove the scams out of the system.</p>
<p>I’d say the best digital identity infrastructure is probably the Indian-based UPI. It was government issued; it was a mass amount of people. And it was done very early on, on a global scale. It’s not the exact model that probably should be utilised for other countries. But they have definitely – through their digital identity framework, have been able to even. There’s homeless people in India with QR codes and a bank account due to their digital identity infrastructure. And when you pass them in the streets or you pass a tiny shop selling something, they have QR-based payment infrastructure that is largely attached to their digital identity. Which creates a more financial inclusive infrastructure.</p>
<p>In Australia, they have a digital identity framework but it’s not as widespread to the same degree as India. The UK is still working on their digital identity infrastructure. So not every country has lined up, open banking, digital identity and real-time rail. But these are three very crucial aspects to the future of finance because the authentication from digital ID is a safety point. The real-time rail is the fast and secure movement of the funds. And the open banking is the safe, consent-driven data sharing aspect. So, once you have all three of them, you’re really setting yourself up to be facilitating the future of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned one term that maybe is not so familiar, at least for me, you mentioned real, real-time rail. What is that exactly?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, they’re real-time rail is an instant payment system, sometimes called that. And the first one ever created was in Switzerland, actually, in 1989, 66 countries have faster payment systems. The UK launched quite a long time ago. But the US just launched their FedNow, that is what it’s called in the US. Which is their real-time instant payment rail, just this year. And Canada hasn’t launched theirs just yet. So, there’s many countries who have this payment infrastructure. When you look at the US last year, or Canada, still, it takes three days, three to five days for bank payments to clear and that’s just the older infrastructure of payment settlement.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, OK. Perfect. Yes, indeed, you have emphasised that all these components needed in, of course, the authentic the national digital identification is a key point. You are correct, not many countries in the world have something, I will say, suitable enough for doing this open finance. I was – in terms also of authentication that reminded me that, for instance, the FinTechs has been for a while. And not long ago the authentication was just username and password, nothing else. So, of course, now, most of the FinTechs have something better than that. But yeah, I can see something that it takes time. All this component takes time to come together to make possible some of these use cases.</p>
<p>So, if you can tell us some of these success stories, now seeing from the perspective of use cases. Let’s say success stories from, if you can, from different part of the world also to illustrate it better.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, so if we’re talking digital identity, I think Scandinavia has done probably one of the best jobs. I think Estonia was one of the first. The other really crucial part of digital identity is you can’t have CBDC, or digital currency in a very safe and secure way without a digital identity framework. So, I think there’s some great examples down that front.</p>
<p>When we’re talking open finance, open banking, the countries I’m most impressed by, obviously, is Australia. They are a country that has five major banks. They are kind of an oligopoly in the sense that those five banks hold quite a bit of the customer base. But they took an initiative past open banking, past open finance, to embed a consumer data rights to every citizen across five different industries with a roadmap to start with open banking. Moved to open finance, open telco, open energy, land with open data, which is really future proofing their country, for the future of the ecosystem. A digital ecosystem, which every business is now turning into a digital business.</p>
<p>So, they’re going to have a really great base layer of understanding that the customer owns the data, the customer is able to port the data, and the customer is able to delete the data. So, by creating a data right infrastructure, and then porting it across multiple industries. I think they’re going to have incredible innovation and eyes are definitely on them as they’re enabling this ecosystem. That really is kind of the future of any one country’s vision of how do you enable digitisation of an economy.</p>
<p>The other country that I’m pretty impressed by is Brazil. In the sense that in the middle of the pandemic, they made their first move to open banking. They made a 12-month mandate that they were going to hit an open banking live ecosystem within 12 months. And open access to their Central Bank of Brazil. And therefore, by opening the access to registered TTPs, which are Third-Party Providers. Companies, like Pix, were able to create a FinTech that reduced the cost of sending money and took the underbanked, underserved in Brazil, and gave them a digital bank with faster, more affordable payments. And I don’t have the exact number. But I believe they’re past 7 million customers and doing billions of transactions on a daily basis. And I believe they reduced the cost something like by 40%, by being able to have direct access to the central bank and fall directly in line with the open banking system.</p>
<p>And after 12 months of being enabled to an open banking system, they immediately started working on an open finance system, and are launching that within 12 months. So, I think the alignment, the passion, and the execution out of the Brazilian market is pretty impressive. And just the pure enablement of new FinTechs that are more affordable services. And finding ways to serve the underbanked, underserved, they’ve done a phenomenal job.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds like that – it sounds definitely amazing. Among all these, well, existing use cases and what comes in the future for open banking and open finance, what are some potential privacy issues that you could tell us?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think every system has to be truly based in a liability model. This liability model has to be extremely clear to everybody within the system. There has to be protection on that liability model. And I think it’s just ensuring that the certification system that allows for third parties to come into the system is robust, is reviewed, that these parties that have been certified inclusive of banks are always looked at to ensure that they’re continued to be certified to have access to the system.</p>
<p>But I do foresee in the future that customers are going to choose to have some type of insurance on their data. That they so choose, just like you have insurance on your travel, or insurance on your health, like actual data privacy insurance.</p>
<p>Because – think of the Marriott issue, or gosh, there’s data breaches every day of the week, and none of the data breaches have to do with open banking, open finance, they’re internal data breaches or external data breaches, or hacks. That there’s no real repercussion to the customer, like, or to the actual party who has had this data breach. There might be a fine, but there’s no settlement to the actual end user whose data has been potentially put on the dark web or given to different parties.</p>
<p>There’s got to the point where, if we have enough of a safe and secure data sharing infrastructure, we should be able to insure our data and be safe and secure. And if it’s breached, have some type of offset. But we have to get to a much safer secure infrastructure of how data is shared in the first place.</p>
<p>So, I just truly see that open banking, open finance is creating the pipes for the water to go through and be able to turn them on and turn them off. And we just don’t have those pipes today in every country. And I think it’s just super important for the next layer of the future of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. Now, if we look at the future, what kind of use cases or what open finance can do in the future? Something that we are not seeing today.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. So, in some countries, they started to enable dashboards, like holistic dashboards of your financial health. So, in these dashboards due to open banking, you would be able to see what your mortgage is. And then it would be able to AI predict what other offerings you should potentially layer in. To add to this product, or tell you that your current mortgage is not serving you. And that there’s three or four other offerings that would be a better mortgage based on your current finances, or the market. And then they’d be able to offer you three different companies that you might want to look into.</p>
<p>So, what this service can then do is you can actually put in your loans – this dashboard would be personalised, just for you to see kind of your financial health. It would help people have an ability to plan better, understand their finances a little bit better. From that perspective, I think it’s going to also create a whole bunch of things we haven’t even thought of, new services, new opportunities, and new ways to ensure you’re saving for your retirement.</p>
<p>Just kind of like round up did in the sense of, you know, if you’re paying for coffee, and it’s $1.50, rounding it up, or if it’s $1.40, rounding it up to $1.50 and then putting that in your pension plan or putting that into a robo-advisor. So that you’re earning money by saving without knowing it, or without feeling it, kind of perspective. So, I think just like the Internet has changed so many ways of what we are doing, and made our lives easier, in many ways. I do think that open finance, layered in with a digital identity can truly help us plan better, execute, have better offerings, save money, and really just be able to plan better for our future.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, sounds definitely a lot to expect for the future what open finance will bring us. So, Michelle, last question for you, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think what they should write is that innovation is driven by ideas. And that there’s an opportunity, especially now that the world has gone digital, to listen in to panels, topics that interests you, but you don’t have all the details on, similar to this podcast.</p>
<p>There’s panels happening in Australia on open finance, or Brazil, that you could listen into. You don’t actually have to travel to these conferences. But you can truly grasp the innovation that’s happening in other countries. And then think about how you can create something for your citizens, for your company. To pivot and start moving towards the future of finance, by learning from other countries who are already there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, I couldn’t agree more. And that’s really one, learning more about these interesting topics that are going to impact us mostly positively in today, in the future is also one reason why we invited you. So, thank you. Thanks a lot for being with us and this was really fascinating conversation with you, Michelle. If people would like to follow the conversation with you, or know more about what you’re doing, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, definitely to follow me on LinkedIn. Simply find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellebeyo/">Michelle Beyo</a>, follow <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/finavator/">FINAVATOR</a> on LinkedIn and <a href="http://www.michellebeyo.com/">Michelle Beyo</a> as well as reaching out to us on our website at <a href="http://www.finavator.com/">finavator.com</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. Many ways to do it. So again, Michelle, it was a pleasure talking with you, and all the best.</p>
<p>Michelle: Thank you so much, Oscar. It was a pleasure being here. Have a wonderful day.</p>

<p>Saint Malo/La Ciotat/Munich, May 24, 2023 – <a href="https://www.cabinet-louis-reynaud.eu/index.php/clr-labs-3/">CLR Labs</a>, a European laboratory dedicated to the evaluation of biometric and security technologies, and <a href="https://www.lsti-certification.fr/en/">LSTI</a>, a conformity assessment body (CAB) specializing in cybersecurity and data protection, are pleased to officially launch their ISO/IEC 30107 conformity assessment scheme, which enables them to evaluate any product or service using biometric technologies. IDnow, one of the leading European identity proofing platform providers, obtains the first LSTI ISO/IEC 30107 certificate for its VideoIdent solution.</p>



<p>The first European certification scheme for biometric technologies</p>



<p>Published in 2017, the ISO/IEC 30107 standard defines safety measures and presentation attack tests on remote identity proofing systems, in order to protect them and prevent these attacks. The conformity certificate is issued by LSTI, based on CLR Labs’ evaluation work – &nbsp;which involves both presentation attacks and biometric data injection tests, such as facial recognition attacks based on deep-fake technology. Until now, the only certification scheme available was from the United States. In Europe, only compliance projects have been carried out so far.</p>



<p>Therefore, this collaborative initiative is unique in Europe, as it defines a guaranteed level of performance assessment of presentation attack detection given by biometric technologies, acknowledged by the cyber industry. </p>



<p>A partnership between two major names from the cyber assessment and evaluation industry</p>



<p>Together, LSTI and CLR Labs designed a common assessment scheme which can be applied to multiple products and services, such as enrolment stations or kits, border automatic doors, biometric readers, entry-exit systems, digital wallets, Trust Service Providers, and any other biometric tech products.</p>



<p>This conformity assessment scheme allows the European cyber ecosystem to acquire the necessary capabilities to evaluate and certify biometric products including presentation attack detection, with a made in Europe label, thus ensuring the promotion of European excellence in cybersecurity.</p>



<p>The first product certified ISO/IEC 30107 according to this scheme</p>



<p>In this European framework, it is the leading identity proofing platform provider IDnow, who becomes the first company to obtain an ISO/IEC 30107 certificate for its VideoIdent product. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">IDnow VideoIdent is an expert-assisted video identity verification product</a> that is facilitated by trained agents in conjunction with backend AI controls. </p>



<p>The VideoIdent process validates the user’s face biometrics and performs liveness checks to detect and prevent presentation attacks. The ISO 30107 evaluation certifies that IDnow VideoIdent meets such strict requirements on biometric identification. LSTI has assessed the level of VideoIdent as “substantial”.</p>



<p>Statements from the companies’ representatives</p>



<p>“This certificate is the result of the successful partnership between CLR Labs and LSTI, but also of the amazing conformity upgrade work done by IDnow on their product VideoIdent”, says Armelle Trotin, CEO of LSTI group.</p>



<p>“We were thrilled when we saw the first certificate emitted by LSTI, as building an ISO/IEC 30107 conformity certification scheme in Europe was one of our goals since the creation of our lab”, declares Stéfane Mouille, CLR Labs Director.</p>



<p>“We are excited to have received the certification for the international ISO/IEC 30107 standard. With the support of LSTI and CLR, we were able to successfully test the strength of our VideoIdent presentation attack detection during the biometric capture step of the remote identity verification process. This certification raises the bar for our fraud prevention measures even further and marks an important step for our company in becoming the leading digital identity provider in Europe,” says Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow.</p>

  The EU’s new MiCA regulation holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer losses, representing a major shift towards increased protection and transparency in the&nbsp;sector.  MiCA regulation introduces significant compliance challenges for crypto exchanges while promising enhanced user protection, potentially boosting confidence and cryptocurrency adoption.  The MiCA regulation could set a global precedent for cryptocurrency regulation, emphasizing the delicate balance between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation in the rapidly advancing field of cryptocurrencies.  <p>Europe’s ascent as the “World’s biggest cryptocurrency economy” is underscored by several telling statistics. In 2020 alone, the continent <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/09/29/europe-is-now-the-world-s-cryptocurrency-capital#:~:text=Europe%20is%20now%20the%20world's%20biggest%20cryptocurrency%20economy%2C%20with%20the,blockchain%20data%20firm%20Chainalysis%20found.">received over 870 billion Euros in crypto</a>. Moreover, the Central, Northern, and Western Europe regions accounted for a quarter of the global cryptocurrency activity.</p><p>Significantly, between July 2020 and June 2021, transfers from large institutional investors mushroomed from 1.2 billion Euros to 39.6 billion Euros, highlighting the escalating crypto activities in the region and setting the stage for imminent regulatory interventions.</p><p>In response to this burgeoning crypto economy and a series of high-profile incidents leading to significant customer losses, the European Union has enacted a sweeping set of regulations. The newly introduced Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p><p>This fundamental shift in the handling of digital assets is aimed at providing a protective shield for investors. By imposing higher standards of transparency, data security, and operational integrity on exchanges, the rules promise to enhance protection and reliability for customers.</p><p>Beyond Europe, these pioneering regulations could act as a blueprint for the global crypto industry, stimulating broader acceptance of such rules while presenting significant compliance challenges for crypto exchanges.</p><p>As the EU navigates this new terrain, the balancing act between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation could shape the future of the crypto industry worldwide.</p> EU’s Landmark Crypto&nbsp;Rules <p>On 16th May 2023, the European Union adopted a regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), initiating a continent-level legal framework for the crypto industry for the first time. The regulatory framework would apply to crypto assets, asset issuers, and crypto-asset service providers.</p><p>The provisions on assets issuers and e-money tokens will apply from 12 months after entry into force, expected to be spring 2024. Other provisions of MiCA will apply from 18 months after entry into force (i.e., in the second half of&nbsp;2024).</p> Significance of the&nbsp;Rules <p>The rules will hold providers liable for losing investors’ crypto assets. All 27 EU member states need to comply with these rules from 2024&nbsp;onwards.</p><p>Under these new rules, providers mean utility token issuers, issuers of asset-referenced tokens and stablecoins, providers of trading venues, and wallet services.</p><p>The aim behind introducing the regulations is to safeguard investor assets, maintain stability in the system, and allow the sector to become more attractive for its trustworthiness and innovation.</p> A Brief History of the EU Cryptocurrency Regulations <p>The attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies do not start with the introduction of MiCA. While the EU presented the MiCA proposal in September 2020, regulatory attempts toward crypto have been prevalent since&nbsp;2013.</p>  2013: The first official statements and analysis on virtual currencies came from the European Banking Authority.  2014: The EBA identified more than seventy risks arising from virtual currencies for all possible sorts of market participants. The EBA also suggested measures to deal with governance, capital requirements, and segregation of client accounts.  2016: The European Central Bank analyzed virtual currency schemes and acknowledged the potential advantages of virtual currencies despite an overall negative assessment.  2017: The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued a report on Distributed Ledger Technology and its application to Securities markets.  Early 2018: The European Parliament commissioned two reports. One was on virtual currencies and Central banks’ monetary policy. The second was on the fight against the illicit use of cryptocurrencies.  Late 2018: The Financial Stability Board released a paper on the crypto assets market and its financial stability implications.  2019: The International Monetary Fund singled out supervisory and regulatory elements to assist policymakers.  2020: It was only on 24th September that the European Commission introduced the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) proposal as part of a larger digital finance&nbsp;package.  2021: On 24th November 2021, the council adopted its negotiating mandate on&nbsp;MiCA.  2022: On 31st March, the tripartite co-legislative discussions started. The discussions ended with a provisional agreement struck on June 30th,&nbsp;2022.  2024: By July 2024, stablecoin-related provisions will come into&nbsp;effect.  2025: By this year, the remaining provisions of MiCA, other than those related to the issuance of asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens, are anticipated to come into&nbsp;effect.  <p>The rules discussed in this article are seen as the formal adoption of the regulation.</p> What led to These new Regulations? <p>The need for crypto regulations, chronicled in the timeline above, has always been there in the Europe market. Yet, a few incidents in the global crypto market made it all the more necessary and relevant.</p><p>One of the most prominent of these incidents was the collapse of FTX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Not only did it impact the European crypto market, but it also sent shockwaves at a global level as the founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s fortune depleted from nearly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/18/how-did-crypto-firm-ftx-collapse">US$16 bn to zero</a> within&nbsp;days.</p><p>Another incident that made people aware of the potential risks of volatility in the crypto market was the collapse of stablecoin Terra. Within a week in 2022, the stablecoin Terra and its sister token Luna collapsed, wiping out as high as nearly half a trillion USD from the crypto&nbsp;markets.</p> The New Regulations Details <p>One has to remember that nearly all of these funds lost in the incidents cited above were customer assets, either in the form of investments or deposits. In a bid to prevent such losses, the new rules hold crypto-asset service providers liable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p> Crypto Exchange Liable for Customer&nbsp;Losses <p>The rules want the issuers of asset-referenced tokens to have an adequate custody policy for their reserve assets to prevent loss and preserve the value of the&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The crypto-asset service providers should also be held liable for losses incurred from incidents relating to Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Such incidents might include cyber attacks, theft, or malfunctions.</p><p>Service providers, issuers of asset-referenced tokens, and e-money tokens will also be held liable for the information they have offered in a crypto-asset white&nbsp;paper.</p> In Focus: Traceability of Crypto Assets and Crypto Consumer Protection <p>Apart from holding exchanges liable for customer losses, other key components of the regulation deal with the traceability of crypto assets, consumer protection, etc. For instance, the rules want to ensure that crypto assets stay traceable.</p><p>The council also wants its rules to create adequate arrangements for “enhanced consumer protection” and “safeguards against market manipulation and financial crime.”</p><p>The EU also wants crypto providers to share their energy consumption details. Moreover, all providers will need to have a license to issue, trade, and safeguard crypto assets, tokenized assets, and stablecoins.</p> Crypto Licensing and Non-compliance Penalties <p>Crypto service providers operating without a license will have to go through inclusion in an ESMA (European Securities and Market Authority) public registry. In this registry, these unlicensed providers will document their non-compliance.</p> Implications for Exchanges <p>The most radical step is that exchanges will be held liable for losing investors’ crypto assets. Also, in ensuring traceability, the exchanges need to ensure that they have a mechanism to trace crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>MiCA traceability requirement is not a new concept, however, as it is similar to how banks keep a trace of money transfers.</p><p>But it cannot be denied that traceability in crypto assets is a double-edged sword. While it enhances security and regulatory compliance, it also raises critical concerns about user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Although exchanges have no option but to implement traceability, as MiCA makes it mandatory, they must ensure meticulous data governance and robust encryption methods to protect user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Transparency about these practices is crucial, with users having the right to know what data is collected, its use, and protective measures in place. It is paramount to strike a balance between security, regulation, and privacy in this ever-evolving cryptocurrency space.</p><p>In case of suspicious transactions, exchanges should ensure they have appropriate blocking mechanisms in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Besides these, the exchanges will also have to declare their energy consumption details and apply for operating licenses.</p> Potential Crypto Exchange Challenges <p>Putting up a robust compliance process could always be challenging. The exchanges will have to ensure zero scopes of technological vulnerability. Additionally, they need to ensure that operations are at par with what has been committed in the whitepapers.</p> Compliance Strategies for Crypto Exchanges <p>To cope with several compliant requirements enforced under MiCA, exchanges have no options but to make operational adjustments. For instance, the rules necessitate enhanced monitoring of exchanges’ source and destination addresses.</p><p>Adhering to FATF regulations could no doubt contribute to a robust and streamlined compliance process. However, exchanges will require a Travel Rule Solution, such as Shyft Veriscope, to comply with the FATF Travel Rule requirements while protecting their customers’ user experience and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>More on Shyft Veriscope’s capabilities: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Shyft Veriscope — The Critical Infrastructure Underpinning FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> Implications for Customers <p>The rules do not apply to P2P transfers. However, transactions above 1,000 Euros from self-hosted wallets come under their purview as and when they connect to wallets hosted by crypto asset service providers.</p> Crypto Consumer Protection <p>Authorities insist that these rules seek to reduce opportunities for intrusion into the system. Hence, hacks, breaches, and data security concerns — all could be reduced if these sets of rules are properly followed.</p> Impact on Crypto Consumer Confidence and&nbsp;Behavior <p>Enhanced consumer protection and transparency in the system would increase the sector’s attractiveness. It will improve credibility and trust, potentially resulting in improved traction and adoption of crypto in the&nbsp;country.</p> Impact on the Global Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>Regulation of crypto asset exchanges would involve collecting and transferring data between different jurisdictions.</p><p>In many cases, one party would be a jurisdiction outside Europe. However, successfully completing the transaction would require exchanges in that jurisdiction to stay compliant with European regulations.</p> Global Influence of EU Crypto Regulations <p>With the EU getting its house in order, other parts of the world, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, will have to keep up with the EU regulations.</p><p>Other countries in the European region, such as Switzerland and the UK, known for their happening local crypto scene, will be impacted as well, despite not being a member of the 27-nation bloc.</p> Switzerland <p>In Switzerland’s case, given the intricate web of business relationships with the EU, Swiss crypto companies must check if MiCA or another EU rule, MiFID II, affects them, especially when dealing with certain tokens like securities.</p><p>Also, MiCA brings unique rules for “stablecoins,” requiring issuers to have an EU-based office and a special&nbsp;license.</p><p>These changes demand Swiss crypto businesses to quickly understand MiCA’s impact and determine which services they can offer from Switzerland to EU countries and what tokens need a special document, the “crypto asset whitepaper,” to be recognized in the&nbsp;EU.</p> The United&nbsp;Kingdom <p>The UK has decided on a phased regulatory approach. It might start with stablecoins and then continue with unbacked crypto assets. This strategy is set to interplay with the European Union’s Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Even though the UK is no longer an EU member, the ripple effects of MiCA regulations can’t be&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>With MiCA creating a unified framework for crypto assets across the EU, UK-based companies offering crypto services in the EU will need to adapt. Compliance with MiCA, regardless of the UK’s local regulations, will become essential for firms looking to operate within the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>On the flip side, the far-reaching and comprehensive nature of MiCA may influence the UK’s phased regulatory approach. It could also serve as a potential blueprint for UK regulators, particularly when moving towards unbacked crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Middle East &amp;&nbsp;Asia <p>The new framework could potentially reconfigure cross-border digital asset transactions involving EU, Middle East, and Asian entities. Given the substantial number of Asian and Middle Eastern businesses and individuals engaged in crypto-related activities within the EU, the MiCA regulations could potentially impact asset flows, particularly those dealing with certain crypto assets subject to more stringent MiCA requirements.</p><p>Moreover, the increased regulatory oversight under MiCA may instigate a realignment of crypto asset flows, potentially diverting some towards jurisdictions with less stringent regulations. Crypto businesses or investors looking for a more flexible regulatory environment might consider migrating their operations or investments to territories with more lax&nbsp;rules.</p><p>The Middle East and parts of Asia, which have been comparatively less stringent in their approach to crypto regulation, could become attractive destinations for such shifts. However, this could also lead to a double-edged sword scenario where the increase in crypto activities could prompt these regions to establish more robust regulatory frameworks, echoing the rigorous standards of the EU’s&nbsp;MiCA.</p> United States <p>Major US crypto businesses, like Genesis, Gemini, and Bittrex, have had legal troubles, making others in the industry worry about the future. Big player Coinbase is now asking for clear rules for crypto companies, pushing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to make a decision.</p><p>In contrast, the EU has been working hard to create rules that protect customers and promote new ideas in the crypto industry. Their rulebook, MiCA, provides clear instructions for companies working with crypto. This not only helps protect people using these services but also builds trust in crypto businesses. It even encourages more use of the technologies behind crypto, like blockchain.</p><p>Other countries, including the US, may look to MiCA as an example when making their rules. While the US is currently dealing with different rules from different bodies, it could learn from the EU’s clear and practical approach. It’s crucial for the US to find a balanced and flexible way to manage crypto, promoting new ideas while ensuring companies follow the&nbsp;rules.</p> The Potential Impact of MiCA Regulations on DeFi Protocols <p>The new MiCA regulations have sparked questions within the crypto community, particularly about their impact on DeFi protocols. The language of the regulations is complex, causing some debate about whether they even apply to DeFi. Some reports suggest they&nbsp;don’t.</p><p>Despite this, it’s wise for funds looking to invest in decentralized finance and DeFi protocols to prepare for compliance. Even if certain decentralized activities seem unaffected by the rules, the broad scope of the regulations could still touch various aspects of DeFi operations.</p> Frequently Asked Questions: Fast Check on Everything MiCA  Q1: What is the new MiCA regulation introduced by the&nbsp;EU? <p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is a new set of rules introduced by the European Union to regulate crypto assets, their issuers, and service providers. A vital component of this regulation is that it holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p> Q2: Why has the EU introduced this regulation now? <p>The introduction of this regulation comes in response to the growing prevalence and influence of cryptocurrencies within the European economy, as well as several high-profile incidents that have led to significant customer losses. The intent is to protect investors and provide a more stable and trustworthy framework for the operation of the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p> Q3: What are the implications of these regulations for crypto exchanges? <p>Crypto exchanges will now be held to higher standards of transparency, data security, and operational integrity. They will be directly accountable for any customer losses, which means they will need to ensure robust security measures and operational protocols are in&nbsp;place.</p> Q4: How will these regulations impact customers? <p>Customers stand to benefit from enhanced protection and greater reliability in the crypto sector. These regulations aim to reduce the risk of losses due to incidents like hacks, breaches, and data security concerns.</p> Q5: Do these regulations have any implications outside of the&nbsp;EU? <p>Yes, these regulations could potentially shape the global crypto industry. They could act as a blueprint for other significant players like the United States and the United Kingdom, stimulating broader acceptance of such&nbsp;rules.</p> Q6: What challenges can crypto exchanges expect as a result of these regulations? <p>Compliance with these regulations will be a significant challenge for crypto exchanges. They will need to ensure they have zero technological vulnerabilities and that their operations are in line with commitments made in their whitepapers. They will also need to apply for operating licenses and declare their energy consumption details.</p> Q7: How will these regulations impact the future of the crypto industry? <p>The regulations represent a significant step in the evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. By striking a balance between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation, these rules could shape the future trajectory of the crypto industry not just in the EU but worldwide.</p> Looking Ahead: The Future of EU and Global Crypto Regulation <p>As the landscape of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, the trajectory of these new regulations remains to be fully discerned. If judiciously implemented and navigated with an understanding of their subtleties, these rules could potentially set a regulatory precedent for the rest of the world to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>The task ahead for the EU is multifold: it must diligently safeguard investor interests and curb potential misuse of funds. At the same time, it carries the responsibility to ensure that regulatory frameworks do not stifle innovation but instead foster growth in this rapidly advancing, technology-driven field of cryptocurrencies. The delicate balance between regulation and innovation will define the future of the crypto industry not just in Europe but globally.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency-5c0778bb11c1">MiCA Paving the Way: From Liability to Transparency</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Protocol Engineer Philipp Krüger gave a presentation on WNFS, or Webnative File System, at IPFS Thing 2023 in Brussels, Belgium. In his presentation, he gave a comprehensive yet approachable breakdown of how we constructed our versioned and encrypted file system built on top of IPFS.</p><p>When Fission set out to create an encrypted file system that would respect user agency, it needed to meet three criteria: </p>  Users would be able to take their data with them anywhere and control who had access to it  It would be available both online and offline, ensuring access no matter the user's level of connectivity  It could be shared on different devices and types of apps (for example, you could share your data on a music app on your mobile phone and a photo app on your desktop)  <p>Developers are used to running a server to hold user data when publishing an app online. During the prototyping process, dummy data is often stored in the browser. We realized that if we made the browser capable of running production data, it would ensure the data was local-first and private (because the data would never have to leave the device itself).</p> Our Frenemy, The Browser <p>So we began working with the browser to make this a reality. The first step was working with the WebCrypto API, which makes non-extractable key pairs possible. In addition, we wanted to ensure revocability, so we created asymmetric key pairs per app/device. </p> Access Control <p>Once decrypted, data is readable in the hostile browser environment. Therefore, we needed to give not just access control but fine-grained access control. We go by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">Principle of Least Authority (POLA)</a> to ensure the user only shares what they want to share.</p><p>To do this, we encrypt all of the files. However, all those keys can be difficult to manage, so we use the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-the-skip-ratchet/">skip ratchet</a> (our CTO Brooklyn's invention!) to organize them. This also gives us temporal and snapshot access control. </p>Source: Philipp KrügerSource: Philipp Krüger Data Persistence and Key Recovery <p>The browser may delete local storage, so data persistence and key recovery are two important considerations. </p><p>We use IPFS to persist encrypted data outside of the browser. IPFS also has a garbage collection feature, so to be absolutely sure that data is not deleted, the user may want to store their data on a machine they keep online (i.e., their own personal node) or utilize a pinning service. Fission does not run a pinning service, but we currently persist all user file systems for free.</p><p>Key recovery can be handled by linking a device with more reliable permanent storage for your secret keys (this can be done using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper/blob/5c1fba894a9fe51811e47865ed62d26e989a0807/accounts/login/awake.md#L4">AWAKE</a> protocol). Another option is to download a recovery kit from the dashboard app (or, in the future, from any app that supports something like it).</p> Concurrent Writes <p>A file system should have concurrent writes so editing can occur offline and multiple authorized users can edit without issue. We achieve this using a cryptographic tree structure (cryptree) that gives every file and folder a unique key. This enables offline access control while keeping the data encrypted and portable. </p><p>But what if two valid writes need to be consolidated? How do we determine which is the "correct one"? WNFS will merge them both by creating a directory that has both changes while also linking back to the previous data (using CRDTs) so nothing gets deleted. Then we leave it up to each app developer to determine how they want to query the history in the API and figure out how to do app-specific merges.</p>Source: Philipp Krüger Privacy &amp; Security <p>Previously we explained that it is important for users to have fine-grained access control because it supports user agency and resolves the issue of decrypted data in the browser. </p><p>When the user does share data with someone else, whether it's an individual or an app, this action should reveal as little metadata as possible.

               <p>Consumer trends and why fashion industries are changing their brand position</p>
<p>There’s been a huge shift in the way consumers demand Transparency when it comes to ethical sourced and sustainable fashion. It’s fascinating to see that more people are paving the way to more openness and demanding more eco-friendly manufactured clothing. Fast and wasteful fashion is no more! </p>
<p>When increasingly more people are changing the way they consume and behave, the fashion industry has to advance as well. Therefore we see a shift in how production is changing back to locally produced goods, true sustainability, more focus on fairly paid workers and distributed companies. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
          <p>The devastating impact on our environment </p>
<p>The use of toxic dyes, pesticides, the tremendous waste of natural resources, farming, harvesting, processing, manufacturing and the transportation for mass production all over the world is really having a devastating impact. The extravagant usage and waste of water that is needed for production is completely irresponsible.</p>
<p>The UNISOT SaaS solution can therefore be used to prove and provide honest information, that guarantees that the company is preventing waste and unethical practices, thus enabling customers to make even more sustainable and environmentally friendly choices.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                         <p>Smart Digital Twins in Blockchain, Web3 and Federated Learning in Fashion </p>
<p>Due to the intrinsic nature of public blockchain technology supply chains will become more transparent. This brings about a whole new level of incentives for companies and how they will do business.</p>
<p>With public blockchain technology we can create a link between the physical object and a digital one: a smart digital twin is created. This link is used to create a Digital Product Passport to state the origin of the actual product; blocking any attempts of counterfeit or diversion. Each action in the supply chain is recorded and due to the distributed nature of public blockchain technology no stored data can be altered, destroyed or diverted. Furthermore, UNISOT’s Smart Digital Twins functionality enables full product life cycle history feedback.</p>
<p>All kinds of exciting technologies are slipping into fashion industry, and garment companies are progressively changing into tech companies. &nbsp;UNISOT applications combined with IoT technologies, Web3 and Federated Learning can make a big change in how the Fashion Industry goes forward – in real time – for each node in the supply chain.</p>
 Let´s change the fashion industry together

Key points: 
<br> 
<br> 
  
  Most fentanyl trafficked into the United States is manufactured using precursors imported from Chinese suppliers.<br><br>  
  Elliptic researchers received offers from more than 90 China-based companies to supply fentanyl precursors, 90% of which accepted cryptocurrency payments. Many mentioned that they have shipped the same chemicals to Mexico.<br><br>  
  Many of these businesses were also willing to supply fentanyl itself, despite this being banned in China since 2019.<br><br>  
  Elliptic’s blockchain analysis shows that the cryptocurrency wallets used by these companies have received thousands of payments, totaling just over $27 million, and that the number of transactions has increased by 450% year-on-year. $27 million would purchase enough precursor to produce fentanyl pills with a street value of approximately $54 billion.<br><br>  
  Analysis of blockchain transactions also shows that a known fentanyl trafficker paid tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin to one of these suppliers.&nbsp;<br><br>  
  
Fentanyl overdoses are now the leading cause of death for those aged 18-45 in the United States. Cheaper to produce than heroin and 50 times more potent, this synthetic opioid has fueled an epidemic over the past decade, as well as becoming a huge source of profits for international drug cartels. 
<br> 
<p><br>For many years, China was the main source of illicit fentanyl. But in 2019 following intense diplomatic pressure from the US, the Chinese government regulated the drug – effectively banning its export.</p> 
<p>However, far from stemming the tide, illicit fentanyl imports into the US have soared. That’s because Mexican drug cartels have stepped in to fill the void and seize the market – manufacturing their own fentanyl using precursors (chemical ingredients) imported from China.&nbsp;<br><br>The US government has placed increasing emphasis on disrupting the financial activity of fentanyl traffickers and their supply networks. In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strengthened-approach-to-crack-down-on-illicit-fentanyl-supply-chains/">fact sheet</a> published on April 11th, the White House indicated that it intends to “expand its efforts to disrupt the illicit financial activities that fund these criminals by increasing accountability measures, including financial sanctions”.&nbsp;<br><br>Three days later, on April 14th, the US Department of the Treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1413">sanctioned</a> several individuals and businesses in China for supplying precursor chemicals to drug cartels in Mexico for the production of fentanyl intended for the US market. The sanctions also listed cryptocurrency wallets used by these businesses to receive payments.&nbsp;<br><br>The Elliptic research team identified more than 90 China-based chemical companies that were willing to supply fentanyl precursors, and that are offering cryptocurrency as a payment method.</p> 
<p>Our researchers received offers to supply large quantities of one particular fentanyl precursor. This chemical is not used in the manufacture of any other products, and is a controlled substance in most countries. However, it remains unregulated in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>GDPR and VASPs: Lessons Learned from Meta’s Historic Fine&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of the recent historic 1.2 billion euro fine levied against Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) worldwide should take heed. The unprecedented penalty, the highest ever under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), sends a strong message about the EU’s commitment to data protection and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Facebook’s Record Fine Sends a Strong Signal to VASPs: EU Regulations and Compliance are Crucial</p></blockquote><p>Reason Behind Facebook’s Fine&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta’s predicament stemmed from its systemic transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. on the basis of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) since 16 July 2020. The GDPR requires an adequate level of protection for data transferred outside the EU, and Meta’s data handling practices were deemed non-compliant, leading to the severe fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key Aspects of GDPR&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GDPR is a comprehensive legislation aimed at protecting the data and privacy of EU citizens. Key principles that organizations should adhere to include:&nbsp;</p>



  Data Minimization: Processing only the necessary amount of data for a specific purpose.&nbsp; 



 Purpose Limitation: Ensuring that data is only used for a clearly stated and legitimate purpose.&nbsp; 



 Accuracy: Maintaining up-to-date and correct data, and promptly correcting or deleting any inaccuracies.&nbsp; 
   Storage Limitation: Storing data for no longer than necessary and in a way that permits identification of data subjects.&nbsp; 
 <p>Beyond MiCA: Other Regulatory Considerations for VASPs&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the recent MiCA regulation is an important consideration for VASPs planning to operate in the EU, it isn’t the only regulatory framework they need to abide by. GDPR compliance is equally crucial, and overlooking this can lead to serious penalties, as seen in Meta’s case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GDPR Essentials for VASPs&nbsp;</p>



<p>To stay compliant with GDPR, VASPs should:&nbsp;</p>



  Understand and apply GDPR principles in their data handling practices.&nbsp; 



 Keep track of where and how they store and transfer data.&nbsp; 



 Implement security measures to protect data.&nbsp; 
   Be transparent with users about data collection, use, and storage.&nbsp; 



 Choosing the Right Partners for GDPR Compliance&nbsp; 
 <p>A critical part of maintaining GDPR compliance is choosing the right partners. When it comes to data protection and storage, partnering with companies that understand the complexities of GDPR and have a robust data security infrastructure is essential. Coinfirm, an EU-based firm, ticks all these boxes. Coinfirm’s servers are located within the EU, ensuring GDPR compliance and providing VASPs with peace of mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinfirm, Your Partner in Compliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The substantial fine against Meta serves as a warning signal to VASPs: data protection isn’t just a legal requirement, it’s an integral part of responsible business practices. While the regulatory landscape may seem daunting, Coinfirm is here to help. As a GDPR-compliant partner, Coinfirm is not only equipped to provide clear, actionable<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>analytics services, but also to guide VASPs through the complexities of operating within the EU. With Coinfirm, VASPs can confidently navigate the intricacies of GDPR, safeguarding their operations while respecting user privacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p>Whether or not you know the term, you know the experience of using a Progressive Web App (PWA): it’s the slick experience that enables you to install a web experience to your native device and enjoy the speed of use of a website with the tight system integration of a native app. They allow for experiences like recreating <a href="https://app.starbucks.com/">Starbucks’ native app in web</a>, or for creating a <a href="https://www.tigren.com/blog/uber-pwa">highly 2G-optmized experience</a> like what Uber created for some of their customers. PWAs take advantage of native features such as on-device storage, push notifications, and even windowing without requiring the overhead of a native app and the ability to install them without going through an app store. </p><p>In the same way that HTML5 and PWAs changed the way users expected to consume their apps through the minor addition of manifest, an even larger shift has arrived in the form of Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs), which combine PWAs with Web5. While PWAs redefined the relationship between the client and server by enabling richer on-device experiences through native integrations, DWAs are going to completely redefine data storage for apps resulting in a seismic shift in user privacy, ease-of-use, and data portability.</p> What changes in a DWA? <p>The basic client-server model that PWAs use is and has been the presumed standard for decades now. Users expect to open up their PWA, a client, that routinely makes API calls to a 3rd party service, the server, where all their data is stored and the business logic of the app lives. For example, a basic ToDo app PDA would provide you a UI to interface with all your action items by calling the API service that accesses those items; fundamentally the data and API layers live outside of the user’s control and ownership.</p><p>In DWAs, users own their own data and, as a result, their apps no longer need an API service because apps connect directly to the data source. This shift leads to virtually no UI/UX change, but triggers a radical change in app architecture because developers are now directly interfacing with a user’s data store instead of with app-owned server storage via API. </p><p>In DWAs, app data is stored in <a>Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)</a>, which are user-owned and redundant data stores capable of transmitting data that provide strong promises of privacy and guaranteed ownership. DWNs can be permissioned publicly or privately related to the querying decentralized identifier (DID) using <a>permissions</a> and<a> protocols</a> to allow select access to all the data stored in them. </p><p>Going back to our ToDo app example, a user would be able to store all of their todo items and app data on their own DWN rather than on a specific 3rd party’s servers, and all the app would do is focus on creating a presentation layer and additional features around the app’s concept. </p> Upgrading to DWAs <p>If you want to migrate a PWA to a DWA, the only thing you’ll need to do is make sure that whatever data you were originally storing remotely and transmitting via API calls is now stored on the user’s DWN and is accessed <a>using CRUD operations</a> on the user’s DWN. For example, your ToDo app may have previously made an API call to write a new item to your list, but now you’d replace that API call with:</p>   <code>// Write a plain text record to the in-memory DWN<br><br>const myRecord = await web5.dwn.records.create(myDid.id, {<br> author: myDid.id,<br> data: todoItem,<br> message: {<br>     dataFormat: 'text/plain',<br> },<br>});<br></code>     <p>You might expect this section on how to migrate your PWA to a DWA to drag on, but that’s really it! Regardless of your front-end frameworks, you can easily turn your app into a DWA using our <a>web5.js library </a>with minimal code changes. So long as your application treats the user’s DWN as its data storage and allows the user to own their own data, your PWA is now a DWA.</p> Benefits of a DWA <p>Even though replacing all your API calls with DWA calls may be relatively easy work, convincing your users to get on board with Web5 and DWNs may be a challenge. So what’s in it for you and them when you build a DWA?</p>  User ownership of data - users don’t have to worry about a server outage or be fearful of a company shutting down and losing all their data.  Data portability - because users are storing their own data in PWAs, they no longer need to be tied to a single service. Imagine, for example, a world with a decentralized Spotify and Tidal. If a Spotify user were to decide to leave the platform and migrate to Tidal, they’d own all their own playlist data and could therefore then give playlist access to Tidal so that all their data migrates seamlessly.   Reduced operational overhead - you no longer need to maintain a massive array of databases, clusters, and other infrastructure to host your simple PWA. Instead, a user can visit your DWA, plug in their DWN, and get to work.   What’s Next? <p>If you’d like to try upgrading your PWA to a DWA or building your own from the ground-up, you can use our <a>web5.js library</a> to interface with DWNs and DIDs. Additionally, you can find support on your developer journey by <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">joining our Discord</a> channel or by <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js">engaging in our GitHub page</a>.</p>

This detailed information can help lenders calculate income faster and more precisely to improve loan quality, simplify the mortgage process and, most importantly, expand access to credit.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Over the last year, we’ve consistently rolled out innovations to ensure our digital tools are improving speed and efficiency, reducing risk and, ultimately, helping us serve our mission by reaching more qualified borrowers. Today’s innovation further automates income assessment by using historical direct deposit pay patterns and current gross income from recent paystubs, which can help more families achieve homeownership.”</p>
Kevin Kauffman, Single-Family Vice President of Seller Engagement at Freddie Mac.</blockquote>



<p>This new AIM capability will be available to Freddie&nbsp;Mac-approved Sellers using Loan Product Advisor beginning June 7, 2023. Finicity, a Mastercard Company, is the initial service provider supporting Freddie Mac’s AIM for income using direct deposits plus paystub.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 9th May to 21st&nbsp;May <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap, your biweekly dose of crypto regulatory news from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Crypto regulatory developments are often a rollercoaster ride filled with unexpected twists and turns, as we saw during and the last two weeks were no exception.</p><p>The EU cleared the path with the unanimous approval of the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), marking a significant stride in cryptocurrency regulations. Meanwhile, South Korea has been emboldened to take decisive actions amidst political scandals, stepping up their crypto regulation game.</p><p>In the United States, the landscape continues to evolve, shaped by rigorous debates over the clarity of digital asset rules and who holds the reins over “stablecoins.”</p><p>So without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Crypto Regulation Rundown: The Balance Between Safety and Innovation Across EU, US, and South&nbsp;Korea <p>The European Union (EU) is making major strides, unanimously approving a new law known as the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). With MiCA, the EU aims to offer clear guidelines for people in the crypto market, providing a safety net for everyone involved.</p><p>But it’s not all rosy. The demands from crypto wallet providers and exchanges are high and might put a damper on new and creative&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Meanwhile, over in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking heat. The issue? They aren’t being clear about their digital asset rules. Leading the protest is the United States Chamber of Commerce and Coinbase, a giant in the crypto world. They worry that this ambiguity could hurt the digital economy and hinder its&nbsp;growth.</p><p>On the other side of the globe, South Korea is taking decisive action. Prompted by some scandals involving cryptocurrencies, they’ve put their stamp of approval on a new crypto regulation bill. This sudden move showcases the urgency for a legal framework around digital asset trading. The heart of this bill is about making things clearer and more responsible in South Korea’s expanding crypto&nbsp;scene.</p><p>Back to the United States, a fascinating debate unfolds around “stablecoins.” The bone of contention here is who should be in control: the states or the federal government? Both sides have distinct views, but there’s a shared understanding that stablecoins are part of our future. And most agree that the U.S. should make the rules so businesses don’t move&nbsp;away.</p><p>Across the globe, the chorus is growing for clear, easy-to-follow rules in the world of cryptocurrency. We need protections for those in the digital asset market, but it’s also vital to encourage fresh ideas and industry growth. How well these new rules can strike this balance will be the key to their&nbsp;success.</p> Decoding the EU’s New Crypto Rules: Mica’s Impact and&nbsp;Insights <p>The European Union (EU) has taken a significant step towards comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation with the unanimous approval of the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation.</p><p>This development comes after the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, comprised of finance ministers from all EU member states, voted in favor of the MiCA bill and amendments to related regulations and directives.</p><p>Earlier in April, the European Parliament endorsed an unprecedented set of regulations for the crypto industry, adding weight to the MiCA legislation.</p><p>With an overwhelming majority of the members voting in favor, this initiative’s primary aim is to protect consumers from potential risks linked with crypto assets and ensure providers can be held accountable for any loss of investors’ assets. This regulatory effort signifies an important shift in the EU’s approach to crypto asset management and the broader financial industry’s future.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/InbarPreiss/status/1658453533463592962?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>In line with the MiCA approval, the European Parliament greenlighted two additional pieces of legislation, further contributing to the detailed regulatory framework. These supplementary rules aim to regulate the information accompanying fund transfers and certain crypto assets, emphasizing transparency and accountability across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>One key provision of the MiCA regulation is that crypto platforms are now obliged to provide clear and comprehensive information regarding the risks associated with their services.</p><p>Though this is a win for consumers’ trust, the stringent licensing prerequisites for crypto wallet providers and exchanges could impact the pace of innovation and competition.</p><p>Another impactful aspect is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to hold substantial reserves. This protective measure can safeguard the market from potential shocks but also introduces a cap on the daily transactions of larger stablecoins, which could influence their&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The overall picture painted by these legislative measures is of a cautious yet forward-thinking EU seeking a balanced approach to harnessing the benefits of crypto assets while mitigating associated risks.</p> South Korea Takes Lead in Cryptocurrency Regulations Amid&nbsp;Scandal <p>South Korea’s National Policy Committee took a bold step forward by approving a landmark cryptocurrency regulation bill, the first of its kind in the nation’s&nbsp;history.</p><p>This action is a direct response to a controversy involving a high-profile opposition lawmaker, who has been accused of heavy cryptocurrency speculation. Now consolidated from 19 similar drafts, the bill is headed for the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, where it will face a thorough&nbsp;review.</p><p>According to legislators, this bill aims to protect digital asset investors, thwart unfair cryptocurrency trading, and establish a reliable framework for trading stablecoins. And in a significant move, it empowers the Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s premier financial regulator, to oversee cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Although the current bill is primarily centered around investor protection and fair trade, a separate bill focused on the intricacies of initial coin offerings, public disclosures, and market regulations is still under committee review.</p><p>Fueling the swift bipartisan support for the cryptocurrency regulation bill is the scandal involving Representative Kim Nam-kuk, who allegedly dabbled in sizeable speculative investments in various cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The disclosure of his extensive digital asset holdings has sparked a call for increased transparency, compelling both political parties to draft legislation that mandates lawmakers and public officials to disclose their cryptocurrency assets.</p><p>This shift in policy brings South Korea closer to the regulatory standards of the US and EU, where comparable disclosure laws were established in 2018 and 2020, respectively.</p><p>The legislation will undoubtedly profoundly impact the South Korean cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering a host of benefits and presenting certain challenges. Investors stand to gain from improved protection measures, thus fostering a safer environment in the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>The law also takes aim at unfair trading practices and establishes a robust structure for trading stablecoins, which could increase public confidence in and participation in the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>However, stricter regulatory oversight may hinder the pace of innovation and deter potential new entrants to the crypto market. On top of that, the new legislation also could infringe on the privacy of lawmakers and public officials who will be obligated to disclose their crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-the-regulated-road-ahead">The Shyft Perspective — Hong Kong’s New Crypto Climate: the Regulated Road&nbsp;Ahead</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1658156397253603334?s=20">Why Shyft&nbsp;Network?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1658850243381796868?s=20">What is Shyft&nbsp;Network?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1659578665284321280?s=20">Key Elements of Shyft&nbsp;Network</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Remaining OCEAN tokens will be minted. OCEAN will be fully decentralized and unpausable. It will vest to community over&nbsp;decades <p>Overview article [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/control-over-the-ocean-contract-to-be-revoked-soon-overview-6c5b15be2db">here</a>], technical article [this post]. May 25 update: it’s&nbsp;done:)</p> 1. Summary <p>The OCEAN token contract has 1.41B tokens capped supply. By the end of May 2023, the Ocean core team will mint the remaining 56.518% in the supply. A multisig wallet holds this newly minted OCEAN; Ocean core team members are a minority. All of the newly minted OCEAN is for the community; most will be transferred to smart contracts that vest OCEAN over decades to fund Ocean Data Farming (DF). DF incentivizes for growth of Data Consume Volume in the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>With this minting done, we are then able to further reduce the OCEAN risk surface by renouncing ownership of the OCEAN token contract. This will make it un-pausable, and fully decentralized &amp; censorship-resistant.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 is an overview of system-level design and implementation phases. Section 3 elaborates on the implementation phases, with emphasis on OCEAN-related actions. The core team has completed the first two phases; the third and fourth is underway. Section 4 concludes.</p> 2. Introduction  2.1 High-Level Overview <p>The image below shows the Ocean system-level design with an emphasis on DF funding flows. It overlays DF Main implementation phases.</p>Ocean system design + DF main implementation<p>The Ocean system-level design follows the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>. The green circle in the image is the heart of this loop: teams in Ocean ecosystem do *work* to drive traction to the Ocean ecosystem in terms of DCV [0], protocol revenue, and OCEAN. Protocol revenue loops back to burn OCEAN and to further fund teams. Ocean Data Farming (DF) is the main approach to incentivize / fund the&nbsp;teams.</p><p>The image overlays the five implementation phases of DF Main implementation, shown in colors of the rainbow, red → orange → yellow → green → blue: (A) Vesting &amp; Splitter Contracts, (B) Recycling Multisig, (C ) Actions around OCEAN contract, (D) Security Audit, (E) Remaining Deployments.</p><p>Aside: The implementation phases A-E are orthogonal to DF Main 1–4. Phases A-E are about implementation work, whereas DF Main 1–4 are about OCEAN vesting schedule. We aim to complete all implementation phases A-E during DF Main&nbsp;1.</p> 2.2 Overview: System-Level Design <p>In the system-level design, Ocean Data Farming is the main approach to incentivize / fund the&nbsp;teams.</p><p>For Data Farming, OCEAN flows from top to bottom as&nbsp;follows:</p>  From the initial OCEAN contract (top left), to the 51% multisig [one-time]  From 51% multisig to vesting wallets Vesting 0, Vesting A, Vesting B, Vesting C, Vesting D [one-time]  From vesting wallets to Splitter contract [weekly, over decades]. More precisely, Vesting 0 and Vesting A vest for DF Main 1 [12 mos]; Vesting B for DF Main 2 [6 mos]; Vesting C for DF Main 3 [6 mos]; Vesting D for DF Main 4 [decades].  From Splitter contract to DF addresses DF passive, DF active, and DF future [weekly, over decades].  From DF addresses to Ocean core team, Ocean ecosystem teams.  Work from these teams drives traction in the Data Ecosystem to output protocol revenue, which goes to Community Multisig Wallet, then Rev-Splitter then (i) buyback &amp; burn and (ii) Splitter contract.   2.3 Overview: DF Main Implementation <p>(This section is adapted from “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#707e">DF Main is Here</a>” blog post. We repeat it in order to expand on&nbsp;it.)</p><p>Ratchet Principle. As DF Main involves a huge amount of OCEAN, we take extra precautions and follow the principle <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">“ratchet up value-at-risk over time”</a>. What this means: rather than sending all this OCEAN directly to the vesting contracts, we “buy time” to more thoroughly verify the&nbsp;system</p><p>Implementation over time. We can ratchet up value at risk as we deploy more components, and put OCEAN into them. Here’s the order of operations.</p>  Deploy canary, wire it up. First we will deploy a “canary” vesting contract for DF Main 1, funded with just 1000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Verification. This allows us to test the system live, in production yet with a small amount of funds at risk. At the same time, we will initiate a bug bounty program and security audit for all these components.  Weekly rewards keep rolling. OCEAN payouts for DF29, DF30, etc will be as scheduled for DF main. A tiny amount will come from the “canary” vesting contract, and the rest will be topped up manually by the Ocean core&nbsp;team.  Deploy the rest. Once the verification is complete, then we will deploy the remaining contracts and move the remaining OCEAN accordingly.  <p>Final outcome. In completing the implementation work above, OCEAN vesting will be fully automated and on-chain. Then we will tackle decentralizing DF-main reward calculations, leveraging advances in decentralized compute infrastructure. This will serve the Ocean ecosystem well in the decades that follow, with more transparency, stability, and composability.</p><p>We now elaborate on each of the implementation phases&nbsp;A-E.</p> 3. DF Main Implementation Phases  3.1 Implementation Phase A: Vesting &amp; Splitter contracts <p>This phase implements the red🟥 phase in the image. This phase is complete.</p><p>First, we developed the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol">VestingWalletLinear</a> contract, which inputs tokens and releases those to a target address according to linear vesting schedule (constant every week). We developed the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol">VestingWalletHalving</a> contract, which vests according to a Bitcoin-style exponential schedule. Finally, we developed a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/Splitter.sol">Splitter</a> contract, which splits any inbound income to multiple output addresses. We moved those contracts to the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">Ocean contracts repo</a>.</p><p>Then, we did the work to “Deploy canary, wire it&nbsp;up.”</p>  We deployed a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting 0 Wallet. We deployed the Splitter contract. All deployments go to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.  We funded it with 1000 OCEAN. It will vest until the end of DF Main 1, with an equal amount every&nbsp;week.  We wired it together with the rest of DF stack, including Gelato for Web3 automation.  It now dispenses through components to DF passive &amp; active rewards addresses. Weekly payouts draw from this plus the main DF payment multisig; the latter being far&nbsp;larger.   3.2 Implementation Phase B: Recycling Multisig <p>This phase implements the orange🟧 phase in the image. This phase is complete.</p><p>Here, we simply deployed the recycling multisig wallet. This multisig — and the others — uses <a href="https://safe.global/">Safe</a> (nee Gnosis Safe). The Appendix has multisig&nbsp;details.</p> 3.3 Implementation Phase C: Actions around OCEAN&nbsp;contract <p>This phase implements the yellow🟨 phase in the image. This phase is in progress.</p><p>The OCEAN token contract has 1.41B tokens capped supply. 796,900,859 OCEAN (56.518%) hasn’t been minted yet. It is earmarked for the Ocean community, as&nbsp;follows.</p>  719,100,000 OCEAN (51%) has always been earmarked for community incentives. Of this amount, 503,370,000 OCEAN (70% of the 51%) is for Data Farming with vesting over decades, held by the respective vesting wallets. 215,730,000 OCEAN (30% of the 51%) is for future community incentives projects, held by the 51% multisig&nbsp;wallet.  77,800,859 OCEAN (5.518%) is other community-earmarked OCEAN that hadn’t yet been minted. This will be managed from the the <a href="https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xD5e6219A79C5CC61b9074331D1B05a6f35c5a48a">OceanDAO community wallet</a> (also multisig).  <p>We (Ocean core team) will the following steps to mint remaining OCEAN for the community, and renounce ownership of the OCEAN token contract, by the end of May 2023. Update: this was completed on May 25,&nbsp;2023.</p>  On OCEAN contract, call mint() of 77,800,859 OCEAN, sending funds to OceanDAO community wallet. <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdf9d32d706c57fc6f62a34d75710f87012091a64e605718229d682d06cd9e765">[Completed tx]</a>  On OCEAN contract, call mint() of 719,100,000 OCEAN (51% of OCEAN supply), sending funds to 51% multisig wallet. <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9286ab49306fd3fca4e79a1e3bdd88893042fcbd23ddb5e705e1029c6f53a068">[Completed tx]</a>  On OCEAN contract, transfer the pauser role to 0x00..00. <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x794b30b3459fef5da0fc3f0b700b250d3b8529f0ba07049f4ecd7caf41c5be98#">[Completed tx]</a>.

It can no longer be&nbsp;paused.</p><p>Then, the 51% multisig and OceanDAO wallets hold the newly minted&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> 3.4 Implementation Phase D: Security audit&nbsp;etc <p>This phase implements the green🟩 phase in the image. This phase is in progress.</p><p>The work for phase D&nbsp;is:</p>  Security audit. Line up security auditors. Get the audit results. Fix smart contracts as&nbsp;needed.  Bug bounty. Add Vesting contracts &amp; related to Ocean’s long-running <a href="http://df%20%26%20vesting/">Immunefi bug&nbsp;bounty</a>.   3.5 Implementation Phase E: Remaining deployments (once security&nbsp;ok) <p>This phase implements the blue🟦 phase in the image. This phase will be performed once phase D is complete, and we’re comfortable with the stability of DF &amp; Vesting, from bug bounty and otherwise.</p><p>Whereas implementation Phase A deployed &amp; funded Vesting Wallet 0 as a “canary”, in this phase we deploy &amp; fund remaining vesting wallets: Vesting A, B, C,&nbsp;D.</p><p>The work for phase E&nbsp;is:</p>  Deploy a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting A wallet, for DF Main 1. Wire it up side-by-side with Vesting 0 wallet, via Gelato. Fund it with OCEAN. How much to fund: 150,000 OCEAN / week; this depends on # remaining weeks in DF Main 1. (Up to 7,800,000 OCEAN, if it ran for all of DF Main&nbsp;1).  Wait 1+ months to ensure that Vesting A is ok.&nbsp;Then…  Deploy a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting B wallet, vesting over 6 months starting at DF Main 2. Send it 7,800,000 OCEAN, such that it dispenses 300,000 OCEAN / week over 52/2&nbsp;weeks.  Deploy a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting C wallet, vesting over 6 months starting at DF Main 3. Send it 15,600,000 OCEAN, such that it dispenses 600,000 OCEAN / week over 52/2&nbsp;weeks.  Deploy a VestingWalletHalving contract as the Vesting D wallet, vesting over 6 months starting at DF Main 4. Send it 472,170,000 OCEAN [1], which dispenses &gt;1.1M OCEAN / week to start, then decays over time according to its <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#707e">halving-based schedule</a>.   4. AMA <p>To field questions by the community, the Ocean core team will hold an AMA about the OCEAN actions, on May 25 at 12.30 UTC. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">@oceanprotocol on Twitter</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> 5. Conclusion <p>The Ocean core team will mint the remaining 56.518% OCEAN tokens and transfer them to a multisig where the core team is a minority.</p><p>All of the newly minted OCEAN is for the community, for Data Farming and more. Most of it vests over&nbsp;decades.</p><p>OCEAN token contract will be un-pausable, fully decentralized &amp; censorship-resistant.</p><p>The core team continues to execute on DF Main implementation phases and related OCEAN actions. Three of five phases are already complete.</p> Notes <p>[0] “Data Consume Volume” (DCV) is the USD$-denominated amount spent to purchase data assets and consume them, for a given time period (e.g. one&nbsp;week)</p><p>[1] Amount going to Vesting D wallet is calculated as: (70% of 51% supply) minus (amount to DF Main 1,2,3) = 503,730,000 OCEAN — (7,800,000 maximum + 7,800,000 + 15,600,000 OCEAN). It will be a bit more if Vesting A doesn’t run for all of DF Main 1. And we already know this to be the&nbsp;case.</p> Updates <p>[May 25, 2023] The transactions to revoke control of OCEAN have been completed. They’re listed as “[completed tx]” in section&nbsp;3.3.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Remaining OCEAN tokens will be minted. OCEAN will be fully decentralized and unpausable. It will vest to community over&nbsp;decades <p>Overview article [this post], technical article [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/control-over-the-ocean-contract-to-be-revoked-soon-technical-77cb8923171">here</a>]. May 25 update: it’s&nbsp;done:)</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is ready to take the next step in our evolution. Our utmost priority is to nurture the Ocean community and protect holders of the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN token</a>. Just as one cautiously feels their way barefoot across a stone riverbed, we have always worked to take the interests of token holders as our priority — taking cautious steps&nbsp;forward.</p> 2. Need for a Native OCEAN&nbsp;Token <p>In the Ocean whitepaper, we envisioned that a Data Economy could be kicked off through the use of programs and incentives that allow people to join the community and contribute meaningfully. Crypto-tokens represent a novel innovation in giving people a small slice of an emerging protocol. Crypto-tokens also can help to align activities amongst a globally dispersed group of people who want to move an idea forward. When used appropriately, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">tokens can help to sustain and drive the growth of protocols</a>.</p> 3. Tokens Nurture the Ocean Community <p>Over the past six years, we have had many programs such as <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Shipyard</a>, <a href="https://oceanambassadors.community/">Ambassadors</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO Grants</a>, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/challenges">Data Challenges</a> to encourage people to explore the value of data and to try out new business ideas. We learned that many of the programs require significant coordination and overhead to weed out scammers and reward true contributors who are aligned with the mission and values of&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>The objective is to encourage independent, non-correlated activities at scale that are the sign of healthy, sustainable protocol communities. Our goal has always been to set up long-term incentive mechanisms that can outlast the involvement of the founding team and serve the interests of the Ocean community.</p><p>We realized that the most responsible way to encourage participation in the network with the least amount of administrative overhead was to tie incentives to the publishing of data assets and algorithms, and real consumption of assets within the Ocean ecosystem. The blockchain doesn’t lie and the truest form of proof is when people put their tokens behind their convictions. The result of this is Data&nbsp;Farming.</p> 4. Data Farming as a Long-Term Sustainable Incentive Program <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">Data Farming</a> incentivizes both active and passive participation in the Ocean ecosystem. Token holders earn OCEAN passively for <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/veocean">locking</a> up their tokens for a fixed time period. Once their OCEAN is locked, they can then actively <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/datafarming">stake</a> the derivative veOCEAN token on data assets, to help signal quality and earn Data Farming rewards. The Data Farming program is being automated so that the administrative overhead is minimal and manageable as adoption of Ocean technology scales.</p><p>With Data Farming in place and road tested for almost one year, a core piece of the incentive puzzle is now in place. Over the next few years, we will improve and secure the mechanism but after nine months of testing Data Farming and the previous years of gingerly testing out incentive programs, we’re now confident that we can finally mint the remaining OCEAN in the token contract to a multi-signature wallet and revoke any pause or destruct capabilities on the OCEAN token contract. By revoking all rights, OCEAN token holders can rest assured that their holdings are completely safe and will live indefinitely on the Ethereum&nbsp;network.</p><p>Find out more&nbsp;here.</p> 5. Crypto as a General-Purpose Technology <p>Our hypothesis is that crypto is a general-purpose technology. Crypto is a 14-year-old general purpose technology kicked off in 2009 with Bitcoin and if our hypothesis is correct, the journey to integrate it into society likely requires another 20&nbsp;years.</p><p>In 2005, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Transformations-General-Purpose-Technologies/dp/019929089X">Dr. Lipsey et al</a> posed the idea that all human progress can be attributed to 30 odd technologies that drive innovation and new products. Generally, these technology innovations are so disruptive and wide-reaching, that it takes at least 30 years to weave itself into the fabric of society and become ubiquitous.</p><p>As a comparison, work on the Internet began in the 1960s but it was only in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web that the internet could begin its rapid rise to ubiquity as a consumer and business essential. Counting forward 30 years from 1989, we land at 2019. Most people can agree that by 2019, the Internet was ubiquitous and inseparable from our modern&nbsp;society.</p><p>For Ocean, the interplay between crypto, data and AI is obvious now with the release of ChatGPT, Bard and other large language models (LLMs), and the rate of innovation could happen faster than expected.</p><p>Our core hypothesis at the founding of Ocean was that, in a world where AI agents are economic agents, the means of exchanging value would be over blockchains, smart contracts and crypto&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>AI agents will use web2 services once web2 services integrate with web3 to allow native blockchain based identity and profiles — and delivery of value will be notarized and orchestrated on blockchains, along with the payments.</p><p>These are the reasons why we <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/909793166416662528">launched</a> Ocean Protocol. To give an incentive structure for AI, data and blockchains to work together beside human agents. This is also the reason why we have a long-term, Bitcoin-like emission schedule of OCEAN to encourage the adoption of Ocean technology over time — because these fundamental business and mindset changes take&nbsp;time.</p> 6. Allocation of OCEAN&nbsp;Tokens <p>The <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48">Ocean token contract</a> has a maximum cap of 1.41 billion&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>In 2019, 613.1 million OCEAN was minted with the majority of tokens distributed to token acquirors, the Ocean community via grants and Ocean Protocol Foundation for administrative expenses. The single mint in 2019 represented 43.5% of the total allowable token supply, leaving 797 million OCEAN or 56.5% of the token supply remaining to be&nbsp;minted.</p><p>As of May 2023, 100% of the OCEAN token supply will be minted with the proceeds being deposited into oceanDAO multisignature wallets with seven signees. The signees are made up of core Ocean team members, Ocean community members and founders of other web3 projects, with the core team members being in the minority of signees. The final allocation of all 1.41 billion OCEAN is shown in Diagram 1&nbsp;below:</p>Diagram 1: Allocation of Ocean&nbsp;Tokens<p>When 100% of OCEAN is minted, 807 million OCEAN representing 57.2% of the total supply remains to be distributed for Data Farming and incentive programs according to a multi-decade emission schedule. There is also funding for existing community programs and administrative expenses.</p>Diagram 2: As indicated by the dotted line, 57.2% (807 million) Ocean Tokens remain undistributed as of 5/2023. The rest of the OCEAN tokens have been distributed. 7. Inflation Rate of the OCEAN Token&nbsp;Supply <p>There will be no major injection of OCEAN into the circulating supply at this stage. The number of tokens disbursed will be gradually ratcheted up in lockstep with adoption, so the inflation rate in the OCEAN token supply will be at a level to attract new participants while protecting existing&nbsp;holders.</p><p>The main source of token inflation moving forward occurs as part of the oceanDAO Data Farming program. The emission schedule is modelled on Bitcoin and serves as a long-term, multi-decade program to incentivize passive and active participation in the Ocean ecosystem. Most importantly, Data Farming is designed to be automated with little or no intervention from the core&nbsp;team.</p><p>The Data Farming program has been running for nine (9) months and we have given ourselves an additional 2 years to test and harden Data Farming. If the adoption requires more time or the incentive mechanisms need more time to mature, less OCEAN will be disbursed.</p><p>Assuming the mechanisms work as designed and adoption of Ocean Protocol tools proceeds as planned, the maximum disbursement of Ocean to the curators and network starts in late-2025 and continues for 4 years (Diagram 3). At peak emissions in Year 2, the inflation rate would be 8% — 52 million OCEAN emitted into a total liquid supply of approximately 650 million OCEAN. At the first halvening at Year 6 (Week 330), the emission rate falls to 500,000 OCEAN per week and the resulting the inflation rate drops to&nbsp;3%.</p>Diagram 3: Data Farming Emission&nbsp;Schedule<p>You can find out more about Data Farming and the emission schedule&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#707e">here</a>.</p><p>We believe that crypto-adoption will continue but between now and 2025, there are broader macro-economic headwinds due to existing global disruptions, the ongoing banking crisis and unsustainable national debt loads. In 2 Years, the adoption of AI and web3 technologies could be ripe and align with the ratcheting up of OCEAN token emissions to capitalize on the long-term trend.</p> 8. Valuation of the OCEAN Token Ecosystem <p>With the current circulating supply of OCEAN at 605 million, the value of the network is $200 million assuming today’s price of $0.33/OCEAN.</p><p>With the minting of the remaining 56.5% of the supply to reach maximum cap, the fully diluted value of the Ocean network is $465 million. Meanwhile, the OCEAN token contract is fully decentralized, censorship-resistant and can no longer be paused or destroyed.</p><p>The Ocean core team will notify the main coin portals CoinMarketCap and Coingecko and provide quarterly updates to the token supply so that community members can rely on&nbsp;them.</p><p>AMA. To field questions by the community, the Ocean core team will hold an AMA about the OCEAN actions, on May 25 at 12.30 UTC.

Upwards and&nbsp;Onwards <p>Trent and Masha McConaghy <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/ascribe-for-nft-archaeologists-17ca5481d206">posed the question</a> 10 years ago on whether digital art could truly be owned, traded and transparently tracked.

<p>Ping Identity is excited to see our customers, partners, and other IAM leaders at <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/events/identiverse.html">Identiverse 2023</a> in Las Vegas from May 26th to June 2nd.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>So, what does the Entertainment Capital of the World and Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) have in common? Las Vegas casinos and CIAM programs both aim to balance security and convenience by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Delivering delightful customer experiences while managing risk</p>
 
 <p>Verifying the identity of customers and authorizing transactions</p>
 
 <p>Profiling and progressively getting to know customers to understand preferences, connect them to services they desire, and provide benefits</p>
 
 <p>Guiding customers on a journey from unknown to loyal</p>
 
 <p>Evaluating behavior to separate the bad actors from the good</p>
 
 <p>Protecting against fraud, counterfeiting, and impersonation</p>
 
 <p>Supporting omnichannel experiences across physical locations (casinos) and digital properties (gambling apps)</p>
 
 <p>Ensuring resiliency across operations</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's digital-first world, we must strongly identify, authenticate, and authorize users in order to boost security and protect our customers. This is true whether you’re an online business or a casino on the strip. Hackers and fraudsters, like casino cheaters, are constantly changing tactics to steal money. We must aggressively and purposefully consider new solutions and different approaches to stay one step ahead and prevent fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To combat threats, more companies are offering multi-factor authentication (MFA) options to safeguard users. And their customers are noticing! Surveys indicate consumers put more trust in brands that offer additional security measures. To meet this expectation, businesses should build consumer adaptive MFA into digital services and leverage it as an eventual springboard to passwordless. Or, if possible, companies should leapfrog right to passwordless for new and existing customers. We need to use tools like MFA to slow down suspicious users when risk is high and, conversely, speed up trusted customers when risk is low, striking the elusive balance between security and convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term "playing with house money" basically means gambling without risk of loss. This is not the case with most digital relationships today. Casinos employ experts to&nbsp; simultaneously profile and surveil their customers to separate good actors from suspected bad actors. Similarly, the latest threat detection tools can evaluate risk signals in real time throughout the user session to determine trust and ensure valid users can transact quickly and easily. That way, your business won’t have to gamble on possible fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the threats that Vegas casinos face are as vast and varied as the digital threats facing businesses today. We all must focus on securing people, businesses, and transactions without sacrificing experience to grow loyalty and revenue. It’s the only way to give our customers extraordinary experiences that keep them coming back for more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his keynote speech on the opening day of Identiverse titled <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361523/">Identity Under Attack</a>, Andre Durand, Ping’s Founder &amp; CEO, will discuss how AI is changing cybersecurity. We also invite you to join us at the Founders Party at On the Record inside of Park MGM on June 1st from 7:00–11:00 PM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, don’t miss an opportunity to give back at Identiverse with our latest Ping4Good initiative! Summer may have just started, but local charities are gearing up to support families in need by providing them with classroom materials. That’s why Ping Identity is partnering with A Precious Child to provide 3rd-5th grade students school supplies, and all attendees at Identiverse can help! Just stop by the Ping Identity Booth (Booth 1303) to build a bag for kids in need.</p>

<p>When it comes to Zero Trust, the conversation has moved from being a nebulous term several years ago to a well-understood framework with a true north that has broad acceptance across the cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p>That said, confusion abounds among C-suite executives and boards. If you walked around the exhibition at the 2023 RSA Conference, you could hear from a networking specialist that Zero Trust is all about IP, and then from an identity vendor that it’s all about credentials. Defining Zero Trust narrowly runs the risk of creating a false sense of security – if you just secure the network or the credentials, you’re done with the Zero Trust journey.</p>
<p>That’s why the recent release of the latest <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/zero-trust-maturity-model">CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> in April 2023 provided a much-needed reference point for government agencies as well as enterprises on how to develop Zero Trust strategies. Zero Trust is broader than any one vendor’s solution. It is an approach that can govern user identity and access management (IAM), and access and security of devices, networks, application workloads, and data, with a risk-based access control model that can be implemented across an organization’s entire user base and IT stack.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model Pillars</p>
<p>When we talk to our customers, we talk about Zero Trust foundations. Regardless of which vendors you choose, Zero Trust is a journey, one that you can track along the maturity model. This includes making sure you’re securing the network and credentials – for humans, machines, and applications. In today’s post-perimeter environment, it means implementing dynamic authentication that is verified rather than assumed and secures your data assets with encryption and key management best practices, and ensuring development code is signed and approved.</p>
<p>In fact, that last item is a great case in point when it comes to these potential Zero Trust blind spots that arise when you don’t think holistically. When developing applications, code is brought in via APIs, libraries, and repositories and analysis shows us that as much of 70% of an organization’s code is assembled rather than written. An application deployed within an organization and the software bill of materials that make them up aren’t always thought of when it comes to Zero Trust planning, but they absolutely should be. How you certify code that comes from outside your organization and the risk profile you apply to it should be part of that framework.</p>
<p>Ultimately the shift in thinking boils down to moving from the idea of trust to verification. So instead of trusted identities and applications we have verified identities and applications. The second part of that shift is the delta, the change over time, which means we don’t just verify once, but continuously. This is change that can be measured over time, geography, and access entitlement and that is aligned with the risk profile for any given user, machine, or application.</p>
<p>This approach is a reflection of the Zero Trust maturity model, which has gained significant attention from cybersecurity professionals and organizations alike. For most organizations, the current state of Zero Trust maturity is still in its early stages.</p>
<p>We recognize that implementing a Zero Trust security model requires a significant investment of time and resources. It involves assessing the current state of security controls and infrastructure, identifying gaps and weaknesses, and developing a plan to address those gaps. While many have a long way to go before they can claim to have a fully mature Zero Trust security posture, there are excellent resources available to help map out that journey, as well as partners like Entrust that can offer the guidance and broad portfolio needed to get there.</p>

<p>At GlobaliD, we’ve been on a mission from day one to provide every individual with a digital identity that they own and control. Last year, we took that one step further, giving users the ability to own and control their money with the <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/launchpad-the-all-new-globalid-wallet-768cd26357c0">release of our non-custodial wallet</a>.</p><p>It’s also why, today, we’re announcing that we’re transitioning to the Universal Namespace. This will allow users to own and control a unique name associated with their digital identity through an independent third-party namespace rather than one managed by GlobaliD.</p><p>A namespace is simply a set of unique names that are tied to different types of things so they can be easily identified. In the context of the internet, the Domain Name System or DNS namespace tied domain names to relevant IP addresses so that people could easily find the websites they were looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>The concept of a namespace is key to the mainstreaming of digital <br>identity — just as it was for the mainstreaming of the internet. The early internet was a fragmented mess. The only way to find anything was through hard-to-memorize IP addresses. With the arrival of DNS, we could now visit wikipedia.com rather than 80.190.205.15.</p><p>In a sense, the DNS namespace made the internet more&nbsp;human.</p><p>The same goes for digital identity, which is even more complex than simply visiting a website. Someone you want to interact with may have many public keys, URLs, or platform accounts you need to keep track of. Now, all you need is their unique&nbsp;name.</p><p>At GlobaliD, we’ve been thinking deeply about namespaces over the last few years — we <a href="https://medium.com/@_globalid/globalid-white-paper-the-namespace-for-identity-6b755afbe42f">published our first white paper on the subject</a> in the beginning of 2019. As an early mover in the digital identity space, we’ve often had to come up with original concepts and terms in order to help develop and push the industry&nbsp;forward.</p><p>That’s also been the case when it came to a namespace for identity. As such, we originally built a namespace in-house. But the long term vision was always for the namespace to be managed independently outside of GlobaliD. That’s something we laid out in our white paper. Ultimately, we believe the namespace should be a public&nbsp;good.</p><p>We now have the opportunity to make that vision a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>For GlobaliD, this is a big step toward interoperability with other digital identity platforms. For instance, GlobaliD may support additional namespaces in the future, giving users a choice over their service provider. Regardless of which namespace you choose, your unique name will always be attached to a verifiable credential that you&nbsp;control.</p><p>In all, this is an incredibly exciting evolution for GlobaliD’s digital identity offering.</p><p>The transition will require one additional step for you, the user, but we truly believe that the end destination — where individuals control their name, their identity, and their money — is worth the&nbsp;effort.</p><p>The simplest way for this transition to work is for existing users to re-onboard with GlobaliD and claim a new name through the Universal Namespace.</p><p>This transition does mean that users will lose their existing identity history on the platform once they re-onboard with a new name. That includes things like chat history, vouches, and verifications.</p><p>This wasn’t an easy decision to make and we’re incredibly empathetic to our early adopters, but ultimately, it became clear that this was the best path forward, one most aligned with our values and&nbsp;vision.</p><p>For GlobaliD, this clean slate is also an opportunity for us to provide major upgrades to our messaging and wallet platforms as well as a bevy of new features that will arrive with our next generation digital identity platforms, which will be released in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>In the meantime, users will still be able to access their wallets via their private key, but they will no longer be able to access it through the&nbsp;app.</p><p>For now, you can head over to the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> (/uns) to reserve your unique name. Make sure you sign in with the same phone number you’ll use with GlobaliD so that we can link your name to your GlobaliD identity.</p><p>You should also keep an eye out for notifications from the current GlobaliD app that will include prompts and instructions which will help you throughout the re-onboarding process.</p><p>In all, we’ve got plenty in store for all of you in&nbsp;2023.</p> Q&amp;A   Will I be able to keep any part of my current digital identity?<br>No, you will lose access to all of the data that was associated with your old name including chat history, groups you joined, and funds in your wallet. However, you can transfer funds out of your wallet now before the transition takes place, or you can use your keys to move your entire wallet to another non-custodial client. If you are locked out of your wallet before you have a chance to migrate it, you can reach out to our support team for help exporting your non-custodial wallet recovery&nbsp;key.  Will I be able to keep my old username?<br>No. The Universal Namespace (UNS) is a new service which will manage GlobaliD names moving forward. All existing users of GlobaliD will re-onboard with UNS by claiming a name on this separate, independent namespace. Because UNS has been managed independently of GlobaliD, some names have already been reserved and owners of GlobaliD names may not have their names available on UNS. If your old name is available in UNS, then you can claim it and re-onboard using that&nbsp;name.  Will the Universal Namespace reserve my existing name?<br>No. You need to reserve your new name on your own. You will be able to do this within the updated GlobaliD app upon release, but you do not have to wait. You can go ahead and reserve your new name now by visiting the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> website.  What if I have money or assets in my GlobaliD Wallet?<br>You will need to transfer funds from your current GlobaliD Wallet to a new wallet by May 30, 2023 in order to maintain access to your money. Alternatively, you can export your wallet recovery phrase to host your wallet with another app. A new wallet tied to your username will be made available to you upon release of the updated GlobaliD&nbsp;app.  What is the Universal Namespace?<br>The Universal Namespace (UNS) is a discoverability platform that enables people to securely connect their online accounts and data with a unique name. With UNS, users can determine how they are found online by building a public profile that connects all of their digital identities to one universal name they own and control — making it easier for them to be discovered across different ecosystems. UNS is managed independently of GlobaliD and provides name services to multiple providers, in addition to GlobaliD. You can obtain a name by signing up with your phone number on the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace website</a>.  Can I export any of my data before it is deleted?<br>Yes. If you are locked out of your wallet before you have a chance to migrate it, you can reach out to our <a href="mailto:support@global.id">support team</a> for help exporting your non-custodial wallet recovery key. Otherwise, go to your Wallet tab and tap on the key icon in the upper right-hand corner to get your wallet recovery phrase. You can also contact our support team if you would like us to export your chat history. All other data such as your credentials, verifications, and public bio information will be&nbsp;lost.  What is the deadline to reserve my new username and transfer funds from my wallet?<br>We will release the updated GlobaliD app within the next few weeks and notify you when it is available so that you can re-onboard. However, you do not have to wait for this release in order to claim your new name. You can go ahead and reserve your new name now by visiting the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> website. You can also go ahead and transfer the funds from your current GlobaliD Wallet to a new wallet in order to maintain access to your&nbsp;money.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/introducing-the-universal-namespace-3bbe51b2701c">Introducing the Universal Namespace</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Note 1: Inspiration for this blog post was taken from a conversation I had with Tim Bouma about the role of digital wallets</p>
<p>Note 2: I made some edits on 5/26 and removed mentions of voltage, as they were not suited for the analogy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 An Analogy for better understanding interoperability requirements for Issuers, Verifiers and Holder Wallets 
<p>As I prepare for an upcoming trip from Canada to Europe, I’m reminded of the different power standards between continents. As usual, I will be carrying my laptop and phone, with their chargers, along with an essential universal travel adapter to keep them powered up while I’m there.</p>
<p>This is how it will all work so that I can seamlessly use my devices while I’m abroad:</p>
<p>The European electrical socket, my source of power while abroad, varies in shape, and frequency compared to what I’m used to back home in Canada. It’s the origin of the electrical energy I need to charge my devices.</p>
 <p>Various electrical sockets</p> 
<p>My universal travel adapter is the unsung hero of my tech travel kit. It’s designed to connect with the European electrical socket, which differs from Canadian standards (European outlets often have two round pins, while Canadian plugs typically have two flat parallel pins with a grounding pin).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I don’t have to worry! My universal travel adapter will allow my devices to consume electricity from the power sockets.</p>
<p>Switching gears for a minute..</p>
<p>At Northern Block, we’ve been recently experimenting with various credential profiles and credential exchange protocols. We’ve come to understand that different use cases necessitate distinct standards and technological choices. This work has led us to think deeply about the interoperability between different parties involved in credential exchanges.</p>
<p>As a company, we have a strong background in the Hyperledger Aries and <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/anoncreds-anonymous-credentials-with-stephen-curran/">AnonCreds</a> world, a topic on which we’ve shared some writings (<a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity/learnings-from-aries-indy-and-various-verifiable-credential-implementations/">here</a> and <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity/aip-2-interoperability/">here</a>). We have also contributed towards multiple open source Aries RFCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, through collaboration with some partners of ours in the digital identity community, we’ve been broadening our scope of support. This includes exchanging various credential profiles by supporting new specifications like <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/open-id-4-vc-openid-for-verifiable-credentials/">OpenID4VC</a>, both for issuances and presentations. We are at varying stages in our implementations of both these protocols. Further in collaboration with our partner, Canadian Bank Note, we’ve been recently working on demonstrating interoperability between DIDComm-based RFCs and the Mobile Driver’s Licence standard. We’ve written about the motivation and reasoning behind our mDL interoperability work with them <a href="https://northernblock.io/announcement/unifying-mdls-and-verifiable-credentials/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now..</p>
<p>Keeping all this in mind, let’s use the example of electrical sockets, my devices, and universal travel adapter as a comparison to understand how different parts interact in digital credential exchanges. This comparison also helps us understand what interoperability means for everyone involved.<br>
<br><br></p>
 Issuers 
<p></p>
<p>In this analogy, the European electrical socket is akin to an issuer of digital credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issuers generate and provide signed data that they’re authorized to issue, which can come in various formats.</p>
<p>Issuers will issue credentials in their chosen format without being forced to adhere to a specific standard, similar to the electrical socket in a specific country, which provides power according to its local standards without needing to conform to the formats used elsewhere. One issuer may pick AnonCreds and another may pick JSON-LD to issue a similar credential.</p>
<p>Each issuer’s specific use case plays a significant role in the choice of technology. For instance, a transportation ministry issuing mobile driving licences would have different needs and considerations than an issuer of organizational-related claims. Each issuer’s primary intended use case shapes their unique needs (e.g., importance of authenticity, confidentiality, privacy, security) and requirements, and thus, they select the technology and format that best aligns with these needs. Similar to the way my electrical socket in Canada follows its own standard, issuers will issue credentials in their chosen format, based on their main use case, without being forced to conform to a uniform standard.</p>
<p>The issuer’s role is considered more streamlined because they can maintain a consistent issuance method and format that doesn’t need to adapt to the formats used by other issuers. This is much like how an electrical socket in a specific country, such as Canada, maintains its own consistent standard, without needing to adapt to the differing standards of sockets in other countries, like those in Europe.<br>
<br><br></p>
 Verifiers 
<p></p>
<p>Next, my devices – my laptop and phone – represent the verifier in the digital credentialing scenario. They need the credentials in a form that they can understand and accept, much like how they need power through a specific power adapter.</p>
<p>The verifier, based on its business and other requirements, decides what type credential format the holder needs to provide to them – they place restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restrictions are independent from how the issuer issued a credential. Similar to how devices like laptops or phones require specific types of electrical input from a power socket. The power source or the power socket doesn’t determine the power requirements of the device. Rather, the device itself dictates what kind of power it needs, independent of the supply available from the socket.</p>
<p>When the wallet can provide the credential that fits the verifier’s requirements, it’s like my devices perfectly fitting into an electrical socket with a universal adapter. Everything works seamlessly.</p>
<p>However, if the wallet can’t meet the restrictions, the verifier must decide if it should adjust its requirements. This is similar to the scenario where my phone or laptop plug doesn’t fit the socket. Here, I would need to adjust or use a different adapter.</p>
<p>When credential proofs are presented by the holder, the verifier checks if they conform to its restrictions. If not, they won’t work properly and could even get damaged. Similarly, a verifier ensures the presented credentials meet their criteria for a secure and valid transaction.<br>
<br><br></p>
 Holders/Wallets 
<p></p>
<p>If we assume issuers will typically pick one issuance method for their credentials, and verifiers may place restrictions for what they deem acceptable to be presented based on their context, then there needs to be something that facilitates this interoperability, or conversion.</p>
<p>The role of my universal travel adapter mirrors that of the digital identity wallet in this scenario. Just as the adapter transforms any incoming power into a form my devices can use, the digital wallet receives these varying credentials from the issuer, manages them, and converts into acceptable formats when requested, ensuring that none of the original credential’s attributes or values are lost in the conversion process.</p>
<p>The holder’s wallet has the most complex role in this ecosystem. It needs to be able to receive, store, and manage credentials from multiple issuers, each potentially using a different credential format, likened to the role of my universal travel adapter, converting ‘power’ from various formats into a form that the device can use.</p>
<p>This allows the holder to present these credentials to verifiers in a format they can understand and accept, much like how my universal travel adapter enables me to plug my Canadian devices into European sockets, converting the European power standards into a format my devices can safely use and accept. The adapter ensures compatibility between different power grids and devices without the user needing to know the specifics. This is similar to how a wallet operates.</p>
<p>The wallet is essential for maintaining the separation between the issuer and the verifier. It eliminates the need for coordination between every issuer and verifier, even if they use different technologies or standards. The issuer might use any format, and the verifier may require any format, but the wallet provides the interoperability that allows the verifier to distance itself from the issuer, thus preserving privacy.<br>
<br><br></p>
 If The Analogy Is True, Then What? 
<p>I do think the analogy of a universal plug adapter aptly depicts the role of the holder’s wallet in the exchange of digital credentials. Much like the adapter, which ensures compatibility between diverse power grids and devices, a wallet manages credentials of varying formats, serving as a vital bridge between the issuer and the verifier.</p>
<p>Just like a plug adapter’s role, the wallet allows for seamless interoperability, shielding the verifier from the specifics of the issuer’s credential format. This operational separation, facilitated by wallets, grants scalability to the system, removing the need for direct coordination between all issuers and verifiers, regardless of the technologies or standards they employ.</p>
<p>However, such conversion isn’t a straightforward process..</p>
<p> Research is required to understand and safeguard the credential’s attributes and values during the transformation. For example, if a credential loses its privacy-preserving features during conversion, we need to clearly communicate this potential loss to the user.</p>
<p>Moreover, the complexity of transformation depends on the credential format. Some formats, like AnonCreds, Selective Disclosure JSON Web Tokens (SD-JWT), and MSO (ISO/IEC 18013-5), offer more enriched data structures than others such as JSON-LD.</p>
<p>For instance, AnonCreds and SD-JWT are rich formats where every element can be individually signed, facilitating selective disclosures. However, this feature also makes them heavier to process. In contrast, converting a rich format into a simpler one like JSON-LD doesn’t pose an issue, as there’s no loss of information. But a reverse conversion is more difficult because not every claim is signed by the issuer in JSON-LD format.</p>
<p>I hope this further underscores the need for in-depth research to understand the dynamics of different credential formats and to develop robust interoperability frameworks. </p>
<p>While we allow the standards to evolve naturally, we must focus on ensuring these frameworks can accommodate and seamlessly convert between all these formats without compromising the credential’s integrity or the issuer’s integrity.</p>
<p>Interoperability is the key here, and that’s where the research should be directed. We should let the standards evolve as they are, but there must be an effort to develop interoperability frameworks.</p>
<p>We can take inspiration from the hardware industry, where plug and play really works. We need to make our systems truly interoperable, just like hardware devices.</p>
<p>Proposed Call to Actions</p>
 
 Advance Interoperability Research: Interoperability, or the ability of different systems or components to work together, is a key concern in the realm of digital credentials. Currently, there are multiple protocols and formats, such as DIDComm, OpenID4VC protocols, and MDL formats. The need for research in this area is to understand how these different formats can interact and be converted without loss of integrity, information or functionality. This would allow for smoother interactions between holders and verifiers, regardless of their chosen credential format. 
 Improve Wallet Versatility: Digital wallets play a crucial role as they need to support and manage credentials in multiple formats. Just as a universal travel adapter can accept plugs from different countries and convert the power into a usable form, the digital wallet needs to be versatile enough to accept, convert, and manage various credential formats. This is a challenging aspect that requires ongoing research and development. 
 Analyze Credential Format Conversion: As different credential formats might prioritize different aspects (e.g., privacy, security, usability), it’s essential to understand what might be lost or gained during the conversion process. This involves deep technical analysis and understanding of the different credential protocols.

<p>Employee Access Management is the use of identity and access management (IAM) to provide employees with secure access to organisational systems and resources. It is also known as Workforce Access Management. These employee access management systems ensure that the right people have (only) the necessary access to the tools and resources needed to complete their jobs. Access levels are usually based on job roles or management levels within the company.</p>
 Importance of Employee Access Management 
<p>Secure and effective employee access management is critical to safeguarding internal and sensitive organisational information. It helps to mitigate information security risks, protect data and ensure regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>With the significant increase in hybrid and remote working since the pandemic, employee access management systems can enable employees to work from anywhere while still accessing applications securely. When remote employees access systems without an appropriate access management system, it risks leaving vulnerabilities within the system for hackers to find and take advantage of. This leads to data breaches, which has severe financial consequences and causes damage to the organisation’s reputation.</p>
<p>The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other regulations meant that companies needed to re-assess data access internally. When all employees have access to sensitive information, including where it is not necessary to their role, it increases the risk of (accidental or purposeful) misuse of data. Implementing employee access management systems that allow access to sensitive information on an individual basis, or based on attributes like job roles, helps to reduce this risk. This is known as the Principle of Least Privilege.</p>
<p>Jenny Radcliffe, aka The People Hacker, joined the Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast to discuss social engineering and the importance of protecting your organisation. In the episode, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/social-engineering-jenny-radcliffe/" title="Educate your staff or get hacked. Stories from a Social Engineer">Educate your staff or get hacked. Stories from a Social Engineer</a>, Jenny discusses how hackers find and exploit vulnerabilities within organisations’ systems, and how identity products can improve the barriers to this happening. However, Jenny also touches on the importance on User Experience (UX) within these systems. Proper UX will ensure that while the software improves security, it should also not be too complicated, or make tasks more difficult.</p>
 Understanding Employee Access Management Requirements 
<p>When investing in access management systems, the software must support all the requirements of the organisation. An evaluation of your access needs can help to build a clear picture of your solution requirements. Factors to consider include:</p>
 
 Access requirements: user management, remote working, single sign-on. 
 Increased security: authentication needs, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), authorisation. 
 Improved productivity: reduced friction for remote workers, self-service credentials. 
 
<p>These are just a few factors that may affect your solution requirements. Learn more about these system options on our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/workforce-access-management/" title="Workforce Identity &amp; Access Management page">Workforce Identity &amp; Access Management page</a>.</p>
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems provide a centralised platform to manage access, authenticate users, and support connection to identity standards applications. Additional authentication, such as MFA, adds an extra layer of security by requesting that employees provide additional verification factors beyond passwords. Privileged access management (PAM) tools enable organisations to monitor and control privileged accounts, minimising the risk of insider threats.</p>
 Balancing Security and Usability 
<p>A key factor when looking to implement employee access management is getting the ideal balance between security and user experience. Strict access controls help to withstand external risks and comply with regulations, but if your employee access management solution is overly complex it can hinder productivity. Finding a user friendly and seamless solution that offers timely support for issues is fundamental for finding the balance between security and usability.</p>
<p>IAM software that is developed to also provide services for external users – aka Customer IAM (CIAM) – ensure such features are particularly user friendly and can cater for all remote working access scenarios as well.</p>
<p>This is where Ubisecure can help, with our Employee Access Management solutions tailored to suit your company’s access requirements. While placing importance on robust security, we also understand the need for user friendly solutions, simplifying complex identity and access requirements for workforce, B2C and B2B interactions. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/contact/" title="Contact us">Contact us</a> to find out more about Employee Access Management.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>When I recorded this podcast with Wenjing, I was initially hesitant to delve too deeply into the current state of generative AI. The pace at which this field is evolving is astounding, with significant advancements appearing nearly every week. Even in the past couple of weeks since we recorded this podcast, numerous new products have been released. A notable example is Google’s generative AI chat product, Google Bard, which is rapidly gaining recognition as a strong competitor to ChatGPT.</p>
<blockquote><p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos.</p></blockquote>
<p>For that reason, in our conversation I aimed to focus on more overarching “evergreen” topics that would remain relevant despite the rapid progression of these Generative AI products. I wanted this discussion to retain its value not only for this week but for time to come.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this conversation was first sparked by my personal experience with these AI tools. Further, at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in April, I attended a session hosted by Wenjing on “Digital Trust in the Age of AI.” This session triggered many thoughts for me about the impact of AI on digital identity and trust, as well as the intersection between advancements in digital trust and the benefits and potential risks of AI. We both decided it would be interesting to have a longer discussion in a podcast format!</p>
<p>We began our conversation with the parable of the blind men and the elephant. In this story, a group of blind men encounter an elephant for the first time. Each touches a different part of the elephant and describes it based on their limited, individual experience. This leads to disagreements about the elephant’s true nature, illustrating how a singular perspective can limit one’s understanding of a larger concept.</p>
 <p>Image taken from Sophia Tepe’s “The Blind Men and the Elephant” blog post on Medium.</p> 
<p>This parable is relevant when considering artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a complex, multifaceted field. Individuals often form opinions on it based on their personal experiences and knowledge, potentially resulting in a limited or skewed understanding, much like the blind men’s perception of the elephant.</p>
<p>For this, it is important that we have more nuanced discussions about the perceived positives and negatives of such a disruptive new technology.</p>
<p>Some of the topics discussed between Wenjing and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Exponential Data Growth and AI Systems: Discussion centered around how the volume of data, particularly from AI systems like GPT-4, is exponentially increasing. As AI starts generating more content, this could create a feedback loop leading to astronomical levels of content. 
 Interaction with LLM as Protocol: The question arose whether the pre-trained Language Model (LLM) could be equated to a protocol and if individuals might interact directly with the LLM in the future. 
 Digital Identity and Trust in the Age of AI and Deepfakes: Concerns were discussed regarding the rise of AI and deepfakes, particularly their implications for digital identity and trust. The challenges of bi-directional authentication and the potential risk to content-based authentication methods were highlighted. 
 Future of Digital Trust Protocols and Authentication: The potential of AI to generate content was related to the future of digital trust protocols. The necessity of digital signatures for authentication was suggested as a possible direction for the future. 
 Reframing Identity: A broader understanding of identity was proposed, questioning whether a reframing of identity could influence our understanding of concepts like authentication. 
 Trust in AI Bots vs. Humans: Personal observations on the level of trust in AI bots vs. humans were shared, suggesting a quicker formation of trust with bots. The implications for future human-bot relationships were considered. 
 Potential Risks and Benefits of Technological Advancements: The discussion acknowledged both potential risks and substantial benefits of technological advancements. A greater level of trust in bots due to perceived lesser risk was noted, along with a significant move towards open source models in the digital trust space. 
 Open-source Model for LLMs and Other Systems: The pros and cons of adopting an open-source model for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other complex systems were questioned.

 With a gaming regulatory framework that has more similarities with Europe than other Canadian provinces, is the Ontario market the natural step for European operators to expand to? 



 



<p>Ever since April 2022, when Ontario opened the iGaming market to private gaming operators, the province’s regulatory framework has been highly lauded and well-regarded in the international gaming community. </p>



<p>Managed by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/igaming-ontario-igo/">iGaming Ontario (iGO)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/alcohol-gaming-commission-ontario-agco/">the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)</a>, there is no limit to the number of private gaming operators that can compete in the province.</p>



<p>There are currently <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">45 regulated operators</a> in Ontario that comply with Ontario’s high standards of game integrity and player&nbsp;protections. The&nbsp;AGCO&nbsp;has approved over 5,000 certified games for use in the&nbsp;province in the last year alone.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">study conducted in March 2023</a>, over 85% of respondents who had gambled in Ontario in 2023 had done so via regulated sites. This is an impressive majority, especially considering that around 70% of all online gambling was done so via unregulated sites before the launch of the open market.</p>



<blockquote><p>Since its launch in April 2022, Ontario’s igaming market has displaced the existing unregulated market and made Ontario an internationally recognized leader in this industry. We are truly proud of this strong, responsible, competitive online gaming model.</p>Doug Downey, Attorney General of Ontario.</blockquote>



<p>One of the most pivotal steps in Ontario’s journey toward being a profitable and attractive gaming market came when the pivotal C-218 bill was passed by Ontario lawmakers in 2021. C-218 allows players to make single bets, rather than the previously allowed combination-only betting, this adds increased flexibility and opportunity for both operators and bettors, as single bets make up a sizeable portion of gambling activity and are some of the simplest to both place and offer.</p>



<p>Ontario was quick to act following the passing of C-218, putting out detailed guidelines for operators interested in entering the market, while also working alongside a range of industry leaders to establish responsible regulations.</p>



<p>For more information, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">‘How to become compliant in Ontario’s iGaming market’ blog.</a></p>



 Advantages for gambling operators doing business in Ontario: 



  Relatively unrestricted marketing opportunities<br>  Young untapped market<br>  Gateway to the rest of Canada<br>  Only province in Canada to have legalized both sports betting and online casinos, which is rare in North America<br>  No cap on the number of licences given to operators, allowing for healthy competition<br>   iGaming sites are not tethered to land based sites<br>  Tax rate is very competitive (around 20%)<br>  Operators can operate out of Malta, UK and other countries  



 Outlook on Ontario’s online gambling market.  



<p><a href="https://vixio.com/blog/a-new-era-for-online-gambling-in-canada/">VIXIO Gambling Compliance forecasts</a> have predicted that Ontario’s gambling market will see rapid growth in the short term, with a forecasted revenue of $1.5 billion by 2026. These numbers put the province as one of the largest online gambling markets in North America.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While impressive growth is forecast, that’s not the only benefit for operators. Ontario’s market also features a very competitive annual tax rate of just 20% – one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another key positives to Ontario gaming sector, is its European-like approach to gambling regulations. Unlike some other markets, operators will not be required to cease offshore activities in other Canadian provinces, once registered in Ontario.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How Ontario’s standards are raising the regulatory bar. 



<p>Ontario’s iGaming market is also raising the bar when it comes to regulatory standards. Due to an extensive list of rules and regulations, it is considered a complex market to enter, and features a core focus on customer protection. &nbsp;</p>



<p>iGaming Ontario and the AGCO have set out a wide range of rules and regulations that need to be followed to enter the market. This goes way beyond standard <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> standards. All users and operators also required to adhere to the Proceeds of Crime  and Terrorist Financing Act (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering-terrorist-financing-act-pcmltfa/">PCMLTFA</a>), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-transactions-reports-centre-canada-fintrac/">FINTRAC</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guidelines include requiring operators to report suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and provide a robust KYC process with an onboarding stage that includes checking official documents, recent photos, as well as liveness. Read the full details of AGCO’s <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The future of Ontario’s iGaming market looks very promising. Not only from a revenue standpoint, but also with regard to its high level of customer protection and regulations. If the market proves to succeed as it is forecast, it shows that stepping up security and customer protection efforts in order to become regulated, is definitely worth the effort. This is especially important in modern times, with regulators all over the globe pushing for stricter gambling rules and regulations. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

 What’s next for the Canadian iGaming market? 



<p>Due to the success of the Ontario model, it’s highly likely the future of Canada’s iGaming market will see more provinces open up their market to private gaming operators. In fact, it’s probable that finance ministers are already looking at Ontario, and its increased revenue streams from the regulated gaming sector, and considering how it could launch its own regulatory regime for the iGaming market. The good news for operators that are registered and regulated in Ontario is that when other provinces finally open up their market, regulations are likely to be quite similar, which will give them a headstart on regulation processes.</p>



 How European gaming operators can enter Ontario’s iGaming market. 



<p>All operators are required to register directly through the AGCO, which will provide their services through a commercial partnership with iGO. This means gaming companies work as private operators on behalf of Ontario’s governing body. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to enter the market, operators must go through an official registration process, which begins with submitting an application through the <a href="https://www.agco.ca/iagco-information">iAGCO</a> portal. Operators must submit gaming-related goods and services, gaming website information, and branding details. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also comprehensive entity and personal disclosure stages,  where the registrant, as well as associated individuals like parent companies and individuals holding key management or operational roles, need to submit details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is, however, more to it than just going through that initial application process. In the long run, operators will need to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">be fully compliant with Ontario’s evolving rules and regulations</a>. <br>&nbsp;</p>



 IDnow’s role in easing entry into Ontario’s iGaming market. 



<p>Entering Ontario’s iGaming market will prove a challenge for any operator. The range and complexity of iGaming requirements mean operators must navigate a regulatory maze to reach compliance. (Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Becoming Compliant in Ontario’s iGaming Market</a>)</p>



<p>Player onboarding requirements include:</p>



  Players must be 19+, physically based in Ontario<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Person (PEP) </a>checks need to be passed<br>  Personal information, including occupation must be collected<br>  Third-party providers are needed for onboarding for initial checks<br>  



<p>One key issue operators may face is a substandard non-compliant onboarding process. iGO’s clear AML and KYC requirements, which even exceed FINTRAC standards, and require detailed verification, tracking, and data storage systems. </p>



<p>This is where IDnow steps in with our verification solutions.</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">&nbsp;identity verification services for gaming&nbsp;</a>work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including gaming.

All users need is a mobile phone, and we guide them through the rest, including Ontario’s and FINTRAC standards, with official document, selfie, and liveness verification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For general questions about the Bluesky company, please visit our FAQ <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/faq">here</a>. If you’re interested in learning more about the protocol Bluesky is built on (the AT Protocol), please refer to our <a href="https://atproto.com/">protocol documentation</a> or our <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/faq">protocol FAQ</a>.</p>
 Data Privacy 
<p>What is public and what is private on Bluesky?</p>
<p>Bluesky is a public social network. Think of your posts as blog posts – anyone on the web can see them, even those without an invite code. An invite code simply grants access to the service we’re running that lets you publish a post yourself. (Developers familiar with the API can view all posts regardless of whether they have an account themselves.)</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
 
 Posts and likes are public. 
 Blocks are public. 
 Mutes are private, but mutelists are public lists. Your mutelist subscriptions are private. 
 Invites and invite trees are private. 
 
<p>Why are my posts, likes, and blocks public?</p>
<p>The AT Protocol, which Bluesky is built on, is designed to support public conversations. To make public conversations portable across all sorts of platforms, your data is stored in data repositories that anyone can view. This means that regardless of which server you choose to join, you’ll still be able to see posts across the whole network, and if you choose to change servers, you can easily take all of your data with you. This is what causes the user experience of Bluesky, a federated protocol, to be similar to all the other social media apps you have used before.</p>
<p>Can I set my profile to be private?</p>
<p>Currently, there are no private profiles on Bluesky.</p>
<p>What happens when I delete a post?</p>
<p>After you delete a post, it will be immediately removed from the user-facing app. Any images attached to your post will be immediately deleted in our data storage too.</p>
<p>However, it takes a bit longer for the text content of a post to be fully deleted in storage. The text content is stored in a non-readable form, but it is possible to query the data via the API. We will periodically perform back-end deletes to entirely wipe this data.</p>
<p>Can I get a copy of all of my data?</p>
<p>Yes — the AT Protocol keeps user data in a<a href="https://github.com/web3-storage/ipfs-car"> content-addressed archive</a>. This archive can be used to migrate account data across servers. For developers, you can use <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-sync#comatprotosyncgetcheckout">this method</a> to export a copy of your repository. For non-devs, the tooling is still being built to make it easy.</p>
<p>You can read our privacy policy <a href="https://bsky.app/support/privacy">here</a>.</p>
 Moderation 
<p>What does muting do?</p>
<p>Muting prevents you from seeing any notifications or top-level posts from an account. If they reply to a thread, you’ll see a section that says “Post from an account you muted” with an option to show the post. The account will not know that they have been muted.</p>
<p>What does blocking do?</p>
<p>Blocking prevents interaction. When you block an account, both you and the other account will no longer be able to see or interact with each other’s posts.</p>
<p>How do I flag abuse?</p>
<p>You can report posts by clicking on the three-dot menu. You can also report an entire account by visiting their profile and clicking the three-dot menu there.</p>
<p>Where can I read more about your plans for moderation?</p>
<p>We wrote about our approach to composable moderation <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">here</a> and we’ll continue to publish more in the near future.</p>
 Custom Feeds 
<p>What are custom feeds?</p>
<p>Custom feeds is a feature on Bluesky that allows you to pick the algorithm that powers your social media experience. Imagine you want your timeline to only be posts from your mutuals, or only posts that have cat photos, or only posts related to sports — you can simply pick your feed of choice from an open marketplace.</p>
<p>For users, the ability to customize their feed returns control of their attention to themselves. For developers, an open marketplace of feeds provides the freedom to experiment and publish algorithms that anyone can use.</p>
<p>You can read more about custom feeds and algorithmic choice in our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">blog post here</a>.</p>
<p>How do I use custom feeds?</p>
<p>On Bluesky, click "My Feeds" on the left side of the app. From there, you can add and discover new feeds.</p>
<p>How can I create a custom feed?</p>
<p>Developers can use our <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator">feed generator starter kit</a> to create a custom feed. Eventually, we will provide better tooling such that anyone, including non-developers, can build custom feeds.</p>
 Invite codes 
<p>I don’t have access to Bluesky yet. How can I get an invite code?</p>
<p>We regularly send out invites to our waitlist, which you can sign up for <a href="https://bsky.app/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I have an invite code, how can I access Bluesky?</p>
<p>When you get an invite code, you can download Bluesky from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199">iOS App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play Store</a>. You can also use our web app at <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a>.</p>
<p>When do I get invite codes? Do they expire?</p>
<p>Most accounts receive invite codes after they’ve been on Bluesky for a while. We periodically send invites to existing users. These codes do not expire, unless we perform a security upgrade on all codes. In that case, a security upgrade will change each invite code’s combination of letters, but it will not affect the number of codes that you have.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when we take action to moderate an account, we may revoke invite codes from that account and other accounts in the same invite tree.</p>
<p>Why does Bluesky use an invite code system?</p>
<p>Invites helps us control growth of our beta as we finish building the tooling for moderation and curation. It also gives us visibility into the growing social graph. We will likely continue to use invite codes as we increase access to the app. At that time, each account will receive many more invite codes to hand out.</p>
<p>The code we use to distribute invites is open source and can be used by other server admins to grow their own communities over time as well.</p>
<p>How does the Bluesky server use the invite tree?</p>
<p>We reference the invite tree to track behavior on the social graph. For example, if we take action to moderate an account, we may revoke invite codes from other accounts in the same invite tree.</p>
 Security 
<p>How can I reset my password?</p>
<p>Click “Forgot” on the sign-in screen. You will receive an email with a reset code.</p>
<p>What if I didn’t get a password reset email?</p>
<p>If you didn’t receive a password reset email, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a>.</p>
<p>Will you implement two-factor authentication (2FA)?</p>
<p>Yes, implementing 2FA is on our short-term roadmap.</p>
 Bluesky, the AT Protocol, and Federation 
<p>What’s the difference between Bluesky and the AT Protocol?</p>
<p>Bluesky, the public benefit company, is developing two products: the <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a>, and the microblogging app Bluesky. Bluesky, the app, is meant to demonstrate the features of the underlying protocol. The AT Protocol is built to support an entire ecosystem of social apps that extends beyond microblogging.</p>
<p>You can read more about the differences between Bluesky and the AT Protocol in our general FAQ <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/faq">here</a>.</p>
<p>How does federation affect me, as a user of the Bluesky app?</p>
<p>We’re prioritizing user experience and want to make Bluesky as user-friendly as possible. Regardless of which server you join, you’ll be able to see posts from people on other servers and take your data with you if you choose to move servers.</p>
<p>Is Bluesky built on a blockchain? Does it use cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>No, and no.</p>
 Miscellaneous 
<p>How can I submit feedback?</p>
<p>On the mobile app, open the left side menu and click “Feedback.” On the web app, there is a link to “Send feedback” on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>You can also email <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a> with support requests. Please do not use this email to request an invite. Instead, sign up for the waitlist <a href="https://bsky.app/">here</a>.</p>
<p>What is a post on Bluesky called?</p>
<p>The official term is “post.”</p>
<p>How can I find friends or mutuals from other social networks?</p>
<p>Third-party developers maintain tools such as <a href="https://fedifinder.glitch.me/#t">Fedifinder</a> to find friends from other social networks.</p>
<p>Is there a dark mode?</p>
<p>Yes. You can change the display settings to be light or dark mode, or to match your system settings, via Settings &gt; Appearance.</p>
<p>How can I set up my domain as my handle?</p>
<p>Please refer to our tutorial <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">here</a>.</p>
<p>The answers here are subject to change. We’ll update this guide regularly as we continue to release more features. Thank you for joining our beta!</p>

<p>Passkey support, our third passwordless developer option, has arrived for ODD SDK.</p> What are Passkeys? <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/">WebAuthn API</a>, or Passkeys, is a user authentication system that replaces passwords using cryptography. We'll dive more into passkeys, how they work, and how they differ from other passwordless options in this blog post, but first, let's review why developers should consider building passwordless apps.</p> The Benefits of Going Passwordless <p>There are several benefits to going passwordless for both users and developers.</p><p>1) Improved Security - This is a biggy! Machine learning is getting better at cracking passwords, and phishing attempts have gotten more sophisticated. Even the savviest users can fall prey to professional hackers. Data leaks jeopardize the exposed passwords and any accounts where users have re-used that password. App creators must have tight security when creating databases to store user passwords - the GDPR risks are enough to keep anyone up at night.</p><p>Passkeys cannot be guessed, and they are end-to-end encrypted. Phishing apps or websites created to steal users' keys won't work (unlike blockchain wallet keys) because these keys are inextricably linked to the user's device and verified by a special token (which we'll expand on in this post shortly).</p><p>2) Better User Experience - Unless a user has a subscription to a password manager (and even those can get <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/lastpass-breaches-cast-doubt-on-password-manager-safety/">compromised</a>), they have to either write down or memorize all their passwords. When they inevitably forget their password, they must go through an account recovery process that can be frustrating when the user is short on time.</p> Fission's Passwordless Options <p>App developers using <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD SDK</a> currently have two passwordless options - WebCrypto API and WalletAuth. </p><p>WebCrypto API gives the browser fairly low-level cryptographic building blocks, which include encryption and signatures. A user's private key is stored in their browser, and no one, not even the user, can extricate it. If they created their account on their laptop and want to access it on their mobile phone, they have to link their devices to do so (this is a simple process using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper/blob/5c1fba894a9fe51811e47865ed62d26e989a0807/accounts/login/awake.md#L4">AWAKE protocol</a>, also part of ODD SDK). </p><p>The upsides of WebCrypto API - it's highly secure and user-friendly. There are many tools built into it for developers to use. The downside - developers need to know what they want to build ahead of time. It's like getting a box of LEGO but no directions.</p><p>WalletAuth allows developers to integrate the Metamask browser extension wallet for user sign-in. When users connect to an ODD SDK app, they can access on-chain data as usual, as well as encrypted off-chain data storage features.</p><p>The upside - it's great for Web3 dapps and Web3 users who are comfortable with blockchain wallets and want to seamlessly work with both on and off-chain data. The downside - users who are not Web3 savvy will be very intimidated by this type of login option.</p> Under the Hood <p>At the beginning of this article, we learned that WebAuthn is a user authentication system that replaces passwords using cryptography. Instead of using a username and password, the user authenticates with a key stored on their device and signs some unique data with that key. </p><p>The unique data is divided into two parts: Client Data and Authenticator Data. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#dictdef-collectedclientdata">Client Data</a> includes contextual information about the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#webauthn-relying-party">WebAuthn Relying Party</a> and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#client">WebAuthn Client</a>. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-authenticator-data">Authenticator Data</a> includes contextual information that derives its trustworthiness from the WebAuthn Relying Party's assessment of the security of the authenticator. </p><p>In other words, the unique data seeks to understand the relationship between the app (or specifically, the WebAuthn Relying Party who created the app) and the user (specifically, the user agent - i.e. the browser or mobile app they are using) and determines whether the app can securely verify the user. On both sides, there is a layer of abstraction to ensure privacy and trustworthiness.</p><p>After the user signs the unique data, they embed that signature and unique data into a Public Key Credential. It uses the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/how-fido-works/">FIDO standard</a> and is a container just like JWT that formats the public key, signature, and unique data in a specific way according to the spec. </p> Passkeys in Action <p>Fission engineer Hugo Dias has spent months diving deep into the passkeys spec, learning what works across browsers and operating systems. As a result, he's put together a <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys">passkeys library</a> that developers can use to add passkeys support to their ODD apps. </p><p>Hugo has created two demos to demonstrate passkey syncing and sharing.</p><p>This first video shows passkeys syncing across devices with Google Password Manager. Using the Android emulator, we visit <a href="https://passkeys.fission.app/">https://passkeys.fission.app</a> (the version on Hugo's personal domain <code>hugodias.me</code>) and create a new user with a passkey-based login.</p><p>The user is now logged in on Android and can upload and access files.</p><p>Switching to Google Password Manager, we see that the passkey for <code>hugodias.me</code> has been saved and synced.</p><p>We can now switch to a desktop browser, visit the same app, and get a prompt to use a saved passkey. A pin is used to unlock.</p><p>Once logged in, we can see that the picture uploaded on mobile is accessible on a desktop web browser, synced through user WNFS files.</p><p>This second video demonstrates navigating to <a href="https://passkeys.fission.app/">https://passkeys.fission.app</a> using the Android Mobile emulator. <code>hugo-sharing</code> is logged in.</p><p>The website is a progressive web app that is installable on Android, so “Install app” is chosen from the Android Chrome browser menu.</p><p>Once installed, the ODD logo appears on the home screen. After launching, we see that <code>hugo-sharing</code> is still logged in, as it uses the same context as the website version.</p><p>Switching to the Google Photos app, the Android share function is used. Selecting the installed ODD app uploads the photo into the user’s WNFS.</p><p>The share button again uses Android native share functionality, and we can share from the installed ODD PWA app over to WhatsApp (or any other Android app). </p><p>View the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys/tree/main/examples/odd-passkeys-preact">GitHub source notes</a> for more information on these features.</p><p>You can start developing with passkeys in ODD SDK today. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys">ODD SDK Passkeys repo</a> to get started.</p>

 An introduction to Metaverse 
 Metaverse and humanity 
<p>In order to operate in the digital space, individuals have to exist in. Therefore, the introduction of digital identities was something which came naturally with people’s need to belong on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost every person has had an online account, somewhere, or has been listed in some digital system. This was done either by the user themselves, or by other individuals in order to keep track of records more easily. The digital realm, therefore, has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is something which almost every person seeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, advancements in modern technology have unveiled the exciting possibility of interacting with virtual objects and spaces. Venturing into the metaverse has the potential to unlock doors to new realms of knowledge. It may ignite the imagination and provide opportunities to explore aspects of the world that may otherwise be physically out of reach.</p>
<p>All in all, the metaverse may change the way we, as society, interact and educate ourselves. With all of this in mind, SelfKey strives to develop digital identity solutions that may enhance security and privacy as individuals begin to explore cyberspace.</p>
 Metaverse in a nutshell 
<p>The metaverse is a concept that came to be at the intersection of enhanced physical reality and persistent virtual space. It is centered around shared virtual spaces, consisting of various digital worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the metaverse represents a digital universe created and sustained by software, which is accessible through the internet. Within this virtual domain, individuals can interact with each other, as well as their virtual surroundings, in real-time.</p>
<p>For many years, the metaverse existed only as a theoretical concept, residing in the realm of people's imaginations. However, with the continuous advancements in technology, particularly in virtual and augmented reality, cyberspace is gradually capturing widespread attention. Although it is currently limited in scope, it has the potential to encompass endless possibilities in the future.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, cyberspace can serve as a parallel existence alongside the physical world, or it can strive to provide a fully immersive virtual environment. This leaves room for many opportunities for individuals to explore and share knowledge in the metaverse.</p>
 The Benefits of Metaverse 
<p>At its core, the metaverse has tremendous potential to revolutionize various aspects of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to its capacity to serve as a versatile platform for a wide range of applications, it may completely revolutionize the way we work, study, and socialize. It could facilitate many activities, such as virtual reality gaming, education, business meetings, social networking, and even virtual tourism.</p>
<p>Another notable feature of the metaverse is the possibility for users to create and design avatars. This aligns with SelfKey’s idea of <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">customizable avatars</a>, which may enable individuals to design avatars in any ways they please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These avatars may enable interaction with other individuals or virtual objects in the metaverse. Furthermore, they may facilitate the creation of digital spaces that can be used for various purposes, such as virtual stores, events, and even entire cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development and adoption of the metaverse may offer many potential benefits, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Improved Connectivity&nbsp; 
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
 Increased Accessibility 
 Virtual Education 
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
 Streamlined Efficiency 
 
<p>Below, we will further elaborate on these advantages.</p>
 Improved Connectivity 
<p>Cyberspace allows for real-time communication and collaboration between individuals from anywhere around the world. Because physical distance is no longer an issue, individuals are able to build connections and easily collaborate on projects.&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
<p>The metaverse may offer amazing opportunities for people to engage in virtual tourism. This means that individuals may delve into virtual recreations of amazing locations from the real, physical world. Additionally, they may be able to experience completely new, fascinating fictional realms which they’ve always dreamt of.&nbsp;</p>
 Increased Accessibility 
<p>Through the power of digital tools and endless creativity, the metaverse may become accessible from anywhere around the world. As long as there are stable internet connections, and with the proper devices, anyone could be part of this immersive experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature is particularly important, as it may facilitate participation for individuals with disabilities or mobility constraints.&nbsp;</p>
 Virtual Education 
<p>The internet has provided access to information which surely must’ve made learning much more accessible than ever before. However, cyberspace can bring education to the next level by allowing the creation of immersive, virtual classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, individuals may be able to build realistic, interactive learning environments. This could prove to be incredibly helpful in terms of accessibility and education for young people all around the world.</p>
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
<p>By utilizing the potential of cyberspace, individuals may be able to experience unique scenarios and activities which may not be practical or possible in the physical world. For instance, they could participate in fantasy-based virtual reality games and simulations.&nbsp;</p>
 Streamlined Efficiency 
<p>The metaverse holds potential to streamline and enhance various business and organizational processes. This includes anything from meetings, training, and customer service, and it could facilitate debugging and solving particular technical issues much faster.</p>
<p>All in all, cyberspace represents a transformative landscape with far-reaching implications. It could potentially reshape the way we interact, learn, and engage with the world around us, and beyond. In spite of all these wonderful benefits, though, there are downsides to the metaverse which are worth mentioning.</p>
 The Dark Side of Metaverse 
<p>As stated above, cyberspace holds immense potential and possibilities. However, alongside these exciting prospects, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges which come with this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the metaverse indeed raises concerns about health and social isolation, among other crucial factors, we will narrow our discussion to two primary aspects:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Privacy Issues 
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
 
 Privacy Issues 
<p>The metaverse relies on the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, which, like any cutting-edge innovation, presents its own set of challenges. As an extension of the internet, cyberspace confronts similar digital privacy and security issues, but perhaps at a more concerning level.</p>
<p>VR systems may collect user data, encompassing personal information and behavioral data, with the intention of enhancing the user experience. However, the collection and handling of such data carry inherent risks, including the potential for privacy breaches or unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Moreover, when engaging with VR applications and services developed by third parties, users should be aware that these entities may gather personal data for their own purposes, raising further privacy considerations.</p>
<p>Safeguarding this data is of utmost importance, as mishandling could expose individuals to privacy breaches, compromising their personal information and leaving them susceptible to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> or misuse.</p>
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
<p>The utilization of VR within the metaverse presents a vulnerable target for identity theft. With the aid of various machine learning algorithms, it may be relatively easy to manipulate sounds and visuals to a degree where they appear genuine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, attackers can exploit virtual reality platforms by introducing deceptive features aimed at extracting personal information from users. This susceptibility, similar to augmented reality, opens the door to ransomware attacks, where hackers compromise platforms and then demand a ransom.</p>
<p>Machine learning technologies also facilitate the manipulation of voices and videos while preserving their realism. If a hacker manages to access motion detection data from a VR headset, they could potentially employ it to generate a digital replica, commonly known as a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake">deepfake</a>.</p>
<p>A deepfake could then be used by malicious players to impersonate a user, or to try and access private accounts and systems in their name. While that is indeed a terrifying scenario, there are several decentralized solutions which may prevent such disasters.</p>
 How SelfKey May Improve your Metaverse Experience 
<p>Given the multitude of benefits cyberspace offers, it comes as no surprise that malicious actors seek to exploit vulnerabilities within it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these facts in mind, SelfKey proposes several decentralized solutions which may enhance security and prevent identity theft and other privacy concerns. These methods put a strong emphasis on privacy and security. The end goal is to empower individuals to confidently navigate the digital world.</p>
 SelfKey iD 
<p>An innovative online identity verification method, <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> was designed with the aim to safeguard user privacy and security. By utilizing ZK filters and AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, it strives to prevent unauthorized access to personal online accounts and systems by bots or identity thieves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">ZK filters</a> is to limit the amount of personal information shared when individuals interact with and engage with other individuals in digital spaces. If the shared data is limited, it may be insufficient for bad players to compromise. And this may enhance overall security and privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> is utilized with the aim to deter identity thieves from accessing a user’s online accounts with the latter’s stolen digital information. Thanks to AI’s ability to detect duplicates or fake, AI-generated images, SelfKey iD may be able to combat and prevent these attempts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The global decentralized identity market was valued at $285 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $6.82 billion by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 88.7% during the forecast period, according to a new report by <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/10/27/2543009/0/en/Global-Decentralized-Identity-Market-Size-Projected-to-Reach-US-6-822-million-by-2027-Report-by-MarketsandMarkets.html">MarketsandMarkets™.</a> This exponential growth is due to increased security breaches, identity-related fraud incidents, the inefficiency of existing identity management practices, and the lack of end-user control over identity usage.</p>
<p>In today’s highly connected and digital world, secure customer interactions have become a top concern for individuals, organizations, and governments. With the increasing use of digital services, the need for secure and reliable identity verification processes has become more pressing. This is where decentralized identity and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes come into play.</p>
<p>What does decentralized identity mean?</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is a system of identity management based on decentralized and distributed technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks. This system, in theory, will provide a digital identity that is not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or corporation. Instead, it is managed by the individual who owns it. This allows the individual to then share only the necessary aspects of their identity to validate themselves in order to interact with different organizations and services online; once the transaction is completed, they can retract their personal identity information if they wish to. Decentralized identity is not yet globally viable, but there are many organizations and governments working to make it real.</p>
<p>What does Know Your Customer (KYC) mean?</p>
<p>KYC is a process used by financial institutions and other organizations to verify the identity of their clients. This is done to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations, as well as to protect against fraud and other financial crimes.</p>
<p>The traditional KYC process involves collecting and storing large amounts of personal information about clients, including their name, date of birth, address, and government-issued ID. This information is often stored in centralized databases that can be attacked by bad actors, making it vulnerable to data breaches and other security threats.</p>
<p>Decentralized KYC processes have the potential to revolutionize the way personal information is managed and verified. By using decentralized identity, individuals can store their identity information in a secure digital wallet that is owned and controlled by them, sharing only parts of their identity as and when needed.</p>
<p>How does decentralized identity benefit organizations?</p>
<p>By adopting decentralized identity, organizations can achieve:</p>
 
 Enhanced security<br>
One of the most significant benefits is enhanced security. Identity systems store identity data on a blockchain, which is a tamper-proof and secure distributed ledger. The decentralized nature of the blockchain means that identity data is not stored in a central location, which reduces the risk of data breaches and identity theft. This is a significant benefit for organizations that store sensitive personal information, such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, and government agencies. 
 
 
 Streamlined identity verification processes<br>
In traditional identity verification systems, individuals often have to repeat the same verification process with multiple organizations. This is time-consuming and can be frustrating. With the adoption of decentralized identity, individuals can share verified identity information with multiple organizations without having to repeat the verification process. This not only saves time, but also reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies in identity information. 
 
 
 Reduced costs<br>
With decentralized identity, organizations no longer need to store, manage, and verify identity data themselves. From a cost perspective, this can be particularly beneficial for smaller organizations that do not have the resources to build and maintain their own identity verification systems and also reduce the costs associated with fraud prevention and compliance, as it provides a secure way to authenticate identities. 
 
 
 Improved user experience: seamless onboarding<br>
Instead of having to fill out long and complicated forms, users can quickly and easily share their decentralized identity with a business, which speeds up account opening. This can improve the overall customer experience and reduce the likelihood of users abandoning the onboarding process. 
 
<p>To summarize, decentralized identity and KYC are two important concepts that are changing the way we think about online identity and security. By allowing individuals to control and manage their own digital identities, and by decentralizing the KYC process, we can create a more secure, transparent, and efficient online ecosystem. While these technologies are still in the early stages of development, they hold great promise for the future of digital identity and security.</p>

<p>Are you wondering what it’s like to facilitate a remote design sprint? Are you searching for ways to make your sprint work? If yes, then this post is for you! If not, no problem; you can still enjoy the tales of a designer going through his first remote design sprint&nbsp;😀</p><p>I’m a Senior Product Designer at Onfido, an identity verification provider. We used a design sprint format to validate an idea that wasn’t part of our quarterly objectives. Going through the sprint process aligned stakeholders on the overall goal and made everyone part of the solution.</p><p>As you might know already, the design sprint process <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint">is well documented</a>, and you can find plenty of resources across the World Wide Web. So I decided that I would add up to the pile myself! I listed the most useful resources at the end. Suppose you’re searching for good material to prepare for your sprint. Hopefully, you find the following bits of advice and learnings useful for yourself.</p>Screenshot of the completed Miro board&nbsp;:D Preparation is&nbsp;key   Make it easy for yourself to facilitate. Prep in advance for every voting activity, timer, board, etc. You should be able to arrive at the activity and know the steps to follow just by seeing the board. I used this template made by Jake Knapp and Stéph Cruchon 👉 <a href="https://miro.com/miroverse/design-sprint-jake-knapp/">https://miro.com/miroverse/design-sprint-jake-knapp/</a>. I did modify it to include process information like timing and number of votes per&nbsp;person.  Remote means you’ll be on Zoom (video call) all day. PLAN LOTS OF BREAKS! I think it goes without saying, but a 10–15min break can save so much mental space and keep focus and attention from your sprint team. It can also give people space to answer some Slack messages, emails, you know&nbsp;… manage their “real work”. One every hour, give or take, is what we implemented and felt&nbsp;nice.  Keep the book near you! Or any activity reference on your computer. You don’t need to know everything because you will forget them anyway. Before each session, I would skim through the reference to refresh my memory. That helped me be more knowledgeable of the task and be able to give directives easily.  When the facilitator forgets the only material&nbsp;needed…<p>Quick fun fact: I only asked one thing for the team to prepare. Have A4 white paper and a black pen for the Sketching day. 15min before the sketching exercise, I realise… I don’t have A4 paper myself 🤦 So I ran to buy a block of 360 A4 paper… (sorry for the “ill”, I was “race walking” and typing on my phone). Told you you’re going to forget&nbsp;things!</p> Being adaptable is priceless   Problems will surely arise, and you need to be ok dealing with them. A debate that goes for too long, an unplanned drop-out, an unavailable expert/user,&nbsp;… the list goes on. Whatever you plan will be put to the test. Knowing things will change allows you to remove the pressure of perfection. Keep in mind that the sprint must go&nbsp;on!  It is fine to have a break in the middle of an activity to check things (I learned that from trying to be a dungeon master 😉). If you don’t know something, take a 5min break and check your reference or find a solution to the problem. No shame in saying, “Sorry, I don’t know how to proceed right now; let’s have a small break so that I can review the process.” Another solution is to ask your group! How would they prefer to solve the issue? How would they change the activity? What information do they need?&nbsp;…  <p>Not so-quick fact: On Wednesday, you decide many things, from the solution to the flow of the prototype itself. And be sure that your team members will try to modify the decision you made 30 minutes, 1 hour ago. During the storyboarding activity, our group was stuck on “what ifs” and “why not change that”, deep inside conversations about very specific and technical subjects. I was boiling inside as the decisions weren’t happening! Seeing that we were not going anywhere, I put a hard stop on conversations and gave a 10min break for everyone. It allowed me to take a breather, think and regain the lead of the conversation. Sometimes cutting short helps you move&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Time pressure is a stress you will experience. The best advice I can give is: “If you are in a hurry, then slow down.” (unsure where this quote comes from, either from a German or Chinese proverb if you ask&nbsp;Google)</p> The importance of the team you&nbsp;choose   As important as picking an impactful challenge, you need the right people in your team. A person who cares about the issue will show engagement and motivation. These are powerful drivers to have a successful sprint. Team members will stay focused, engage in conversations, and overall put energy into doing things&nbsp;well.  Perspective diversity should come with relevant team members. I’m glad that everyone in the sprint shared and learned something! Humans are curious by nature, so having different points of view will generate engagement through learning and rewards through&nbsp;sharing.  Having people with specific skills can help you design a feasible solution. Luckily we had 2–3 engineers in our team that helped us create a close-to-reality prototype! An interactive, half-coded prototype through Framer suited our use case. You shouldn’t base your choice on this,&nbsp;though.   Engage the team when you&nbsp;can   Within exercises, give them roles or ask them to do some tasks. <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/articles/remote-design-sprint-guide">The bible for remote design sprint</a> referenced below advises it. That was also the first feedback I received on the first day: “When you organise post-its or move things from one board to another, you can ask the group to help. You don’t have to do it by yourself! It’ll save time.” And they were right! I decided to involve them more in the day-to-day logistics. Involving them lowered my stress level and slightly improved their attention and engagement in the activity.  Make each person in the team shine during the week. Everyone has a skill or personality trait that can make the week easier or the work better! An engineer solving a problem? Give them a shout-out at the end of the day. Does a Product Manager have the best voice and temper for testing? Allow them to interview. A very knowledgeable team member? Give them 30min to expose their knowledge.  Let them shine even outside of activities! I used Chat GPT to create “inspirational sentences” for every day of the week. One in the morning within an automated Slack message and one at the end of the day in the meeting. This person in our group started to ask for a sentence written in a specific style (like pirate or medieval), which resulted in some excellent impressions and stylistic reading of these quotes. I started to ask them what style did they want each day as well as leaving this person have a little show. That was a great moment between the team and perfect to end each day on a positive&nbsp;note!  <p>Thursday’s end-of-the-day 🤖 chat GPT quote in an evangelist priest&nbsp;style:</p>ChatGPT conversation to create an inspirational sentence for my design sprint team on Thursday after finishing a prototype in one afternoon. TIPS: don’t use the word “quote” if you want something like this. Otherwise, it will get you a quote from someone, not “create&nbsp;one”.<blockquote>Hallelujah, my brothers and sisters! Let us gather ‘round and bear witness to the miracle that is about to unfold before us. For in this very afternoon, through our unwavering faith and tireless labor, we shall bring forth a prototype that shall reign supreme and conquer all doubters! So let us join our hearts and minds together, and let the power of our convictions guide our hands as we march towards glory!&nbsp;Amen!”</blockquote><p>Was our solution the perfect one? No. Did the week help us validate our idea? Mostly. Did we all learn something? Absolutely! This is a reminder that a design sprint is not a process in which you will end up with a fully ready-to-build product. Insights and learnings are the primary output. These will inform a product decision; iterating or building. In our case, we learned that our direction was good, but we needed to refine the solution&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Overall facilitating a design sprint is an excellent exercise for designers. The one we did was a one-off “bubble week” for me. By that, I meant facilitating a design sprint for a team I didn’t work in. This allowed a focus on the process and facilitation aspect of product&nbsp;design.</p><p>Ultimately you practice leading exercises, people and projects using lots of communication skills. Product design is about working with different people, so these skills are useful! I encourage everyone to try a design sprint; it’s a great experience! And obviously, have fun with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thanks for reading&nbsp;🙂</p><p>Sharing is caring!

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Christina Lu and I joined Ontology in June 2018, shortly before Ontology’s mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I have a Masters degree in Conference Interpreting and Translation Studies from the University of Leeds. I felt that this degree was the right fit for me as I’m multilingual, a fast learner, and adaptable. In the same vein, traveling and exploring new places is one of my favorite things to do as I like to experience different cultures and see what various cities have to&nbsp;offer.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I am Ontology’s Head of Social Media. In this role, my main duties include: developing social media and marketing strategies to drive engagement and increase followers; creating content and campaigns; analyzing social listening and monitoring data; and conducting internal and external communications, including but not limited to media, KOLs, partners, exchanges, and event organizers.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>What makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains is the fact that it has remained focused on Decentralized Identities (DID) and building the infrastructure and tools for Web3 for the past five years. We employ an exceptional tech team and a devoted marketing and business development team, who are dedicated to our overall&nbsp;vision.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Ontology offers individuals new opportunities, bringing awareness to DID and giving users back control in order to manage their own personal data and online identities.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>While I have reached many notable milestones throughout my time at Ontology, the most prominent is building our global community from 3 languages to over 30+ languages worldwide. Additionally, the creation of the Harbinger program is an important moment in my career to date. Essentially, it is a network of passionate blockchain and Web3 lovers and contributors. Launched in 2020, it has played a major part in helping us build a strong global community presence.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I’m most excited for more applications for DID and users owning and having complete control over their own data and identities.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In the future, I anticipate that Ontology will be leading Web3 when it comes to DID. For Web3 more generally, I expect to see mass adoption of Web3 technologies. Just like we witnessed with Web2 and the rapid growth of smartphones and social media, individuals will realize that it’s essential to adopt this technology and understand what it can&nbsp;offer.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-head-of-social-media-christina-lu-7db02fe1cad0">Meet the Team: Head of Social Media, Christina Lu</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The estimated global crypto ownership rate is around <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/#:~:text=As%20of%202023%2C%20we%20estimated,420%20million%20crypto%20users%20worldwide.">4.2%</a>, with more than 420 million crypto users worldwide. Although Hong Kong falls beyond the global average with an ownership percentage of 2.35%, more than 175,000 people own cryptocurrency there.</p><p>With the new regulations are set to come into place in June 2023. Industry experts, analysts, large investors, individual participants, and crypto enthusiasts — all are busy assessing potential challenges and opportunities that lie on this regulated road&nbsp;ahead.</p> Understanding the new&nbsp;climate <p>The new regulations come with the final guidelines for crypto exchanges looking to launch in Hong Kong this&nbsp;May.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://wp.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/20230427_Synopsis-CEO-at-Bloomberg-APAC-Policy-Series-English.pdf">regulatory synopsis</a> issued on 27th April 2023 by Ms. Julia Leung, the CEO of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, the SFC is “working with global counterparts to set baseline standards to regulate centralized virtual asset exchanges for adoption in major markets.”</p><p>The commission held public consultations on crypto exchange regulations last year to determine the best way for retail investors to access cryptocurrencies. It also wanted to test the feasibility of offering crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the geography. Indicating considerable buzz for the framework to come into place, the SFC received over 150 responses from the&nbsp;public.</p><p>The new regulations are also considered a milestone as they would let investors trade in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum from June 1st this&nbsp;year.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/hong-kongs-proposed-asset-regulation-sparks-industry-optimism">Hong Kong’s Proposed Asset Regulation Sparks Industry&nbsp;Optimism</a></p> Current crypto situation <p>The new regulations will considerably impact the crypto climate in Hong Kong, presenting a significant market opportunity for the crypto industry. According to Chainanalysis, cryptocurrency values received by internet addresses in Hong Kong were around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/hong-kongs-crypto-push-sets-up-race-bottom-2022-11-22/">US$70 billion</a> in the first half of 2022&nbsp;alone.</p> The New Regulations <p>The new regulations come under the legislative purview of the ‘Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill&nbsp;2022.”</p><p>According to its stated <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf">objectives</a>, the bill wants to amend the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinances (AMLO) to establish a licensing system for Virtual Asset Service Providers and apply the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under Schedule 2 to AMLO to&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges <p>Once the new regulations come into effect, crypto-related service providers will require an SFC license to operate in Hong Kong. And to obtain a license, they would have to furnish a detailed plan for combating money laundering risks and protecting their investors from such breaches and intrusions.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1656109508668653570?s=20">Image Source</a><p>In a broader sense, the new regulations would help set standards and benchmarks for crypto regulations in Hong Kong, a region actively pursuing the goal of becoming a crypto hub — not only in Asia but at a global scale — for some time&nbsp;now.</p><p>Numbers suggest that over<a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/over-80-web3-firms-set-up-shop-in-hk-ahead-crypto-regulations-take-effect-june/"> 80</a> foreign and Mainland China companies have already expressed interest in setting up their Web3 company through this licensing mechanism. The interest indicates positivity towards norms that advocate system regularization and protection of investor rights and interests.</p> Comparison With Previous Regulatory Frameworks <p>Many new regulations often come at the cost of destabilizing the traditional system, but that is not the case with the Hong Kong crypto licensing rules, as it would subject providers to the same AML and counter-terrorist financing legislation that traditional financial institutions follow. Hence, one can expect a seamless or at least considerably less friction in the transformative process when it becomes effective from June 1st&nbsp;onwards.</p> Implications for Cryptocurrency Exchanges <p>Although the new regime is set to come into effect from June 2023, at least <a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/over-80-web3-firms-set-up-shop-in-hk-ahead-crypto-regulations-take-effect-june/">23 businesses</a>, out of the 80 that expressed interest, according to Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and Treasury Christopher Hui, are already setting up their presence in Hong Kong. And these 23 not only include crypto exchanges but Web3 security companies, blockchain payment providers, blockchain infrastructure builders, and&nbsp;more.</p> Adaptation strategies of local exchanges <p>Adapting to the imminent regulatory shifts and challenges could be easy for local exchanges by fulfilling the core demand: exhibiting the capability to perform due diligence on their customers and meet Hong Kong’s AML and anti-terrorist financing standards. Only then would it become easier to receive a&nbsp;license!</p> Potential challenges and opportunities <p>The potential challenge may arise from something common to most of the transformative processes worldwide: arranging provisions for compliance and setting up a robust mechanism for conducting adequate due diligence. It involves upskilling the existing compliance team. The team needs to become aware and set up the system following what has been asked&nbsp;for.</p><p>What awaits providers at the end of the compliance and diligence tunnel are enhanced trust from consumers, increased transparency in the system, and the scope of a pumped-up audience&nbsp;base.</p><p>The Hong Kong authorities are also coming out with increased support for virtual asset service providers willing to pass through this regime. For instance, Hong Kong has allocated <a href="https://www.budget.gov.hk/2023/eng/budget10.html">HK$50 million</a> in its annual budget spending to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Comparative analysis with other jurisdictions <p>Similar to Hong Kong, a lot of adjacent and global jurisdictions are also proactively taking up the job of regulating virtual assets and the Web3 economy. And crypto entrepreneurs believe that when compared to Singapore and South Korea, Hong Kong’s new crypto regulations would be much similar to Singapore’s approach. Both are focused on protecting investors, institutional and retail&nbsp;alike.</p> Global and Asian Crypto&nbsp;Climate <p>Like Singapore and South Korea, being part of the Asia continent helps Hong Kong become a participant in the most thriving crypto market globally. Out of more than 420 million estimated crypto owners worldwide, more than 260 million are from the Asian market&nbsp;itself.</p> Key trends in global cryptocurrency adoption <p>It has to be kept in mind that Asia is also the most populous geographic region among continents in the world. However, other continents are also picking up speed in terms of gaining adoption and traction.</p><p>The number of owners in North America is more than 54 million, followed by Africa (38 million+), South America (33 million+), Europe (31 million+), and Oceania (15 million+).</p><p>In Asia, while regions like Singapore and Hong Kong are keen to encourage growth in the Web3 ecosystem, some countries like South Korea want to tread cautiously. Hong Kong, on the other hand, is moving forward in a structured way. The current exchange licensing system will be followed by stablecoin regulations in&nbsp;2024.</p> Influence of international regulations <p>Along with its Asian counterparts, there are many countries or regions which are considering introducing similar regulatory systems.</p><p>For instance, the European Parliament has already approved the first set of comprehensive rules to regulate cryptocurrency markets, known as MiCA or Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation.</p><p>Dubai has also set up the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority as a unique body regulating Virtual assets across&nbsp;Dubai.</p><p>All these international regulatory institutions are expected to duly influence the crypto market in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">EU Parliament Greenflags MiCA — Potential Impact on the Crypto Landscape</a></p> History of Cryptocurrency in Hong&nbsp;Kong <p>Hong Kong, for some time now, has been looked at as one of the most preferred crypto destinations in the world. In fact, the <a href="https://forexsuggest.com/worldwide-crypto-readiness-report/">Worldwide Crypto Readiness Report</a> termed Hong Kong as the most crypto-ready location in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>In 2022, Hong Kong topped the charts in all categories, including the number of blockchain startups per 100,000 people and the number of crypto ATMs proportional to the population. The region was ahead of some of the most thriving global economies, including the US and Switzerland.</p><p>Over the years, multiple local crypto companies have emerged in the region, such as Kikitrade, Saxo Crypto Products, MYETHSHOP, CoinUnited.io, and other cryptocurrency trading and educational platforms, hubs, and&nbsp;more.</p> Regulatory Framework and Government Initiatives <p>We have already discussed the form and potential use cases of the upcoming crypto licensing mechanism in Hong Kong. It is also to be noted that the region’s AMLO aligns with the global recommendations of FATF. It requires VASPs across countries to adhere to an anti-money laundering benchmark in countering fraud, breaches, and financing terrorism regulations.</p><p>The Securities and Futures Commission is the primary body looking after the execution of the imminent licensing regime in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) <p>Founded in 1989, the Commission’s job is to work as an independent statutory body to regulate Hong Kong’s securities and futures markets. Its principal responsibilities are to maintain and promote fairness, efficiency, competitiveness, transparency, and orderliness in the securities and futures industry.</p> Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) <p>One of the most crucial legislations that the SFC is bothered with in regulating the crypto industry is the <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf">AMLO</a>. In the Hong Kong special administrative region, the legislation comes with an ordinance. The ordinance amends the laws to apply customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements to virtual asset service providers.</p> Government support and initiatives <p>While regulations are set in place, the Hong Kong government is also keen to keep its support window open for the holistic growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>Cyberport came up with Web3@Cyberport in the early half of the 2023–24 financial year. According to the <a href="https://www.budget.gov.hk/2023/eng/budget10.html">official budget document</a>, HK$50 million was allocated to expedite the Web3 ecosystem development by “organizing major international seminars” and promoting “cross-sectoral business cooperation.”</p> Collaboration with Mainland&nbsp;China <p>When it comes to calibrating the region’s crypto strategies with that of Mainland China, Xiao Feng, the Chairman of the Hong Kong Crypto exchange HashKey, believes that the Hong Kong government’s emphasis is on practicing different laws from mainland China under the “One Country, Two Systems” framework.</p> Market Opportunities and Key&nbsp;Players <p>The<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/List-of-licensed-virtual-asset-trading-platforms"> SFC list</a> of licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong includes OSL Digital Securities Limited and Hash Blockchain Limited. Invariably the list of such exchanges is set to grow in the coming days, with local exchanges coming up in accordance with the regime and increasing their market share and accelerating growth.</p><p>Brands like Hex Trust, fully licensed, insured digital asset custodians, are also active in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>NUTS Finance is a blockchain development lab active in Hong Kong that focuses on building secure, composable, open-source technology to enable decentralized finance services. DTTD, another Hong Kong-based service, makes managing NFTs across multiple crypto wallets easy. Xversem, a Hong Kong-located service, aims at building effective Bitcoin wallets for Web3. Hong Kong-based Pictta is a mobile-first, gasless, and social-enabled NFT marketplace.</p><p>Such examples are many, and the bouquet of such service &amp; product companies is bound to grow in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> Challenges and&nbsp;Risks <p>It is evident that implementing the licensing mechanism will come with its share of challenges and&nbsp;risks.</p><p>Any new regulation introduced in an existing market is bound to create friction in the system. Companies will have to exhibit to the regulators and their consumers that they can do due diligence and protect the investor from potential hacks, attacks, breaches, laundering, and other possible mismanagement of funds. At the same time, they will have to comply with global benchmarks for protecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Necessarily, it would have to be a consistent effort, demanding a fixed cost to be incurred by businesses every quarter. There are chances that occasional volatility in an emergent market like crypto will take a toll on the company’s bottom line. It is essential to have efficient fund management practices in place so that companies do not lack in their compliance and diligence efforts.</p><p>The People’s Republic of China’s <a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/the-peoples-republic-of-chinas-digital-yuan-its-environment-design-and-implications">Digital Yuan</a> promised to achieve a “relatively high degree of financial inclusion” and aid in developing “various large-scale financial platforms” that reduce the cost of providing financial services. Its presence could also play a decisive role in shaping the future of crypto services in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Future Outlook and&nbsp;Trends <p>Despite all these potential challenges, Hong Kong is looking toward a brighter future in crypto services. Blockchain and DeFi are high-potential areas with a lot to offer to people who still lack access to traditional finance&nbsp;avenues.</p><p>Merging of blockchain and crypto services to the traditional finance functions of lending and borrowing, underwriting, etc., have already started. One only needs to be careful of promises made to promote the new economic order that Web3 has the power to introduce through the decentralization route.</p> Final Note <p>The imminent regulations and licensing regimes in Hong Kong present both risks and opportunities to the crypto investor and user communities.</p><p>While regulatory compliance may lower the speed of innovation and pump up costs, the investors stand to gain from a more protective atmosphere in general. There is also the scope for businesses to enjoy long-term premiums by offering enhanced trust and transparency.</p><p>Every stakeholder must stay updated on the shifts and changes happening in the regime. It always helps steer ahead in an evolving market with less friction and optimal cost-efficiency.</p> Mickey and the Hong Kong Crypto&nbsp;Quest  Additional Resources <p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/bills/b202206241.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/bills/b202206241.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-d47fcbd59076">The Shyft Perspective: Hong Kong’s New Crypto Climate</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			  Lautaro Giambroni is Product Owner&nbsp;at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hi there! I’m Lautaro Giambroni, a Product Owner at Tokeny. I’m 27 years old and was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I earned my engineering degree there and later pursued a master’s degree in financial markets in Spain.<br>
<br>
From a young age, I’ve been interested in how technology and digital products shape the world and improve people’s lives. It’s a passion that has driven me to continue my career in this field, and in recent years, I’ve been closely following the exciting developments in the blockchain space.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked in various companies related to the financial and banking sector. As a UX designer, product manager, and innovation consultant, I gained experience and insights into the industry. However, I couldn’t help but notice the outdated structures and practices that seemed to hinder innovation in the sector.<br>
<br>
Seeking to make a real impact, I came across Tokeny. What really stood out to me was the innovative approach to leveraging blockchain technology to transform financial operations in companies, as well as their commitment to bringing the benefits of blockchain to society.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Working here is an awesome experience. The best part is the team I get to work with, who are not only highly skilled but also share the same passion to make finance easy-to-access and efficient for everyone via our leading tokenization platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work we do is demanding, but it’s also highly rewarding. Our product is growing at a fast pace, and keeping up with the disruptive innovations in the DeFi industry can be a challenge. However, seeing the team’s hard work come to fruition after a release makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>Being part of a company that is driving real change in the industry is something I’m grateful for every day. The tech industry is an exciting place to be, and being part of a team that is leading the way is truly amazing.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>There are two things that really ignite my passion: meeting new cultures and learning new skills. I’ve had the opportunity to live in different countries, and that experience has fueled my desire to explore new places, try new foods, and meet people from all walks of life. In addition to that, I’m always looking to learn new skills. Whether it’s taking up a new hobby or improving my professional background, I’m eager to expand my knowledge and challenge myself. Lately, I’ve been getting into surfing, and I started practicing analogic photography.</p>
<p>Overall, I think it’s important to stay curious and keep pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. Life is all about growth and learning, and I’m passionate about embracing that journey and seeing where it takes me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Over the past decade, my home country has faced one of the worst financial crises in its recent history, marked by high unemployment rates, inflation, and a lack of economic stability. This has caused many young people, including myself, to leave in search of a better future. It’s a difficult reality that I would love to see change.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe that decentralized finance could have an impact. Especially in a country where the monetary policy has been mismanaged, and lack of transparency has led to a loss of trust in local currency. Ultimately, my dream is to contribute to creating better conditions for the people in my home country.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>As a future Tokeny employee, you will have the opportunity to learn and grow as a professional in a dynamic and innovative environment. We work hard to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of tokenization, and we’re constantly looking for new ways to innovate and make a difference.<br>
<br>
So, my advice to any prospective employee is simple: join the team and be prepared to work hard, learn a lot, and make a real difference in the world of tokenization. We will be excited to have you on board!<br>
</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>What excites me the most about Tokeny’s future is the tremendous potential for growth in the tokenization market. Over the past few years, we’ve seen significant growth in this space, and it’s estimated that the market will continue to grow at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>Being part of a company at the forefront of this market is truly amazing. Our platform is designed to empower firms seeking to digitize their operations and benefit from the latest advancements in technology.</p>
<p>I am proud to be part of a company that is driving real change in the industry, and I’m excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Decentralized Identities in all their facets have been a hot topic at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023 (EIC)</a>, which ran in Berlin last week. Just a few days before, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/12/linkedin-and-microsoft-entra-introduce-a-new-way-to-verify-your-workplace/">announced</a> their support for Verified Workplace in LinkedIn using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id">Microsoft Entra Verified ID</a>.</p>
<p>Verifying the workplace</p>
<p>What Microsoft announced is focused on a particular use case, the verification of workplaces of LinkedIn members. It builds on multi-step verification.</p>
<p>The entry level is workplace email verification. There is little friction in that. Organizations can verify the work mail of their employees based on a lightweight WebApp adding to the Microsoft Entra Verified ID service, which again requires a Microsoft Entra Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. Factually, this allows issuing verified credentials/IDs based on Azure AD or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Microsoft also will provide, together with its partner Clear, a government identity verification and binding to this. This adds another level of proof.</p>
<p>The third step then is a wallet for professionals that, in the first phase, can accept verified credentials. Enterprises can issue credentials to their employees that can be shared with LinkedIn or to Microsoft Authenticator for verification beyond LinkedIn. This thus integrates both the Microsoft Authenticator and LinkedIn – relying parties that are talking to the Authenticator also can talk to LinkedIn and the Authenticator can be used for extended verification scenarios.</p>
<p>Microsoft is basing this on the (still emerging set of) standards around decentralized identity, making it interoperable.</p>
<p>The first step into practice and towards critical mass</p>
<p>While the announcement is focused on a specific use case, it is an important step forward towards the ubiquitous use of decentralized identities:</p>
 
 It demonstrates a concrete, practical application of decentralized identities. 
 It builds on standards for interoperability. 
 It is supported by a growing partner ecosystem. 
 It neatly integrates with Microsoft Entra (including Azure Active Directory), LinkedIn, etc., and can be integrated with further solutions. 
 It provides concrete value to the users. 
 It helps in creating a critical mass of users. 
 
<p>At the EIC, I’ve illustrated my talk about decentralized identity in the enterprise with the employee and partner onboarding use case, where a verified government ID is used for initial onboarding and proofs of employment and job title/role are used for partner onboarding. In the public preview, Microsoft is demonstrating such a use case in combination with Entitlement Management, a feature within Microsoft Entra.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to seeing broader adoption of the Decentralized Identity model across the globe. Approaches such as the one announced by Microsoft can help it happen earlier.</p>

 A Step-by-Step Guide! <p>Embarking on your DeFi journey with Ontology just got easier! With the power of iZUMi Finance, you can now swap your ONG for ONT in a few simple steps. This guide will walk you through the process, helping you navigate the decentralized exchange (DEX) like a pro. So, whether you’re a seasoned DeFi enthusiast or a newcomer to the space, let’s get started and master the art of swapping!</p> Three steps on how to turn ONG into ONT via the&nbsp;DEX:  Step 1: Transfer ONG (Ontology) to ONG (ORC20) with Ontology&nbsp;Bridge   Go to: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">https://bridge.ont.io</a>, connect non-EVM wallet and EVM wallet. You should see your wallet address displayed once&nbsp;done.    Click the ONG Transfer button as shown in the figure&nbsp;below.  Choose Non-EVM from the Wallet column (Your native address will be recognized automatically then) and fill in the EVM address (To which ORC-20 ONG will be&nbsp;sent)  Click “Transfer” when everything is good, make sure you have enough ONG for the gas fee (0.05 ONG each transaction).   Step 2: Use iziSwap to swap ONG (ORC-20) to WONT&nbsp;(ORC-20)   Go to: <a href="https://izumi.finance/trade/swap">https://izumi.finance/trade/swap</a>, locate in the top right corner and click the “Connect Wallet” button to connect metamask wallet. Also, switch to “Ontology” in your wallet’s network settings.  Time to swap “ONG” into “WONT”. The top token or “from” placeholder depicts the token you own (ONG in this scenario), while the second token or “to” placeholder represents the token you receive (WONT in this scenario) after the successful swap.  Double check the amount you want to swap and make sure you prepare enough ORC-20 ONG for the gas fee (Around 0.5 ONG for each transaction).  Click swap and confirm the transaction. If the transaction is successful, a message will appear in the bottom right corner of the&nbsp;page.   Step 3: Bridge WONT (ORC20) to ONT (Ontology) with Ontology&nbsp;Bridge   Go to: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">https://bridge.ont.io</a> again.This time we should use Token&nbsp;Bridge.  Let’s choose “WONT” in the assets list and ensure the asset will be bridged from ORC-20 into Ontology&nbsp;native.  Double check the amount and make sure you have enough ORC-20 ONG for the gas fee (Around 0.15 ONG normally).  Click Swap and confirm the transaction. You ONT will be available in a short&nbsp;time.   About iZUMi&nbsp;Finance <p><a href="https://izumi.finance/home">iZUMi Finance</a> is a DeFi protocol providing one-stop Liquidity as a Service (LaaS), dedicated to building a top DEX and providing liquidity service on ZK-rollups and multi-chains. iZUMi Finance has two products, iZiSwap and LiquidBox. iZiSwap is the first and top on-chain Order Book DEX driven by iZUMi’s innovative DL-AMM and peer-to-pool Order Book design, providing CEX experience to DEX users on Layer 2.

<p><a href="http://www.entrust.com/vmc">Entrust Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> are digital certificates that enable organizations to create a more immersive and personalized email experience by displaying their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside emails. This helps them elevate their brand and stand out in their prospects’ crowded inbox. Because VMCs are linked with DMARC technology, they also potentially reduce email spoofing.</p>
<p>Entrust started working on VMCs in June 2017. Entrust is proud to have issued the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2019/verified-mark-certificates#:~:text=Entrust%20is%20the%20first%20certification,for%20organizations%20that%20support%20VMCs.">world’s first VMC</a> (in Sept 2019), <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2020/07/why-googles-verified-mark-certificates-pilot-matters/">performed a pilot with Gmail (in July 2020)</a>, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/government-organizations-can-now-get-verified-mark-certificates-for-their-outgoing-emails/#:~:text=Entrust%20is%20proud%20to%20announce,national%20IT%20agency%2C%20Statens%20IT.">issued the world’s first Government Mark Certificate (in March 2023)</a>. Entrust has also partnered with Red Sift to offer organizations an integrated BIMI solution to enhance their email security and boost their brand recognition in the inbox.</p>
<p>Now, Gmail has included an additional benefit to email senders and users in the Gmail desktop web browser UI – a new checkmark icon that proactively indicates the sender of the email has verified that it owns the domain and the logo displayed in the avatar slot. This new checkmark is only available when DMARC and VMC are both implemented.</p>
<p>This first image shows how the new checkmark icon will appear in the Gmail application “detail message” view.&nbsp; The checkmark is shown in white against a blue badge, to the right of the VMC logo and the sender’s display name:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, there’s a new tool tip that displays the following confirmation text when a user hovers over the checkmark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you see, the tool tip message confirms that the email sender has verified that it owns its email domain and logo as specified in the VMC.</p>
<p><a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/05/expanding-gmail-security-BIMI.html?m=0">Gmail is actively rolling out this VMC checkmark icon now</a>, so all desktop web browser Gmail users should see these new icons soon. Gmail has not yet announced how this might appear in mobile environments but Entrust expects there will be coordination of Gmail UIs across their other environments.</p>
<p>This checkmark icon is a good visual cue for recipients to identify verified email senders. Entrust strongly supports this new VMC enhancement and believes it will be embraced by email senders and users.</p>

<p>Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA), is a security measure used to verify a person’s identity by asking them to provide specific information that only they should know.<br>
How Does Knowledge-Based Authentication Work?<br>
The idea is that these questions serve as a block for other individuals who should not know the user’s private information but which the user has immediate knowledge of (and does not have to memorize).</p>
<p>KBA questions can be generated in two primary approaches: static and dynamic.</p>
<p>Static KBA<br>
Static approaches involve selecting a set of predetermined questions that users can choose from when setting up their KBA. These questions are often personal, referring to highly personalized experiences or preferences that would be difficult for an attacker to guess without directly knowing the user.</p>
<p>Examples of static KBA questions include:</p>
 
 What is your mother’s maiden name? 
 What was the name of your first pet? 
 In what city were you born? 
 What is your favorite book? 
 
<p>These questions are typically selected during user onboarding. Later, when the user accesses the account, they are asked to provide the answers to those same questions.</p>
<p>Dynamic KBA<br>
Dynamic approaches, as a form of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/adaptive-authentication/">adaptive authentication</a>, will generate questions based on information from various data sources tied to the user, such as public records, credit reports, or social media profiles. The system uses algorithms to select relevant, personalized questions only the user should know. Examples of dynamic KBA questions include:</p>
 
 Which of the following addresses have you lived at in the past? 
 What was the name of your elementary school? 
 Which of these phone numbers have you previously used? 
 What bank/financial institution/auto lender do you have a loan/bank account/credit account with? 
 
<p>The generation process for dynamic KBA questions typically involves data aggregation and analysis to create a set of potential questions.</p>
<p>Both static and dynamic KBA have their pros and cons, with static KBA being more straightforward to implement but potentially less secure due to the limited set of questions. Dynamic KBA is more secure since it generates personalized questions based on the user’s unique background. Still, it requires access to reliable data sources and can be more complex to implement.</p>
 How Effective Is Knowledge-Based Authentication? 
<p>KBA can provide a reasonable level of security in cases where it is used with other authentication methods. As a standalone method, however, it has some limitations.<br>
Some of the critical issues with KBA include:</p>
 
 Guessable Answers: Answers to static KBA questions may be easy to guess or research using publicly available information, such as social media profiles, online directories, or leaked data from breaches. This makes KBA more susceptible to attacks by determined adversaries. 
 Data Breaches: If an organization suffers a data breach, the answers to KBA questions may be compromised, rendering the KBA process ineffective for affected users. 
 Knowledge and Memory: Users might need to remember their answers, leading to account lockouts and frustration. Additionally, users might give easy-to-guess or common answers that are easier to guess. 
 Social Engineering: Attackers can use techniques like phishing or pretexting, to trick users into revealing the answers to their KBA questions. 
 
<p>Due to these limitations, KBA is generally considered less secure than other authentication methods like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) or biometrics. While it can still serve as an additional layer of security, organizations are increasingly adopting more advanced and secure authentication methods to protect user accounts and sensitive information better.</p>
 Is Knowledge-Based Authentication Used in Multi-Factor Authentication? 
<p>MFA requires users to present multiple factors to verify their identity before granting access to a system, application, or resource.</p>
<p>These factors are typically classified into three categories:</p>
 
 Knowledge: This factor includes information that only the user should know, such as passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), or answers to knowledge-based authentication (KBA) questions. 
 Possession: This factor involves something the user physically possesses, such as a hardware token, a one-time password (OTP) sent to a registered mobile device, or a software token generated by an authenticator app. 
 Inherence: This factor refers to biometric characteristics unique to the user, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, or iris/retina scans. 
 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication can fit into the knowledge category. But, broadly, KBA isn’t a replacement for passwords or PINs. However, and more appropriately, KBA can provide another, easy-to-implement layer on top of MFA.</p>
<p>So, for example, if a user attempts to access their credit report, the provider can ask for a password and a one-time password sent via email. Then, when the user logs in, the provider can use dynamic KBA to ask questions related to the credit report, adding another layer of security to an incredibly sensitive document.</p>
 What Are Some Alternatives to Knowledge-Based Authentication? 
<p>Several alternatives to Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) provide more secure and reliable methods for verifying a user’s identity. Some popular alternatives include:</p>
 
 Token-Based Authentication: One-time passwords are unique, time-sensitive codes generated by a dedicated hardware token, mobile device, or software application. The user must enter the OTP in addition to their standard password to authenticate their identity. Since OTPs expire after a short period or upon use, they offer a more secure alternative to KBA. 
 Device Authentication: Verification systems can use push notifications or apps to allow users the ability to authenticate via their device, typically a mobile device. While these devices can be compromised, they will, at minimum, greatly reduce the attack surface that could impact those users. 
 Biometrics: Biometric authentication relies on unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/what-is-behavioral-biometrics-authentication/">behavioral biometrics</a>, or facial scans, to verify a user’s identity. Biometric authentication is more secure than KBA because it is based on features unique to the individual, making it difficult for attackers to spoof. 
 
<p>These alternatives offer varying levels of security, usability, and implementation complexity, depending on the specific use case and the organization’s requirements. Many organizations opt for a combination of these methods to provide a more robust and secure authentication process.</p>
 Ground Your Security in Identity-Based Authentication with 1Kosmos 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication is a useful companion to other forms of identity verification but only a small part of it. Implementing such solutions can help add layers of security but don’t serve as a replacement for solid security techniques like identity verification, biometrics, and passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>1Kosmos provides these critical fundamentals through the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture, and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>This is the story of how we built an open source company that specializes in developing the identity, data, and compute protocols for the future of the Internet.</p>Poutine Meetup in Berlin<p>Fission’s co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@boris">Boris Mann</a>, has been on the Internet for a long time. As one of the first 1,000 bloggers in the world, Boris loved being able to publish content online but recognized the challenges to making self-publishing possible for everyone. Running a server under your desk at home, installing software on the command line, and generally having the necessary technical know-how is neither realistic nor equitable.</p><p>Discovering the Drupal open source content management system and its worldwide network of contributors was an eye-opener: here was software and more importantly community working on making it possible for anyone to publish online. Boris became an active contributor, including helping to organize events that grow from 40 people to 1000s of Drupalcon attendees, and helping to form the Drupal Association.</p><p>At the same time, large proprietary software companies, like Microsoft, were working hard to retain their market position. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents">They viewed open source software as a dangerous competitor</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">adopted internal policies</a> to thwart the advancement of FOSS. </p><p>Boris continues to advocate for and share open source code, data, and community principles. Building better together, so that people can have more control and agency of technology for better communication and collaboration online and off. </p> <p>Fission's co-founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, started studying music composition at the University of Calgary and doing graphic design projects on the side. She picked up Photoshop and Illustrator and eventually dropped out of music school and moved to Vancouver. About five years later, while doing graphic design professionally at a friend's startup, she was given a book on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and asked if she could learn a bit of web development. By the end of the year, Brooklyn had taught herself over 20 programming languages.</p><p>Brooklyn became deeply involved in the local meetup scene, running multiple communities across many topics. She became involved in international functional programming and distributed systems conferences after she ported the Haskell standard library to Elixir. (It later tuned out that functional data structures are a great fit for IPLD).</p><p>Eventually, Brooklyn decided she wanted to return to startups, and was hired by a company based out of San Francisco. She and her Vancouver co-worker rented a desk from Boris's <a href="https://fullstack.ca/">co-working space</a>, which is how they met!</p><p>Brooklyn went on to do consulting work for Facebook, Uber, Kickstarter, and many others. After writing the same boilerplate for the nth time and fighting with k8s, she started to feel that there must be a better way. She began early designs of things that would eventually find their way into Fission.</p><p>After a couple of years away travelling as a digital nomad, she she returned to Vancouver in 2017. She joined Boris as principal engineer at a company working on Ethereum-based, legally compliant infrastructure. Brooklyn then focused on writing a formally verifiable smart contract language that was also human-readable (so that a lawyer could review the code).</p>April 2019, RUN EVM event in Berlin<p>Excited by the potential of a backend as a service, aka the "world computer" of Ethereum, Boris and Brooklyn together founded a company called SPADE ("Special Projects and Decentralized Engineering") and received an important grant from the ConsenSys Tachyon program to work on Ethereum Status Codes, which were later renamed FISSION Codes. They were one of only two companies to receive an open-source grant (the other being WalletConnect).</p><p>While building FISSION Codes, both Boris and Brooklyn started to recognize that the real challenge for both Web2 and Web3 was the increasing complexity of putting together full stack applications – plus the devops needs of running such apps. Except now, these problems were compounded by complex security needs and a more fervent demand for user control and agency. Users had been burned by Web2 exploitation and were becoming more discerning and knowledgeable about how their privacy was being compromised.</p><p>While the Web3 of blockchain, decentralized web, and p2p components were new and everyone was learning, all of the same challenges of needing to gain all of the increasingly complex skills of full stack app development and deployment were there.</p><p>After spending time on core Ethereum development &amp; community building, our cofounders asked themselves:</p><p>What if some of the emerging concepts of &nbsp;Web3 – advances in distributed systems, cryptography, and self verifiable data structures – could make it dramatically easier for front end developers to build apps, without having to become full stack developers and devops experts.</p><p>And so Fission the company was born: building an edge stack with identity, data, and compute components that enables front-end developers to build local-first apps while respecting user privacy and agency. </p>The 2019 Diffusion Hackathon grand winners, Marco and Eugene, were gifted a 4L jug of maple syrup for using the first version of the Fission service in their winning entry<p>In a Web2 stack, to put an app online, you need to run a server to hold user data. All of this data is visible to the people that run the service, and the incentives are typically to lock the users' data into the service. Never mind scaling and devops server management.</p><p>In prototyping, front end developers use dummy data in the browser without having to worry about setting up a server.</p><p>What if they could make that much simpler prototype development capable of running the production data? It would make development much easier for developers, and data wouldn't have to leave the device! By default, it would have to respect user agency. </p><p>Fission (as it is now known) became a member of the <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs Network</a> and started to build on top of the IPFS protocol. This direction would lead to the inventions of UCAN (decentralized user auth) and WNFS (user file system on top of IPFS with encrypted private data).</p><p>Today <a href="https://odd.dev/">our front end developer SDK</a> has evolved its storage solution into an overall data solution. We are working on a far-edge database called <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">Rhizome</a> to be added to the mix. We continue to iterate and collaborate with others on UCAN and other decentralized identity tools and have done an initial release of the final piece of our edge stack: content-addressed computation on IPFS with the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipvm-computation-ipfs/">InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM</a>) specification.</p><p>Our commitment to community building and open-source development is unwavering, and we look forward to continuing to grow and collaborate within this robust and exciting ecosystem.</p>

<p>This is a guest blog by <a href="https://medium.com/u/49286d46d497">Abu Majid</a>, Storyteller at Story x&nbsp;Design</p><p>As a multimedia producer at Nairobi-based Story x Design, I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating on four Caribou Digital research projects since October 2020. When Caribou Digital reached out in February 2022 asking to expand our participatory video storytelling methodology to meet the needs of digital platform workers living with disabilities, we had the opportunity to rethink our processes, from training, to filming, to the accessibility of our final&nbsp;edits.</p><p>An <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/a-platform-of-their-own-our-experience-running-a-participatory-video-storytelling-project-e90075e3f69d">earlier blog</a> by Story x Design Director Miranda Grant outlines our original participatory storytelling methods and offers tips for those interested in this filmmaking process. This blog reflects on our experience of collaborating with persons living with disabilities to create short documentaries about their lives and how we adapted our methods to fit their needs. We recount our design process, learnings, successes, and contingencies to barriers encountered.</p><p>This research, co-led by <a href="https://inable.org/">InAble</a> and Caribou Digital and in partnership with Mastercard Foundation, aims to understand the experiences and challenges of young people living with disabilities and engaging on platforms for work. With the support of InAble and Caribou Digital, we designed open-ended questionnaires to elicit authentic reflections on the challenges faced and strategies employed by platform workers living with disabilities. Our agile approach allowed us to stay nimble, learn from participants, and adjust as required throughout the&nbsp;process.</p> Three key adjustments to our&nbsp;process   Adapting the project design to ensure access for all. In order to make our collaboration with persons living with disabilities beneficial to them, we tweaked some of our supporting tools (i.e., film practice manuals, questionnaires, film prompts) for ease of use to all participants.  Working with interpreters and aides to accommodate multiple abilities. With the great support of a sign language interpreter and individual aides, we were able to help each participant identify and express the stories most important to them through a mix of in-person and one-on-one narrative and technical skills training. This hybrid mentoring approach helped participants gain confidence in their abilities to self-direct their own&nbsp;stories.  Diversifying post-production. Our versatile post-production, leveraging WhatsApp video / voice calls / voice notes and regular carrier calls, but also importantly in-person training, enabled us to stay in close touch with the participants who faced different types of challenges creating their&nbsp;content.   Adapting the project&nbsp;design  1. Adapting resources <p>Our participatory self-shot video diaries approach was developed in 2020 as a countermeasure to the COVID-19 lockdown. The framework requires the deployment of equipment and intensive multimedia skills training to all participants, where success depends on participants’ comprehension and willingness to contribute on their own time. So this process can be time and resource intensive. However, even after the COVID-19 lockdown was lifted, we decided to carry on with the self-shot video approach as participants expressed their eagerness to tell their own stories and willingness to take up the role of self-directing.</p><p>As per our usual process, we distributed a small smartphone production kit to each participant. But made a few adjustments to accommodate those who took&nbsp;part.</p><p>The phones were preloaded with:</p>  Six instructional videos on the downloadable VLC phone application. These instructional videos were embedded with a voiceover (VO) feature that defined and detailed basic film terms and techniques. The VO not only navigated participants with visual impairment through the content but also offered relatable examples for all to try. See a sample Story x Design instructional video&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd3m6aJBzAs">here</a>.  A readable softcopy instructional manual for the native <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">TalkBack</a> assistive application for both the visually and hearing impaired.  An audio instructional manual for the visually impaired participants and their&nbsp;aides.  Hardcopy instructional manuals for&nbsp;all.  A softcopy questionnaire and prompt document readable with TalkBack apps for all participants.   2. Working with aides during skills training and&nbsp;filming <p>We gathered with five of the six participants and their aides in a conference room in Thika Town, 44 kilometers from Nairobi City, a central location for all in attendance.</p><p>Together with participants and aides, we explored the self-shot video diaries format, examining proper camera orientation, sound capture, lighting, framing, and many more good film practices. Ongoing virtual mentorship provided participants with the support necessary to overcome technical and creative challenges over the course of production.</p><p>The close collaboration with interpreters and aides was key to enabling transparent communication with participants, in particular about the use of participants’ images and published videos. With clearly drafted agreement and image release forms, participants with their aides as witnesses, read, understood and after being satisfied, signed onto contributing to the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Participants and aides were compensated for their work on this project. Participants received ongoing payments to purchase internet bundles for uploading large media files throughout production, as well as a one-time payment on project completion. Aides were provided with per diems for their efforts in supporting filming.</p> 3. Diversifying post-production <p>A key addition to this project was Monica Onyango, a sign language interpreter who helped translate footage submitted by the participants with hearing impairment. This enabled the post-production team to transcribe and edit subtitles to build a story that honored the contributors.</p><p>In one case where one of the visually impaired participants could not manage to find help in filming and sending more footage, we successfully sought her consent to use her voice notes as voice overs to missing segments in her story. This was in line with our desire to create a safe, accommodating space that offered an equal platform for expression.</p> Challenges and contingencies <p>We recognized that there would be challenges that we had not faced before. Although the six participants all come from one country and one time zone, and had experience navigating digital platforms, none had experience self-directing for video or taking part in a collaborative multimedia project of this&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Beyond the usual challenges in supporting the production of self-directed videos, here are some specific challenges people with disabilities faced.</p>  The need for in-person support. In addition to an initial in-person training, participants required one-on-one mentorship and refresher sessions throughout the duration of the project. When internet connections failed, team members needed to visit participants with visual impairment in person for troubleshooting and automatic upload restoration. Similarly, when capturing B-roll proved too challenging for participants, we traveled to support, while taking great care to follow participants’ self-direction and maintain the participatory project&nbsp;design.  The availability of aides. Even with per diems on offer, most aides were unavailable on occasion, particularly because most aides selected by participants were fellow students, and others had full-time jobs. Consequently, production was often halted as the visually impaired participants waited for&nbsp;help.  The authenticity of participants’ stories. We wanted to highlight participants’ authentic techniques of navigating the digital world to find work and understand their challenges. However, we refrained from asking questions beyond what participants revealed, allowing them to authentically share their successes and obstacles, instead of only emphasizing their disabilities.   Self-determination <p>The most gratifying measure of achievement for all of us is the fact that the expressions of all participants were not dictated, directed, or curtailed. At each stage of the project, participants had full control of their stories and authority on what to feature in their final&nbsp;videos.</p><p>All contributors stated that they felt liberated and supported throughout the projects, which made even the most difficult moments feel like blips in the project’s timeline.</p><p>To those looking to produce user-generated content in collaboration with people from all walks of life, we hope these learnings serve you well. There are many measures to evaluate a film, documentary, or piece of text, but no number can ever be placed on the impact of people feeling seen, listened to, and&nbsp;moved.</p><p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSJyLOKwzy5_ghJMy-gG50twQMN6TYKC3">Watch The Youth With Disabilities Digital Platform Experience videos&nbsp;here.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/persons-living-with-disabilities-self-directing-their-own-stories-93e2f5d4e8c">Persons Living With Disabilities Self-Directing Their Own Stories</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As part of my hosting duties on the Entrust Engage podcast, I’ve had the pleasure of speaking to some outstanding guests on a variety of topics from the science behind quantum computers themselves, to impacts post-quantum will have on digital security. In the latest episode, I was pleased to get a perspective I hadn’t yet – that of an analyst – when I was joined by guest speaker, Forrester Principal Analyst Sandy Carielli. As we set up the discussion for the episode, here are some of the insights she provided on the state of post-quantum preparedness:</p>
<p>Samantha Mabey: Where do you currently feel like organizations are with looking at PQ and kicking off preparations to prepare against and mitigate the threat?</p>
<p>Sandy Carielli: Organizations are in the early stages of PQ preparation. The financial services and public sectors are the farthest ahead in this area, not surprising given the sensitivity of the data that traverses their systems. The Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Practices Act signed by President Biden at the end of last year speaks to the attention that government is placing on PQ, and the recently unveiled National Cybersecurity Strategy also stresses the importance of planning for the transition to post-quantum cryptography. However, even those industries paying close attention to PQ are at the early stages – aside from a few pilots and proofs of concept, organizations are primarily at the planning stage, with some kicking off cryptographic inventories.</p>
<p>SM: What do you foresee being some of the greatest challenges that organizations will face in preparing for the migration to post-quantum cyrptography?</p>
<p>SC: Cryptographic migration is never easy – previous migrations, such as from SHA-1 to SHA-256, have taken years. Even increasing the key size, such as moving from 1024 to 2048-bit RSA, doesn’t happen overnight. The migration from RSA or ECC to a post-quantum algorithm will be even more complicated – given how deeply embedded cryptographic functions are in code and devices, rip and replace is rarely simple. For software and systems that organizations develop themselves, development teams will need to replace existing cryptographic code with new libraries, but standard implementations of the NIST selected algorithms aren’t widespread. Then there’s the supply chain issue – organizations will rely on their partners and vendors to update cryptographic implementations in their own products before the organization can fully migrate to PQ.</p>
<p>SM: While there is a consensus that the threat (of a quantum computer being able to break traditional public key cryptography in use today) is possibly a decade away, there is a more immediate threat known as “harvest now, decrypt later”. Do you feel like there is a lack of awareness of this threat and that it further justifies that the need to prepare for PQ now?</p>
<p>SC: The “harvest now, decrypt later” threat is understood in pockets, such as government and financial services, and these are the areas where that threat is critical – customers’ bank account numbers and citizens’ government identification numbers are not likely to change in ten or twenty years. This is why these sectors have started to prepare and must continue to do so – they realize that they will need to have migrated to PQ long before a quantum computer is able to break traditional public key cryptography, and that attackers won’t be able to decrypt any PQ-encrypted data that they harvest. Outside of that, security leaders are not as aware of the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat – leaders must realize that any harvested data protected with RSA or ECC could be vulnerable later, including account information, intellectual property, and personal information (which an attacker could use as blackmail material). Broader awareness of the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat would help organizations support PQ preparation strategies.</p>

<p>IDENTOS rolls out Navigator 3.0, a new release of its digital front door product featuring simplified navigation for users and improved content management for administrators</p>
<p><a href="https://identos.com/">IDENTOS Inc</a>., a leader in digital identity and access management, has launched the latest version of its Community Navigator, Navigator 3.0. This new Navigator includes key updates that improve the end-user experience and offer greater ease in managing content.&nbsp; It enables organizations to launch modern user-centric digital front door services and integrate digital services seamlessly, including the ability to deliver a patient-centric digital health ecosystem.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.identos.com/community-navigator/">Community Navigator</a>: more than just a digital front door.</p>

<p>-Enables digital service discovery: an easily configurable app to support simple integrations or a complex marketplace of partners for your users to discover.</p>
<p>-Is built for trusted onboarding and digital identity services: facilitates onboarding of one or multiple digital services without requiring an organization to overhaul their existing/internal workflows.</p>
<p>-Allows for granular data sharing: <a href="https://www.identos.com/federated-privacy-exchange/">IDENTOS’ FPX</a> standards based identity and consent APIs allows for the safe sharing of data across a set of trusted service partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Benefits/features of the updated Navigator</p>
<p>-A simplified end-user experience: enabled by a simplified navigation in the Navigator and its Wallet application through the introduction of user-friendly tabs and buttons – improving discoverability of content and integrated services.</p>
<p>-A modern web-based application that retains the benefits of a native iOS and Android application: facilitated by a web-based interface using open pervasive technology (html and css) that resides in a native application shell enabling IDENTOS to offer the benefits of both native and web apps.&nbsp; This allows for instantaneous content updates, without needing to re-submit to App stores.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Increased flexibility around adding, updating or removing content for administrators: resulting in improved efficiency surrounding content management.</p>
<p>These significant enhancements will benefit various institutions, including government, financial and health service providers. This also includes health teams and healthcare systems that operate with several EMRs/EHRs, ACOs, and entities accountable for ensuring seamless care delivery with a collaborative approach to healthcare.</p>
<p>Availability<br>IDENTOS’ Navigator 3.0 updates are available today to new and existing customers.</p>

 The world of finance is rapidly evolving and at the heart of this transformation is the emergence of digital currencies. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), in particular, have been a topic of increasing interest among global central banks. Coinfirm, as a leader in blockchain analytics and anti-money laundering (AML) solutions, closely follows these developments. Today, we delve into the latest updates from the European Central Bank (ECB) on their ongoing project – the digital euro. 



 The Digital Euro: Prioritizing the Euro Area 



<p>According to a recent presentation from the ECB, the primary focus of the digital euro project is to serve the needs of the euro area. The ECB plans to gradually introduce different use cases for the digital euro, aiming to make it accessible to everyone within the euro area before expanding to users outside this zone. This phased approach is designed to prevent the project from becoming overly complex while ensuring it meets the needs of its primary users.</p>



 Exploring International Opportunities 



<p>The ECB recognizes the significant potential of an international dimension for the digital euro. It aims to enable access to and use of the digital euro outside the euro area without requiring currency conversion. Furthermore, the bank acknowledges the need for interoperability to facilitate cross-currency payments. The ECB’s foresight in considering these broader opportunities is a promising indicator of the digital euro’s future utility.</p>



 A Rising Tide of CBDC Projects 



<p>The ECB isn’t alone in this digital currency exploration. In fact, a recent report by the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/bank-for-international-settlements/"> Bank for International Settlements </a>(BIS) shows a substantial rise in CBDC projects around the world. The ECB is actively supporting international CBDC initiatives, collaborating with the BIS,<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/g7/"> G7,</a> and<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/international-monetary-fund-imf/"> International Monetary Fund (IMF) </a>among others. This collective effort by central banks worldwide underscores the significance of CBDCs in the future of finance.</p>



 The International Use Cases of the Digital Euro 



<p>When it comes to the use of the digital euro outside the euro area, the ECB is considering several scenarios. These include cross-border payments in digital euro, payments in digital euro outside the euro area, and use by visitors. The rules for geographical access will be determined by legislation, and if permitted, access could be extended to consumers and merchants in the European Economic Area and selected non-EU countries.</p>



 Interoperability of Digital Euro with Other CBDCs 



<p>One of the key factors in the success of the digital euro will be its interoperability with other CBDCs. The ECB has proposed two models to facilitate this: the interlinking model, which allows transactions without participation in each system, and the single system model, which involves a single system across multiple currencies.</p>



 Wholesale Central Bank Money Settlement: A New Initiative 



<p>The ECB is looking to contribute to digital innovation while ensuring that central bank money remains a monetary anchor. To this end, it has announced a new initiative on wholesale central bank money settlement. A new Eurosystem task force has been established to explore new technologies that could facilitate interaction between TARGET services and distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms.</p>



 Final Thoughts 



<p>As an organization deeply entrenched in the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>and digital currency space, Coinfirm recognizes the potential of CBDCs to revolutionize financial systems globally. We are excited to see how the ECB’s exploration of the digital euro progresses and will continue to provide our expertise and solutions in AML and blockchain analytics to support this evolution.</p>

<p>During this development cycle we have focused our lens on Sweden in particular, specifically with the continued support for Swedish BankID. Additionally, we have performed expected security and life-cycle management development. For full details, please head over to review the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20231/pages/9008381963/Identity+Server+2023.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
 Features 
 Swedish BankID 
<p>Throughout the Nordics, the ability to strongly identify oneself is considered to be second nature. The countries have invested substantial time over the last twenty years ensuring that each citizen and resident can perform many of their day-to-day tasks online. To carry this out, one needs to have a strongly authenticated digital identification method.</p>
<p>Within Sweden, this is predominantly <a href="https://www.bankid.com/en/privat/skaffa-bankid">BankID.</a> Since our original support of BankID via CIBA (Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication) back in the summer of 2018, things have changed. We have reviewed the BankID Relying Party Guidelines (v3.7) and developed an authentication adaptor to enable you to directly configure BankID within the Identity Platform. This means both two device flow, and the more commonly used single device flow, are supported. Now your users can strongly authenticate your web page or mobile app directly on their mobile device.</p>
 Focus Sweden 
<p>Full support for BankID coupled with our existing support for <a href="https://frejaeid.com/en/home/">Freja eID</a> and <a href="https://www.svipe.com/">Svipe</a> means that you can empower your users to authenticate with the most common services in Sweden. It’s well known that Ubisecure has a long history of supporting the Finnish population with a full suite of authentication options, from banking (TUPAS, which is now the FTN), through social logins (O365, Google and Apple), as well as specialised authenticators. &nbsp;Our latest release demonstrates our commitment towards Sweden, and we continue to develop the Identity Platform with a pan-European focus. We will be carrying out additional work over the next year to develop animated QR codes, required in 2024 by BankID. If there is an authenticator you need, that we are not yet offering, please contact Support or your account team and let us know. We work alongside our customers to ensure our Identity Platform evolves in line with your needs and expectations.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>Ongoing security maintenance is, of course, paramount. As we maintain the Identity Platform, we continue to improve both its functionality and security. During this release cycle, we have focused on updating Wildfly (to Wildfly 26). We have also updated OpenLDAP to 2.5.14, and Redis support to 6.2.8. Support of Linux Redhat 8 has also been tested. We always encourage you to upgrade to the latest possible release of our software as it provides the most secure and feature-rich Identity Platform possible. As always, you can find highlights of the changes on the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20231/pages/9008381963/Identity+Server+2023.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> along with a link to the detailed example of the logging changes found on our Developer Portal.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>In the short term, we are continuing work towards ongoing improvements that will be available in the next month, when we release updates for both SSO (SSO 9.2.1) and CustomerID (CID 6.2.1). Over the summer, we are continuing the maintenance cycle as usual. Continuing into the autumn and winter, we will be continuing our research into risk-based authentication development and other aspects of strong authentication.</p>

 It’s estimated that by 2024, 74% of fraudulent card transactions worldwide will involve card-not-present (CNP) transactions. The PSD2 regulatory framework is designed to protect customers and financial institutions operating in the digital payment ecosystem from fraud, especially CNP fraud.

<p>It’s estimated that by 2024, 74% of fraudulent card transactions worldwide will involve <a href="https://moneyzine.com/personal-finance-resources/credit-card-fraud-statistics/">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a>. The PSD2 regulatory framework is designed to protect customers and financial institutions operating in the digital payment ecosystem from fraud, especially CNP fraud.</p>  
 What is PSD2 SCA?  
<p>The revised Payment Services Directive, more generally known as&nbsp; PSD2, is a regulation that has been implemented in Europe, covering countries in the EEA, Monaco and the UK. Its main goals are to improve customer choice among payment providers, protect customer safety, and combat payment fraud. One key aspect of PSD2 is its obligation for all companies that provide payment services, including banks, financial institutions or other payment service providers (PSPs), to use Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The PSD2 SCA requirements oblige relevant companies to enhance customer security around payments by deploying <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for relevant transactions. MFA means that the customer must verify their identity by providing two or more factors of authentication. The guidelines on PSD2 SCA also note that authentication must be performed in a manner that protects customer data.&nbsp;</p> 
 Who Needs to Comply with PSD2 SCA?&nbsp;  
<p>Who falls under the umbrella of PSD2 SCA compliance? Well, it's not just the traditional players in the banking industry. Thanks to PSD2, new players like Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) and Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) have entered the scene. PISPs act as intermediaries between customers' banks (or where their money is) and sellers of goods or services. AISPs, upon user permission, consolidate all user financial information (such as deposits, loans, and direct debits) in one place.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If your company falls into these categories, you need to adhere to the PSD2 SCA requirements when <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html">providing the following services</a>:</p> 
  
  Payment initiation services (these inform a seller that the customer has proceeded through an online purchase)  
  Account access (when a user, or a third-party service provider, asks their bank to inform them of their financial situation)  
  Card-based instructions (when a customer asks their bank or PSP to pay someone from their account)  
  
<p>If the payment or information instruction is initiated and processed in the regulation’s area, it must follow PSD2 SCA guidelines. For US companies, this could apply, for example, if they have a European-based entity or are looking to provide the specific services mentioned to EU citizens.</p> 
<p>Organizations are required to decline transactions that do not meet SCA requirements. There are exemptions for small transactions (less than €30), where the financial institution can prove it is a low-risk transaction or where the customer has whitelisted the service provider, such as for a direct debit of a phone or electricity bill.</p> 
 How to Implement PSD2 SCA  
<p>To comply with the PSD2 SCA requirements, organizations must ensure that their customer authentication meets the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/1761863/314bd4d5-ccad-47f8-bb11-84933e863944/Final%20draft%20RTS%20on%20SCA%20and%20CSC%20under%20PSD2%20%28EBA-RTS-2017-02%29.pdf">regulatory technical standards</a> (RTS) set out for PSD2 SCA. This involves implementing MFA for relevant transactions and adhering to&nbsp; other specifications detailed in the RTS. These include:</p> 
  
  Dynamic linking of remote payments (creating a unique code specifying payee and amount to reduce fraud) should be based on technologies such as digital signatures or cryptographically underpinned validity assertions using keys.&nbsp;  
  Special advice should be given about the length or complexity of knowledge factors and the algorithms underpinning possession and inherence factors.&nbsp;  
  The application of PSD2 SCA should strike a balance between enhanced security for relevant payments and user-friendliness and accessibility.&nbsp;  
  Payments and PSD2 SCA elements must have separation. For example, if a smart device is used to make a payment and also counts as a factor of authentication, there must be a clear process to differentiate them.&nbsp;  
  
 Benefits of PSD2 SCA  
<p>Beyond regulatory compliance, PSD2 SCA brings other significant benefits to financial institutions and their customers, including improved customer security, fraud reduction, and a better user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
 Improved Customer Security  
<p>First and foremost, PSD2 SCA enhances customer security by raising the bar for authentication. With MFA in place, it becomes much harder for attackers to impersonate users and carry out fraudulent activities. While there are still issues around <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/passwordless-vs-mfa">allowing knowledge factors (namely passwords) in MFA</a> as they can be easily phished or brute forced, mandating MFA is a major step towards a more secure online world for consumers.</p> 
 Reduced Fraud  
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">Fraud committed through account takeover</a>, which uses a victim’s card or bank details to purchase items, can create significant distrust between the customer and the firm involved, even if neither party was at fault. Reducing payment fraud fosters greater trust in online transactions, making customers more comfortable with making purchases and boosting revenue opportunities for service providers.</p> 
 Better User Experience  
<p>The PSD2 SCA regulation recognizes the importance of maintaining a user-friendly process. Nobody wants frustrated customers <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/customer-authentication-tips-for-safer-shopping">abandoning their shopping carts</a> due to cumbersome authentication requirements or forgotten passwords. The specification for being accessible and user-friendly means companies complying with PSD2 SCA should consider how their authentication stream impacts the user and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-for-low-friction-authentication">how it can be as frictionless as possible.</a></p> 
 What’s Next?  
<p>Earlier this year, the European Commission presented a study on the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f6f80336-a3aa-11ed-b508-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-280122910">application and impact of PSD2</a>. The study follows a period of <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/consultations/finance-2022-psd2-review_en">open consultations into revisions of PSD2</a> legislation. It is widely expected that a PSD3 framework will be announced, but its timing and the extent of the revisions have not yet been made public.</p> 
 Comply With PSD2 SCA and Improve Customer Experience With HYPR  
<p>The PSD2 regulates financial transactions in the EU and other countries such as the UK and Norway. Its strong customer authentication (SCA) requirement obliges financial institutions, banks and payment service providers to maintain strict MFA authentication procedures for operations such as payments over €30 or requests for account information. The PSD2 SCA requirements aim to improve online consumer trust by reducing fraud and account takeover attacks, yet without a significant trade-off of user experience.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s True Passwordless solution for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-customer-authentication">customer authentication</a> allows firms to fully comply with the PSD2 SCA and transaction signing directives, including cryptographic signing of every transaction and unique dynamic linking. With HYPR, you can ensure SCA regulatory compliance while removing friction from your customer authentication process.

<p></p> 
<p>In today's modern work environment, effective management of user identities and access is crucial for securing enterprise applications, systems, and data. As organizations increasingly deploy cloud-based services and resources, managing access has become complex and necessary. As a helpdesk engineer, it’s my responsibility to manage and track access requests from end users. To streamline this process and ensure secure access, I recently deployed an approval-as-code tool, which automates the approval process for access requests and integrates with our existing tools. This will enhance our ability to manage access and mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access to critical systems and data.</p> 
 Access Management Challenges  
<p>Traditionally, I provide users with predefined default access based on their roles and responsibilities. Some admin users are provided with full access to core resources on an ongoing basis. Unfortunately, these accounts are potential targets for security breaches.&nbsp; Experian, Uber and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-improve-okta-security">Okta</a>, and many others, were all breached due to hackers, such as the Lapsus$ group, exploiting admin access.</p> 
<p>In some emergency situations, users are provided with elevated access to be able to resolve a critical issue or incident. These requests are largely handled in either tickets or Slack threads. In other words done “by hand”.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some of the challenges I face:</p> 
  
  Inefficiency: Manually managing access can be an inefficient process and mistakes can be made if access is not removed.  
  Compliance challenges: It can be difficult to demonstrate that access controls are being enforced when some users have perpetual admin access.  
  Scaling: As the organization grows and the number of users and resources increases, it becomes more difficult to manage access for a large number of users across many systems. Creating access policies can get complex.  
  
 What Is Approval-As-Code?  
<p>At HYPR, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is an already adopted practice to automate and standardize the process of deploying and managing our IT resources. We recently came across a tool that advertises “approval-as-code,” which extends the same principles as Infrastructure as code. With approval-as-code, we can automate and codify approval workflows for elevated access.</p> 
<p>The tool in question is called SYM by a company called <a href="https://symops.com/">SYMOps</a>. Sym allows you to build approval workflows that can be initiated and approved within Slack to dedicated resources defined within the tool.&nbsp; This provides just-in-time access in a manner which is audited and tracked. The current approval flow we have in place:</p> 
  
  End users request access within Slack and are asked  
   
   Which resource they need access to  
   Justification (ticket, incident or reason)  
   Duration of access  
   
  Request is routed to a dedicated Slack channel  
  Designated approvers can either approve or deny the request  
  If approved, the user is provided access to the resource for the duration selected  
  Once the time for the duration expires, access is removed and the user is notified within Slack.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Being that SYM is approval-as-code, we use our current code review process and I can collaborate with my team when building the workflows. The tool itself is managed with Terraform code so you can deploy resources and update the workflows. The approval logic is all defined in Python code so I am able to create custom policies that meet our needs but also help us scale.</p> 
 Deployment&nbsp;  
<p>Now I am not a strong or even an average coder, but the examples and support provided by the SYM team has been invaluable in helping my team and I get this tool off the ground running. No question was too basic or complex for their team as they helped me craft this tool which is now critical for our daily operations.</p> 
<p>SYMops offers multiple out-of-the-box integrations with their Python libraries. With the custom logic, we are taking advantage of the PagerDuty integration. This integration on request checks if the user is on-call in PagerDuty, to assist with&nbsp; “break-glass” access after hours in response to an incident or a page. Here is an example of the code that defines this logic which is also in the examples SYMOps provides:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>https://github.com/symopsio/examples/tree/main/basic/pagerduty_on_call</p> 
 Greater Security, Greater Convenience&nbsp;  
<p>By implementing a tool like SYM on top of our HYPR Passwordless stack, we can improve the speed, tracking and security of our applications, systems and data. Being that the tool is built within Slack allows our organization to easily adopt this process and not impede any critical work or velocity of our teams. Having the elevated access being gated by the approval workflows helps us ensure that there are sufficient guardrails for access controls in place and they are enforced.</p>

 Recap of recent IDnow ‘The State of Micromobility Regulations 2023’ webinar. 



 



<p>Our April webinar, which explored <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/state-of-micromobility-regulations-in-2023/">the current state of micromobility regulations</a>, could not have happened at a more interesting time for the industry, following the recent Paris escooter ban.</p>



<p>Moderated by Oliver Bruce, Co-Host of The Micromobility Conference &amp; Podcast, the hour-long session welcomed industry insiders and experts Usman Abid, Senior Product Manager at Tier, Martin Lefrancq, New Mobility Policy Advisor at Brussels Mobility, Felix Aumair, Head of Customer Success at GoUrban, along with our very own Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Mobility at IDnow.</p>



 What happens in Paris, stays in Paris? 



<p>With the escooter ban fresh in people’s minds, it was natural for the group to start by sharing their opinions on how it would likely impact not only <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">electric scooters</a> in major cities but the wider micromobility landscape in the rest of Europe.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it was a mixed bag of opinions, with some participants pointing out that it would likely heap additional pressure on mobility operators, who would be forced to play the waiting game while other cities decide whether to follow suit with a ban or not.</p>



<p>Despite the recent happenings in Paris, Michael said that there was no time to waste, and operators should seize the opportunity to enter the growing micromobility industry, “Now is a good chance to invest more and have a bigger focus on these kinds of topics to improve and develop micromobility services in the future.’’</p>



 The relationship between technology and regulations. 



<p>Later in the webinar, Felix and Michael discussed what measures and technology micromobility providers could implement to improve user compliance with regulations and ensure responsible use of their services.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is where IDnow supports many companies – not only in mobility – to give more responsibility to the user because there needs to be rules in place, certain behaviors, certain qualifications to make use of certain services, especially in the mobility sector. But since regulations develop and change, it’s important that providers have flexible solutions.</p>Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Mobility at IDnow</blockquote>



 Shaping the future of a safer, more sustainable mobility future. 



<p>Later in the webinar, discussions shifted from regulations to the role that micromobility could play in addressing urban congestion, and how this can be better communicated to policymakers and the public.</p>



<p>Martin mentioned how there have been huge changes over the years regarding sustainable urban mobility in Brussels.</p>



<p>“Micromobility is forecasted to help reduce carbon emissions in our cities by 30-50% by 2030,’’ said Usman.</p>



<p>Before the webinar ended with a Q+A session with the audience, the panel covered the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">key trends and developments</a> that will shape the regulatory landscape in the coming years.</p>



<p>Predictions ranged from the importance of free-floating, dedicated parking zones to why micromobility needs to have a consistent regulatory framework that is only part of a broader ecosystem. Michael said that the very future of cities was dependent on the success of micromobility, citing the need for collaboration between key stakeholders (users, city governance, operators and regulators) to ensure regulations offer a safer and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">balanced mobility experience</a> for everyone.</p>

 Ontario’s iGaming market has witnessed rapid growth since opening to private gaming operators in 2022. With an industry-envied regulatory framework, now is the time to enter the lucrative market. 



 



<p>It’s been a little over a year since Ontario decided to permit private gaming operators the chance to offer online gaming services in April 2022. </p>



<p>Sports betting regulation in Canada differs depending on local governments, with each province having authority over the regulations in their jurisdiction; Ontario is no different in that regard. Where Ontario does differ from other Canadian provinces is that they are the only province that doesn’t require residents to use government-owned lottery and gaming corporations’ platforms.</p>



<p>Since opening the market to private gaming operators, <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">45 Ontario operators</a> have taken steps to comply with Ontario’s high standards of game integrity and player&nbsp;protections. The&nbsp;AGCO&nbsp;has also approved over 5,000 certified games for use in the&nbsp;province in the last year alone. </p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">study conducted in March 2023</a>, over 85% of participants had gambled via regulated Ontario gambling platforms. This is an impressive majority, especially considering that around 70% of all online gambling was done so via unregulated sites before the launch of the open market.</p>



<p>For more information on why Ontario is a natural market for European operators to expand in, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/?preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=70959">‘iGaming Ontario – a promising market for European operators?’ blog</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>A key objective in this first year has been to move Ontario players from playing on unregulated sites to the regulated market, so that they would benefit from high standards of operator and game integrity, fairness and player protections including responsible gambling safeguards.</p>Tom Mungham, Registrar and&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;of the&nbsp;AGCO</blockquote>



 Key iGaming regulations in Ontario. 



<p>One of the most pivotal steps in Ontario’s journey toward becoming a profitable and desirable gaming market came in 2021, when the C-218 bill was passed by Ontario lawmakers. </p>



<p>C-218 allows players to make single bets, rather than the previously allowed combination-only betting, this adds increased flexibility and opportunity for both operators and bettors, as single bets make up a sizeable portion of gambling activity and are some of the simplest to both place and offer.&nbsp;<br><br>In July 2021, shortly after the passing of C-218, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/igaming-ontario-igo/">iGaming Ontario (iGO)</a> was created – a body to conduct and manage iGaming in Ontario, serving directly as a subsidiary of the pre-existing<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/alcohol-gaming-commission-ontario-agco/"> Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)</a>.&nbsp;Applications with iGaming Ontario and AGCO can run concurrently.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">The aim of iGaming Ontario is to enter into agreements with operators</a>, allowing them to offer online gaming experiences to residents of Ontario, as long as they are compliant with the new legal code and provincial law. One of the four iGO and AGCO’s market objectives is consumer protection, which is defined on <a href="https://igamingontario.ca/en">iGO’s website</a> as the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Ensure safe and responsible play, and game integrity<br>  Prevent underage access<br>  Ensure private operators comply with applicable laws, including compliance with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> (AML) rules and regulations, and compliance with relevant privacy and information security laws&nbsp;  



<p>The <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a> contains information on Ontario’s different iGaming rules and regulations. These are largely based on existing standards of Ontario’s regulatory body, AGCO.</p>



<p>Canada’s iGaming sector is also subject to the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering-terrorist-financing-act-pcmltfa/">PCMLTFA</a>), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-transactions-reports-centre-canada-fintrac/">FINTRAC</a>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, there are a strict set of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> requirements. Operators are required to maintain internal AML operating procedures that comply with Canadian federal regulatory requirements, which include a wide range of rules and regulations, such as reporting suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and much more.</p>



<p>Additionally, there are detailed KYC requirements in place, such as in-depth identity verification standards. This means players will have to provide official government documents, recent photo or selfies, and liveness to verify their identity during the registration process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 5 steps to becoming a regulated gaming operator in Ontario. 



<p>1. Apply for registration with the AGCO (Execute letter of agreement with iGaming Ontario)</p>



<p>2. Set up regulatory reporting with AGCO. Provide Technology Complicance Confirmation to AGCO (AML &amp; FInancial Information Submissions)</p>



<p>3. Obtain registration from AGCO</p>



<p>4. Application processes can be completed within a few weeks, if applications are well prepared, then iGO and AGCO are very responsive&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. The most difficult part of the application process is the risk assessment stage</p>



 Becoming compliant with Ontario’s iGaming regulations&nbsp; 



<p>Considering the depth and complexity of iGaming requirements in Ontario, entering the region as an operator may prove to be difficult. Operators will have to meet strict PCMLTFA and FINTRAC standards, as well as go above and beyond those to meet iGaming Ontario-specific regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key barriers will also include meeting iGO’s AML and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-institution-kyc-process-running/">KYC program requirements</a>, which could require operators to do complete overhauls of data storage, tracking, and verification systems. This is something that has already been a hot topic around the world, with more and more regulators calling for stricter iGaming systems and regulations. A good example of this were <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">the changes for operators in Germany</a> which was challenging to say the least. Having experienced partners in a situation like this will be key to success.</p>



<p>Player onboarding requirements include:</p>



  Players must be 19+, physically based in Ontario<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Person (PEP) </a>checks need to be passed<br>  Personal information, including occupation must be collected<br>  Third-party providers are needed for onboarding for initial checks  



<p>One solution to meeting compliance and regulatory challenges is by working with an identity verification partner like IDnow. As an identity verification specialist, IDnow has the experience and tools to aid operators in entering new markets. This is done with the help of our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">automated identity verification service</a> that quickly and securely verifies users identities, while being completely AML compliant.</p>

<p></p><p>The concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) was first proposed in 2015 by Drummond Reed and then became an official W3C standard in July of 2022.</p><p>Adoption has grown quite a bit in the last few years. Here are a few ways they are being used today.</p> Employment Verification<a title="Direct link to Employment Verification">​</a> <p>LinkedIn recently announced a new free <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23679998/linkedin-verification-badge-system-clear-microsoft-entra">verified badge feature</a> that will be used to prove the validity of your employment, education, and other achievements. “The system is backed by decentralized identity and a trust model that involves an issuer, a holder, and a verifier. Organizations can issue cryptographically signed digital IDs, which employees can then use to prove they work at a company…” </p><p>LinkedIn is  using the Self-Sovereign Identity trust model connecting an employee's DID (subject) with their employer's DID (issuer), and LinkedIn as the verifier of the transaction.</p><p></p><p>As for education verification, LinkedIn users can request that their educational institution issue a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) for their degree or certification. The user can then choose to share the credential with employers or other third parties via LinkedIn, who then verifies the authenticity of the credential using cryptographic proofs.</p>  info  <p>DIDs vs VCs: DIDs provide a way to create and manage decentralized identities, whereas VCs provide a way to prove information about those identities in a secure and portable way.</p>   Digital Driver's Licenses<a title="Direct link to Digital Driver's Licenses">​</a> <p>The DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in the United States and in Queensland Australia are piloting a program that involves issuing <a href="https://www.govtech.com/fs/california-moves-to-test-new-digital-drivers-licenses">digital driver's licenses</a> and vehicle registration documents that can be accessed and verified using a mobile app. Digital driver's license apps are cryptographically secure and can be used to verify the authenticity of the license without the need for physical documents. These apps are backed with the use of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and DIDs. This program will lead to faster and more efficient services for customers, as well as improved security and fraud prevention.</p> COVID Digital Health Apps<a title="Direct link to COVID Digital Health Apps">​</a> <p>IBM used VCs as a key component in its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/resources/digital-health-pass-blockchain-explained/">Digital Health Pass</a> solution to enable individuals to securely and privately present their COVID vaccination status to third parties - such as concert venues and stadium events.</p><p>When an individual needs to prove if they are vaccinated, they can simply present their VC to a verifier (e.g., baseball stadium), who then verifies the authenticity of the credential and the accuracy of the information it contains using cryptographic proofs. </p><p>There are several benefits to DIDs and VCs in this use case including privacy protection, security, and efficiency. This simple interaction now allows individuals to maintain control over their personal health information. For example, all they need to disclose is true/false (vaccinated or not) versus a more detailed health record. </p><p>Overall, the use of VCs and DIDs in the IBM Digital Health Pass provides a secure and privacy-preserving way for individuals to prove their health status, which was essential for enabling safe travel and activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> Social Media<a title="Direct link to Social Media">​</a> <p>Even social media applications are embracing the use of decentralized identifiers. Bluesky is a new social platform that serves as a reference implementation of the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">AT Protocol</a>, a federated protocol for large-scale social applications. Instead of usernames that are specific to and owned by the application, BlueSky instead uses domain names for identity (e.g. alice.bsky.social).

<p>Secure remote access is a method that lets authorized users access a private network as if they were on-premises with that network.</p>
<p>This includes accessing systems, resources, and data the user could access where they logged in on the private system.</p>
<p>While remote access was relatively common in business sectors for the past decade, the onset of COVID and work-from-home situations expanded this kind of technology even further. Now, remote access is used for everyday work, managing remote systems, or performing IT support for end users.</p>
<p>Key components of secure remote access include:</p>
 
 Authentication: Users must provide valid credentials through various methods, including usernames and passwords, biometrics, or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication-best-practices/">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a>. 
 Access Control: Administrators can implement access control policies to restrict user access to specific resources, applications, or systems based on their roles and responsibilities. 
 Encryption: Data transmitted between the remote user and the target system is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access. This is often done through protocols like Secure Shell/Transport Security Layer (SSH/TLS) that support strong encryption and tunneling. 
 System Security: Servers, network devices, and endpoint devices must remain secure. Otherwise, they will compromise the integrity of the overall access solution. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Using a Secure Remote Access Solution? 
<p>Secure remote access offers several benefits for businesses, organizations, and individuals, including:</p>
 
 Security: First and foremost, secure remote access allows users to connect to sensitive systems and data wherever they are. The value of this kind of remote access in a modern, decentralized world cannot be understated. 
 Compliance: Secure remote access can play a major role in compliance efforts. Most frameworks and regulations have some requirements on how users access systems–requirements that include authentication, authorization, and encryption. Secure remote access checks these boxes. 
 Flexibility: Secure remote access allows employees to work more flexibly, accommodating various schedules and time zones. This means more productivity, more variation in where your company can hire, simplified collaboration between remote teams, and reduced office space and equipment costs. 
 Scalability: Secure remote access can quickly scale to accommodate the growth of an organization, particularly its workforce, allowing new users and resources to be added with minimal effort. 
 Centralized Security and Operations: IT administrators can manage remote devices, install updates, and troubleshoot issues remotely and en masse, ensuring that all systems get the same level of attention. 
 
<p>By providing secure access to resources and systems from remote locations, secure remote access offers numerous advantages in terms of productivity, cost savings, flexibility, and security.</p>
 What Are the Different Types of Remote Secure Access? 
<p>There are several types of remote secure access solutions available to accommodate the varying needs of organizations and individuals. Some popular solutions include:</p>
 
 Virtual Private Network (VPN): VPNs are secured and persistent connections (private networks) that can extend to users such that they have full access to secure system resources. These networks work through a combination of technologies, including all those listed previously. 
 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): RDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that functions like a VPN but allows the user to access a single system rather than an entire network. 
 Secure Shell/Transport Layer Security (SSH/TLS): SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure remote access through “tunneling.” TLS is the protocol that supersedes SSH. 
 Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): VDI is a technology that provides remote access to virtual desktops hosted on a centralized server. Users can access their virtual desktops from any device with an internet connection. 
 Remote Support Software: There exist additional tools that IT support services can use by requiring end users to install a client app that can facilitate secure system sharing between the two. These solutions have also become somewhat popular in instances of digital fraud. 
 Cloud-Based Solutions: Cloud-based remote access solutions leverage cloud infrastructure to provide secure remote access. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) WorkSpaces and Google Cloud’s Compute Engine. 
 
<p>Each remote secure access solution has its unique features and uses cases. Organizations should carefully assess their needs and requirements before selecting the appropriate solution to ensure security, scalability, and ease of use.</p>
 Are Their Problems Using Secure Remote Access? 
<p>Although secure remote access solutions provide numerous benefits, they also introduce some risks and challenges that organizations must address to ensure the security of their networks and data.</p>
<p>Some of the risks associated with secure remote access include:</p>
 
 Unauthorized Access: If an attacker gains access to a remote user’s credentials or devices, they may be able to access sensitive resources and systems. Since the solution assumes the user is legitimate, they will have full access to any system the user would have access to. 
 Endpoint Security: Security is only as strong as its weakest link, and in the case of remote access, this is typically user security. An unsecured laptop or mobile device can open up a vulnerability in the network that admins cannot plan for. 
 Insider Threats: Much like endpoint security, insider threats are hard to fight since they are, for all intents and purposes, legitimate users. An insider with remote access can gain control of sensitive resources. 
 Data Leakage: Data transmitted over insecure networks or stored on remote devices can be intercepted, stolen, or manipulated by malicious actors. This can lead to data breaches, loss of intellectual property, and damage to the organization’s reputation. 
 Compliance: Organizations must ensure that their remote access solutions comply with relevant regulations and industry standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA. 
 
<p>Organizations should implement robust security measures to mitigate these risks. One such approach is a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/zero-trust-best-practices/">zero-trust architecture</a> that can address typical attacks as well as user-based vulnerabilities.</p>
 1Kosmos Is Transforming Secure Remote Access 
<p>Many organizations will use some combination of MFA and access control to handle secure remote access. 1Kosmos is changing this approach by providing identity-based <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-is-iam/">authentication and access management</a> tied to biometrics and compliant identity verification.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you can secure your remote access system with the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and POI (proof of individuality), or proof of humanity staking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and POI staking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers POI staking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and POI Staking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>POI (Proof of Individuality), or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, POI staking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a POI credential that can be staked on with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By staking KEY on their POI credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's POI staking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By staking their POI credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have staked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, staking POI credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens, as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POI staking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By staking on their POI credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD POI Staking 
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's POI staking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information. To ensure the privacy and security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD POI staking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By staking on their POI credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

  <p>Are we really in control of our identities, are they merely assigned to us, or is there something else at play?<br> <br> The promise of a "self-sovereign identity" seems great: you know who you are, and through the magic of technology you can prove to everyone around you that you are who you say you are. The technology to enable this is being built and deployed, but is it the right solution? Even more fundamentally, is it the right model at all?<br> <br> In this session, we'll examine the core concept of "self-sovereign" identity in the light of how society has historically viewed identity and how our digital systems have modeled identity in different ways over time.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/your-identity-is-not-self-sovereign-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries and applications, from creating realistic images and videos to generating natural language responses. This Future Enterprise Use of Generative AI Deep Dive session will explore the current state and future trends of Generative AI technologies. Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of Generative AI technology and its current and future applications in various industries.</p>
<p>Over the last years, Generative AI has presented significant advancements in industries such as software development, finance, insurance, education, healthcare, government, manufacturing, etc. It is expected that in the coming years Generative AI will enable businesses and organizations to create more personalized and engaging experiences for customers, optimize operations, and make more accurate decisions.</p>
<p>However, with great progress comes great responsibility. The growing sophistication of these algorithms also raises concerns about their impact on society, such as the potential for misuse, bias, and the displacement of human jobs. Generative AI poses significant challenges as well as opportunities. It is therefore essential to balance the development of Generative AI with responsible research and ethical considerations to ensure that its advantages can be harnessed while minimizing its potential disadvantages.”</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/generative-ai-in-the-enterprise-eic2023"></a>

  <p>For many years public concern about technological risk has focused on the misuse of personal data, with GDPR, most hated and loved at the same time as one of the results. With the huge success of LLMs and generative AIs such as ChatGPT,&nbsp; artificial intelligence soon will be omnipresent&nbsp; in products and processes, which will shift regulator´s attention to the potential for bad or biased decisions by algorithms. Just imagine the consequences of a false medical diagnose, or of a correct diagnose created by an AI and then not accepted by the doctor. Not to mention all the other fields where bad AI can be harmful, such as autonomous cars or algorithms deciding on your future credibility. Inevitably, many governments will feel regulation is essential to protect consumers from that risk.</p>
<p>In this panel discussion we will try to jointly create a list of those risks that we need to regulate the sooner the better and try to create an idea on how this future regulation will impact the way we use AI in our bsuiness and private lives.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-governance-regulation-eic2023"></a>

Every organization faces the risk to be the target of a cybercrime, but the transition to business digitalization leaves a greater room to present vulnerabilities in the system, and if attackers happen to identify them, the attack will occur. The world is changing rapidly, and companies must change with it, and so insurers see their possibility to break into the market. Is it worth to have a cyber-insurance policy? Does it cover all the damages? What is the extent of insurers responsibilities and the company one? Could these cases go to court and under what conditions?&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Vertical risk management and complete identity governance can only be achieved through integration of critical platforms with other systems and applications in use and by either integrating existing point-solutions or reducing their number altogether. Integration of the identity-platform with SAP is one of those major challenges for many organizations today.</p>
<p>One Identity’s approach to this challenge is through a unifying, standard integration into SAP as well as other systems and applications to establish a common GRC framework and security concept. Which includes preventing isolated environments. To establish SAP-internal governance and minimize risk within the platforms privilege landscape most organizations use specialized embedded tools like ECS (Easy Content Solution) from IBS-Schreiber Solution. Integrating the identity management platform with the SAP rule-set administration allows SAP Rule sets to be applied directly, run SoD-analysis fast and efficiently and extend them to other systems and applications, such as MS AD, AAD. The potential value of this approach is significant as it allows a preventive risk-assessment throughout the whole SAP-stack.</p>
<p>This integrative approach also extends to the SAP Firefighter concept for it to be applied to the rulesets and extend these into other systems.

  <p>Companies are facing increasingly complex security threats. Many are struggling to assess their own security risks due to an inability to address potential issues as they arise, due to the breakneck pace at which issues are disclosed, and teams' ability to address said issues as they accumulate and because the huge number of security tools in use create diagnostic&nbsp;fatigue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vulnerability management programs rarely ever match the overall scale of the organization, boosting the number of potential points of exposure. What's more, besides vulnerabilities, attackers are increasingly&nbsp;leveraging&nbsp;exposures such as misconfigurations and stolen credentials to gain access to companies' core business. Because of this, attack paths to critical assets are often overlooked or identified too late.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at vast numbers of isolated issues, XM Cyber aggregates them into an attack graph to proactively identify hidden attack paths and weaknesses in both the cloud and on-premises. XM Cyber helps organizations efficiently address the issues that can have the greatest impact on organizational&nbsp;risk. Then teams can eliminate attack paths at critical junctures, i.e., choke points, in order to achieve ultra-efficient risk remediation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/continuous-exposure-management-eic2023"></a>

  <p>In the last 10 years machine learning has become ubiquitous and touches all lives in ways that was unimaginable before. The machines can make decisions that required considerable human effort at a much faster speed and reduced cost with a little human oversight. As a result, machines don’t just have a higher than before influence in shaping our lives but are also under increased scrutiny by both regulators as well as user rights advocates.<br> The adage “with great power comes great responsibility” has long been used – from French revolution to superhero comics. It has never been truer as the great power that machine learning wields is now in the hands of almost anyone making a software product. It ranges from giving people access to the funds that can alter their lifepath, medical diagnosis that can increase their life expectancy or reduce it dramatically to their social media feed that cannot just provide them the content that keeps them engaged, but also polarise their beliefs by feeding them information that reinforces their existing notions.<br> With the growing influence of AI technologies and the corresponding scrutiny, the way AI development happens is beginning to change. The full data science lifecycle needs to incorporate the elements of responsible AI and the professionals who know how to design and implement these will be the ones that employers will look for.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/responsable-and-ethical-ai-eic2023"></a>

Understanding&nbsp;all the different vectors of your risk posture, the flood of different tools and checklists that need to be taken into account and the way to consolidate this risk into an overarching risk dashboard is an immense challenge for CISO's, Risk Managers and their senior leadership. Because of this major challenge and a non-standard way of calculating the risk; more and more Insurance companies are putting a high demand on the information provided in order to get a proposal for a Cyber Insurance and then, if and when a Cyber Insurance&nbsp;is offered, the premiums and coverage become another big challenge and financial&nbsp;burden on companies.</p>

In his keynote, Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will take a broader perspective and look at why the future of IAM and cybersecurity must and will be policy-based. This involves policies in IGA, policies in cybersecurity, hierarchies of policies, policies for application developers and IaaS administrators, policies in Zero Trust, overcoming static entitlements, policies in the context of DID (decentralized identities), and other topics. He also will discuss what needs to be done where, such as Policy Governance, Data Governance, and Policy Lifecycle Management, and why the shift to policy-based approaches requires a multi-speed approach, with policies in new digital services coming faster than policies for modernizing legacy IAM.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-of-iam-cybersecurity-is-policy-based-eic2023"></a>

<p>With heightened reliance on remotely delivered services and transactions, the need for safer and sounder digital identification and verification is required and will become the norm in the future. This especially is true looking forward to mandates for the adoption of zero trust frameworks in which digital credentials will be issued and then used for identification and operational purposes. GLEIF is committed to making concrete and lasting improvements to the process of identity verification by leveraging the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in digital tools. GLEIF has made the LEI verifiable by creating the vLEI (verifiable LEI) with digital credentials that deliver decentralized identification and verification for organizations as well as the persons who represent their organizations either in official or functional roles. GLEIF has made much progress on developing the governance, credentials and infrastructure since introducing the vLEI in 2020 and will share an updated at this progress in this session.</p>

  <p>Decentralized identity has made its waves in the EU with European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) and in the US with various funded projects. A vast market in south-east Asia stays untapped. We have enabled our partner organization ZADA to build a decentralized identity ecosystem that connects various southeast Asian countries with numerous cases like 'Decentralized Vaccination TravelPass', 'Employment IDs', and 'Government issued Educational Credentials'. The journey of a decentralized identity platform from ideation to MVP and to a scalable production system can bring tremendous insights. We were able to successfully enable the public sector in Myanmar to engage with self-sovereign identity and bring value to its citizens by issuing over more than a quarter million digital credentials. Monetization of these credentials was an essential factor for us. These self-sovereign identity credentials varied in use cases and were verified by Singapore immigration, Public sector hospitals, the Education Ministry of Myanmar, the Health Ministry of Myanmar, and various other private sector vendors. Our journey covers various use cases in EdTech, HealthTech, IAM, and KYC. Explored right, these cases can help us dive into how enterprises can engage with the southeast Asian identity market.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-identity-ecosystem-southeast-asia-eic2023"></a>

During this session, we will present the results of our latest analyses, including trends in DID transactions over time, distributions across different verification methods, and errors found in DIDs and DID documents. This information can be valuable for businesses looking to understand and utilize DIDs in their operations, as well as for individuals seeking to use DIDs for their own digital identity management.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/global-decentralized-identifier-data-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The European Union’s regulation on Digital Identity, eIDAS, is currently being overhauled to adopt decentralized identity principles. The goal is to provide all citizens and residents across the EU with highly secure and privacy preserving digital wallets that can be used to manage various digital credentials, from eIDs to diplomas to payment instruments. Decentralized identity principles aim at giving freedom of choice and control to the end-user. Ensuring security and interoperability, however, will be challenging — especially in the enormous scale in terms of users and use cases the EU is aiming at. The choices made in eIDAS will have a huge impact on digital identity in the EU and beyond.</p>
<p>The so-called “Architecture and Reference Framework” (ARF) defines the technical underpinnings of eIDAS v2. Many experts from the member states and the Commission have been working on this framework over the last year, trying to select the best combination of technologies and standards out of the enormous number available in the market today. This talk will introduce the ARF and explain what architectural patterns and technical standards are adopted and how the challenges mentioned above are addressed in order to leverage on the vision of the eIDAS v2 regulation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eu-goes-decentralized-eic2023"></a>

  <p>This session will share how the concept of a Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) has evolved since 155 identity experts proposed it in 2021. It summarizes a recent paper by the non-profits that guide the GAIN vision.<br> <br> GAIN remains a call for collaboration toward globally interoperable identity assurance at-scale - a purpose that underpins the goals of governments, intergovernmental agencies, and private industry. It has inspired multiple working groups and continues to unite six non-profits - even (and especially) as the technical and policy landscape evolves to include emerging standards (e.g. MDLs, DIDs, VCs) and regulation (e.g. eIDAS 2.0).<br> <br> This talk reflects on GAIN's relevance in today’s landscape and shares progress. It includes a deep dive into the technical community group at the OpenID Foundation, which has built a prototype that demonstrates cross-network trust and high-assurance identity data exchange. It now turns its attention to digital wallets, verifiable credentials, legal entity identifiers, and government-issued IDs.<br> <br> It also reviews forward-thinking policy work by the Open Identity Exchange, which paves the way for Smart Digital IDs. Their Global Policy Metadata Framework proposes the standard publication of policy characteristics. In this world, policy metadata is shared between each trust framework through trusted wallets.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/gain-2023-and-beyond-eic2023"></a>

<p>Workforce identity workflows are complicated, with an extensive portfolio of assets and legacy applications that create gaps in strong authentication coverage. However, organizations need to trust nothing and no one - and have to prove strong authentication is in place to regulators and cyber insurance underwriters.</p>

<p>At IPFS Thing 2023, Engineer Blaine Cook presented his work on the Name Name System, a tool that could improve the discoverability of IPFS-hosted content.</p> What's in a Name? <p>Let's start with the basics. First, let's define what a name is and isn't. A name is public, globally unique, and verifiable. </p>  Public - viewable by everyone  Globally unique - cannot be duplicated  Verifiable - possible to prove control of the name using a DID. Examples of verifiable names include DNS hosts and domains, email addresses, social media handles, public keys, HTTP URLs, SSNs, and more.  <blockquote>"A DID is not a name, but all NNS names have at least one valid DID."</blockquote> What is NNS? <p>It is a way to map names to data securely.</p> How Does it Work? <p>Step 1: Select a did:method</p><p>This could be did:ens, did:DNS did:twitter, etc.</p><p>Step 2: Fetch the TXT record for your did:method and find the public key</p><p>Step 3: Input the name and DID data in the NNS form</p>  Name (the name you are assigning to the content)  Issuer (the DID)  Fact Type (DNS link, Mastodon server, etc.)  Fact Value (the pointer to that fact type)  <p>Step 4: Generate a UCAN out of that data</p>  DID for Private Key  UCAN  Signature  <p>Step 5: Store in NNS DHT (shown in Blaine's demo in the recording)</p><p>Step 6: Fetch the record(s) for the name from the DHT and use the data in the UCAN</p><p>Since a name is tied to a specific DID, and the DID is self-validating, there is no way to manipulate a name you don't have control over. We enable authentication (DID) and authorization (UCAN) in a distributed P2P system and create a DHT by storing the UCAN in NNS, thus opening up many exciting possibilities. &nbsp;</p> What Problems Does NNS Help Solve? <p>Discoverability - NNS helps users find other users' public keys without knowing the DID method they used to generate them. It also allows the user to find where another user shares content tied to that DID. </p><p>Encrypted Chat - NNS can be a mechanism for enabling encrypted communication</p><p>IPFS Search - If you want to know where someone's IPFS-hosted blog exists, finding it can be very difficult if you don't know the CID. NNS helps locate specific content by its name, which is much more human-readable and easier to remember.</p><p>Package Naming - Similar to IPFS Search, NNS makes locating specific Wasm code easier through package naming.</p> What is NNS Not? <p>It's not a petname system. Petnames don't cross connectivity or trust barriers. In a local-first future, we need names to help us continue working offline and ensure we interact with the person/data we intend.</p><p>It's not a way to prove ownership of a name (that's what the DIDs are for!). It helps you discover those proofs.</p><p>It's not a new namespace. </p><p>It's not guaranteed to be globally consistent.</p><p>It's not a blockchain.</p> Possibilities <p>It can bring together all existing standards in one place instead of trying to create a new standard.</p>XKCD <a href="https://xkcd.com/927">https://xkcd.com/927/</a><p>It could replace IPNS and DNSLink by improving latency and security. Yes, a decentralized DNS!</p><p>Currently, there are several ways to link DNS names to the decentralized web, but virtually no options link email, social handles, HTTP, etc.</p><p>We could enable permissionless usage of names that we don't own using NNS by signing a proof that we own an email address (for example) even if that email is from a centralized service that hasn't enabled interactions with some new decentralized service. </p> Next Steps <p>This work is in the beginning/experimental stages, and many questions still need to be answered. We also need to solve for latency and locality and ensure a degree of consistency. </p><p>Here's the recording of Blaine's presentation at IPFS Thing 2023.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about NNS, you can review the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/nns-the-name-name-system/3684">spec</a> and join our monthly <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan?tk=I52b5p">UCAN community calls</a>. </p><p> </p>

  The G7 is pushing for increased oversight of P2P cryptocurrency transactions through the&nbsp;FATF.  Authorities insist that the proposed regulatory changes could lead to a safer and more transparent cryptocurrency market, fostering wider adoption.  These stricter regulations raise concerns about privacy rights and could increase costs for crypto service providers.  <p>Cryptocurrencies have surged onto the global stage, carving out a significant niche in an increasingly digital world. However, the rapid expansion of this relatively nascent market has also been accompanied by notable challenges.</p><p>The Group of Seven (G7), recognizing these challenges, is now pushing for improved oversight of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. And although this call to action has its share of potential benefits, it also underscores the complex realities of&nbsp;change.</p> A Significant Shift <p>The G7’s call for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to intensify its scrutiny signals a significant shift in global regulatory focus.</p><p>The FATF, an intergovernmental body known for setting global standards against illicit financial activities, currently only supervises transactions that go through crypto service providers. By extending this oversight to include peer-to-peer transactions, the G7 aims to cast a broader safety net over the global crypto landscape.</p><p>This proposition comes at a pivotal moment as digital currencies continue to gain traction worldwide, with regulators insisting that a robust regulatory framework is not just essential anymore — it’s imperative.</p><p>Authorities believe enhanced oversight could curb illicit activities, strengthen overall market confidence and security, spur trust among users and potential investors, and set the stage for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>More on the topic: G7’s <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC&nbsp;Adoption</a></p> The Flip&nbsp;Side <p>This regulatory coin involves striking a delicate balance between increased oversight and the sanctity of user privacy — a valued feature that has been central to the appeal of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>While necessary for mitigating risks, regulations may impinge on the freedom and privacy that crypto users have come to appreciate.</p><p>Also, the increased costs for crypto service providers to adhere to new regulations could indirectly affect the users. While some view these potential costs as necessary for the sector’s evolution, others fear it could hamper innovation and growth in the&nbsp;space.</p><p>Balancing these aspects — privacy, security, and cost — will be a crucial part of the regulatory evolution.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">The FATF Travel Rule — Implications for Privacy and Data Protection</a></p> Final Note <p>While the G7 calls for enhanced oversight of individual cryptocurrency transactions is a significant step towards a safer and more transparent crypto ecosystem, it is essential to tread carefully.</p><p>The crypto landscape is a complex and rapidly evolving one, and ensuring its sustainable growth requires a regulatory approach that considers all sides of the equation.</p><p>The crypto world is on the brink of significant changes, but with careful consideration and balance, these changes could pave the way for a brighter crypto&nbsp;future.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Certificate lifecycle management (CLM) is a critical requirement for organizations. In the past we’ve talked about the need for CLM <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/05/the-speed-of-business-is-fast-is-your-pki-keeping-up/">due to CA sprawl and concerns around legacy PKI</a>, and it being a means to rein that in and centralize certificates across environments. We also know that the number of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/12/the-trend-continues-organizations-are-managing-and-issuing-more-certificates-than-ever/">machine identities are on the rise</a> and in addition to the sheer number of machine identities that need to be managed, they also bring complexities – such as short-life certificates – that make manual processes unsustainable.</p>
<p>While those are excellent reasons to invest in a proper CLM tool, let’s talk a bit more about the role of CLM in relation to overall IT strategy – like implementing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> and preparing for post-quantum.</p>
<p>Zero Trust</p>
<p>Digital certificates provide identity to people and machines, such as mobile devices, virtual machines, and IoT devices. Those certificates need to be issued by a PKI/certificate authority, which will then be able to verify that thing and give it access, whether that’s allowing someone access to your network, or servers talking to one another.</p>
<p>The part where CLM comes in as an important component of your overall Zero Trust strategy is in making sure you have strong issuance protection for your certificates. Essentially making sure no rogue certificates get issued giving too much access or privilege. This same reasoning applies to the need for control at any stage in the lifecycle of a certificate, like revocation.</p>
<p>Going one step further, here’s how CLM helps enforce the principles of Zero Trust:</p>
 
 Verify Explicitly – Making sure the right certificate is provisioned to the correct endpoint/target 
 Least Privilege – Providing the right assurance and access/privilege, by picking the correct certificate and lifecycle controls to be able to issue and manage it 
 Assume Breach – The ability to contain an attack and limit the loss and damage by revoking certificates (incident response) 
 
<p>Post-Quantum </p>
<p>When it comes to post-quantum preparedness, there is a looming <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">threat to existing cryptography</a>, which means organizations need to take steps today to prepare for the migration to quantum-safe cryptography. One of the first steps in that preparation is to have visibility into your cryptographic assets – from hardware and software to keys, certificates, and secrets.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways CLM can help:</p>
 
 Inventory. With robust discovery capabilities, CLM tools can help centralize the visibility of certificates across environments, from different certification authorities, so you know what credentials you have and where. 
 Identify Weak Cryptography. Is your cryptography up to date? Do you have hard-coded algorithms?<a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/do-you-have-cryptographic-agility/"> Are you crypto-agile</a>? The right tools can identity any risks you might have with your cryptography so you can remediate in advance of preparing for the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). 
 Consolidation. Going back to a core use of CLM – reining in the CA sprawl – it can be a tool to help migrate and consolidate your PKI footprint, making the transition to PQC much easier. 
 Automation. With the growth in the number of certificates organizations are managing, and the complexities of IT landscapes, organizations are looking for automation. There’s too much to manage and it’s too great of a risk to not have, making it a necessity. Pairing that with the migration challenge of PQC, automation will be a key ingredient to successful implementations. 
 
<p>Whether for the practical reasons of ensuring you have visibility and control over your environments, or for the more strategic reasons of implementing Zero Trust and preparing for post-quantum, make sure you’re using the right CLM tool alongside your PKI to ensure a secure future.</p>

What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am a quiet and simple person in general. However, I get things done quickly when something piques my interest. My strength is my ability to work really well within a team. I like to have an impact on the success of my team, therefore, I work hard and contribute many of my own&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>I completed a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering before starting my career. My hobbies include reading, traveling, and going on adventures. If I could have a superpower, it would be to be positioned whereby I can do things that make me happy and support humanity each and every day without having to worry about financial implications.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I joined Ontology as a harbinger in 2017 to help others to understand and contribute to the company’s vision and mission. My role is to provide support for Ontology’s English-speaking community members. This involves providing members with information on the Ontology project or assisting them with any questions they might have. I also run a procurement company (BitKong General Merchandise) aside from volunteering with Ontology.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>Ontology has been well-funded from the start and devoid of any crypto drama. As a project, it places huge value on its community and acts on any community feedback related to the Ontology product offering. Ontology is wholly dedicated to building the most impactful thing for the crypto space — a framework for Decentralized Identity Management, and this is something that sets it apart as a Web3&nbsp;project.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Although I don’t have an active part in developing the Ontology project, I enjoy supporting the success of the project through my role.

While it has been a tough journey, it has sharpened my perception as an individual. Also, being able to provide support to other people, irrespective of their background, and being recognized for my efforts frequently, is very fulfilling for&nbsp;me.</p> What are you most excited about in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited about being able to contribute to the growth of the Ontology community and provide much-needed support to the ever-growing network of Ontology members. I have seen how Ontology has succeeded in recent years as a decentralized identity provider and how the project has grown steadily, so I am very excited to see how it&nbsp;expands.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I expect Ontology to be very successful in the next five years and to become a dominant force to contend with in the industry. I think it will outpace its competitors with its data privacy protection products and decentralized identity management tools, and thus, become a widely adopted Web3 project with a high price appreciation for its native&nbsp;token.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-hamzat-5f01a23ee227">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Hamzat</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>As organizations undergo digital transformation to zero-trust architectures, identity-driven security becomes a critical aspect. Beyond new authentication technologies, organizations must have strong authorization controls. Today, if and when an identity is compromised, the attacker can make lateral movements with very few restrictions and access a wide range of critical systems and information. Much of this over-permissive environment can be attributed to manual permissions management processes that are hard to maintain over time. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), which underlie these manual processes, provide a good baseline for access security. However, their complexity grows over time and the management overhead they place oftentimes subvert the very goals of security and compliance they are deployed for. Just-In-Time Access Management (JITAM) represents a new robust and secure authorization strategy that can reduce the need for periodic access certifications and manual role administration, while providing auditability. Learn how the authorization space is rapidly changing from RBAC and ABAC to JITAM, and how it could benefit your organization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/whats-next-in-enterprise-authorization-eic2023"></a>
