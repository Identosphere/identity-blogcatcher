<p>Web apps continue to grow in complexity. Front-end developers are expected to be experts in security and infrastructure just to get their apps deployed. It's time we change that.</p> How Did Web App Development Get So Complicated? <p>Over the last fifteen years, the complexity of putting a web app online has increased significantly. </p><p>Responsive design is required now that more browsers and device types have emerged. </p><p>Web apps are more feature-rich, and performance optimization is key. Users won’t stick around if it takes too long for their files to load. </p><p>The more features and complexity an app has, the more attack surfaces it has. Security is a big concern, and web app developers must educate themselves on various security vulnerabilities and employ best practices to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and defend against attacks. </p><p>Users expect real-time updates and collaborative features in web apps. This adds complexity to the overall architecture and requires data synchronization. </p><p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Front-end developers shouldn’t have to become full-stack super devs AND security experts. We can’t go back to the way the Web was before, but we can take computing paradigms from the past and engineer them with today’s advancements and know-how to build web applications that are resilient, reliable, and require no backend.</p> Local-First to the Rescue <p>There are plenty of ideological reasons why a developer would choose local-first - no centralized big tech companies holding user data hostage, less susceptible to censorship, etc. But there are also many practical reasons why a developer would opt to build local-first apps.</p><p>Since files are stored locally, users don't need to wait for a server to access their data and send it back to them. We've all experienced trying to use an app only to find that the server went down. This may annoy some, but it could devastate a business or app that relies on real-time data. In 2023, apps should be more resilient than this. Local-first means no waiting around and opens the door to edge computing products and services, like autonomous vehicles and health monitors.</p><p>It is vital that your app is encrypted and safe from hackers. An advantage to using a distributed system is that no central point of failure can be targeted. Many news reports have reported user data being stolen or held for ransom by bad actors. With local-first apps, the data never leaves the user's device, mitigating much of the risk. Marketers also love that it's compliant with <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>. </p> Fission's ODD SDK <p>The <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD App Template</a> with <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">WNFS</a>, our encrypted file system protocol, empowers developers to quickly build local-first, edge-ready applications without a complicated backend infrastructure. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition to solving the issues above, it enables real-time (as well as offline!) collaboration, even though it's a decentralized tool. This is possible because we use CRDTs to guarantee eventual consistency and authorize users with the capabilities-based <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/">UCAN</a> protocol.</p><p>The ODD App Template is responsive, so there is no need to fiddle with the CSS.</p> <p>If you'd like to learn more about simplifying your approach to building apps while keeping them robust and secure, check out the <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD.dev</a> site for templates, demos, and workshops.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Artificial intelligence has transformed the field of cybersecurity by enabling advanced threat detection, automated response systems, and improved overall defense strategies. Although it is considered a game changer in cybersecurity, the adoption of AI presents significant ethical challenges, bias, and the growing risk of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Ethics in AI is a topic that has been discussed for many years, but in today's context, AI is making decisions that directly impact people and organizations, and the importance of considering ethics is a must. A critical examination of the moral and societal implications of AI systems used for threat detection, intrusion prevention, and incident response constitutes AI ethics in the context of cybersecurity. There are five pillars of AI ethics to consider:</p>
 
 Fairness: It should be ensured that the AI model is fair to everyone - especially historically underrepresented groups. 
 Explainable: An AI model should be explainable in the sense that it should be possible to demonstrate to an end user how results and decisions are made, what data was used to curate the model, what methods were used, what expertise was required, and how the model was trained. 
 Robustness: It should be possible to assure end users that the model does not favor one person or segment over another.&nbsp; 
 Transparency: It is important to inform users that an AI model is being used to make decisions, and people and organizations should be able to access the metadata to learn more about the model and how their data is being used. 
 Privacy: An AI model should ensure privacy for all the parties involved. 
 
<p>It sounds good and feasible to achieve, but is it that simple?</p>
 Bias and Deepfakes: Cybersecurity Concerns 
<p>In cybersecurity, algorithmic bias in AI is an evolving concern. Due to their reliance on historical data, AI systems can replicate and amplify human biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes. To ensure that security measures do not unfairly target certain groups, inadvertently undermine privacy, or perpetuate harmful stereotypes, it is critical to address bias in cybersecurity AI tools. Similarly, deepfakes pose a cybersecurity challenge because they use AI algorithms to manipulate or fabricate audio, video, or images, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fake content. In the context of cybersecurity, deepfakes can be used to deceive individuals, impersonate high-level officials, or manipulate public sentiment, with potentially destructive consequences.</p>
<p>There are things that can be done to mitigate bias and deepfakes. From a technical perspective, developing AI algorithms that are less susceptible to bias is one possibility. Another requirement is to strive for fairness by including a representative level of diversity in model training data sets. Also, using techniques such as adversarial training to detect and counter deepfakes can improve the effectiveness and reliability of cybersecurity systems. Research and innovation in this area is essential to stay ahead of the curve. On the other hand, industry, academia, and society must work together to raise awareness of the ethical implications, biases, and threats that deepfakes pose to cybersecurity. Today, there are conferences, seminars, and public campaigns to promote knowledge sharing, best practices, and the responsible use of AI technologies. Governments and regulatory bodies also play a critical role in establishing ethical AI practices in cybersecurity. By establishing guidelines and standards, frameworks promote transparency and regular audits of AI systems to make it easier to detect and counteract bias.</p>
 A Long-term Journey 
<p>As AI continues to transform the cybersecurity landscape, it is important to proactively address the interrelated issues of ethics, bias, and deepfakes. It is possible to mitigate the potential risks associated with biased AI systems and the malicious use of deepfakes by taking a multi-pronged approach that incorporates technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and collaborative efforts. There is still much work to be done to create a safe and inclusive cybersecurity environment that protects individuals, organizations, and society by prioritizing ethical principles, promoting fairness, and using AI for the greater good. Most importantly, it is necessary to understand that the use of AI in business should augment human intelligence, and in no way replace it, which indirectly leads to transparent and accountable AI systems.</p>

<p>A typical scene at a car enthusiasts motorhead event involves souped-up cars with their hoods propped open and a bunch of grease monkeys gathered around staring at the powerful V12 combustion engine. With the migration to electric cars it is probably a scene that will start to phase out over time. A bit like classical asymmetric cryptography!</p>
<p>There has been a lot of coverage on the anticipated advance of quantum computers: the boon they will bring to medicine, science, and chemistry; and the curse on IT security, with Shor’s algorithm sounding the death knell for traditional classic asymmetric cryptography, which underpins the security for most of what we do on the internet. For this blog post I decided to focus on some of the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) related activities that are going on as we speak, under-the-hood. I’m talking specifically about the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), who are tasked with preparing the public internet for a post-quantum world, figuring out how to retool and migrate the protocols and standards built on classical algorithms that we rely on extensively today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: &nbsp;NIST forms the nucleus of the PQC migration, surrounded by a shell of other standards bodies</p>
<p>First to provide a bit of context, it is worth reviewing where the IETF fits in to the PQC story. At the nucleus of figure 1 is National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Their ongoing competition tasked with identifying and standardizing on the PQC primitives has been well-documented. You might already be au fait with some of the short-listed PQC algorithms including SPHINCS+, CRYSTALS-Dilithium and CRYSTALS-Kyber, as well as XMSS and LMS, which are already NIST standards [SP 800-208]. The output of the NIST’s work will then be used by a shell of orbiting standards bodies such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), EMVCo, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Wi-Fi Alliance®.</p>
<p>Outside of the NIST’s area of responsibility, updating the protocols and technologies that rely on cryptography deemed vulnerable to quantum attacks falls to each of the respective standards bodies to make them ready for a post-quantum world.</p>
<p>Consider the IETF, who own the specifications for many of the internet’s cryptographic and security protocols:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: Some of the security protocols and standards maintained by the IETF</p>
<p>You might not recognize all of these protocols, but you should be at least vaguely familiar with TLS, SSH, HTTPS, TCP/IP, and DNSSEC, fundamental building blocks for internet communication and security. Fortunately, there is an opportunity to reuse and recycle. The protocols highlighted below are those that need to be retooled with PQC algorithms. The remaining protocols actually don’t need updating. They get their cryptography for free by embedding another PQ-safe protocol. So the list is perhaps less daunting than it first appears but still some non-trivial work lies ahead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3: IETF security protocols and standards with those requiring PQC retooling highlighted</p>
<p>A couple of my Entrust colleagues, Mike Ounsworth and John Gray, are fully embedded in the IETF Working Groups. They have been working for the past 5 years on defining the standards for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs/">composite digital certificates</a>, utilizing a combination of classical and PQ cryptography. Last time I counted they have authored or co-authored 13 papers that will eventually define and specify how communication protocols operate in a post-quantum world – pretty cool stuff! They reported back from their recent IETF 116 session in Tokyo/Yokohama, Japan, where the general MO is “Hurry up and wait.” In essence it means get drafts of these protocols started, then put them in a holding pattern until final NIST specs for CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, SPHINCS+, and CRYSTALS-KYBER are standardized. As I chatted with my colleagues, one of the things that was clear is their appreciation for just how well-crafted and versatile the classical algorithms and APIs were. I’m referring to those which came from the pioneers of modern-day cryptography such as public key cryptography defined in the ’70s by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA), Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle, and others. I imagine it is the equivalent of modern-day car designers gazing under the hood of a vintage E-Type Jaguar or Ferrari in appreciation of its design, power, and finesse. We’re talking about the nuts and bolts of cryptographic algorithms and APIs here: key transport, key agreement, key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), double ratchets, and 0.5 (round-time trips) RTTs! What the IETF working groups are finding is that some of the classic algorithm and mechanism properties are very hard to retain when migrating to PQC equivalents. It is proving challenging even for some of the sharpest minds in the industry. However, in a slow and steady pace they are making good progress.</p>
<p>One of the initiatives I learned about from Entrust’s participation in IETF 116 was our support for the new IETF PQUIP (Post-Quantum Use In Protocols) working group. The name PQUIP, a post-quantum spin on the word “equip” was actually coined by my colleague Mike Ounsworth. The PQUIP group was founded in Jan 2023 and recently had its first meeting at IETF 116. The PQUIP charter is here: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/pquip/about/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/pquip/about/</a> I know my Entrust colleagues are super proud to be founding and active members of this group focused on bringing the entire internet community together to share knowledge and best practices for how to integrate the new PQC algorithms into the myriad IT security protocols that we rely on every day. This is about mathematicians, subject matter experts, software engineers, and cryptographers coming together across academia and industry to pave the way for a smooth transition to PQ. Architecting the largest cryptographic migration that humanity has ever done is no small feat! It involves juggling security against ease-of-deployment for IT admins through often politics-ridden public discussion groups while under a tight and unforgiving deadline!</p>
<p>So far, the primary output of PQUIP is this document cataloging all of the PQC efforts across the IETF. Check out <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-pquip/state-of-protocols-and-pqc">https://github.com/ietf-wg-pquip/state-of-protocols-and-pqc</a> to see how much design work is involved. Also note the listing at the bottom “Security Area protocols with no PQC-specific action needed” referring to the protocols that will get PQC for free.</p>
<p>Eminent mathematician and PQC academic Michele Mosca when asked for his advice to enterprises on preparing for PQ said “make this about lifecycle management not crisis management.” I think it is fair to say that the IETF working groups are implementing those wise words, figuring out the tricky low-level stuff while we have time. I look forward to seeing the output of their good work in the coming months and years.</p>

<p>When a critical asset like an expensive piece of machinery or infrastructure breaks unexpectedly, it affects customers and can cost companies millions. To be successful, businesses need to have clear, real-time visibility into the condition of their assets and a plan to keep them running smoothly and make repairs quickly when things break. Enterprises are constantly looking for new ways to optimize performance, increase reliability and extend asset lifespans—all without adding unnecessary costs.</p>



<p>This is why asset reliability is such a critical component of business strategy. Before we dive into it, let’s take a look at some relevant terms.</p>



 What is an asset? 



<p>The term “asset” can refer to both physical and non-physical items that companies own and use to create value. Examples of physical assets include machinery, factories, office supplies, production plants, assembly lines, vehicle fleets, buildings and civil infrastructures. Examples of non-physical assets include software, intellectual property, trademarks and patents.</p>



 What is asset reliability? 



<p>Asset reliability is the ability of an asset to perform under certain conditions over a specified period without breaking down. To be considered “reliable,” an asset asset must perform at a certain level and comply with all regulatory requirements surrounding its operation.</p>



 The difference between asset reliability and asset availability 



<p>The terms asset reliability and asset availability are easy to confuse, but there are several key differences worth noting. First, availability measures the operational capacity of an asset over time. In other words, how long can a piece of equipment perform the tasks associated with its operation successfully. Reliability, on the other hand, refers to an asset’s ability to function without downtime or disruption under certain conditions. An asset is only deemed “reliable” when it operates without unexpected shutdowns in order to perform necessary repairs.</p>



<p>While reliability and availability are both measured in percentages, it’s possible—even likely—that these percentages will differ even when referring to the same piece of equipment. For example, a piece of equipment operating at 100% reliability might only be 90% available if 10% of the time was used to perform critical, planned maintenance necessary to keep it running.</p>



 How does asset reliability work? 



<p>In order to take a proactive approach to asset reliability, maintenance managers rely on two widely used metrics: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/preventive-maintenance-vs-predictive-maintenance/">mean time between failure, (MTBF)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mttr">mean time to repair (MTTR)</a>. Both KPIs help predict how assets will perform and assist managers in planning <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/preventive-maintenance-vs-predictive-maintenance/">preventive and predictive maintenance</a>. First, let’s look at MTBF and MTTR.</p>



 Mean time between failure (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) 



<p>Both MTBF and MTBR can be calculated using simple mathematical formulas. Here’s the formula technicians use to calculate MTBF:&nbsp;</p>



<p>MTBF = Total operating time / Number of failures in a specific time period</p>



<p>For example, if a piece of equipment is used for 20,000 hours and fails 5 times during that period, its MTBF would be 20,000 hours / 5 failures = 4,000 hours. In other words, this equipment can be expected to fail every 4,000 hours. Armed with this information, operators can plan maintenance activities to ensure equipment doesn’t break down unexpectedly, resulting in costly downtime.</p>



<p>While knowing an asset’s MTBF is critical to keeping it performing at peak levels, it doesn’t help operators determine how much time they will need to repair it. This is where MTTR comes in. To calculate MTTR, operators first need to know how much time it takes to perform the following tasks on an asset:</p>



 
 Notify asset maintenance teams 



 Let the broken equipment cool before it can be worked on 



 Perform repairs and reassemble any necessary items 



 Test the equipment thoroughly before restarting production 
 



<p>Here’s the mathematical formula operators use to calculate MTTR:</p>



<p>MTTR = Total downtime / Total number of failures over a specific time</p>



<p>For example, if over the course of a year, a system failed 10 times, resulting in 20 total hours of downtime, its MTTR would be: 20 hours / 10 repairs = 2 hours. In other words, it takes, on average, 2 hours to repair this piece of equipment each time it breaks.</p>



<p>Like MTBF, MTTR is used to determine asset reliability and, more specifically, to allow operators to measure the efficiency of their maintenance programs and to make adjustments where necessary.</p>



 Preventive and predictive maintenance 



<p>Both preventive and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-maintenance">predictive maintenance</a> are maintenance strategies used by business leaders to increase asset reliability.</p>



<p>Preventive maintenance relies on condition monitoring to help managers strategically plan for asset repairs and downtime in a way that minimizes the impact to the overall business. Predictive maintenance takes the maintenance capacity of preventive maintenance one step further. Sensors collect data in real-time that is then fed into an enterprise asset management (EAM) or computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), where AI-enhanced data analysis tools and processes like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> spot issues and help resolve them. This information is then used to build predictive models of an asset’s performance over time and help spot potential problems before they arise.</p>



<p>One of the ways maintenance managers refine and improve predictive analytics to increase asset reliability is through the creation of a digital twin.</p>



<p>Digital twin technology</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin">Digi</a>tal twin technology allows for the creation of a virtual representation of an asset that spans the entire asset lifecycle and is subject to the same conditions as the real asset. Digital twins use real-time data, simulations and machine learning to aid decision-makers in the management of their most critical assets.</p>



<p>Digital twins can be created for assets as exotic as manned-spacecraft or as common as a wind turbine. As in predictive analytics, sensors connected to the physical object collect data from the real world that is then mapped onto a virtual model. By monitoring the asset’s digital twin, managers can spot crucial insights into how the asset is reacting to its environment and develop strategies to improve its reliability.</p>



 Asset performance management 



<p>Business leaders know how important it is to have a deep understanding of when their assets are likely to fail so they can take immediate action to reduce risk to overall business operations. Asset performance management, or APM, helps decision-makers enhance asset management insights with automation, analytics and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> capabilities. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Through AI-powered remote monitoring, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/root-cause-analysis">root-cause analysis,</a> Failure Mode Analysis (FMEA), computer vision and predictive maintenance, APM enables the modern enterprise to reduce unplanned repair work, manage risk, extend asset lifecycles and increase profitability.</p>



<p>Enterprise asset management (EAM) and CMMS</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-asset-management">Enterprise asset management (EAM)</a> is an asset management system that combines software and services to help organizations maintain, control and optimize the quality of operational assets throughout their lifecycles. With the amount of data being generated via IoT, maintenance managers are relying more and more on management software and AI-enhanced data analysis to help them make more informed decisions. The goal of EAM is always to improve equipment reliability, increase productive uptime and reduce operational costs.</p>



<p>Many EAM initiatives work in tandem with a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-cmms">computerized maintenance management system (CMMS)</a> to help maintenance departments centralize vital asset information. A CMMS tells maintenance managers where an asset is, what kind of services or repairs it requires and who should perform them. A strong CMMS can enhance maintenance planning by making the information about an asset immediately accessible and auditable.</p>



<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgmsE4RQ61Q&amp;ab_channel=IBMTechnology">What are the different types of asset management?</a>



 Why is asset reliability important? 



<p>Asset reliability offers modern enterprises peace of mind when it comes to their most valuable resources. By deploying the most cutting-edge technologies available, coupled with rigorous maintenance management strategies and adherence to key metrics like MTBF and MTTR, enterprises can reduce costs, increase asset dependability and maximize their return on investment (ROI) in their most valuable assets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits of strong asset reliability include the following:</p>



 
 Increased uptime: Having good asset reliability means top-performing assets run at peak levels for longer without increasing their risk of failure. By performing preventive and predictive maintenance as part of an overall maintenance strategy, businesses can reduce the number and frequency of breakdowns. &nbsp; 



 Reduced costs: When asset reliability improves, maintenance labor, inventory, and working capital costs go down—it’s that simple. Reliability programs help managers plan strategically for downtime and perform repairs only when the impact on business continuity can be minimized. 



 Improved worker safety: Another benefit of asset reliability is the improvement of workplace conditions for maintenance workers. By reducing the likelihood of equipment failures, workplaces avoid accidents and injuries associated with unexpected equipment failures. 



 Smarter asset management: The continuous monitoring of assets through an EAM or APM approach to improving asset reliability generates insights into current and future (expected) asset states that improve the decision-making capabilities of maintenance managers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>As the pace of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> accelerates in the manufacturing and engineering industries, two concepts have gained significant traction: digital twins and digital threads. Both concepts refer to digital representations of physical objects, but they serve different purposes and offer companies unique advantages. Here, we will compare digital twins and digital threads, and discuss potential use cases and benefits.</p>



 What are digital twins? 



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin">digital twin</a> is a digital replica of a physical object or system, complete with all the design and operational data of the physical object, including geometry, performance data and behavior models. The purpose of a digital twin is to simulate the behavior of equipment in real-time, allowing engineers and operators to monitor performance and identify system issues/anomalies.</p>



<p>Digital twin technology uses Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> and simulation software to collect product data and generate accurate models. Teams can then use the models to predict maintenance needs, simulate changes to the system and optimize processes (e.g., safety protocols, reporting procedures, manufacturing processes, etc.).</p>



<p>For example, a digital twin of a wind turbine can simulate the impact of changing wind speed and direction on the turbine’s performance, helping operators make informed decisions about maintenance and energy production.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-digital-twins-optimize-the-performance-of-your-assets-in-a-sustainable-way/">Explore how digital twins can optimize the performance of your assets in a sustainable way</a>



 What is a digital thread? 



<p>A digital thread is a digital representation of a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/systems-engineering">product’s lifecycle</a>, from design to manufacturing to maintenance and beyond, providing a seamless flow of data that connects all aspects of the lifecycle. The purpose of a digital thread is to provide a complete and transparent view of manufacturing systems, enabling efficient collaboration and decision-making across all stages of the process.</p>



<p>Digital threads use a variety of technologies, including computer-aided design (CAD) software, product lifecycle management (PLM) systems and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> sensors, to collect and share data across <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workflow">workflows</a>. Digital thread technology optimizes traceability, providing a way to track asset progress and ensure that all stakeholders are on the same page throughout the production process. For example, aerospace companies can create a digital thread to help assemble aircraft with digital engineering. Production teams utilize 3D-model-based systems to guarantee that aircraft are built exactly to engineering specifications and rely on the digital thread to track progress and identify issues and inefficiencies during production.</p>



 What distinguishes digital twins from digital threads? 



<p>Both digital twins and digital threads utilize virtual representations of real-world assets and processes, but they offer distinct capabilities.</p>



 Scale 



<p>Digital twins are scalable, but only to a point. Digital twin technology collects real-time data from a single source/asset. And although a digital twin concept can connect to other twins to simulate entire digital environments, they are most useful in evaluating a specific production environment. A digital thread concept, on the other hand, is limitlessly scalable. Digital threads can connect to (almost) any other enterprise system, including digital twins.</p>



<p>As such, digital thread technology may be best suited for operations and/or circumstances where data must be gathered from an array of departments, devices, systems and processes. On the contrary, digital twins will better serve operations that rely primarily on repetitive machine processes within a specific production environment.</p>



 Data centralization 



<p>Both digital twins and digital threads centralize data to some extent. Both collect comprehensive sensor data and aggregate and store that data in an easily accessible data hub. However, digital threads enable teams to take data from digital twins and other sources and centralize the data flow across departments and production silos so that the entire company can access the same information. Data attached to a digital thread also tends to be more consistently accurate, because the automation features of a digital thread concept eliminate the need to manually transmit information between departments and workflows.</p>



 Benefits of digital twins vs. digital thread 



<p>Digital twins and digital threads help organizations increase system efficiency, reduce production costs, improve product design and limit system downtime. However, the impact of each technology will vary depending on manufacturer needs.</p>



<p>Digital twins allow manufacturers to do the following:</p>



 
 Engage in responsive monitoring in real time 



 Conduct proactive risk assessments and utilize predictive troubleshooting for organizational assets 



 Accelerate innovation using digital models and digital mirroring 
 



<p>Digital threads help manufacturers in the following ways:</p>



 
 Build more agile operations by facilitating a continuous, synchronized data flow 



 Increase interdepartmental collaboration across assets and systems 



 Optimize connectivity between manufacturing and engineering processes 



 Streamline product development to reduce production time and get products to market faster 



 Ensure regulatory compliance by tracking the entire product lifecycle, including design decisions, engineering changes and maintenance records 
 



 Leverage IBM Maximo Application Suite for your digital transformation

<p>Manufacturing has undergone a major <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> in the last few years, with technological advancements, evolving consumer demands and the COVID-19 pandemic serving as major catalysts for change. To maintain their competitiveness and overcome today’s challenges, manufacturers have had to make agility and adaptability top priorities.</p>



<p>Here, we’ll discuss the major manufacturing trends that will change the industry in the coming year.</p>



 1. Digitalization and Industry 4.0 



<p>Digitalization has had a profound impact on the manufacturing sector, enabling businesses to optimize processes, improve quality and reduce costs. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0">Industry 4.0</a>—also known as the fourth industrial revolution—is the latest phase of the manufacturing industry’s digital transformation. It integrates advanced technologies—like the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things</a> (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a>—into an organization’s existing manufacturing processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Industry 4.0 enables manufacturers to conduct real-time data collection and analysis for vast amounts of data, providing them valuable insights into their operations.</p>



<p>It also helps organizations more easily manage and maintain equipment, utilizing cloud storage and facilitating communication between enabled equipment to create more flexible, agile manufacturing systems that can adapt quickly to changes in demand.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/KRMVA6XW">IDG infographic to understand how you can unlock Industry 4.0 with an asset lifecycle management cloud</a>



 2. Artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp; 



<p>One of the most significant benefits of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> in manufacturing is its ability to analyze vast amounts of data in real-time. With Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices and sensors collecting data from machines, equipment and production lines, AI algorithms can quickly process and analyze data to identify patterns and trends, helping manufacturers understand how production processes are performing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies can also use AI to identify anomalies and equipment defects. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">Machine learning</a> algorithms, for instance, can be trained to identify patterns in the data and manage decision-making based on those patterns, allowing manufacturers to catch quality issues early in the production process.</p>



<p>Furthermore, AI can help manufacturers implement <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-maintenance">predictive maintenance</a> systems and processes, streamline supply chain management, and identify and address workplace safety hazards proactively.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/harnessing-the-power-of-data-and-ai-to-operationalize-sustainability/">How can you harness the power of AI to operationalize sustainability?</a>



 3. 3D printing 



<p>3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a rapidly growing technology that has changed the way companies design, prototype and manufacture products. In smart factories, 3D printing is a popular tool for producing complex parts and components quickly and precisely.</p>



<p>Traditional manufacturing processes, like injection molding, can be limited by the complexity of a prototype’s part geometry, and they may require multiple steps and operations to produce. With 3D printing, manufacturers can produce complex geometries in a single step, reducing manufacturing time and costs.</p>



<p>Additive manufacturing is particularly useful in industries such as aerospace, automotive and healthcare, where complex parts and components are required. This technology also enables manufacturers to produce spare parts on-demand, reducing the need for large inventories and improving supply chain efficiency.</p>



 4. Robotics and automation 



<p>Robotics and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> have been transforming manufacturing for years now, and this trend is only expected to continue. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/rpa">Robotic process automation</a> has been a key driver of smart manufacturing, with robots taking on repetitive and/or dangerous tasks like assembly, welding and material handling.</p>



<p>Robotics technology can perform repetitive tasks faster and with a much higher degree of accuracy and precision than human workers, improving product quality and reducing defects. Manufacturers can also integrate robotics with Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors and big data analytics to create a more flexible and responsive production environment.</p>



<p>Ultimately, robotic automation can improve system efficiency, reduce errors, decrease equipment downtime and increase worker safety in manufacturing operations. As an added benefit, robots can work around the clock, providing manufacturers with the ability to operate 24/7 and significantly increasing productivity.</p>



 5. Sustainable manufacturing 



<p>Manufacturing processes often require large amounts of energy and water and can often produce harmful waste and other by-products, so sustainability initiatives are becoming an increasingly important factor in modern manufacturing. Today’s consumers are more environmentally conscious than ever before, and governments continue to implement regulations to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment. As a result, manufacturers are under pressure to mitigate the impacts of climate change by pushing for carbon neutrality and minimizing their carbon footprints.</p>



<p>Companies engaging in sustainable manufacturing aim to reduce waste, conserve resources and minimize the use of harmful substances by using renewable energy sources, adopting circular economy principles and implementing eco-friendly production processes.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/sustainable-operations-one-asset-at-a-time/">Find out how you can create more sustainable operations</a>



 6. Servitization 



<p>Servitization is a business model that involves moving from selling products to providing services. In the manufacturing industry, servitization involves offering after-sales services—such as maintenance, repair and upgrades—to customers. This model can help manufacturers to build stronger relationships with customers, increase customer loyalty and generate recurring revenue streams.&nbsp; Servitization also enables manufacturers to differentiate themselves from competitors by offering value-added services that enhance the customer experience. Furthermore, manufacturers can gain valuable insights into their customers’ needs and preferences, which can inform product development and improve customer satisfaction.</p>



 7. Reshoring&nbsp; 



<p>Reshoring is the process of bringing manufacturing operations back to their home country from overseas locations. This trend has gained momentum in recent years due to labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical risks and rising labor costs in overseas locations. Reshoring can provide several benefits for manufacturing companies, including reduced transportation costs, improved quality control and increased flexibility. Additionally, reshoring can help to create new jobs and support local economies.</p>



 8. Extended reality 



<p>Extended reality (XR) refers to technologies that merge the physical and digital worlds; for example, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). One of the chief benefits of XR is its ability to improve employee training and education and address worker skills gaps. XR technologies can help manufacturers create immersive training simulations that help employees learn new skills and procedures in a controlled environment. As a result, workers get real-time information and guidance, and companies get more productivity and fewer errors.</p>



<p>On the consumer side, XR can enhance the customer experience by providing virtual product demonstrations and visualizations. It can also help manufacturers design and develop better products for customers since designers can visualize and test products in a virtual environment before they are mass-produced and sent to market.</p>



 9. Advanced materials 



<p>As manufacturing processes have advanced, so too have manufacturing materials. Advanced materials like composites, ceramics and nanomaterials are becoming the industry norm, as these materials offer increased strength and durability and improved thermal properties when compared to traditional raw materials. Advanced materials have a variety of potential applications, including aerospace, automotive and healthcare manufacturing. Composite materials, for instance, are helping manufacturers produce lightweight and fuel-efficient aircraft, while nanomaterials are being used to develop new medical treatments.</p>



 10. Digital twins 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin">Digital twins</a> have become an increasingly popular concept in the world of smart manufacturing. A digital twin—a virtual replica of a physical object or system, equipped with sensors and connected to the internet—can collect data and provide real-time performance insights. In smart factories, digital twins are used to monitor and optimize the performance of manufacturing processes, machines and equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By collecting sensor data from manufacturing equipment, digital twins can detect anomalies, identify potential problems, improve forecasting capabilities and provide insights into how to optimize production processes. Manufacturers can also use digital twins to simulate scenarios and test configurations before implementing them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As consumers, we’re increasingly attracted to websites that ask for less information, not more. Imagine your hair trimmer is not doing the job it used to do when it was brand new. Should you buy a new one? Of course not, let’s get a blade replacement instead. Often, such parts are not available from your usual ecommerce sites. After searching and comparing prices through websites, you find a good deal on an online shop. However, you’ve never heard of this shop before, but it looks trustworthy. Once the part is added to your basket, you proceed to the checkout and what you see makes you cringe: a long form that asks not only for your name, email and postal address — which would be reasonable—but also age, gender, phone number, marital status, and date of birth as mandatory fields.</p>
<p>The result is simple: you close that browser tab and go to another shop. These days, increasingly more online businesses realise that the opposite is more likely to result in a sale: they ask for as little data as possible.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, there is a solution that not only removes the user’s pain but also provides more in-depth customer analytics over time. Its name? Progressive profiling.</p>
 What is progressive profiling? 
<p>Progressive profiling is a technique in which a business collects users’ data incrementally, during different touchpoints of the customer’s journey. The goal is to build and constantly update a profile for every user, to enable a customised user experience. Let’s bear in mind that the customer journey starts from the first visit (unknown, anonymous user), next becoming a customer, continuing to upselling, and only ending if the user account is deleted.</p>
<p>To convert and retain customers, a company aims to go from knowing almost nothing about the user, to building a detailed user profile. All this can be accomplished without violating the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or other similar stringent regulations.</p>
<p>Building (and maintaining) a user profile takes several steps, which may include forms to download an asset, user registration, questions with an incentive, surveys, etc.</p>
<p></p>
 Benefits of progressive profiling 
<p>Progressive profiling offers benefits for both users and companies. Let’s review the strongest.</p>
 
 Improved user experience
 
 Reduced customer frustrations. Asking users for their data all at once is not only time-consuming but perceived as aggressive by most people. I think all of us has had such an experience, got annoyed and decided not to come back to that service. By asking for information bit by bit, and with the right incentive in place, users will be much more willing to provide additional information. 
 Improve the onboarding process. If a visitor decides to create a user account for your service, you will have some of their data already available, so instead of asking again you can shorten the user registration. Alternatively, after account setup, you can ask a couple of questions to enrich that user profile. But keep those questions optional so they don’t feel obliged to share that data with you. 
 Personalise the buyer’s journey. As a result of building a good user profile, your company will be able to personalise every step of the customer journey. 
 
 
 Increased security and data protection
 
 Minimise the impact of a potential data breach. In the unfortunate event of a data breach, the less data a company has in its data repository, the smaller the damage. Don’t collect data you don’t need, and progressive profiling helps you achieve that from the start. 
 Be an ally for security awareness. Another reason people don’t like putting information in forms is because they are becoming more aware that the data can be misused. Show that your company is careful about its customers’ personal data. 
 
 
 Marketing benefits
 
 Helps update and strengthen user profiles. Typically, a user profile is created at the time a person registers for a service. Within months, this data can become outdated. What if your company decides to launch a great campaign to send a gift or greetings card to your users, only to realise that more than half of your users’ postal addresses are empty, wrongly typed, or outdated? Well, not many of your customers will be delighted as you expected. Nobody wants to miss out on great experiences. 
 Increased conversions. By collecting only information that is necessary and relevant to the customer experience at hand, the customers will be less likely to abandon your form or page and instead press the Submit button. 
 
 
 
 Keep it clear and simple 
<p>When presenting requests for more information, always present the reason for collecting the additional information in terms of the user benefits. Provide easy access to the relevant data processing and privacy policies.</p>
<p>Where possible, make the data collection as quick and easy as possible, such as structuring questions in a yes or no format, or a choice of 1 to 3 options for quick selection.</p>
 Why CIAM is better than marketing tools for progressive profiling 
<p>Most marketers talk about progressive profiling as merely a marketing topic and preach that the magic solution is buying an advanced marketing tool. From a marketing tools perspective, progressive profiling is often applied to leads, from a person’s first interaction through to becoming a customer. In this marketing world, it’s mostly about filling data in forms, sometimes surveys, in which the customers enter more personal data themselves. The purpose is to convert a form visitor to lead to customer. Progressive profiling is clearly advertised as an advanced feature in marketing tools, available only in premium plans or the exclusive products in the portfolio.</p>
<p>But is progressive profiling something that can be achieved with just a marketing tool? Not really. For progressive profiling to become magic, it needs a few spells of Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM).</p>
<p>From a CIAM systems perspective, progressive profiling is applied to registered users who can already log in to one or many services. A login session is the key here. Those users can be leads or converted customers.</p>
 Some advantages of using a CIAM solution for user profiling: 
 
 Marketing tools can’t use attributes from an identity provider. As the user is never authenticated, data must always be entered by the user themselves. Instead, an authenticated user brings to the relying party (the service) at least a few attributes from the identity provider: first name, surname, email, country etc. The list depends on how the identity provider’s system administrator has configured its attribute release policies. 
 You can use a user verification tool to improve the accuracy of a user’s data. If users enter personal attributes for themselves, how do we know if such data is accurate? When users authenticate with a high level of assurance method such as a national e-id, your service can add new verified attributes and correct inaccurate data. 
 Profile differently based on the user’s level of assurance. If more than one authentication method is enabled in the login pages, the service can trigger different questions if the user is authenticated by social media or a bank-based authenticator app. 
 Follow through devices. Marketing tools cannot add more data to the same user’s profile if this person has logged in with different devices. What if the user frequently switches between a laptop, tablet, mobile phone? The cookies are set up in the browser per device. Instead, an authenticated user will be the same regardless of which device is used. Your service can trigger progressive profiling at any touchpoints, whenever the right time comes. 
 
 Can marketing and CIAM join forces? 
<p>If at the time the user creates an account, this person already exists as a lead in the marketing automation platform (or mail automation), the user registration workflow – which is powered by the CIAM system — can make a backend call to synchronise the identity with the already collected data. With the user’s permission, it is also possible to link the new account to an existing browser history on a device, even if created before user registration or a logged in session. This allows wider insight into the same user’s behaviour across all their devices.</p>
<p>All in all, progressive profiling is a powerful technique that helps companies in both their business and security goals. The best way of achieving progressive profiling is putting CIAM into the equation.

<p>The Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) enables the creation of an open identity infrastructure that allows parachain projects to delegate identity management to other parachains that provide identity solutions. As DIP can be easily integrated into systems that can communicate via XCM (the cross-consensus message format), this also extends beyond the Polkadot ecosystem.</p> The Decentralized Identity&nbsp;Provider <p>With increasing regulation worldwide, a reliable and trustworthy identity component is becoming even more critical.</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) protocol is a decentralized alternative to OpenID — an industry-standard protocol that allows the delegation of user’s identity management and verification to trusted third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>DIP allows any blockchain that supports XCM (cross-consensus messages) to delegate users’ identity management and verification to one or more third-party identity providers, such as KILT Protocol.</p><p>As part of the integration process, an XCM channel would be opened between the integrating parachain and the identity provider, allowing the parachain to verify identities existing on that provider. In this way, for example, an identity built on KILT can also be used across other chains that choose to use KILT as their identity provider.</p><p>In other words, a user with a KILT identity can use this identity to log into any dapp and authenticate transactions on any parachain that integrates DIP — for example, they could use the same identity across Astar, Frequency, Zeitgeist, etc.</p> DIP Actors <p>DIP has three&nbsp;roles:</p>  The identity provider: A blockchain that has an identity system in place and makes it available for other chains to use, for example, KILT Protocol.  The identity relying party: A blockchain that has chosen to delegate identity management to the provider.  The user: An entity that has an identity on the provider chain and wants to use it on other chains without setting up a new identity on each of&nbsp;them.   The Tech <p>The following components are currently available for integration to enable cross-chain decentralized digital identities:</p>  A pallet for deployment on identity providers. The pallet allows entities on these systems to bridge identities of given subjects to a destination, and manages the entire XCM communication with that destination.  A pallet for deployment on identity relying parties. The pallet provides other pallets in the runtime with a DIP origin and manages the entire XCM communication with the identity providers. The DIP origin contains identity provider-specific information. For example, in KILT this includes DID signature verification.  Support crates, suitable for use within an identity relying party’s runtime, including common type and trait definitions.  <p>DIP integrates with existing runtimes with minimal changes. This&nbsp;means:</p>  The fee model of the relying party remains unchanged.  The identity subject only needs a wallet to generate a signature and does not necessarily need to submit the transaction and pay the fees (subject to specifications of the relying party / provider)  The relying party only needs to perform per-transaction origin verification to have access to the identity of the submitter, as defined by the identity provider.   Why Integrate KILT as an Identity Provider? <p>KILT provides practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers.</p><p>Based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C standards</a>, identity on KILT begins with a unique <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/decentralized-identifiers">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> generated by the user on their device and anchored to the KILT blockchain. This DID can be customized with a user-friendly web3name that provides a 1:1 link to the DID. <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> from trusted entities can then be added to the DID, building the identity. These credentials are stored on the user’s device in their wallet, under their control. They decide who to share them with, and how much information they want to share (selective disclosure).</p><p>For a parachain, integrating DIP with KILT results&nbsp;in:</p>  Less effort: The parachain doesn’t have to build and maintain its own identity solution as identity management and verification is handled by&nbsp;KILT.  Focus: Parachains can focus on what they do best without having to worry about identities.  Risk mitigation: The parachain doesn’t have the risks stemming from managing and storing users’ identities.  Access to the KILT user base: Parachains can gain access to the identity information graph composed of all existing KILT’s&nbsp;users.  <p>For builders and users, additional KILT benefits&nbsp;include:</p>  Portable identities: The parachain users just need to create and maintain a single identity on KILT and use it on all supporting chains.  Support for unique <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/web3names/">web3names</a>. Enabling cross-chain identity means that these web3names are usable anywhere they are supported.  Support for <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/develop/sdk/cookbook/account_linking/account-link">cross-chain account linking</a>. These accounts have explicitly been linked to the DID by the DID subject. Polkadot and Ethereum are currently supported, with more chains&nbsp;planned.  Support for verifiable credentials and service endpoints will be included in the next&nbsp;phases.   OpenID <p><a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a> has become the industry standard, with Facebook, Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Auth0 as the most well-known providers, making OpenID very centralized.</p><p>In addition to providing a decentralized alternative to OpenID, DIP can potentially also be used in conjunction with OpenID in future iterations: the OpenID community is already pushing for the integration of W3C DIDs and verifiable credentials, and are working on the specifications.</p><p>If integrated, any website that relies on OpenID as the authentication method could start accepting users that own a DID and present requested credentials.</p><p>All the building components to implement these features are already available and ready to use in the KILT&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>This development is a huge milestone for the intersection between Web2 and Web3, moving blockchain and decentralized identity into the real world and giving control of identity back to the person it belongs&nbsp;to!</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driver’s license) to the digital world, while keeping data private and in possession of its&nbsp;owner.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/one-identity-across-all-parachains-using-kilt-infrastructure-c87b1115fe64">One Identity Across All Parachains Using KILT Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Digital-first, but not digital only! This is what we found consumers prefer based on a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/us-consumers-prefer-seamless-and-fully-integrated-payment-experiences-new-entrust-survey-reveals">recent survey</a> of 1,000 consumers in the United States.</p>
<p>This survey (<a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic">see this infographic</a>) generated unique insights around the state of the American consumer, including their preferred ways to pay and which digital banking innovations excite them the most.</p>
<p>We learned that consumers ask for digital experiences, but not exclusively digital: Indeed, physical cards are still widely utilized and will remain a valuable tool for for issuers looking to provide a complete payments experience.</p>
<p>The survey showed that consumers continue to prefer physical payment cards in-store (69%), while 14% prefer using a digital wallet (Apple Pay or Google Pay, for example). Another 14% of respondents prefer paying with cash. Even so, digital payment experiences and digital touchpoints are very relevant to the consumer. Read <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/12/are-mobile-banking-and-payments-capabilities-the-answer-to-your-cardholder-acquisition-problem/">this article</a> on the importance of digital onboarding, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/from-app-to-branch-and-beyond-cardholder-acquisition-starts-with-choice/">this article</a> on how offering more payment choice will help push customer acquisition.</p>
<p>We see this preference for both digital and physical also when we have a look at interactions with the bank. We asked: How do you prefer to interact with your bank? Respondents told us that while they prefer to engage with their banks digitally (51.2% say they mainly use the mobile app, and 22.7% say that they prefer to interact via their banks website), nearly 20% of the surveyed people still listed in-person (or in a branch) as their preferred way of engagement. This shows us that banks must rise to the challenge and offer customers a variety of ways to interact to stay relevant and meet their needs.</p>
<p>Seamless, sustained payment enablement is key.</p>
<p>Net-net, consumers were loud and clear in their responses: Providing seamless, sustained payment enablement is key. And they want this not just when it comes to the types of cards that are offered, but also for every interaction with their bank, from account opening to onboarding, issuance, and payments.</p>
<p>We see a strong need for a complementary and complete card portfolio to answer the very diverse needs of cardholders and to cover all requested touchpoints along the banking and payment journey. Without these offerings in place, banks will find consumers are unwilling to compromise when it comes to finding a bank that will provide them with this flexibility, convenience, and efficiency.</p>

<p>A deeper understanding of biology has the potential to transform how healthcare is delivered, how people are screened, how clinical conditions are treated and monitored. The exponential growth of biomedical datasets over the recent years has resulted in the identification of a great number of molecular signatures vital for the realization of the personalized diagnosis and treatment era. We are at an inflection point, where we have witnessed 100,000-fold reduction in cost since the human genome was first sequenced in 2001. Today, the rate of data volume increase is similar to the rate of decrease in sequencing cost.</p>



<p>In fact, the sequencing cost per human genome has decreased from nearly $100,000 to just $200 in September 2022. High-throughput sequencing technology, notably next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, has led to a multiomics revolution. Processing terabytes or even petabytes of increasing complex omics data generated by NGS platforms has necessitated development of omics informatics.</p>



<p>Large-scale and complex datasets are increasingly being considered, resulting in some significant challenges:</p>



 
 Scale of data integration: It is projected that tens of millions of whole genomes will be sequenced and stored in the next five years. Most individual omics informatics tools and algorithms focus on solving a specific problem, which is usually part of a large project. This forces organizations to integrate multiple tools into a single pipeline to serve various goals. 



 Multimodal data: Omics data come from different — usually siloed — sources and in different formats, from raw sequences and signals to high-resolution images and mass spectrometry. 



 Analytical requirements: Once the data has been brought onto a single platform, and the tools have been assembled into a pipeline, computational techniques must be deployed to interpret data. 
 



<p>That’s where the next problem lies: omics data analysis and interpretation, including sequence alignment, assembly and variant discovery, are computationally intensive tasks required for interpretation and other downstream analysis and thus are of importance to guarantee overall accuracy. To solve this challenge, IBM Consulting is working with partners like Amazon Web Services (AWS), who are focused on providing a platform and tool set for processing omics data at in a secure, scalable and cost optimized manner.</p>



 What is Amazon Omics? 



<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/omics/">Amazon Omics</a> is a HIPAA eligible, GDPR compliant, purpose-built service to help healthcare and life science organizations and their software partners store, query, and analyze genomic, transcriptomic, and other omics data and then, generate insights from that data to improve health and advance scientific discoveries. Using Amazon Omics, clients are scaling multimodal and multiomic analyzes, generating insights from omics profile, images, medical claims and health records data processed simultaneously using other AWS services, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/healthlake/">Amazon HealthLake</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/">Amazon Comprehend Medical</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/medical/">Amazon Transcribe Medical</a>.</p>



 Accelerate genomic innovation 



<p>Some organizations continue to debate whether a cloud journey has been right for them, and others have yet to present a business case to their executive teams. However, healthcare and biopharma community tend to agree that pursuing population-level multimodal and multi-omic research is cost-prohibitive using the traditional data center infrastructure. Challenges include vast amounts of raw data, spiky nature of workloads, multitudes of tools used, strict security and compliance requirements, a need for cross industry collaboration and time to market.</p>



<p>With a low price per gigabase, ability to efficiently store, index and secure petabytes of raw sequence data, Amazon Omics becomes a no-brainer solution for storing heterogeneous omics data at scale, with a pay-as-you-go model.</p>



<p>The next step in the data journey is performing analytics on the ingested data and streamlining the output in interoperability-ready formats with reproducible and scalable pipelines. This purpose-built service offers automated analysis workflow, so that various types of data (beyond sequencing data, images, records, claims and more) can be brought in for analysis using&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/">Amazon Athena</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/">Amazon EMR</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">Amazon SageMaker</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/">Amazon QuickSight</a>.</p>



<p>Scientists can finally focus on science and let the undifferentiated heavy lifting be replaced by intelligent, scalable and purpose-built cloud services and solutions, <a>eliminating opportunities for error arising from manual or disparate data processing.</a>&nbsp;Lastly, the output of sequencing analysis are genomic variants presented as massive semi-structured files (Variant Call Files and Genomic Variant Call Files), which then are usually annotated (“assigned meaning”). To analyze annotated data at scale requires a query-ready data schema — another benefit that Amazon Omics provides — allowing to receive the output data as an <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/">Apache Iceberg Table</a>. This process alone saves hundreds of hours of productive time. With Amazon Omics awareness of file formats like FASTQ, BAM and CRAM, clients can focus on data, bring in workflow definition tools like WDL, letting Amazon Omics take care of the rest. Clients enjoy built-in, attribute-based controls to define fine-grained data access policies to enact effective governance, along with comprehensive logging and data provenance to track data accessibility. All of these features help with an accelerated time to market, along with developing a secure, scalable omics processing pipeline.</p>

<p>Imagine a symphony orchestra where each musician plays their own tune without listening to others. The result would be chaotic and dissonant, right? Similarly, in the business world, when decision-making happens in silos and planning processes are disconnected, it’s like having a group of individuals playing their own instruments without any coordination. The harmony is lost, and the organization becomes inefficient, misses opportunities, and struggles to keep up with the fast-paced market.</p>



<p>Integrated Business Planning (IBP) addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive framework that integrates strategic, operational and financial planning, analysis, and reporting to drive better business outcomes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A retail company experiences a sudden surge in online sales due to a viral social media campaign. Integrated planning incorporates supply chain planning, demand planning, and demand forecasts so the company can quickly assess the impact on inventory levels, supply chain logistics, production plans, and customer service capacity. By having real-time data at their fingertips, decision-makers can adjust their strategies, allocate resources accordingly, and capitalize on the unexpected spike in demand, ensuring customer satisfaction while maximizing revenue.<br>&nbsp;<br>This blog explores the significance of IBP in today’s modern business landscape and highlights its key benefits and implementation considerations.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics%20">Learn more about IBM Planning Analytics</a>



 Integrated business planning framework 



<p>Integrated Business Planning (IBP) is a holistic approach that integrates strategic planning, operational planning, and financial planning within an organization. IBP brings together various functions, including sales, marketing, finance, supply chain, human resources, IT and beyond to collaborate across business units and make informed decisions that drive overall business success.<br><br>The term ‘IBP’ was introduced by the management consulting firm Oliver Wight to describe an evolved version of the sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP process) they originally developed in the early 1980s.</p>



 Making up the IBP framework are six key pillars: 



 <br>1. Strategic planning 



<p>Integrated Business Planning starts with strategic planning. The management team defines the organization’s long-term goals and objectives. This includes analyzing market trends, competitive forces, and customer demands to identify opportunities and threats. Strategic planning sets the direction for the entire organization and establishes the foundation for subsequent planning roadmap.</p>



 2. Operational planning 



<p>Operational planning focuses on translating strategic goals into actionable plans at the operational level. This involves breaking down the strategic objectives into specific targets and initiatives that different departments and functions need to execute.</p>



<p><br>For example, the sales department might develop a plan to enter new markets or launch new products, while the supply chain department focuses on inventory optimization and ensuring efficient logistics. The key is to align operational plans with the broader strategic objectives to ensure consistency and coherence throughout the organization.</p>



 3. Financial planning 



<p>Financial planning ensures that the organization’s strategic and operational plans are financially viable. It involves developing detailed financial projections, including revenue forecasts, expense budgets, and cash flow forecasts. By integrating financial planning with strategic and operational planning, organizations can evaluate financial profitability, identify potential gaps or risks, and make necessary adjustments to achieve financial targets.</p>



 &nbsp;4. Cross-functional collaboration 



<p>A fundamental aspect of IBP is the collaboration and involvement of various functions and departments within the organization. Rather than working in isolation, departments such as sales, marketing, finance, supply chain, human resources, and IT come together to share information, align objectives, and make coordinated decisions.</p>



 5. Data integration and analytics 



<p>IBP relies on the integration of data from different sources and systems. This may involve consolidating data from enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, supply chain management systems, and other relevant sources. Advanced analytics and business intelligence tools are utilized to analyze and interpret the data, uncovering insights and trends that drive informed decision-making.</p>



 6. Continuous monitoring and performance management 



<p>Integrated Business Planning is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring of performance against plans and targets. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are established to measure progress and enable proactive management. Regular performance reviews and reporting enable organizations to identify deviations, take corrective actions, and continuously improve their planning processes.</p>



 What are the benefits of Integrated Business Planning process? 



<p>By integrating strategic, operational, and financial planning organizations can unlock the full potential of IBP and drive business success and achieve their goals.</p>



 Enhanced decision-making 



<p>IBP facilitates data-driven decision-making by providing real-time insights into various aspects of the business. By bringing together data from various departments, organizations can develop a holistic view of their operations, enabling them to make better-informed decisions.</p>



 Improved alignment 



<p>By aligning strategic objectives with operational plans and financial goals, IBP ensures that every department and employee is working towards a common vision. This alignment fosters synergy and drives cross-functional collaboration.</p>



 Agility and responsiveness 



<p>In the rapidly changing business landscape, agility is crucial. IBP allows organizations to quickly adapt to market shifts, demand fluctuations, and emerging opportunities. By continuously monitoring and adjusting plans, businesses can remain responsive and seize competitive advantages.</p>



 Optimal resource allocation 



<p>Integrated Business Planning enables organizations to optimize resource allocation across different functions. It helps identify bottlenecks, allocate resources effectively, and prioritize initiatives that yield the highest returns, leading to improved efficiency and cost savings.</p>



 Risk management 



<p>IBP facilitates proactive risk management by considering various scenarios and identifying potential risks and opportunities. By analyzing data and conducting what-if analyses, companies can develop contingency plans and mitigate risks before they materialize.</p>



 Essential steps for implementing Integrated Business Planning 



<p>Implementing an effective IBP process requires careful planning and execution that may require substantial effort and a change of management, but the rewards are well worth it. Here are some essential strategic steps to consider:</p>



 1. Establish leadership buy-in 



<p>Gain support from top-level executives who understand the value of Integrated Business Planning and can drive the necessary organizational changes. Leadership commitment, led by CFO, is crucial for successful implementation.</p>



 2. Foster cross-functional collaboration 



<p>Break down silos and encourage collaboration and open communication among different departments and functions. Create a culture that values collaboration, information sharing, and collective decision-making.</p>



 3. Integrate data and systems 



<p>Establish a robust system that integrates data from various sources and systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and supply chain management systems. Implementing advanced analytics and business intelligence tools can further enhance data analysis and decision-making capabilities.</p>



 4. Continuously monitor and adjust 



<p>Implement mechanisms to monitor performance against plans and targets. Regularly review key performance indicators (KPIs), conduct performance analysis, and generate timely reports and dashboards. Identify deviations, take corrective actions, and continuously improve the planning processes based on feedback and insights.</p>



 5. Embrace technology 



<p>Leverage advanced planning and analytics tools, such as Integrated Business Planning (IBP) software solutions, to streamline and automate the planning processes. These tools can provide comprehensive functionality, data integration capabilities, scenario planning and modeling, and real-time reporting.</p>



<p>Implementing an integrated business planning approach also requires a strong technological foundation. A robust technology infrastructure is essential to gather, integrate, analyze, and disseminate data effectively across the organization.</p>



 Integrated Business Planning software 



<p>From a tech perspective, organizations need advanced software solutions and systems that facilitate seamless data integration and collaboration to support IBP. Here are some key components that contribute to the success of integrated business planning:</p>



 1. Corporate performance management 



<p>A platform that serves as the backbone of integrated business planning by integrating data from different departments and functions. It enables a centralized repository of information and provides real-time visibility into the entire business.</p>



 2. Business intelligence (BI) tools 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-intelligence">Business intelligence</a> tools play a vital role in analyzing and visualizing integrated data from multiple sources. These tools provide comprehensive insights into key metrics and help identify trends, patterns, and opportunities. By leveraging BI tools, decision-makers can quickly evaluate financial performance, make data-driven business decisions and increase forecast accuracy.</p>



 3. Collaborative planning and forecasting solutions

<p>Slow productivity can be defined as working at a slower pace on fewer tasks at a time to increase workplace productivity and satisfaction. The trend toward slow productivity is for businesses and employees to rethink what productivity looks like and create an environment where quality of work is emphasized over quantity of work.</p>



<p>In his book <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/22/alex-soojung-kim-pang-interview-rest-why-you-get-more-done-when-you-work-less">Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less</a>, Silicon Valley consultant Alex Soojung-Kim Pang describes taking a working sabbatical where he got an enormous amount done but also experienced it as an extremely leisurely time. He says he realized the conventional thinking about our working hours and productivity is all wrong.</p>



<p>Slow productivity calls for a change in how we define productivity. It encourages companies and their workers to think differently about what it means to be productive, considering <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyblankson/2022/10/24/the-rise-of-the-slow-productivity-movement/?sh=3a1d93802c1a">questions</a> like:</p>



 
 In what work environment do you do your best work? 



 What practices support sustainable productivity (i.e., is it a sprint or a marathon)? 



 What kind of work are you doing, and does it demand speed or thought? 
 



 Origins of slow productivity 



<p>The phrase “slow productivity” was coined by Cal Newport, computer science professor and best-selling author of Digital Minimalism and A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication Overload. He also has a podcast called <a href="https://calnewport.com/podcasts/">Deep Questions with Cal Newport</a> on living and working deeply in what he calls an increasingly shallow world.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/office-space/its-time-to-embrace-slow-productivity">New Yorker</a>, Newport discusses the four-day workweek but says it’s only a partial solution to the real problem—overwork. Cutting back on the number of hours one person works without reducing their workload, he says, would only make the situation worse. He asserts that productivity should be about the quality of work, not the quantity.</p>



<p>Slow productivity is similar to other slow movements, such as the slow food movement of the 1980s, which also supported more mindfulness.</p>



 The productivity fallacy: The opposite of slow productivity 



<p>The productivity fallacy says that if we work hard or fast enough, we’ll have the time to do the things we most enjoy. But being busy doesn’t necessarily mean being effective. Keeping work days full of tasks and activities may keep employees too busy to explore their capabilities and creativity. Just staying busy can distract from finding purpose and meaning, and it can lead to burnout.</p>



<p>With support from the <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/beyond-burned-out">Harvard Business Review</a>, a survey of 1,500 respondents across 46 countries found that burnout is an enormous and global problem. Key findings included the following:</p>



 
 89% of respondents said their work life was getting worse. 



 85% said their well-being had declined. 



 56% said job demands had increased. 



 62% of the people struggling to manage their workloads reported they experienced burnout “often” or “extremely often” in the previous three months. 
 



<p>According to UC Berkeley and Deakin University researchers, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246546370_Making_a_significant_difference_with_burnout_interventions_Researcher_and_practitioner_collaboration">six primary causes of burnout</a> are work overload, lack of control, insufficient reward, breakdown of community, absence of fairness and value conflict. Burnout can also be a symptom of something else, such as employees having endless task lists that they’ll never finish.</p>



<p>Another hindrance to productivity is busywork. Working harder and faster on more tasks can keep employees perpetually busy and further away from achieving their goals. Work teams can move from busywork to productivity by setting fewer goals that are more attainable, focusing on one thing at a time, and eliminating distraction.</p>



 The benefits of slow productivity to businesses and employees 



<p>There are some easily recognizable benefits of slow productivity. People who work at a slower pace on fewer things at a time often experience better mental well-being and have more energy to achieve their goals. Streamlined, more intentional work can also give employees more time to socialize, self-reflect or create a better work-life balance. </p>



<p>Slow productivity benefits businesses, as well. Even if employees aren’t burned out, they aren’t always as productive as they should or could be. Slowing down can boost productivity and improve business outcomes by allowing more time to focus on what matters most to customers and other stakeholders.</p>



 How to put slow productivity into practice 



<p>“What else can we do in the face of endless tasks but begin to disengage?” asks science and business writer and educator Karla Starr. “When we know that the To-Do list is never going to get shorter, why&nbsp;would&nbsp;we naïvely summon extra motivation when we know that it’s not going to change our overall circumstances if the tasks just won’t stop?”</p>



<p>Some <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/01/1077302869/belgium-right-to-disconnect-government-workers">European countries</a> outlaw emails outside of work hours, such as Belgium’s new “right to disconnect” law. Employers can also advise employees to turn off notifications for email, Slack and other social media. Company policy may suggest they post a notice that they’re in “deep work” mode instead.</p>



<p>In his New Yorker article, Newport purports that if a four-day workweek became the federal standard, working less wouldn’t be a “disruptive experiment undertaken by a few start-ups.” Instead, he writes, it would be an option employers would have to justify not offering. And that justification might become harder to sustain as time marches on and the benefits of a shorter workweek become more apparent.</p>



<p>Managers can encourage slow productivity by keeping an employee’s workload at sustainable levels by prioritizing fewer, but higher-impact, projects.</p>



 The challenges of slow productivity 



<p>There’s opposition to slowing down in the workplace. “Hustle culture” among knowledge workers means a workplace environment that emphasizes hard work and long hours, despite the fact that the <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/17-05-2021-long-working-hours-increasing-deaths-from-heart-disease-and-stroke-who-ilo">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) says overworking is dangerous.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.careeraddict.com/workplace-competition">Competition in the workplace</a> can also derail slow productivity. For example, Starr describes the U.S. as a capitalist, winner-take-all society with deeply entrenched social norms. Such norms run counter to slow productivity.</p>



<p>Newport discusses another challenge to slow productivity—the challenge of managing “work that’s not yet assigned.” In other words, some managers may resist slow productivity because it would require them to prioritize and assign work instead of just emailing an employee, in the moment, about a task that needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Excessive work volume for computer workers is built into the system, according to Newport, and a shorter work week, or merely capping the number of hours worked, won’t solve it. Organizations should consider slowing down the pace of the workday itself and spending <a href="https://calnewport.com/on-slow-productivity-and-the-anti-busyness-revolution/">less time</a> overall on work that doesn’t matter.</p>



<p>Slow productivity may be worth experimenting with because lost productivity is expensive. For example, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productivity-prohibitors">HubSpot</a> found that lost productivity costs U.S. businesses alone $1.8 trillion USD every year.</p>



 IBM and slow productivity 



<p>Technology can be both a problem and a solution when it comes to productivity. It’s a problem when employees are overloaded juggling a variety of apps to get work done. It’s a solution when employees can automate repetitive tasks and spend more time on the actions that drive results. And spending more time on higher quality work is core to the slow productivity movement.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a>, applied in the right way, can help decrease the burden of busywork and the number of tools employees manage to get work done. By putting AI to work across processes that are complicated or where the day-to-day is routine, you free employees from repetitive work and empower them to deliver better outcomes and make better, data-driven decisions. This can lead to higher levels of job satisfaction, which can lead to lower rates of attrition—and happier employees are more likely to produce happier customers.</p>



<p>Productivity is about getting more out than you put in. Slow productivity is about the quality of work versus the quantity. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/intelligent-automation">Intelligent automation</a> is about giving employees easy, conversational access to the information and task automations they need to better serve customers and get the most important work done.</p>

<p>IT teams are tasked with improving energy efficiency and reducing their overall carbon footprint and waste in data centers—on-premises or in the cloud. &nbsp;IT operators often face challenges to know just how much energy IT applications use or which ones are generating more carbon emissions in order to target the biggest offenders and make the appropriate updates.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic</a> is excited to launch the next phase in our commitment to provide automation tools designed to help customers understand energy use and carbon emissions of their data centers and help them to become more efficient. Turbonomic now tracks the energy consumption and carbon footprint of on-prem hosts and virtual machines (VMs) to help you put your sustainability goals into action.</p>



<p>With the latest release (version 8.9.2), Turbonomic offers new energy and carbon emission reports to help IT teams identify and reduce energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions of data centers by optimizing IT resources, while ensuring that applications perform optimally.</p>



<p>With this release (along with the recent release of the Turbonomic integration with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/how-digital-technologies-may-help-operationalize-sustainability-for-the-cio?social_post=sf176830838&amp;sf176830838=1">IBM Envizi ESG Suite</a>), IT teams now have simplified tools to help optimize energy use in data centers and show the potential results of carbon reduction when action is taken.</p>



<p>The core functionality of version 8.9.2, along with visibility into energy use and carbon emission data, is helpful with setting and achieving sustainability goals. To visualize this data, Turbonomic provides the following features.</p>



 Sustainability charts 



<p>Turbonomic monitors the energy consumption and carbon footprint of your IT infrastructure and then displays relevant data in charts. Currently, these capabilities are supported for hosts and VMs discovered via vCenter, UCS Manager and HPE OneView targets. When you set the scope to any of these hosts and VMs and then click the Details tab, you can view sustainability data in the Energy and Carbon Footprint charts.</p>



 Energy consumption 







<p>Turbonomic collects energy-related data from hosts and VMs at 10-minute intervals. For VMs, the collected host data is used to calculate energy consumption. Currently, Turbonomic collects data via vCenter, UCS Manager and HPE OneView targets. When you set the scope to one or several hosts or VM discovered from these targets, the data that Turbonomic collected or calculated displays in the Energy consumption. The chart shows average and peak/low values over time. Use the selector at the bottom left section of the chart to change the time frame.</p>



 Carbon footprint chart 







<p>Carbon footprint represents carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions for a given virtual machine (VM). Turbonomic measures carbon footprint in grams.</p>



<p>Turbonomic collects energy-related data from hosts and VMs at 10-minute intervals, and then uses that data to calculate carbon footprint. Currently, Turbonomic collects data via vCenter, UCS Manager and HPE OneView targets. When you set the scope to one or several hosts or VMs discovered from these targets, the data that Turbonomic calculated displays in the Carbon Footprint chart. The chart shows average and peak/low values over time. Use the selector at the bottom left section of the chart to change the time frame.</p>



<p>Turbonomic’s calculation for carbon footprint includes actual data center usage and geography-influenced factors. The calculation IBM Turbonomic uses for carbon footprint can be found within the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tarm/8.9.2?topic=charts-carbon-footprint-chart">Turbonomic product documentation</a>. You can create&nbsp;data center policies to adjust the calculations according to the requirements of your data centers. For example, a data center in a particular location might have different requirements than data centers in other locations. After you adjust the calculations based on your specific policies, Turbonomic can accurately report your organization’s carbon footprint.</p>



 Energy consumption dashboards in embedded reporting 



<p>If you have enabled the Embedded Reporting add-on, add the sustainability dashboards to gain insight into how you can reduce your energy consumption and associated carbon footprint.</p>



 Dashboard for sustainability: Private cloud 



<p>This dashboard focuses on the energy consumption and carbon footprint of hosts. Most importantly, Turbonomic also shows opportunities to reduce consumption and carbon footprint by executing Turbonomic actions through automation:</p>







 Application carbon footprint: Private cloud 



<p>This dashboard focuses on the energy consumption and carbon footprint of VMs. The Top Applications by Carbon Footprint view provides insight into the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions of the VMs that power your applications. The dashboard also shows opportunities to reclaim resources by executing VM resize actions and optimization opportunities that can help reduce energy consumption and associated carbon footprint further:</p>







<p>With this data, IT teams can better understand which applications are the biggest energy users and carbon emitters make more informed decisions, such as redesigning the application to be more energy efficient or moving it to a more energy-efficient location or one that is supported by renewable energy.</p>



 Get started 



<p>We are already seeing positive internal feedback with these new tools. As said by Gauthier Siri, Technology Engineer, IBM Client Engineering in our IBM Montpellier data center: “As engineers, we are always looking for new ways to be more efficient in energy use and reduce carbon impact in our data centers. With these new Turbonomic tools, we can see how our business apps are impacting our data centers to take direct actions to reduce it. We are working to become more sustainable; there is work to do but we are on our way.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Turbonomic complements IBM’s existing portfolio of sustainability solutions and consulting expertise—including the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Cloud-Carbon-Calculator-Aims-to-Help-Organizations-Address-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-to-Advance-their-Sustainability-Objectives">IBM Envizi ESG Suite</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Cloud-Carbon-Calculator-Aims-to-Help-Organizations-Address-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-to-Advance-their-Sustainability-Objectives">IBM Cloud Carbon Calculator</a>,&nbsp;IBM Planning Analytics&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/linuxone-4/sustainability">IBM LinuxONE</a>—that help organizations set, operationalize and achieve their ESG goals.</p>

 Categorized as a major threat to the stability of the financial system since the late ‘80s, what more can be done to tackle the global trade in dirty money?&nbsp; 



 



<p>In 1989, the <a href="http://Financial%20Action%20Task%20Force%20(FATF)">Financial Action Task Force (FATF</a>) was created to address the emerging threat posed by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorism financing</a>, and&nbsp;provide some much-needed stability to the financial system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, more than 30 years later, the dangers of the trade in dirty money still looms large. In fact, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, up to <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">$2 trillion</a> is laundered every single year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In a June 2023 report, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-finds-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing-risks-payments-institutions-are-not-managed">European Banking Authority</a> announced that money laundering and terrorist financing risks were still not being managed effectively by EU payment institutions, citing insufficient AML/CFT internal controls. Findings from the report indicated that as some authorities were not supervising their sector effectively, payment institutions with weak AML/CFT controls were still managing to operate in the EU by establishing an entity in a member state where authorization and AML/CFT supervision processes were&nbsp;less stringent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money laundering leads to unreliable changes in money demand, major risks to a bank’s soundness, affects the legality of financial transactions, and wreaks havoc on exchange rates due to unanticipated cross-border asset transfers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what more can be done, and how can you better protect your business and your customers from the scourge of money laundering? Below, we share some of the most common red flag indicators associated with money laundering. </p>



 What is money laundering? 



<p>In short, money laundering refers to the act of obscuring the source of ill-gained funds, and injecting them into the legitimate financial system. In 1988, the United Nations Vienna Convention Article 3.1 defined money laundering as: </p>



<blockquote><p>The conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property is derived from any offense(s), for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of assisting any person who is involved in such offense(s) to evade the legal consequences of his actions.</p>The United Nations Vienna Convention Article 3.1 (1988)</blockquote>



<p>For a more detailed explanation of how money laundering works, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/3-stages-of-money-laundering/">‘Explaining the 3 stages of money laundering’</a> blog.</p>



 Organizations fighting back. 



<p>As money laundering is transnational by nature, many international coalitions have been developed in a bid to tackle the issue. Some of the major groups focused on combating money laundering and adjacent offenses include the FATF, the <a href="https://egmontgroup.org/">Egmont group</a> (composed of 166 Financial Intelligence Units [FIU]), <a href="https://www.interpol.int/">Interpol</a>, Europol and UNODC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Different legal frameworks and regulations have also been created to support anti-money laundering efforts. For example, in the European Union (EU), there have been multiple AML directives (the latest being <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">AMLD 6</a>) featuring&nbsp;requirements, tools and processes for EU countries, their respective authorities, and “<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0421">selected obliged entities</a>”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/29/new-eu-authority-for-anti-money-laundering-council-agrees-its-partial-position/">proposal</a> part of a legislative package to strengthen European AML/CFT rules also laid ground for the creation of a supranational body – the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amla-eu/">Anti-Money Laundering Authority</a> (AMLA), which should be created this year and become fully operational by 2026.</p>



 6 money laundering&nbsp;red flag indicators. 



  Unusual transaction patterns: Different transactional patterns can indicate when money laundering is taking place. Fast-paced transactions coming and going, significant increases in frequency or value, structuring schemes to break down deposits as well as inconsistent transactions regarding the client’s activities should all raise eyebrows and hint at suspicious activities.&nbsp;<br>  Cash-intensive activities: As cash is&nbsp;the major&nbsp;facilitator of money laundering, cash-related businesses are prime targets for money launderers. They offer an unparalleled opportunity to move funds with extremely limited monitoring, and relatively easy ways to escape controls. Businesses with a high volume of cash transactions (casinos, restaurants, grocery stores) or with no apparent justification for cash transactions (construction companies, service providers) may contribute to money laundering schemes. Important controls have been implemented in regulatory frameworks to hinder money laundering, such as reporting thresholds for cash transactions, deposits, or withdrawals.<br>  Third party relationships: Finding the beneficial ownership of companies in tax havens is an <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/blog/cjeu-ruling-eu-public-beneficial-ownership-registers-what-next-for-corporate-transparency">uphill battle</a>, and will remain so, especially in countries with less clear regulations. Money launderers may use third parties to create complex transaction chains, involving multiple accounts or intermediaries, to obscure the trail and source of illicit funds. Some laundering schemes will also appeal to complex international ownership structures, and leverage shell or offshore companies with nominees to hide beneficial ownership. Transactions from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/#:~:text=A%20Politically%20Exposed%20Person%20(PEP)%20is%20someone%20who%2C%20through,bribery%2C%20money%20laundering%20or%20corruption.">Politically Exposed Persons</a> must also be considered when looking for signs of money laundering.<br>  Specific geographical areas: Some countries are more exposed to corruption, organized crime, and money laundering than others, due to weak regulatory systems and poor governmental oversight. When monitoring transactions, geolocation data might be an indicator of suspicious activities. To support transactional analysis, the <a href="https://index.baselgovernance.org/">Basel AML index</a> and <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022">Corruption Perception Index</a> are always helpful to put into perspective global money laundering risks per country.<br>  Deficient financial systems: “Finding the weakness” could be the&nbsp;motto for money launderers. Whether it is corruption-enabled, lack of&nbsp;proper KYC/AML program implementation,&nbsp;or simply weak regulatory framework, some <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/topics/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions.html">financial systems are easier than others to launder money</a>. In particular, inadequate due diligence processes or weak internal controls within a financial institution are especially interesting for people looking to hide the source of their funds.<br>  Technology-enabled money laundering: Digitalization and technological developments have been powerful enablers of money laundering, and opportunities are countless. The emergence of cryptocurrencies and virtual assets provides an additional layer of anonymity to be exploited, on top of decentralized or peer-to-peer exchanges. For example, funds going through an account and instantly converted into crypto might be flagged as suspicious.&nbsp;Read more about the need for cryptocurrency compliance and regulation in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">‘How criminals leverage non-compliant crypto exchanges for money laundering’ blog.</a><br>&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-investigation-leads-takedown-darknet-cryptocurrency-mixer-processed-over-3">Darknet marketplaces also facilitate illicit transactions</a> and provide means to acquire fictitious identities. Darknet visitors are able conceal their identity or location thanks to specific protocols, VPNs, or proxy servers. &nbsp;  



 AML measures and deterrence mechanisms. 



<p>Having a robust AML program is essential to&nbsp;effectively deter money laundering. Countries with strong AML regulatory frameworks now enforce fines and administrative sanctions on actors who fail to demonstrate effective AML programs. For example, the French institution Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution&nbsp;in charge of monitoring the activity of banks and insurances can impose fines up to €100 million or 10% of a company’s annual turnover. In 2020, the UK’s <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a>&nbsp;fined the London branch of the German Commerzbank <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-commerzbank-london-37805400-over-anti-money-laundering-failures">£37 million</a>, “for failing to put adequate anti-money laundering (AML) systems and controls in place between October 2012 and September 2017.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>To remain compliant and avoid being sanctioned by authorities, having your reputation damaged, and incurring fines, improving these three pillars can drastically help:</p>



  KYC processes: Implementing thorough KYC procedures is crucial for financial institutions. This involves verifying the identity of customers, understanding their business activities, and assessing the legitimacy of the funds involved in transactions. Enhanced due diligence measures may be applied for higher-risk customers, such as PEPs or high net worth individuals. KYC obligations are now largely informed by national or supranational regulations, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Anti%2DMoney,based%20closely%20on%20FATF%20guidance.">AML directives</a> in Europe.<br>  



  Transaction monitoring and reporting: Transaction monitoring plays a vital role in tackling money laundering by identifying and flagging suspicious financial transactions for further investigation. Rule-based and behavior-based analytics, detection of unusual activity and real-time monitoring are all actions that can help detect suspicious patterns and support further investigations.<br>  Collaboration and information sharing: Financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports&nbsp;(SAR) through dedicated channels with their respective authorities, whenever there are reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering. Enhancing public-private partnerships is therefore one of the main ways to&nbsp;successfully tackle money laundering. As a global issue, money laundering also requires international cooperation and information sharing among different countries and regulatory bodies. Collaboration facilitates the exchange of intelligence, supports investigations, and assists in tracing and recovering illicit assets across borders.  



 Combating money laundering for the better good. 



<p>Money laundering poses a significant threat to the integrity of financial systems and can have severe consequences for global security. <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/display/book/9781589067738/ch014.xml">According to the International Monetary Fund,</a> “Countries with weak AML/CFT regimes are subject to the negative effects that large international criminal organizations can have on their economic growth and financial stability.” &nbsp;</p>

 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 


 
 
 
 What are the main AML red flags?&nbsp; 
 

<p>Common red flags include large cash transactions, structuring transactions to avoid reporting thresholds, rapid movement of funds, unusual customer activity, lack of business justification, dealing with non-resident customers or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons</a>, offshore transactions, unregistered or unlicensed entities, and lack of proper documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 What is an example of a red flag in AML?&nbsp; 
 

<p>One example of a red flag in AML is a sudden and unexplained increase in cash deposits or withdrawals in a customer’s account. For example, if a customer who typically makes small transactions suddenly starts depositing or withdrawing substantial amounts of cash without an apparent reason, it could indicate potential money laundering activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 What are some red flags in banking?&nbsp; 
 

<p>In banking, unusual cash deposits or withdrawals, rapid movement of funds, multiple accounts with similar names or unusual customer behavior could indicate&nbsp;money laundering activities, prompting the need for further investigation or the need to submit a SAR to the national FIU.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the cloud era, a compute cluster that once took months to build out can now be created and ready to use in minutes. In this blog post, we will discuss all pieces that come together to make this near-instant infrastructure a reality. From there, we will show how this infrastructure and file system fulfills the promise of performance right out of the box.</p>



 IBM Spectrum Scale 



<p>The express path to a high-performance distributed file system and compute cluster begins with the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/content/ibm-spectrum-scale-d722b6b6-8bb5-4506-8f0f-03a5f05a3d6e-global">IBM Spectrum Scale catalog tile</a>. Follow the link, and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/schematics">IBM Cloud Schematics</a> interface offers a straightforward process for filling out the parameters to configure your cloud-based storage and compute cluster. After you provide all the configuration details, your input is stored as a Schematics workspace. This workspace contains your infrastructure specification, and upon your command, the workspace connects with the Terraform and Ansible code contained in the repository to create your cloud-based infrastructure.</p>



 VPC infrastructure 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vpc">IBM Cloud VPC</a> infrastructure used by the Spectrum Scale catalog tile can employ storage nodes based on bare metal instances with NVMe devices or use virtual instances with instance storage. For this post, we will be using bare metal instances that offer the following:</p>



 
 8 3.2 TB NVMe storage devices 



 48 physical cores (96 vCPUs) from Intel Xeon 8260 processors 



 192 – 1536 GB of memory 
 



<p>The number and configuration of the compute nodes is up to the user with virtual instance profiles:</p>



 
 From 2 to 176 vCPUs 



 From 2 GB to 2.5 TB of memory 
 



<p>In addition to the storage and compute nodes, the automation provisions and configures a bastion node that helps to secure the cluster’s VPC in several ways:</p>



 
 Serves as an SSH jump host allowing secure command line access to the cluster’s VPC 



 Isolates the cluster VPC from the internet by closing non-essential ports 



 Restricts access to the cluster to approved remote IP addresses or CIDR blocks 
 



 IBM Spectrum Scale file system 



<p>IBM Spectrum Scale is a high-performance clustered file system that provides concurrent access to a shared file system from multiple nodes. It can be used in a wide variety of hardware and software configurations. For our purposes, it is configured as a collection of nodes built from both bare metal servers for storage and virtual instances for compute. Each bare metal instance has direct-attached NVMe storage serving as NSD volumes and a 100 Gbps network interface.&nbsp; We’ll have more to say about this in the performance section.</p>



 Security 



<p>The tile automation scripts build a cluster that employs simple and effective security practices to get you started:</p>



 
 User-supplied SSH keys 



 A login (bastion) node jump host&nbsp; 



 Firewall with only the SSH port open and restricted to your specified CIDR 



 All nodes in the cluster can only be accessed from within the VPC 
 



<p>From there, it is expected that you employ the rich set of tools supplied by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/security">IBM Cloud</a> and Spectrum Scale to implement the level of security that meets your needs.</p>



 Cluster creation 



<p>As discussed earlier, before it is rendered in real hardware, the cluster exists as a specification stored in a Schematics workspace. This workspace can be thought of as a form of infrastructure that incurs no cost or energy while in storage.</p>



<p>Assuming the cluster is already configured, the process of bringing it to life begins with invoking the “apply” command, which executes the pre-existing and well-tested Terraform scripts from the Schematics repository to provision the cloud resources. Whenever possible, the provision steps are carried out in parallel. In the case of our largest example, a 10 storage node and 64 compute node cluster, there can be close to 100 discrete cloud operations in flight at one time. In this way, for one example, the 64 compute nodes are provisioned concurrently and complete in a little over 1 minute, and so it goes with subnets, security rules, a bastion node, storage nodes and so on. Once the hardware is in place, Ansible scripts are kicked off to install and configure the software.</p>



 Time required to create a Spectrum Scale cluster 



<p>The following timings were measured on varying cluster configurations in real experiments and can be used as a guideline. As always, your results may vary to some degree. Three different cluster sizes were tested, and the times needed to create them were broken down to give an idea of how long various operations take.</p>



Cluster TypeSchematics TimeController Terraform TimeController Ansible TimeTotal Time3-storage, 3-compute05:2016:3819:3541:356-storage 64-compute05:0217:1132:1254:2510-storage 64-compute05:1217:1734:1256:41 Scroll to view full table  Table 1: Cluster creation times (hh:mm:ss)



<p>“Schematics time” is the amount of time spent running Terraform scripts in a Schematics container. This time is spent provisioning a login node and a “controller” node to which we transfer the responsibility for finishing the cluster. The reason we make this transition is to allow us to move execution to a node that we own and control. We can also size to speed up the process that is executing Terraform scripts to provision resources and later Ansible scripts to install software and configure the cluster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the table above, this time is split into the Controller Terraform and Controller Ansible components. The “Total Time” column is the elapsed time from “apply” to the cluster being ready to get to work. It is interesting to note how the performance varies as we scale up the cluster size. Schematics time is essentially invariant because it is the same amount of work in this phase, regardless of cluster size. The controller Terraform illustrates how successfully we can parallelize the Terraform provisions. In this case, the time needed to do 74 (10 storage + 64 compute) provisions is less than 5% longer than the time needed to do 6. In contrast, the Ansible-based configurations run serially in many cases, so the time needed is proportional to the number of nodes in the cluster.</p>



Cluster TypeBootstrap Destroy TimeSchematics Destroy TimeTotal Destroy Time3-storage, 3-compute05:5304:0309:576-storage 64-compute06:3703:2410:0110-storage 64-compute05:4303:5409:37 Scroll to view full table  Table 1: Cluster destroy times (mm:ss)



<p>We also tested the time needed to destroy a cluster, and the results are in Table 2 above. The total time is made up of two separate operations. There are two operations due to the split nature of the Terraform work. Some of it runs on the Schematics container, while the bulk of the work is carried out on the bootstrap instance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These two operations run sequentially, so the total time is obtained by adding the two operations together. Regardless of cluster size, it takes approximately 10 minutes to free all the resources and return them to the cloud. Just as in resource creation, we take advantage of the ability to run Terraform operations in parallel to keep the total time down.</p>



 Spectrum Scale storage resiliency 



<p>Out of the box, our cluster offers resiliency that allows for the loss of a storage node and the loss of a storage block.</p>



<p>This level of redundancy requires two settings that are applied at cluster creation time:</p>



 
 A minimum storage cluster consists of the three nodes 



 A write replication factor of two is set 
 



<p>The above settings can be seen as providing the basic level of resiliency that befits a large, clustered file system. Beyond this, and depending on your needs, Spectrum Scale and IBM Cloud can be customized to provide resiliency and security at very high levels.</p>



 Spectrum Scale storage performance

<p>Table 3 provides an overview of Scale file system performance for a few key metrics. The testing was performed on a system with the following characteristics:</p>



 
 10 storage nodes 



 80 NVMe drives 



 256 TB of raw storage capacity 



 100 Gbps network in each storage node 



 A single 107 TB file system provided by Spectrum Scale 5.1.4 
 



<p>On the compute side, we have:</p>



 
 64 compute nodes 



 cx2-16×32 (16 vCPU, 32 GB memory) instance profile 



 512 physical cores 



 24 Gbps network per instance 
 



<p>Digging into the results in Table 3, it should be evident that these are very good numbers for a clustered file system. The read bandwidth of 112 GiB/sec is essentially all the bandwidth supplied by the 10 100 Gbps network adapters, which means when it comes to read bandwidth, the Scale software and IBM Cloud network infrastructure is leaving nothing on the table. Write bandwidth is also good, operating under the constraints imposed by replication. The 5.4 million read IOPs supplied are also impressive. In short, this is a very high-performance offering out of the box.</p>



<p>It should be noted that all the results listed above were achieved “out of the box.” As with any high-performance computing system, the cluster has benefited from testing and tuning, but it was done over the course of our development and performance testing and the tuning is now applied automatically when a cluster is built from the tile.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The IBM Cloud Spectrum Scale catalog tile has been designed and built to offer you the shortest path possible to get to a high-performance compute and storage cluster. In less than one hour, you can build a compute/storage cluster to your specification with up to a 100 TB distributed file system, as much compute capacity as you desire and tuned to extract maximum performance from the underlying hardware. We invite you to try out our offering and embrace the cloud-based future of high-performance computing today.</p>

<p>Trusted profiles can serve as a foundation for secure cloud environments and as a building block for secure cloud solutions. In our new IBM Cloud solution tutorial, you are going to learn about trusted profiles, their use cases and how to utilize them for enhanced security.</p>



<p>Cloud environments and cloud security are always changing and evolving. If you are interested in or have to care about cloud security, you should be interested in our new IBM Cloud solution tutorial.</p>



<p>It looks at a feature of Identity and Access Management (IAM) that provides a special identity and can be used for access policies: Trusted profiles. You’ll learn about trusted profiles and then can follow the tutorial to create and utilize a trusted profile and discover and interpret related security logs. Get started to enhance security in your cloud environments.</p>

 New tutorial 



<p>In our new tutorial <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-trusted-profile-for-enterprise-security">Use trusted profiles as foundation for secure cloud environments</a>, we give an overview of what trusted profiles are and their typical use cases.</p>



<p>Similar to users and service IDs, trusted profiles are a type of identity supported by IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM). As such, they can be granted access in IAM policies. A difference from users and service IDs is that trusted profiles cannot own IAM API keys or, like users, may have passwords. They are an identity within a specific account that serves as a “gateway” for someone or something else to work within that account without the need for an API key. They can assume the identity of that trusted profile.</p>



<p>In the tutorial, you will learn how to use one of these gateways. You are going to create a trusted profile that is used by an application deployed to a Kubernetes cluster (see the architecture diagram above). You configure the trusted profile to accept the application in its namespace as a trusted environment—a so-called compute resource. With that, the app can switch to the identity of a specific trusted profile and perform (privileged administrative) tasks in the IBM Cloud account.</p>



<p>You will learn how to manage trusted profiles and to look for and understand related security logs. The screenshot below shows parts of an event logged to IBM Cloud Activity Tracker. It lists the trusted profile that was used for a request and information on the compute resource that was utilized to assume the identity.</p>

                <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in June 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Last month, we discussed our&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/network-agnostic-tokenization-platform-for-enterprises/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ofZm8n3SJwcPbEky_ddwlGgm7VUE8JJnnBq_f8RrY7_cOTSrl1tMJ04hR6LPap2zwkwzL">network-agnostic approach</a>&nbsp;for enterprises seeking to tokenize assets. This month, we’re focusing on our&nbsp;‘Custody’ solutions, highlighting our strategy for&nbsp;smart contracts management and wallet services.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way we think about digitization of finance. One of the key components of this technology is the blockchain wallet, which allows users to interact with the blockchain by signing operations.&nbsp;Wallets are used to sign transactions on the blockchain in order to validate information, authenticate, or trigger smart contract functions.</p>
<p>However, despite its numerous benefits, blockchain wallets can often be complex and difficult to use for the average user, increasing the risk of user error, such as misplacing private keys or sending funds to the wrong address. These errors can have serious consequences, including the loss of funds and the potential for fraudulent activities. To address these issues,&nbsp;it is crucial to simplify the user experience of wallets for institutional players. This can be achieved through the development of user-friendly interfaces, permission systems, and automation.</p>
<p>For years already, Tokeny has provided solutions to facilitate operations for users, being issuers, agents, or investors. Tokeny has not and doesn’t plan to develop a proprietary solution for blockchain wallets. We believe in self-control and direct ownership of assets and want to&nbsp;remain agnostic in terms of wallet solutions. Our role is to integrate these blockchain solutions into the <a title="T-REX Platform" href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX tokenization platform</a> in order to provide a good and secure user experience.</p>
<p>Each of the different roles presented below has a defined set of available actions that can be signed by a wallet:</p>
 
 The issuer&nbsp;(i.e., owner) is the top level administrator. An issuer can mostly appoint/revoke agent(s). 
 Agents&nbsp;manage the day-to-day operations on behalf of the issuer, such as the token supply, investor qualification, redemption… Agents use their wallets to sign these actions (i.e., blockchain transactions). 
 Investors&nbsp;use their wallets to control their identity and the tokens assigned to them. 
 

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We distinguish several types of wallets:</p>
 Custodial Wallets vs. Non-custodial Wallets 
<p>We usually talk about custodial wallets when a third-party keeps and/or manages the private keys of the wallet. Custodial wallets solutions enable a high-level of automation and security, but can be subject to operational constraints linked to crypto-assets regulations.</p>
<p>Non-custodial wallets are managed directly by the end-user. With recent developments, they are now much easier, secure and cost-effective to use and are probably the future of this industry.</p>
 Integrated Wallets vs. Connected Wallets 
<p>We’ve integrated custodial and non-custodial wallet providers into our platform. These integrated wallets can be provided automatically to Issuers, Agents, and Token holders.</p>
<p>Signatures are made from the front-end, or automated if using custodial wallets, and the platform is connected to the wallet provider by API to trigger the blockchain operation. A gas tank feature enables gas-less transactions. As a result,&nbsp;the platform handles both the preparation and the signature information of the users’ transaction.&nbsp;It enables a simplified UI flow and facilitates automation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, thanks to connections with Metamask and WalletConnect, the T-REX platform is compatible with all the key wallet providers and digital assets custody solutions of the industry.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, our ultimate goal is to foster comfort and confidence among users when using our wallet solution. Regardless of their choice of wallets, we aim to empower our platform’s users, ensuring ease and confidence in wallet navigation.</p>

<p>The primary objective of this data challenge was to develop data analysis reports and machine learning models that accurately assess investor sentiment towards the OCEAN token over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Twitter, and specifically ‘Crypto Twitter (CT)’ has risen as a unique economic indicator in global sentiment for a particular project and token. Ocean Protocol provided two datasets for this exercise: one contained a record of all tweets featuring “$OCEAN” since 2020, while the other included the price history of the OCEAN token since 2019. Entrants were asked to find correlations between Twitter sentiment and token price and to develop a machine-learning model capable of classifying tweets as bullish, bearish, or&nbsp;neutral.</p> Winners are as&nbsp;follows: <p>1st Place: Nicolas Landry ($2500&nbsp;prize)</p>  Nicolas’ in-depth analysis report and machine learning model caught our scoring team's eye. The paper included Nicolas’ methodology, clear explanations of the asked data analysis questions, data, and visual expressions of said data to support the thesis. Nicolas dug deep to find correlation coefficients, explain his query scripts, and test more than one ML model in his findings.  <p>2nd Place: Alexis Gassmann ($1500&nbsp;prize)</p>  Alexis was immensely thoughtful and results-oriented in the data analysis portion of this quest. Using HTML notebooks, Alexis was able to find averages and make assumptions backed by data to prove when and how bearish/bullish sentiment was most prominent in the time frame provided for this challenge.  <p>3rd Place: Mohammad Jamali ($1000&nbsp;prize)</p>  Mohammad took a unique approach in polishing and re-preparing the data by language, time, and price movement of the data set provided in this challenge. By doing so, Mohammad found patterns in the correlation between Twitter sentiment and price movement that we hadn’t thought of before. This creativity and exploration is a prime example of how Ocean data challenges empower the data scientist and lead to better informed, data-driven decision&nbsp;making.  <p>Are you curious about how the performance of your project, protocol, or favorite team reflects on the town hall of crypto, Twitter? Let us know in our community channels, and your protocol may be selected next to run a sentiment challenge on.</p><p>Congratulations to the winners, and thank you to all the participants for their hard work and dedication.

 Polimec and Deloitte Switzerland Introduce New KYC Credentials to Enhance Regulatory-Compliant Fundraising <p>Use case sets the basis for regulatory compliance in decentralized finance (DeFi), reducing the risk of fraud and accelerating Web3.</p><blockquote>“We are excited that only 8 weeks after our <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/deloitte-integrates-kilt-identity-blockchain-7ea12c0e0806">initial announcement with Deloitte</a>, we can already announce Polimec as the first use case for reusable KYC credentials. We are confident that many more will follow soon, inside and outside the Polkadot ecosystem.” — Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Press Release by Deloitte and&nbsp;Polimec</p><p>June 28th, 2023 — Switzerland — <a href="https://www.polimec.org/">Polimec</a>, a decentralized funding protocol developed on Polkadot, and Deloitte Switzerland are joining forces to issue reusable KYC (Know Your Customer) credentials enabling access to global fundraising of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Banking grade standard KYC credentials, issued by Deloitte, streamline the process of participating in early-stage fundraising on Polimec. The credentials are anchored on the KILT blockchain, providing an additional level of regulatory compliance, security, and data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Users share their KYC documentation exclusively with Deloitte, a company trusted by the largest multinational enterprises and governments worldwide. Deloitte Managed Services then provides KYC credentials in Web3, an evolved version of the internet that incorporates blockchain technologies and decentralized systems. These Deloitte KYC credentials present a more efficient and secure alternative to traditional KYC methods, which typically involve significant time and resources to confirm the identities of customers.</p><p>“We are proud to share the result of the last nine months that we’ve been working together with Deloitte. This enables us to take a step closer to a vision of Web3, where everyone controls their own data, identity, and destiny — and with Polimec they can own parts of the most exciting Web3 projects from the very earliest fundraises. This collaboration will bring additional funding possibilities to the Polkadot ecosystem and lead the way to a more decentralized community-focused Web3, while also satisfying regulatory criteria”, said <a href="https://ch.linkedin.com/in/kmjoergensen">Kasper Mai Jørgensen</a>, Co-Founder of&nbsp;Polimec.</p><p>Credentials will be available for natural persons as well as for legal entities in consideration of their respective needs:</p>  Issuers: The credentials serve as authenticity certificates of the legal entity raising funds, instilling trust and accountability in funding&nbsp;rounds.  Participants: The credentials allow access to Polimec and enable the categorization into retail, professional, and institutional.  <p>With the introduction of reusable KYC credentials, Polimec revolutionizes fundraising practices by creating a compliant and transparent fundraising environment with the goal of ensuring data ownership for all stakeholders. Now each credential holder gets to choose who holds their data and decide what data to share with&nbsp;whom.</p>  Issuers are able to offer contribution tokens to individuals/entities that have been appropriately certified by using the required KYC/AML (Anti Money Laundering) standards, reducing their risk of fraud and ensuring a more secure, more compliant and pseudonymous investing environment. This enables the customization of funding round criteria such as jurisdiction and participant types and provides access for investors based on criteria specified by the&nbsp;issuer.  Participants no longer need to share KYC/AML documentation with multiple intermediaries and issuers to be compliant. Their sensitive documentation is shared with Deloitte exclusively; they save time and reduce the risk of potential data breaches and identity theft. Participants are also assured of project legitimacy due to the issuer and the founders obtaining KYC credentials.  <p>The result is a fast, accessible, privacy-preserving, and compliant authentication experience.</p><p>“After announcing our partnership with KILT Protocol at the Decentralized conference in Lugano, we are proud to announce our first use case,” said <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/de/profiles/mbitterli.html">Micha Bitterli</a>, Head of Deloitte Managed Services. “With this first of many expected use cases, we demonstrate that we are not only talking about potential projects but executing on our promise. Together with the Web3 community joining us as either a user or as a use case for our solution, we want to enable blockchain technology to move toward a compliant DeFi environment.”</p><p>The KILT infrastructure ensures that KYC credentials can be verified at any time. That verification is documented on the Polimec blockchain, ensuring that all transactions and network participants can be processed in a regulatory-compliant, transparent, and secure manner while preserving data privacy. As a result, Polimec is able to create a secure and regulatory compliant fundraising environment for all involved stakeholders.</p><p>”I’m thrilled to see Polimec evolve into a fully-fledged decentralized funding mechanism. This is due to the fantastic and dedicated team at the Polimec Foundation. Together with the Polimec and Deloitte teams, we have created a seamless entry point for new teams to join the Polkadot ecosystem”, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingo-ruebe-0915068/">Ingo Rübe</a>, Founder of KILT Protocol.</p><p>The Polkadot ecosystem exemplifies effective collaboration between Protocols and Enterprises, establishing a streamlined workflow through interoperability and shared security. This synergy fosters innovation, yielding products that enhance user experience and community value. While KILT Protocol and the Polimec fundraising protocol undertake extensive tech operations and XCM (Cross-Consensus Message) transactions, complexities are rendered user-friendly. This simplicity catalyzes Web3 adoption, facilitating accessible, compliant, and decentralized products.</p><p>Polimec will go live as a Polkadot parachain in late 2023, after which the first projects will be supported in reaching their fundraising goals, enabling them to focus on building new and exciting technology for Web3. Everyone in the ecosystem will be able to participate via&nbsp;Polimec.</p><p>There will be possibilities to use your KYC credential early on to get acquainted with this new way of performing KYC and managing your data on chain. We invite you to join our <a href="https://polimec.link/did-signup">waitlist</a> to stay updated on the next&nbsp;steps!</p> About Polimec: <p>Polimec is a decentralized community-driven funding protocol developed on Polkadot to accelerate the Web3 ecosystem. Polimec facilitates fundraising in a regulatory-compliant and sustainable manner using on-chain credentials, by providing an automated framework for projects to raise funds within a broad and diverse community with transparent and fair access for all. The protocol provides access to fundraising and governs the issuance, distribution, and conversion of tokens to&nbsp;mainnet.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/polimec-and-deloitte-switzerland-introduce-new-kyc-credentials-to-enhance-regulatory-compliant-5a6bb0654dd4">Polimec and Deloitte Switzerland Introduce New KYC Credentials to Enhance Regulatory-Compliant…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A summary of the mechanics of OCEAN, circa Jun&nbsp;2023 [Image: <a href="https://freerangestock.com/photos/129158/waves-in-sea.html">freerangestock.com</a>] Summary <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN</a> mechanics currently include locking OCEAN for curation of data assets, burning OCEAN as a function of network revenue, and as a unit-of-exchange.</p><p>OCEAN has a generalized design that can incorporate new features, towards the overall goal of growing traction.</p> Introduction <p>OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage volume&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">[1]</a>:</p>  A rise in usage volume → leads to more network revenue, which goes to Ocean community via (a) burning OCEAN (b) other community initiatives  A rise in usage volume → leads to more OCEAN being&nbsp;locked  <p>So the name of the game is to drive usage&nbsp;volume.</p> On Network&nbsp;Revenue <p>The baseline revenue: anytime a data asset is consumed, 0.1% of the value goes to Ocean community; a portion of that is burned. It’s independent of what currency the data asset it sold for. The higher the data consume volume (DCV), the more OCEAN to the community, the more value to OCEAN. So the name of the game is to drive DCV&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">[1]</a>.</p><p>Over time, other revenue-generating mechanisms may be&nbsp;added.</p> OCEAN Distribution Towards&nbsp;Traction <p>The majority of OCEAN supply is earmarked for the community, distributed over decades, to incentivize locking OCEAN and driving&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/veocean-is-launching-data-farming-is-resuming-abed779211e3">2</a>][<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">4</a>] has the main mechanics:</p>  Passive DF. Lock your OCEAN for veOCEAN → earn weekly OCEAN rewards&nbsp;.  Active DF. Currently via curation: Point your veOCEAN to assets that you think will have high DCV, and if they do, you earn OCEAN rewards. DCV isn’t that high (yet), so “active” DF rewards aren’t that high&nbsp;(yet).   Unit of&nbsp;Exchange <p>OCEAN can also be used as a unit-of-exchange, as it is in Ocean Market&nbsp;[1].</p><p>However, do understand that this mechanic doesn’t drive value much, as <a href="https://medium.com/@cburniske/cryptoasset-valuations-ac83479ffca7">Chris Burniske’s PV=MQ work showed.</a> Thus, the Ocean core team puts more emphasis on greater drivers of&nbsp;value.</p> Looking Forward <p>Inside Ocean core team, all our work is around driving traction, and especially DCV [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">5</a>]. Stay tuned, some cool stuff is coming, including more revenue streams:)</p><p>And there are several teams in the Ocean community, building great products powered by Ocean, which each drive OCEAN as they drive&nbsp;DCV.</p> References <p>0.

<p>When we last left off, Dhiway had a new narrative but the same identity. We were only half there! Let us unfold the rest of this rebrand story….. see you on the flip side (Wink wink).</p>



 <br>Out with the old, in with the new? 



<p>Rewind the clock by three years! When we embarked on our Dhiway journey, all we cared about was verification. But things have changed! Our story has grown broader.</p>



<p>It’s like showing up to the office in your cricket gear. Something just feels off. We realized we needed the right attire to look the part.</p>



<p>Our path to design was clear</p>



 
 We need to shed our startup vibes and embrace the look of a serious tech player. Think established, timeless, with a touch of class. 



 The visuals need to match our personality – We are bold, authentic, thorough, rational &amp; dependable 
 



 <br>Visualizing Dhiway 2.0 



<p>What does ‘reshaping the digital future’ look like? Could it be a majestic rising sun, or perhaps a precious pearl tucked away in an oyster, or maybe an animal that shakes up its entire ecosystem? The ideas were flowing during our brand creation process.</p>



<p>But then, someone chimed in, saying, “What if it’s all about turning over a new page?” Intriguing, we thought. It sounded simple, yet held a profound meaning. It also had a visual element that excited our creative senses!</p>



<p>But the kicker: it fit perfectly into our brand story.</p>



<p>‘Turning the page’ going once, twice, thrice. Sold. We had our visual concept.</p>







<p>Concept note</p>



<p>In a world rampant with data breaches and digital clutter, we find our trust and convictions often being put to the test. It has become the need of the hour to begin a fresh chapter, to turn over a new leaf. Dhiway is here to drive change, and belief and open doors to a new world.</p>



<p>Achieving certainty in the digital world is no longer a far-off dream. With Dhiway, it’s just the turn of a page.</p>







 <br>Introducing Dhiway 2.0 







<p>The Dhiway identity visualizes the story of ‘Reshaping the digital future’, about creating a better digital world. The identity boasts three essential elements</p>



 
 Circle: A powerful symbol embodying a better digital world 



 The Fold: A bold depiction of the transformative path from darkness to light 



 The ‘W’: The dynamic slant of the ‘w’ symbolizes forward movement (We are ‘reshaping’ the digital future &amp; not just ‘reshape’ the digital future) 
 



<p>On a side note:</p>



<p>We actually had three different design approaches in mind, and we were leaning towards going with something completely different. You know what changed our minds? During the Dhiway Townhall, someone said, ‘I really miss that tilted W from approach 2.’ And that statement made us pause and reflect. Looking back, it’s pretty funny how we were drawn to the ‘Turning the page’ approach, but we reluctantly chose a different one. We genuinely think that these unexpected twists are where the real fun happens.”</p>



 <br>Redesigning a cohesive visual language 



<p>Building from our identity, the new visual language needed to portray a forward-looking tech company while conveying our brand narrative.</p>



<p>We did this through 3 main components</p>



<p></p>



<p><br>1. Colour system</p>



<p>Most tech and blockchain companies have the usual visual tropes of blues &amp; blacks. For us, the opportunity lay in ‘purple’ and ‘yellow’ basis of our competitive research.</p>



<p>Our colour pallets give Dhiway a fresh new look while not letting go of our bold yet dependable image. The balance between solid and gradient palettes communicates the confidence of a well-established ecosystem while retaining a timeless appeal.</p>



<p>Additionally, the gradients act as a visual representation of frictionless interactions; dipicting a smooth flow of data.</p>







<p></p>



<p><br>2. Typography</p>



<p>Our brand typeface, Aeonik, complements our colour systems by embodying our brand’s personality while maintaining a sense of boldness and dependability. A meticulously crafted and versatile typeface, its extensive range of styles and characters makes it ideal for creating a timeless brand identity. Aeonik is ideal for large &amp; small sizes; something that is essential for the ecosystem we deal in.</p>







<p><br>3. Circle</p>



<p>Our core visual element represents a better digital world. This is widely used in most of our creative expressions and is the center of our brand.</p>







 <br>Extending beyond Dhiway 



<p>Taking inspiration from our parent brand, our offerings embrace the central element of the fold. This deliberate design choice establishes a cohesive and harmonious visual language that unifies our entire product family.</p>







<p><br><br></p>



 Finally…….making the brand live 



<p>And here we are, bursting with excitement! On June 7th, 2023, we proudly unveiled our brand to the world. We had a blast teasing the launch with cryptic messages on our social media platforms.</p>















<p></p>















<p>That’s the end of our rebranding adventure. We hope you enjoyed reading about it as much as we enjoyed writing it.</p>



<p>Of course, we don’t have everything perfectly figured out just yet. We know we have a long road ahead of us, but we also know we’re heading in the right direction.</p>

<p>It is a crisp December morning, with frost on every leaf and a warm winter sun amidst blue skies. There may even be a robin or two amongst the trees. Christmas is in the air and there is a hive of activity here to deliver something special—a sofa, fridge, or TV—in time for the holiday for thousands of John Lewis customers. As the convoy of shiny black liveried trucks, each laden with its stock of large items, makes its way out of the site and on towards customers across the country, the scale of this operation becomes apparent.</p>



<p>John Lewis Partnership (JLP) is an iconic British retailer and its renowned customer loyalty has a long heritage. As the retail market and society have changed, particularly post-Covid, the focus on the customer promise has never been higher. For large items like refrigerators, furniture, or anything requiring a two-person delivery, this means delivering what the customer ordered, when they expect it, leaving them delighted with the experience. Every time.</p>



<p>Optimizing and improving the supply chain to support these objectives is a priority for any retailer. Traditionally, this has relied on the deep expertise within supply chain teams to deliver the scale, service quality and efficiencies required by the business. Forward looking retailers are now looking to augment this by starting to explore the promise of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin">a digital twin</a> of their supply chain. The aspiration is to discover novel possibilities and explore opportunities for solving existing and future business challenges.</p>



 What is a digital twin? 



<p>A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system that spans its lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision-making. </p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/topics/what-is-a-digital-t">Find out more</a>



<p>The John Lewis supply chain team engaged with IBM Client Engineering to explore the initial steps toward a digital twin. Alongside this strategic aim were more tactical, but still important, supply chain planning objectives that were good candidates for a more data-driven approach. Digital twins can serve as a sandbox for testing new supply chain strategies and technologies without affecting the physical supply chain, enabling continuous improvement and learning.</p>



 Why IBM Client Engineering? 



<p>Using the Value Engineering Method we take a human approach to solving complex business problems with transformative technology. Using a proven co-creation methodology we align experts from both parties to identify a business challenge that could be the focus of a PoX (Proof of Experience).</p>



 What data challenges and opportunities do you have? 



<p>According to Anthony Olver, Supply Chain Planning Manager for the John Lewis Partnership, “We have the benefit at JLP of many years of historic data but in many different formats. As a result, datasets were in different locations, with differing levels of access and under the purview of different teams within the partnership. It was therefore not always efficient to bring it together in a useful way.”</p>



<p>“We wanted greater visibility of the present and the ability to easily look back to gauge performance and KPIs. We also had a desire to do more modelling of the art of the possible and future scenarios to give the business the right insights to make the right future investments.”</p>



<p>Presenting all this in a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate the past, present, and future in a natural way was important for adoption. Achieving this would allow business users to make the most of the data in a way that is relevant to their role.</p>



<p>Our Partnership Data Plan, which centers around Snowflake, is our strategic approach to address this. Our project highlighted the potential of more real-time data and the benefits of having data in a single logical location. It has given a glimpse of the future.</p>



 What was JL’s experience of the Client Engineering process? 



<p>“Working with the Client Engineering team provided us with an exciting opportunity to co-create and explore innovative ways to increase efficiency within our supply chain,” said Stewart Dean, Supply Chain Planning &amp; Development Lead, John Lewis Partnership.</p>



<p>Two streams ran at speed in parallel—stakeholder interviews leading to a UI wire-frame design, and development of the UI in React alongside design and population of the data model. These streams were synced through daily stand-ups which provided an opportunity to rapidly pivot and take on new requests, such as including carbon usage and customer satisfaction data.</p>



<p>The momentum this process generated energized the IBM and John Lewis teams. Weekly playbacks were a celebration of the progress and an opportunity for senior stakeholders to provide their input.</p>



 What possibilities did this data visualization project highlight? 



<p>“We saw the art of the possible and the scale of the opportunity,” says Anthony Olver. “The magic was how IBM created the data model and brought it all together in a UI design such that the data and insights were easily navigable. This has fantastic potential and puts us on the path to a Digital Twin of our supply chain.”</p>



<p>Stewart Dean went on to say, “The IBM team were able to absorb our complex data sets and transform them into a dynamic and interactive MVP performance dashboard, providing our teams with new capabilities, allowing them to easily assimilate data and gain key performance insights in a highly visual way.”</p>



<p>The screenshots below show the complexity within datasets such as for supply chain, customer orders and revenue being represented in relation to each other in a dynamic interactive dashboard.</p>



UI design for supply chain scenario modelling (using dummy data)



UI design for supply chain network performance heatmap (using dummy data)



<p></p>



UI design for supply chain network performance mapped against delivery routes (using dummy data)



 Where do you see this going next? 



<p>According to Anthony Olver, “This has massive potential in terms of giving us the ability to visualize the supply chain with different perspectives across sites, group, regions, overlaid with specific metrics and timelines. We would have a view of overall performance right down to individual items. This would give us the ability to make data-enriched strategic and tactical decisions.”</p>



<p>Client Engineering is IBM’s investment in its customers to help solve tough business challenges through co-creation. We are designers, data scientists, technology engineers and business analysts who love working with customers and bringing IBM technology to life.</p>

<p>Protocol Engineer Brian and Head of Design Ryan recently attended <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/">DWeb Camp 2023</a> in the California redwoods. DWeb Camp is a five-day retreat for builders and creators constructing tools, making apps, and cultivating a community around the decentralized web. While there, they presented a <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/dwebcamp-workshop-2023">workshop</a> on the ODD SDK using <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> and the <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD App Template</a>. The workshop invites participants to create ODD Avatars, like the one below. </p>Our marketer Becky, transmogrified! Creating Your ODD Avatar <p>After grabbing a copy of the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/dwebcamp-workshop-2023">workshop code</a> from GitHub, you'll first complete the Transmogrify activities. These activities will enable you to upload a photo in the public file system (WNFS) and run <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">Tensor Flow.js</a> over it. This adds the signature ODD eyeballs to the image over the eyes of the person in the image (this mostly works for people, but we've also seen it work on illustrations!). </p>The ODD Haskell High Priestess<p>First, create a public avatars directory path. Then, create the directory on your local machine and verify it is in your local file system.</p><p>Now it's time to complete the Summon activities. Summon enables the gallery view. The activities are similar to the previous ones, with an additional activity enabling the "delete" function. When finished, you can view your transmogrified image in the gallery. There is also a link to the image hosted on IPFS. </p> Served with Your Choice of Nodes <p>IPFS doesn't persist an image - instead, it assigns it a CID (content identifier in the form of a hash) and enables storage and sharing across the nodes in the network. Over time, if a file isn't being requested very often, eventually, it will be "garbage collected" and removed from the node to make room for other content. To ensure that your files remain on IPFS, you must use a "pinning" service to persist them. When you use ODD SDK, Fission persists (or pins) them to our node. (NOTE: We don't run a paid pinning service, but we currently offer complementary pinning to ODD SDK users). </p><p>However, if you choose to move your content to another node or change the delivery gateway, all of this can be done very easily! For example, to change the delivery gateway, you only need to change the domain in the code and refresh the ODD Avatars app. When you click on the IPFS link, you'll see it's using a different gateway. The content is being pulled temporarily to the node behind that gateway. But again, make sure to use a pinning service if this is content that you wish to keep around! </p><p>Fission will never lock you into our services, and we always build to open source and interoperable standards. </p> Collect Your Favorite Avatars <p>This activity utilizes the public file system in WNFS. Since all the files are public, you can use the CIDs of those files and add them to your own gallery. Currently, there is no way to search for CIDs in IPFS (<a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-nns/">though we're working on it!</a>), but if you know the CID, you can plug it into the function we built into the app. </p> <p>This was a lot of fun to put together, and we hope you enjoy making your own ODD avatars. We'd love to see what you come up with! Tag us on social media so we can see your ODD creations.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/dwebcamp-workshop-2023">Workshop Code</a></p><p><a href="https://ugly-thick-brass-whale.fission.app/">ODD Avatars App</a></p><p>And if you'd like to learn more about ODD SDK, you can visit the <a href="https://odd.dev/">website</a> or join the #ODDSDK channel on <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Discord</a>.</p>

   The Antidote to Costly Security Risks and Unhappy Customers is Enterprise-Grade Digital Identity 
	
<p>For five years running, the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=reports&amp;utm_content=2023-breach-report_healthcare_blog">ForgeRock Identity Breach Report</a> has uncovered the fact that cybercriminals target healthcare more than any other industry. Attackers aim for the path of least resistance, and, According to Accenture,<a>1</a> the call center has become that path due to legacy and siloed authentication processes and technology. The security risks associated with healthcare call center, front desk, and help desk authentication include weak passwords and credentials, insider threats, social engineering, unauthorized access, and account takeover (ATO).</p>

<p>The customer experience authenticating with traditional healthcare call centers, front desks, and help desks is similarly poor. Customers often have to repeat their weak credentials at multiple points within their journey – a frustrating experience that diminishes customer confidence and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Overhauling call center authentication security and experiences may seem daunting, but with the right digital identity solution, healthcare leaders can realize significant cost savings and profit gains.</p>

<p>For example, a recently commissioned study, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/186-roi-new-total-economic-impacttm-study">Forrester® Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) of ForgeRock CIAM</a>, shows that over three years, healthcare enterprises could achieve:</p>

  40% reduction in security-related calls to the call center 
   $4.7M reduction in costs associated with fraud 
   400% increase in customer engagement 
   133% increase in customer conversions 
 <p>ForgeRock offers enterprise-grade digital identity security solutions that not only protect healthcare customers and enterprises from breaches, fraud, and ransomware, they also enable great call center, front desk, and help desk experiences. These include:</p>

 CIBA and Secure Impersonation 
<p>Rather than having callers answer weak authentication questions, client-initiated backchannel authentication (CIBA) enables front-desk, call-center, and help-desk representatives to authenticate callers with methods such as sending a prompt via a mobile app or text. CIBA also enables secure impersonation, which, upon an authentication prompt, allows consumers to hand over temporary control over their account to another party, such as a call-center agent, for a set period of time. Both of these security methods make it much harder for fraudsters to achieve their mission.</p>

 Passwordless and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> eliminates the need for a password during authentication using a variety of alternatives, such as passkeys, biometrics, or by gathering contextual authenticators such as device, IP address, geo-location, and so on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/multifactor-authentication">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> validates a user's identity through multiple authentication mechanisms in addition to standard login credentials. These may include a push notification or biometrics like facial recognition or Touch ID.</p>

 No-Code Identity Orchestration With Continuous, Contextual Authentication 
<p>To predict whether fraud is likely requires context. ForgeRock offers a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">no-code identity orchestration engine</a> that enables administrators to design authentication journeys for all users that detect anomalies both before and after authentication. Anomaly detection goes on behind the scenes and is invisible to legitimate users; their experience isn't impacted. Suspicious actors, on the other hand, are required to provide added proof of their identity.</p>

 Autonomous Access 
<p>Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a> is a threat protection solution that helps healthcare security leaders prevent <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover (ATO)</a> and fraud at all points of authentication. It uses AI to analyze threat signals and anomalous behavior patterns, and provides risk scores to help stop bad actors in real time. AI-informed risk scores can be incorporated into the design of call-center and help-desk journeys, allowing healthcare security leaders to remove unwanted friction and improve the experience of legitimate users.</p>

 Autonomous Identity 
<p>Internal actors are the second-highest cause for healthcare breaches.<a>2</a> ForgeRock Autonomous Identity leverages AI to disrupt the traditional, static identity governance models used to grant workforce access by looking at an organization's entire entitlement landscape. It then provides insights to make informed provisioning and governance decisions, and identifies high-risk areas that may require more governance. This helps healthcare security leaders significantly reduce the number of users that have access to things they shouldn't.</p>

<p>ForgeRock's enterprise-grade digital identity capabilities, listed above, can address risks and vulnerabilities to significantly improve healthcare call center, front desk, and help desk security while enhancing end-user experiences.</p>

<p>What’s the secret to overcoming common roadblocks when implementing Zero Trust</p>
<p>The concept of Zero Trust dates back more than a decade, when forward-thinking CIOs realized that digital expansion was making perimeter-based security obsolete. As digital connections with acquisitions, contractors, customers, banks, government agencies, and business partners proliferated, the traditional wall of security surrounding the enterprise became increasingly porous. The global pandemic accelerated trends like remote work and work from home, extending the perimeter to remote locations and people’s homes, making security extremely difficult to manage with traditional perimeter-based technology, identity, and policy frameworks.</p>
<p>As enterprise technologies moved to the cloud and remote worker populations soared, the need for security beyond the traditional perimeter took on greater urgency. In 2010, a Forrester researcher – let’s give John Kindervag his due credit – crafted the term “Zero Trust” to describe a modern framework for enterprise security in a perimeter-less ecosystem. Kindervag made it clear that Zero Trust could not be achieved through a single product or technology. Rather, the framework guided a highly disciplined approach that called for all users, devices, and systems to be authenticated before connecting, then continually verified while engaged with accessing networks, systems, and data.</p>
<p>Growing risk drives big talk, but little action on Zero Trust</p>
<p>That was 13 years ago. Since then, we’ve seen cybercrime become an <a href="https://itbrief.com.au/story/cyber-crime-costing-the-world-8-trillion-every-year#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20by%20Cybersecurity,space%20to%20protect%20cyber%20rights.">$8T (USD)</a> annual industry, <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/05/the-devastating-business-impacts-of-a-cyber-breach#:~:text=The%20latest%20IBM%20Data%20Breach,one%20data%20breach%20during%202022.">83% of organizations</a> have suffered a breach, and the average cost of those events has surpassed $4.5M (USD). Analysts warn that cybercrime will surge to even higher levels as hackers increasingly add the power of quantum computing and tools such as phishing-as-a-service and ransomware-as-a-service to their arsenals. Most cyber incidents can be tracked back to compromised credentials and security frameworks not planning for cyber resilience – i.e how to ensure business continuity in case of a breach.</p>
<p>And yet, adoption of Zero Trust principles has been slow due to several factors:</p>
 
 Fuzzy line of sight to business outcomes: IT and security professionals have been challenged to create a line of sight between Zero Trust implementation and goals for the business. 
 Big bang IT project orientation: With limited budgets and a long-term shortage of cybersecurity staff, moving to a strategy where every user, device, system, and application represents a new perimeter can appear daunting – and easy to put off until more time and more resources are available. 
 Cyber insurance was sufficient: We’ve seen in some the attitude that risk of a cybersecurity incident is tolerable – and the cost would be covered by cyber-insurance policies. 
 
<p>Finally, there remains confusion over what Zero Trust is. Technology vendors get some of the blame here, often presenting Zero Trust as a tech re-platform project, rather than an infosecurity paradigm shift, where you can measure and plan your road to maturity.</p>
<p>No more. Today, we’re clearly at an inflection point. In the U.S., the White House has directed federal agencies to adopt Zero Trust principles by 2024. And the release of the latest Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/zero-trust-maturity-model">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> has moved the concept from buzzword to blueprint, providing that roadmap for addressing the key pillars of a Zero Trust architecture. Version 2 of the model adds an additional maturity level, recognizing the fact that getting to an optimal maturity level is a huge leap for any organization. Enterprises are rapidly engaged as well, with PwC reporting that 36% of CISOs say they’ve already started to implement components of Zero Trust and another 25% plan to start in the next two years.</p>
<p>But achieving maturity will take time; Zero Trust is a journey and an ongoing effort to coninuously improve and enforce controls. CISA makes it clear that there is no one solution to get to Zero Trust maturity, and that implementation will take strategic backing, time, and investment. The upside: With each step a maturity model approach enables improvement to the organization’s risk posture.</p>
<p>Breaking through roadblocks to overcome inertia</p>
<p>Success requires two high-level commitments – with a number of practical steps to support them. The first comes from the board or C-suite. No senior leaders or board members are unaware of the cost and ubiquity of cyberattacks. They get it. IT is the environment for innovation, the conduit for sales, the connectivity to customers, and the engine for market expansion. Boards and CEOs need to invest in digital infrastructure like it’s the core business, not just departmental overhead. Building the business case for that mindset shift requires a dedicated strategy on the part of IT and security leaders.</p>
<p>The second commitment is patience – across the enterprise. Start by evaluating your current state, and from there plan out how you will grow into a Zero Trust posture – rather than simply buying a new tech platform and, inevitably, underdelivering on results. Getting to Zero Trust maturity require integration of carefully selected and integrated security technologies. But you can’t deploy a new tech stack and say, “Check Zero Trust off the list.” What you can do is work with your team and your partners to make sure the tech meets you at your Zero Trust maturity level. Your IT security teams and business leaders need to be in sync with an evolving framework that gets smarter, more agile, and more secure over time.</p>
<p>These two high-level commitments provide the sustained momentum for change. But building an effective Zero Trust framework requires strategic guidance to funnel that momentum in the right direction. Entrust has helped a number of organizations design, launch, and maintain their frameworks over the past several years. We’ve collected several insights and best practices from those engagements and distilled them into a quick-read ebook titled “Building a Solid Foundation for Your Zero Trust Framework.” You can download the ebook <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/ebook/entrust-report-zerotrust-eb.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>As a leader in the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>analytics and anti-money laundering (AML) sector, Coinfirm not only provides solutions for businesses to stay compliant and secure but also helps victims of cryptocurrency fraud through our project, ReclaimCrypto.com. Here, we offer victims a platform to report crypto crimes and assist them in the possible recovery of their stolen assets. In this article, we delve deep into the data from ReclaimCrypto.com to identify the shifting trends in cryptocurrency-related crime over the past five years.</p>



<p>The data, reflecting the percentage of claims associated with different cryptocurrencies from 2019 to 2023, provides a comprehensive view of the changing landscape of crypto crimes. This analysis identifies notable trends and anomalies that offer a clearer understanding of how the crypto-crime scenario has evolved over the years.</p>



 Declining Bitcoin Claims: 



<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency, unsurprisingly, featured heavily in the claims in the earlier years. In 2019, Bitcoin accounted for 39% of all claims, which surged to a peak of 66% in 2020. However, the percentage of Bitcoin-related claims has shown a consistent decline since then, falling to 35% in 2021, then to 21% in 2022, and finally to 28% in 2023. This trend could be attributed to increased awareness and security enhancements around Bitcoin transactions, but also to the growing diversity in the crypto market.</p>



 Varying Ethereum Claims: 



<p>Ethereum (ETH) claims have varied over the years, starting at 8% in 2019, peaking at 22% in 2021, and dropping to 14% in 2023. The popularity of Ethereum for smart contracts and the rise of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) projects built on its platform could account for the peak in 2021.</p>



 Emergence of Binance Coin (BNB) Claims: 



<p>Interestingly, Binance Coin (BNB) claims made their first appearance in 2021, accounting for 5% of claims, and maintaining that proportion in 2022. As Binance Smart Chain’s native token, BNB’s growing involvement in fraudulent activities could be tied to the rapid expansion of the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem and its increasing adoption.</p>



 Resurgence of Ripple (XRP) Claims: 



<p>Ripple (XRP) claims have remained relatively low, accounting for 5% in 2019, falling to 4% in 2020, and then further reducing to a negligible presence in 2021 and 2022. However, 2023 witnessed a resurgence of XRP claims, rising back to 4%.</p>



 Rising Tether (USDT) Claims: 



<p>Most notably, the percentage of Tether (USDT) claims, a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar, saw a significant increase over the years. Starting from a mere 3% in 2020, the USDT-related claims rose to 7% in 2021, then significantly jumped to 19% in 2022, and finally reached a peak of 32% in 2023.</p>



<p>The surge in USDT-related claims is noteworthy, as it marks the increasing involvement of stablecoins in crypto crimes. Tether (USDT), being a stablecoin, is designed to maintain a stable value against a specific asset or a pool of assets, most commonly USD. The appeal of stablecoins lies in their ability to provide stability in a highly volatile crypto market. They allow users to escape volatility without exiting the cryptocurrency space entirely, and hence have seen widespread adoption for transactions, trading, andvalue storage.</p>



<p>The increased use of USDT in fraudulent activities could be attributed to several reasons. First, the widespread adoption of USDT might have attracted criminals due to its high liquidity and ubiquity across exchanges, making it easier for them to move funds while avoiding detection.</p>



<p>Second, the relative stability of USDT may provide an additional layer of security for fraudsters. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, whose value might drastically fluctuate, the value of stolen USDT is relatively stable, reducing the risk for criminals holding these assets.</p>



<p>Third, the perception that stablecoins, being pegged to real-world assets, are somehow ‘safer’ or ‘less traceable’ might be playing into this trend. It’s important to debunk such misconceptions and continue to improve the tracking of stablecoin transactions in the fight against crypto crimes.</p>



<p>Finally, the rise in DeFi and yield farming platforms, many of which use USDT as a base currency, might have also indirectly contributed to the increase in USDT-related claims. As more users engage with these platforms, the opportunities for fraud also increase, leading to a higher number of reported incidents.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that while we have seen an increase in USDT-related claims, it does not necessarily imply that the USDT network itself is less secure. Rather, it’s a reflection of its widespread usage and certain characteristics that might be exploited by bad actors. Despite these challenges, we are confident that with continuous improvements in tracking technologies and regulatory practices, we can tackle this issue effectively.</p>



<p>As we continue to navigate the ever-evolving crypto landscape, it’s crucial to stay vigilant and informed. At Coinfirm, we are committed to aiding in the fight against crypto fraud and providing support for victims of these crimes. Through continuous innovation, advanced tracking technologies, and regulatory partnerships, we strive to make the crypto world a safer place for all.</p>

<p>Dhiway is abuzz this week.</p>



<p>We have all been excited, nervous, pumped, and more. Who knew a rebrand would have this effect? But before this turns into a gushy session, let us take you through all the fun parts.</p>



 <br>How it all started! 



<p>Sometime last year, we were working on creating new offerings, launching version 2 of our Blockchain (The fastest, most scalable blockchain in town – a humble brag?) and our new wallet application.</p>



<p>And as we were juggling all this, one of the founders said out loud ‘How do we really make our clients understand all this?’ Not everyone understands tech. And honestly, we were very close to our work – read ‘really really close’. And why not, it was our baby. But now it was time to bring in a sounding board. Enter Small Town Folk (STF) – the design agency we worked on the rebrand with.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>Digging deeper than deep tech 



<p>Although we all knew what we did at Dhiway, it was not articulated in a common language. So STF and us did several workshops to answer numerous questions related to our business, our offerings, and even the most existential question – our why?</p>



<p>But every time we started, we came up with too many answers. All of us had the same sentiment but a different articulation.</p>



<p>“Maybe we should just document the building blocks” – said a team member. So we locked ourselves in a room and just started whiteboarding.</p>



<p>Finally ending up with this. Some documentation this …. phew!</p>







<p>The clarity of putting something down on paper can’t be underestimated. We understood the relationship between Dhiway, Cord &amp; Mark. A proper brand architecture was now ready.</p>



 <br>And now back to the big one – The Why? 



<p>“At the end of your life, what fundamental impact would you have made on this world?”</p>



<p>This powerful question got the most passion out of us. Someone said ‘Dhiway would be fundamental to our lives’ others said ‘Dhiway will put power back in the hands of the people’. And then the aha moment – ‘Dhiway would make the digital world comparable to or better than the current physical world’</p>



<p></p>



<p>Hold on…. this is interesting. So this meant</p>



 
 The current digital world is not comparable to the physical world 



 Which meant that there is mistrust in the current digital world 



 This translates to – the current digital world in its current form is broken 
 



<p>And voila our brand purpose</p>







 <br>Swiftly moving on to The How 



<p>By now it was very clear what we were solving for.</p>



 
 Dhiway is about friction-free interactions 



 Dhiway is about population-scale technology 



 Dhiway is about collaborations 



 Dhiway is about ever-adaptive solutions 
 



<p>We needed a single narrative that tied it all together. Easy right? </p>



<p>Introducing Dhiway’s brand promise…. (Drum rolls)</p>



 “Reshaping the digital world” 



<p>At first glance, it seemed right. We shared it with our existing investors &amp; select people in our ecosystem. It seemed right to them as well.</p>



<p>Did we just crack our narrative? I think we did. Clap Clap</p>



 <br>Wait…..there’s more – A new brand identity? 



<p>You know those conversations that rain on your parade? Ours goes something like this.</p>



<p>“What about the logo?”</p>



<p>“The logo? What about it?”</p>



<p>“You do know the logo talks about our Mark Studio &amp; verification story, don’t you? Shouldn’t the logo reflect our new brand narrative”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this was true. Our identity was designed when we launched MarkStudio. And that’s when it dawned on us.</p>



<p>We were only half there!</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">Biometric authentication</a> refers to the automated capture of an individual’s unique characteristics, which are then saved and encrypted into a security system. When the user logs in, their biometrics will be recaptured to verify their identity and provide access.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Biometric authentication can use any of the following body parts:</p> 
  
  Fingerprint  
  Palm print  
  Face  
  Voice  
  
<p>This technology is being leveraged in place of or to supplement simple passwords on smart devices, transport, banking, and more.&nbsp;</p> 
 Credentials  
<p>Possession-based authentication leverages personal credentials that are unique to the user. They are usually information saved on hardware that only the owner controls.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some examples of possession-based credentials include:</p> 
  
  Software tokens  
  Soft Token Software Development Kits or SDKs  
  Smart cards  
  Security keys  
  Mobile credentials  
  
<p>Credential authentication is complex and more difficult to compromise. However, malware attacks may lead to access to the hardware where the unique keys are found.&nbsp;</p> 
 Email OTPs and SMS  
<p>Most websites or apps require users to register an email address or mobile number, often both. Whenever you try to access your account, two-factor authentication will be triggered, and a one-time pin (OTP) will be sent to your mobile number or email address. You must enter the OTP into the login system within a certain period.</p> 
<p>Some sites send multiple OTPs or use authentication apps to generate random codes. It should be noted that these methods are discouraged by the OMB, CISA and other agencies as they are <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">susceptible to phishing and interception</a>.</p> 
 Magic Links  
<p>Similar to OTPs, if you have a registered email address or mobile number, the site or app will send a magic link that will give you access to your account. Similar to OTPs, these can pose security risks.</p> 
 Push Notification  
<p>Users receive a push notification to their device, which serves as verification of their identity. When the user clicks the notification, they will gain access to their account.</p> 
 Benefits of Using Passwordless Technology  
<p>According to a study, <a href="https://fox8.com/business/press-releases/globenewswire/8825620/composecure-launches-security-awareness-campaign/#">90% of internet users are worried</a> that their accounts will be <a href="https://dialanerd.co.za/5-ways-hackers-can-get-into-your-network">hacked due to weak passwords</a>. Weak passwords have been identified as a leading cause of data breaches in numerous studies.</p> 
<p>While a <a href="https://cybernews.com/best-vpn/cheapest-vpn/">reliable VPN</a> or Cloud DLP can help curb security breaches, protection and security can be improved with passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It’s about time sites and apps leverage passwordless technology to protect user data. Here are the benefits of such methods of authentication:</p> 
 Better Security Protection  
<p>Most users only have one password for every site and app that they use. This is a well-known security risk, but many still do it as the alternative is more complicated for them to attempt.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With hackers becoming more sophisticated by the day, simple or complex passwords are no longer dependable as protection. When a cyber attacker breaches one password, multiple accounts become vulnerable. An individual can lose money or their identity in an instant. And when it happens to a company, it can lead to millions of dollars in losses.&nbsp;</p> 
 Reduced Long-Term Costs  
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/12/11/go-passwordless-strengthen-security-reduce-costs/">Passwords are expensive to manage</a>, according to Microsoft. Why? Because users often forget them, and constantly resetting them leads to a loss of productivity when the user can’t sign in. Based on Microsoft’s experience, there are associated hard costs for every hour the Microsoft Helpdesk administrator helps a single user figure out or reset a password.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Since rolling out passwordless technology, Microsoft experienced an 87% reduction in soft and hard costs, estimated at $6 million and $3 million, respectively.&nbsp;</p> 
 Better User Experience  
<p>Most passwordless technologies provide better user experiences. Biometrics, for example, is easy to accomplish each time, with just a touch of a finger or a glance at a camera. Users gain access to their accounts in no time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Compliance With Regulatory Bodies  
<p>Regulatory bodies like the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) have a set of standards that industry players must satisfy when it comes to access controls in a bid to protect sensitive data.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The most common requirements are multi-factor authentication, encryption, and hashing. Passwordless authentication will achieve all these and more. When complemented with automatic bot detection and secure session management, it can prevent broken authentication attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
 What To Look for in Passwordless Authentication Technology  
<p>Now that you know how important passwordless authentication is in the digital age, let’s look at the basic requirements when shopping for solutions.&nbsp;</p> 
 MFA for Desktop Login  
<p>While much passwordless authentication is used for mobile apps, it is best to look for vendors with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for desktop logins. For one, most employees work with desktops in the office. This is also a legal requirement of the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices/executive-order-improving-nations-cybersecurity#:~:text">Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The work login must be complemented with offline capabilities so employees can maintain access while traveling or working remotely.&nbsp;</p> 
 Certifications  
<p>Passwordless technology providers obtain specific certifications as proof of their efficacy and credibility. Some of the top certifications for the technology include:</p> 
  
  <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST Authenticator Assurance Level</a> - a NIST authentication process with three levels: AAL1 provides some assurance, AAL2 provides high confidence, and AAL3 provides very high confidence.&nbsp;  
  
  
  <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO Certification</a> - the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) alliance grants certification to validate a product’s conformance and interoperability.  
  
  
  <a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa">CISA Certification</a> - the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) certifies companies that audit, control, monitor, and assess an organization’s IT and business systems.  
  
 Easy to Deploy  
<p>Using brand-new technology could disrupt productivity and may even intimidate employees. Find solutions that are easy to integrate into your operations so you can launch the system as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Passwordless technology with a robust SDK is easy to integrate. It should have built-in security controls for optimal functionality.&nbsp;</p> 
 Are Passwords a Thing of the Past?  
<p>Not quite yet, as passwords are still used in many sites and applications. But they are no longer dependable on their own as cybercriminals become more creative and sophisticated in breaching passwords.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Passwordless technology is no longer a luxury; it is the present. Elevated authentication technology will be the future.</p>

 Now that the white paper has been released and the UKGC has outlined its plans, what do players and operators need to know? 



 



<p>After much frustration and numerous delays, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK’s Gambling Act White Paper </a>was finally released in April 2023. The white paper, which contains proposed changes to the UK’s Gambling Act 2005, aims to more accurately reflect gambling in the digital age, by addressing issues related to VIP customers, slot limits, financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks), and other facets of the UK’s gambling sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the policy paper, many of the main measures will be effective by the summer of 2024. So, as the government initiates a series of consultations to convert policy into practical measures, what challenges lie ahead for the UK gambling sector, and how should UK gambling operators be prepared for the new era?</p>



<p>Numerous conferences and webinars featuring high-profile personnel with close connections to the gambling industry have also been held since April to discuss the white paper’s proposals. The much-anticipated document has certainly given the gambling industry plenty to think about, with many gambling operators pondering how best to react.&nbsp;</p>



 The UK Gambling Commission’s 3-year plan. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission (UKGC)</a>, which will work toward implementing the proposals in the coming years, has recently disclosed its <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/evidence-gaps-and-priorities-2023-2026">Evidence Gaps and Priorities</a> program, set to run from 2023 to 2026, mapping out areas in the UK gambling sector requiring further data collection and research.</p>



<p>In reference to <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/evidence-gaps-and-priorities-2023-2026#:~:text=The%20document%20outlines%20a%20cohesive%20and%20consistent%20framework%20for%20improving%20the%20evidence%20base%2C%20in%20line%20with%20our%20regulatory%20duties">its plan</a>, the UKGC states: “The document outlines a cohesive and consistent framework for improving the evidence base, in line with our regulatory duties.”</p>



<p>The UKGC also plans to enhance its research and evidence-based principles over the next three years, highlighting collaboration and transparency with the <a href="https://www.gamcare.org.uk/about-us/get-involved/lived-experience-forum/#:~:text=The%20Lived%20Experience%E2%80%AFForum%E2%80%AFis%20a%20group%20of%20people%E2%80%AFwho%20have%20been%20affected%20by%20gambling%20related%20harm%20which%20helps%20to%20influence%20wider%20developments%20in%20the%20prevention%2C%20support%2C%20and%20treatment%20of%20gambling%20harms%20at%20GamCare.%C2%A0">Lived Experience Forum</a>, which brings together a group of people that have lived experience of gambling related harms, either from their own gambling or from someone else’s. One of their chief aims is to share stories and insights to help influence wider developments in the prevention, support, and treatment of gambling harms.</p>



<p>The UKGC has designated six key themes of research that will function as the primary focus of its investigations:</p>



  The impact of operator practices<br>  Early gambling-related experiences and gateway products<br>  The variability and range of gambling experiences<br>  Harms and vulnerability related to gambling<br>  Gambling product characteristics and their risks<br>  Illegal gambling, fraud, and crime  



<p>Ultimately, the research process is set to examine how players respond to different gambling-related activities and the associated potential hazards. The Commission looks to understand the variability and range of different gambling experiences. For example, how betting on slots and sports betting can produce dramatically different behavior.</p>



<p>The UKGC also seeks to further its knowledge of the adverse impacts of gambling and the elements contributing to player vulnerability. By determining such potential hazards, they hope to create effective strategies that will potentially protect vulnerable individuals and safeguard them from harm.</p>



<p>With the UK’s gambling white paper now released, the Commission believes the coming years will provide more opportunities to make genuine progress toward making gambling in the UK fairer, safer, and free from crime.</p>



 How can operators prepare for the new UK gambling laws? 



<p>Operators can prepare by reviewing their ongoing policies and practices. This includes ensuring they comply with all relevant laws and regulations and identifying areas that might benefit from change. For instance, increasing the use of KYC checks. It is also crucial for operators to stay updated on any developments in the white paper, including any new proposals or updates to existing regulations.</p>



<p>According to panelist Chris Elliot, partner at law firm Wiggin, in a recent <a href="https://webinars.igamingbusiness.com/iGB/Hitting-the-jackpot-or-coming-up-short-Has-the-Gambling-white-paper-really-hit-the-mark?bmid=7936f8c37ba3">webinar</a> held by iGB in partnership with the Department of Trust, operators will face an imminent demand to figure out which consultations are most impactful for their business. As a short-term response, operators can focus, in the next few months or years, on which consultations matter. Overall, Elliot noted that the white paper presents operators with a clear and coherent policy direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial risk checks are perhaps the major cause of anxiety, with many licensees rowing back from offering VIP or loyalty clubs at online casinos. VIP services are designed to reward customers who spend large sums of money. However, after a report in 2020 that narrowed in on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/02/gambling-report-shows-industrys-reliance-on-loss-making-customers#:~:text=One%20of%20its%20rivals%20took,blow%20to%20the%20industry's%20revenues.">industry’s reliance on problem gamblers</a>, some operators decided to remove VIP schemes altogether.</p>



<p>The now obligated<a href="https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2023/global/gambling-white-paper#:~:text=Unsurprisingly%2C%20the%20white%20paper%20proposes%20new%20obligations%20on%20operators%20to%20conduct%20%E2%80%9Cfinancial%20risk%20checks%E2%80%9D%20on%20customers%20who%20may%20be%20at%20risk%20of%20harm%20due%20to%20unaffordable%20and%20unsustainable%20gambling%20losses"> financial risk checks</a> are likely to significantly impact the quality of the gaming experience. Operators must now carry out financial checks if players incur a £125 net loss within a month or a £500 net loss in a year, with the most rigorous checks effective at a £1000 net loss in one day or £2000 net loss in 90 days.</p>



<p>Bodies such as the <a href="https://www.britishhorseracing.com/">British Horseracing Authority</a> questioned how intrusive these checks might be. However, ministers were quick to emphasize their desire for the checks to be as frictionless as possible. Consequently, operators must conduct these checks with the least friction possible or risk losing customers to other brands where checks feel less intrusive. Operators failing to comply with the new financial risk checks and keeping up to date with new requirements <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/featurednews/2023/05/02/white-paper-finance-risk/#:~:text=Operators%20could%2C%20therefore%2C%20be%20wary%20of%20the%20new%20finance%20risk%20checks%20and%20ensure%20they%20keep%20up%20to%20speed%20with%20new%20requirements%20to%20avoid%20fines.%C2%A0">could risk fines</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC will also undertake consultation on design rules for online gaming products, to take into account the impact of features such as the speed of play, the illusion of player control, and other features prone to heighten risk.</p>



<p>Considered a high-risk product, online slots are typically associated with long, binge sessions, large losses, and no statutory stake limits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, stake limits will be introduced, consulting on a limit ranging from £2-£15 per spin. Greater protections have also been considered for 18-24-year-old players who are considered more vulnerable, e.g., options of a £2 stake or £4 stake limit per spin or a separate approach predicated on individual risk.</p>



 Who wants to be a VIP anyway? 



<p>There are two parts of the white paper that, either intentionally or not, will heavily impact the online gaming experience of VIPs or high-spending customers: slot limits and financial risk checks. It is highly likely, therefore, that the operators that are currently offering services to VIPS may decide to change tact, and refocus on the mass market.</p>



<p>However, although the now compulsory slot limits will make the process of attracting high rollers more challenging, gambling platforms shouldn’t necessarily neglect this player base. After all, the problem doesn’t lie with high rollers, who can afford to gamble significant amounts, but the one-size fits all approach. Operators must therefore look for innovative ways of offering VIP services, rather than just avoiding offering them altogether. It is therefore crucial for such consultations to find a voice for all customers. Operators need to put customers at the forefront.</p>



 3 further steps toward the new UK gambling laws.&nbsp; 



<p>To prepare for the new, updated and more accountable UK gambling landscape, operators should focus on three specific areas to ensure they meet new and upcoming compliance requirements:</p>


 
 
 
 Evidence 
 

<p>Evidence will remain a keyword for the next five years for the UKGC, and should be for operators too, who must now provide evidence of the decisions they make and the programs they implement.</p>

 
 
 
 Innovation 
 

<p>Innovation will become the answer to many of the challenges posed by the white paper, particularly open banking: one of the key drivers for innovation, alongside  artificial intelligence.</p>

 
 
 
 Collaboration 
 

<p>Collaboration will be essential across different business units and operations to effectively utilize innovative technologies. The goal is to protect consumers and enhance operations by automating processes, all while ensuring consistency and coherence in a thorough and comprehensive manner.</p>

 
 
 
 


 How can operators prepare for the future? 



<p>As further regulatory changes come into play, and new global markets continue to slowly but surely open up, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gambling-latam/">Brazil</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/">Canada</a>, one key way that operators can prepare for the future is by incorporating robust identity verification technology that enables operators to conduct thorough <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer checks</a>. Many current IDV platforms utilize the latest data analytics tools to ensure their players are who they say they are, the age they claim to be, and with the financial means they claim to have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another crucial consideration for operators is the need to focus on and further enhance responsible gambling practices. The key to preparing for the future of the UK’s gambling industry is to be agile, innovative, collaborative, and focused on offering the best possible customer experience.</p>



<p>Our highly configurable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">platform for identity proofing in the gaming market</a> allows operators to keep abreast of constantly changing regulations, and new fraud schemes and scams, while ensuring a safe, secure and seamless gaming experience. With our latest round of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/platform-automated-document-liveness-data-check-uk/">platform enhancements</a>, we now offer UK-specific data checks, and financial risk checks, which provide operators with insights into a player’s affordability indicators to comply with the latest updates to the UK Gambling Act.</p>



<p>This not only helps businesses avoid potential fines and reputational damage, but also allows for ongoing monitoring of changes in player circumstances and verification of reported income without the need for additional documentation.</p>

   2023 ForgeRock Breach Report underscores the need for AI-powered identity 

<p>We are excited to announce the release of our fifth annual <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">ForgeRock Identity Breach Report</a>. Our goal each year is to discover what's trending — how enterprises are being breached, how many records are being exposed, and how attackers are getting past security controls that cost companies roughly $88 billion a year.<a>1</a></p>

<p>As in previous years' reports, we have published our key findings, including the industries most vulnerable to attack, the rising costs, and the leading cause of breaches (unauthorized access wins that dubious honor once again!). But this year's report revealed one trend we have not seen before: a significant drop in the number of breached records. In fact, the number was the lowest we've seen in five years. So can we infer that the bad guys are giving up, taking their keyboards and going home? If only!</p>

<p>An obvious challenge of storing so much sensitive personal information in digital form is that this data is highly valuable to criminals. And it appears in the last year that they've been going for quality over quantity – the number of records containing protected health information (PHI) rose by 160%. Why? Because a single healthcare record in the U.S. is now fetching $675 on the black market. Such records can be used widely for fraud, from filing false insurance claims to obtaining prescription drugs illegally. No wonder healthcare is the most highly targeted sector, accounting for 36% of all breaches.</p>

 An emerging threat: they're using AI to devise new attacks (and we can use AI to stop them) 

<p>This year, we've all been hearing a lot about generative AI, which produces various types of content, including text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data. Expect to hear a lot more about how generative AI makes it easier to impersonate others and perpetrate fraud.</p>

<p>Researchers recently discovered underground hacking communities using ChatGPT to generate malware, create encryption suitable for ransomware, and devise other fraudulent schemes. The new AI wave is contributing to a huge increase in voice and video deepfakes.</p>

<p>As criminals find novel ways to use AI, we can use AI to thwart their efforts. Decisioning AI, which fuels our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a> product, is essential for elevating protection against AI-based threats in a granular and responsive way.</p>

<p>AI that specializes in risk decisioning can take in a range of signals about who is trying to do what –&nbsp;and then determine what they can or cannot do next. Decisioning AI can also prevent attempts to gain unauthorized access by incorporating multiple contextual signals into the decision process, such as login location, IP network reputation, and the distance between login attempts and registered MFA devices.</p>

<p>Organizations with AI-powered identity and access management (IAM) can detect unexpected activity, stopping intruders in real time as they try to authenticate. They can also automate the process of eliminating over-provisioned access that enables attackers to use one compromised account to move laterally to higher-value targets.</p>

 Third-party attacks: do your partners' security practices measure up to yours? 

<p>The 2023 report shows how a tactic that emerged in last year's report is now routine: breaching high-value organizations through their third-party partners and vendors. These attacks increased 136% from the year before and accounted for more than half of all breaches this time around. Attackers know that hospitals, for example, face strict regulations for protecting patient data – but hospitals' suppliers may be less stringent.</p>

<p>In one breach alone, an accounts payable vendor supporting hundreds of healthcare organizations was the victim of a ransomware attack, which allowed attackers to access systems and documents containing patient-related data. The breach affected more than 657 healthcare organizations and almost two million people.</p>

<p>Poorly protected integrations between third-party suppliers and the organizations that rely on them — weak access controls, vulnerable API integrations, or a lack of MFA for employee accounts — can be used to exploit third-party providers. Without strong identity security and governance, API security, and a least-privileged access model, an attacker can breach one workforce user's account and move laterally, not just across a vendor's systems but also its partners' systems, to find and exploit valuable data.</p>

<p>Our report shows that ransomware and unauthorized access were the leading attack vectors in third-party service provider breaches.</p>

 High-value data needs high-quality protection at the identity perimeter 

<p>The underlying theme of this year's report is that it takes only one compromised credential to pave the way for unauthorized access and the exposure of sensitive data, including customer data. This is not news to most of us, but it's worth reasserting now, in light of so many attacks on partner ecosystems.</p>

<p>This trend means that every identity must be secured — not just your workforce users and contractors, but every identity in your partners' organizations as well. Implementing single sign-on (SSO), passwordless multi-factor authentication (MFA), and effective identity governance practices is vital for preventing unauthorized access. And this year we're seeing AI become essential in stopping breaches and for handling an onslaught of threats that are themselves AI-generated.</p>

<p>Dhiway has powered ON Sparknet, intending to enable developers with a platform to experiment with and build natively Web 3.0-ready applications.</p>



<p>Sparknet is built from the ground up using CORD. The project design is biased towards enabling modularity, decentralized governance, security and scalability. On Sparknet, developers can get the opportunity to build applications which leverage the key features.</p>



 
 Unique persistent cryptographic identifiers to better manage the representation of off-chain data. These persistent identifiers can help track the modifications to a diverse set of data objects, thus addressing some of the shortcomings of using hash-based systems. 



 On-chain delegations to enable the creation of delegation hierarchies for authorization and coordinated decision-making. 



 Creating dynamic data registries allows applications to build authenticated data sources, including collections of identifiers and data schemas. 
 



<p>CORD also introduces additional technological innovations that enhance trust in data exchange over the network. These include verifiable attributes, auditable history, and a comprehensive stack featuring tiered transactions, delegations, authorizations, and governance. The persistent identifiers available on CORD enable long-term verifiability, a requirement for sectors like supply chain management, healthcare, IP management, notarization services, public sector services and other systems where the capability to independently verify the integrity and authenticity of data over extended periods is crucial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sparknet is designed to provide a fully functional sandbox for application development. It comprises different types of nodes – boot node, full node, validator node and archive node. Today, the CORD project has pre-built binaries available, which can be used to get started quickly <a href="https://dhiway.notion.site/CORD-Sparknet-Deployment-643a902b3d714927b447f42b66c7f55e">view documentation</a>. Coming up – machine instances will be made available to reduce the time required for setting up a node and attaching it to a running network.</p>



<p>The CORD project and Sparknet have been designed to offer an improved experience of blockchain technology specifically for applications which need high scalability and throughput. Applications on Sparknet can be designed around the W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for use cases such as identity verification flows, data sharing and data exchange needs and controlling access to services.</p>



<p>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/yaGg4WFEVe">CORD community on Discord</a> to start today.</p>

<p>Fission is ecosystem-obsessed. We believe in collaboration over competition and use this approach to build protocols and invent new tools that benefit everyone. In some cases, we've initiated these efforts. In others, we're active contributors. But in everything, we strive to make the Web more sustainable, equitable, and secure.</p> Fission-Led Efforts <p>UCAN - <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">User Controlled Authorization Networks</a> are a secure way of handling authorization in a distributed system. They use capabilities rather than an access control list, removing the need for a centralized server. UCANs were created by Fission's Co-Founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, in 2019. <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/">The protocol is open source</a>, and the lovely team at <a href="https://web3.storage/">web3storage</a> has co-authored UCAN specs. Brendan from their team also created a <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/go-ucan/tree/master">go-ucan</a> implementation. We also run <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan">monthly community calls</a> where library implementers, spec maintainers, and users come together to ask questions and build out new features.</p><p>WNFS - Webnative File System is a versioned content-addressable distributed file system with private and public sub-systems. It offers concurrent writes and offline access. <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">The protocol is open source</a>, and we have worked with the community to build a <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/rs-wnfs">Rust implementation</a>. Special thanks to the <a href="https://banyan.computer/">Banyan</a> team, who worked on large files, and the <a href="https://fx.land/">Functionland</a> team, who worked on mobile. Functionland also made a React native version. </p><p>RhizomeDB - RhizomeDB is a far-edge database for querying decentralized data in local-first applications. <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">The protocol is open source</a> and currently under construction.</p><p>IPVM - The Interplanetary Virtual Machine brings content-addressed computation to IPFS using Wasm, PKI, and capabilities. IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability. <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">The protocol is open source</a>, and our friends on the <a href="https://www.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a> team have co-authored IPVM specs. We run <a href="https://lu.ma/ipvm">monthly community calls</a> where library implementers and users can collaborate to build out the VM. The <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">Homestar</a> Rust implementation is available today. </p><p>Distributed Systems Reading Group - The DSys RG is a monthly virtual meetup led by our Staff Research Engineer, Zeeshan, for folks interested in learning more about distributed systems. The group picks a paper to read each month (classic or contemporary), a volunteer presents a summary, and then a general discussion follows. Check out the YouTube <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfW9my7NCey_Adz2pUZFQdw7sp2mSiSbV">playlist</a> for call recordings. </p><p>Secure/Design Working Group - The Secure/Design WG is a product and UX-focused community seeking to make secure outcomes more probable in distributed systems. Initiated by Ryan, Fission's Head of Design, the group hosts <a href="https://lu.ma/calendar/cal-FOmHnDL7EZJ6P5F">monthly community calls</a> and has a <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/secure-design/discussions">GitHub discussion board</a>.</p> Places We Contribute <p>Filecoin - &nbsp;Filecoin is an open-source, public cryptocurrency and digital payment system intended to be a blockchain-based cooperative digital storage and data retrieval method. Fission is a member of the Permissioned Data Working Group, which is focused on enabling permissioned and private data on Filecoin. We're also a FIL Accounts Working Group member, working to integrate UCAN and WalletAuth into FIL Accounts in 2023.</p><p>Protocol Labs Network - The <a href="https://www.plnetwork.io/">PLN</a> comprises hundreds of DWeb and blockchain companies working together to enhance the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystems. Fission is deeply involved with the PLN, from events to the marketing council to building the PL Network Mastodon server. </p><p>CASA - The <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA">Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance</a> is a collection of working groups dedicated to blockchain protocol-agnostic standards. CASA also publishes <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs">Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposals</a>, which describe standards created by the different working groups to make blockchains interoperable. Fission initiated <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/issues/132">CAIP-25 RPC Methods</a> in response to MetaMask deprecating ETH encrypt/decrypt, and we are working with others in CASA to document a secure way for blockchain key material to be used for encryption and decryption.</p><p>IPFS - IPFS is a P2P hypermedia protocol that powers content-addressable data storage across a distributed network. Fission submitted one of the first accepted IPIPs, <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-redirect-support-for-ipfs/">Redirect Support for IPFS</a>.</p><p>In conclusion, Fission is involved in many ecosystem projects, with more in the works. If you're building in the distributed or decentralized web and want to work together, please join our Discord and let us know about your project. We'd love to see how we can support you! </p>

<p>Ping Identity, SailPoint, and BeyondTrust teamed up for the event to educate the ASEAN region on the latest workforce identity solutions. With over 600 registrants across 5 countries, the roadshow was one of the first times a group of identity solution providers worked together to introduce a full-fledged identity fabric to the ASEAN market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The roadshow focused on several key modern workforce cybersecurity topics while honing in specifically on the notion of the “identity trifecta.” Other topics of the roadshow included Zero Trust, as well as important workforce cybersecurity trends in the ASEAN region.</p>

<p>The goal of Bluesky is to turn social media into a shared public commons. We don’t want to own people’s social graphs or communities. We want to be a tool that helps communities own and govern themselves.</p>
<p>The reason we focus on communities is that for an open commons to work, there needs to be some sort of structure that protects the people who participate. Safety can’t just be left up to each individual to deal with on their own. The burden this puts on people — especially those who are most vulnerable to online abuse and harassment — is too high. It also doesn’t mirror how things work in the real world: we form groups and communities so that we can help each other. The tooling we’re building for moderation tries to take into consideration how social spaces are formed and shaped through communities.</p>
<p>Today, we’re publishing some proposals for new moderation and safety tooling. The first focuses on user lists and reply controls which can be used for community-driven moderation. The second will focus on moderator services and how they can handle problems that small communities can’t. The third is for Hashtags, which are not directly related to moderation but can have a large effect on customizing what you see. (We wanted to include this to distinguish between the labeling proposal, which is intended to address moderation, and mechanisms for discovery.)</p>

 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0003-hashtags">Hashtags</a> 
 
<p>These proposals are <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals">published on GitHub</a>, and we’d love to hear your feedback and discussion there. In the rest of this post, we want to first share some insight into why we believe a public commons is important for social media.</p>
 Why build a public commons? 
<p>We’re a public benefit company that was formed with the mission “to develop and drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open and decentralized public conversation.” We believe that public conversations, which form the basis of a democratic society, should be held in spaces that can be a shared public commons.</p>
<p>A company is an efficient structure for building out a cohesive vision of how things should work, but locking users into our systems would be antithetical to our mission. An open commons can’t be governed at the sole discretion of one global company. We offer services like professional moderators so that we can help protect people and provide a good experience, but we shouldn’t exert total control over everyone’s experience, for all time, with no alternative. Users should be able to walk away from us without walking away from their social lives.</p>
<p>The reason we’re building in decentralization is because we observed that business interests and the open web have a habit of coming into conflict. Third-party developers often get locked out. Moderation policies come into conflict with the diverse interests and needs of different groups of users. Ads push towards algorithms that optimize for engagement. It’s a systemic problem that keeps playing out as centralized social media companies rise and fall.</p>
<p>Some might think this isn’t a big deal. Maybe social media is like a club, and the place can be happening one day and dead the next. Would it be so bad if people just moved on to the next joint...? The problem is that people put their lives and livelihoods into these networks. When a network shuts down, people lose out on a lot: they lose their connections, they lose their creative work, and they lose their places of business. Social networks are not just products; they’ve become digital homes.</p>
<p>Even when things are working correctly on social platforms, there are weird dynamics caused by people’s relationships being mediated by a single company. The Internet is pretty obviously real life in the sense that its management has real-world consequences. When these places control our identities and our ability to connect and to make money, having no way out from the founding company is a precarious situation. The power difference is daunting.</p>
<p>The goal of Bluesky is to rebuild social networking so that there’s not a lock-in to the founding company, which is us. We can try to provide a cohesive, enjoyable experience, but there’s always an exit. Users can move their accounts to other providers. Developers can run their own connected infrastructure. Creators can keep access to their audiences. We hope this helps break the cycle of social media companies coming into conflict with the open web.</p>
 What should this feel like? 
<p>Social media has a reputation for being emotionally chaotic. Some days it can be fulfilling, and other days it can be a box of horrors. If we’re going to succeed in our mission of creating social media that operates as a sustainable public commons, these tools need to not just be good in theory, but actually help create a better social space than what has come before. Our goal for investing in moderation tooling and processes is to create a better public commons for conversations to take place in. Perhaps it can even be a happy, healthy, and predominantly enjoyable space.</p>
<p>Here’s some of what we think it takes to create a great experience:</p>
<p>A great experience should be simple to use. It shouldn’t be overly complex, and there should be sensible defaults and well-run entry points. If things are going well, the average user shouldn’t have to notice what parts are decentralized, or how many layers have come together to determine what they see. However, if conflict arises, there should be easy levers for individuals and communities to pull so that they can reconfigure their experience.</p>
<p>A great experience should recognize that toxicity is not driven only by bad actors. Good intentions can create runaway social behaviors that then create needless conflict. The network should include ways to downregulate behaviors – not just amplify them.</p>
<p>A great experience should respect the burden that community management can place on people. Someone who sets out to help protect others can quickly find themselves responsible for a number of difficult choices. The tooling that’s provided should take into account ways to help avoid burnout.</p>
<p>A great experience should find a balance between creating friendly spaces and over-policing each other. The impulse to protect can sometimes degrade into nitpicking. We should drive towards norms that feel natural and easy to observe.</p>
<p>A great experience should reflect the diversity of views within the network. Decisions that are subjective should be configurable. Moderation should not force the network into a monoculture.</p>
<p>Finally, a great experience should remember that social networking can be pleasant one day and harsh the next. There should be ways to react to sudden events or shifts in your mood. Sometimes you need a way to be online but not be 100% available.</p>
 What’s our development process? 
<p>During the private beta, we’ve been actively responding to user feedback. For example, based on user feedback, we recently introduced an optional “context” field to add a few lines of text to reports so that moderators can better understand issues that require more context to make a decision on. With these upcoming proposals, we’re looking for feedback ahead of time so we can get to the best outcomes quickly and prepare for opening up the network.</p>
<p>The proposals we’re publishing have been in the works for awhile; we focused on moderation and safety from the earliest moments of developing Bluesky and the AT Protocol, even if they didn’t always appear to be front and center. We’ve been fleshing out our ideas over the last few months through the practical experience of engaging with users during the Bluesky app’s beta. In designing these, we researched existing tooling implemented on other sites, discussed with users from different communities on the app, consulted with trust &amp; safety advisors, and above all, constantly asked ourselves what tools would reduce harm, protect people, and decrease the likelihood of bad outcomes.</p>
<p>Decisions such as who has the right to speak or moderate an online space are intrinsically controversial. And it isn’t just about platforms making moderation decisions. For example, the ability to moderate replies to your own threads introduces complex tradeoffs around safety, counterspeech, and accountability. Replies are an area where some of the nastiest forms of abuse can happen, so we felt that per-thread moderation was a good idea. But there are downsides, too: For example, if a thread contains misinformation, then giving reply controls to the author means they might use it to suppress corrections from other users. Our hypothesis, reflected in the moderation proposals we’re sharing, is that giving users more tools to protect themselves from harassment is worth some downsides like not always having the record corrected in the replies.</p>
<p>We’re presenting proposals for community discussion and developer feedback to help develop a rough consensus around these approaches — these tools won’t be effective unless people actually use them. They’re a set of tools that are meant to overlap, work together, and provide the building blocks for new ideas.</p>
 An updated Community Guidelines 
<p>In addition to working on moderation tooling, we’ve also been developing new policies and processes to moderate the services we run. As we explain in the community guidelines:</p>
<p>Bluesky Social is one service built on top of the AT Protocol. While we won’t always be able to control everything that happens on other services that use the AT Protocol, we take our responsibility to the users of Bluesky Social seriously. Our community guidelines are designed to promote a safe and enjoyable experience. To achieve this goal, we moderate the content on Bluesky Social, and you can also adjust content filters within the app according to your preferences.</p>
<p>An important site of moderation is the servers themselves, and we want our policies to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for users who enter the network through our services. If the moderation tooling we’re building is like the building blocks and foundations of a city, the norms and policies we’re setting are how we’re actually going to run the city.</p>
<p>For the Bluesky servers we run (that is, the Bluesky app you’ve been using up to this point), we’re publishing updated Community Guidelines next week, linked to in our Terms of Service, which includes the following:</p>
 
 Treat others with respect. For example, no:
 
 Threats of violence or physical harm, or content that encourages, promotes, or glorifies violence against people, groups, or animals 
 Repeated harassment or abuse directed at a specific person or group 
 Encouraging self-harm or suicide 
 Promoting hate or extremist conduct that targets people or groups based on their race, gender, religion, ethnicity, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation 
 Depictions of excessive violence, torture, dismemberment, or non-consensual sexual activity 
 Misleading impersonation of other individuals, organizations, or entities 
 
 
 
<p>The actions that we take to enforce these guidelines will include removing individual posts and suspending and removing users from our services.</p>
<p>In the future, other services built on the AT Protocol might choose to adopt their own community guidelines that differ from ours. In a federated model, each server has discretion over what they choose to serve and who they choose to connect to. If you disagree with a server’s moderation policies, you can take your account, social connections, and data to another service.</p>
 Proposals 
<p>We’ve created a new GitHub repository to host some of these proposals to streamline discussion. You can find the links to them here:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0001-user-lists-replygating-and-thread-moderation">User Lists, Reply-Gating, and Thread Moderation</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0002-labeling-and-moderation-controls">Labeling and Moderation Controls</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0003-hashtags">Hashtags</a> 
 
<p>These proposals, and our implementation of them, are not the end of what is possible in an open network — they are part of a process of development that will go through multiple iterations. Other companies or communities can also help set norms and build tooling, but we are investing in a best-effort first pass at creating a safe, pleasant, resilient public social commons. Your feedback, both in the app and through GitHub, is appreciated. Thanks for joining us on this journey.</p>

<p>This Dev Pulse brings a new release for the 0.1.x branch of Holochain. We’re still recommending that you stick with this branch for now, as we’re still troubleshooting performance issues in the 0.2.x branch.</p><p>Meanwhile, a goodly number of our team and community are en route or at DWeb Camp, where we’ll be involved in all sorts of ways — including being a sponsor!</p> Holochain 0.1.5: Backwards compatibility fixes <p>As you may have <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-01x-series-skip-014-wait-for-015">read</a> in the last Dev Pulse, I recommended that you not upgrade your hApp and userbase to Holochain 0.1.4, and instead wait for 0.1.5. Well here’s 0.1.5, with a bugfix for the broken dev environment (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2252?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2252</a>) as well as:</p>  There’s a compatibility path for a change to the database schema introduced in 0.1.4, so you can use 0.1.5 on databases created by older conductors (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2253?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2253</a>).  Some housekeeping tasks backported from 0.2: removal of the testing framework from the default build of the conductor (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2312?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2312</a>), and repair of a remote signals test (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2318?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2318</a>).  Breaking (sort of): 0.1.4 fixed a bug whereby a DNA’s name was mistakenly included when hashing the DNA. This broke some apps in the wild, so it’s been reverted (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2312?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2312</a>) and the correct functionality will appear in 0.2 onwards. This is not a breaking change if you’re updating your hApp from Holochain 0.1.3 to 0.1.5; it’s only breaking if you’re updating from 0.1.4.  <p>Additionally, you may want to read all the changes in 0.1.4 (with the exception that the last bullet point above reverts a change introduced in 0.1.4). Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/compare/holochain-0.1.3...holochain-0.1.5?ref=blog.holochain.org#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed">full changelog since 0.1.3</a>.</p> Known issues   In large-scale stress tests (around 200+ highly active nodes per conductor) we’re noticing some performance issues. These show up as zome call timeouts, high virtual memory usage, and dropped WebSocket connections — in short, the conductor gradually becomes unresponsive and needs to be restarted. We’re all-hands-on-deck troubleshooting this issue right now, and we believe it might also be present in 0.2.x and 0.3.x.  An out-of-bounds memory error is occasionally happening; depending on the circumstances, this can cause subsequent zome calls to fail. We’re putting in more tracing throughout the codebase to diagnose issues like this.  There’s a rounding error in the sharding algorithm that causes mismatches in the region of data being synced. (You can find out about regions in this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/quantised-gossip-optional-countersigners/#holochain-00147-quantised-gossip">Dev Pulse</a> from last year.) As we’re nearing the end of the six-month support promise for 0.1, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2332?ref=blog.holochain.org">fix for that</a> will land in 0.2.1.   Launcher release notes  0.9.4: UX improvements, bugfixes <p>This version has a few fixes, including better App Library download feedback, improved German translation, better error handling, and a bugfix for web forms on Linux.</p> 0.10.0: Holochain 0.1.5 support, more UX improvements <p>This version comes with Holochain 0.1.5. And it continues to get UX polish thanks to our friend Tibet Sprague from <a href="https://terran.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Terran Collective</a>. He’s been redesigning various parts of the UI to make things more accessible for everyone.</p><p>The most important UX change is mostly invisible — the hApp store no longer requires you to be part of the DevHub DNA and sync all the data. Instead, your node will look for a DevHub host and request the download from them. This means you don’t have to wait until you’re a full peer in the DevHub network before you can download hApp packages, which speeds up the first-run experience.</p>A screenshot of the new settings pane in the Launcher UI, showing the amount of resources each Holochain version is using, along with settings for each hApp, which used to be on the main pane.&nbsp;<p>There are a lot of changes; too many to list here. Just <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.10.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">download the Launcher</a> and see for yourself. And this is just a start — you’ll see more UX work in future releases!</p><p>This version is a breaking change, in that hApps that you installed in previous versions of the Launcher won’t show up in this version.</p> Known issues <p>Launcher is built on a Rust library called <a href="https://tauri.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tauri</a>, which is similar to Electron but of course Rust-based. It uses the operating system’s default web view library to display UIs. As such, we inherit any bugs that exist upstream in Tauri. Here are the ones we know about:</p>  Downloading files from a hApp that supports it is not supported on macOS.  App windows don’t have their own menu on macOS.  Trying to open a hApp UI that’s already open but minimised will not bring it to the front on some Linux distros.  Because of the dependency on the system web view, your hApp UI should target the built-in browser of the oldest desktop OS that your userbase is using.  As an example of this from the Launcher UI itself, on macOS Monterey the toggle switch for the new ‘developer mode’ (which allows you to become a DevHub host and upload packages to the hApp store) doesn’t toggle on.  hApp UIs that use WebRTC aren’t supported on Linux.  Launcher can freeze on macOS when an app is opened in full-screen view.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.10.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">Download Launcher 0.9.5</a>.</p> Quick update on Holochain 0.2.1 progress <p>We were planning to release a new version quick on the heels of Holochain 0.2.0 to repair both a peer discovery issue and some network performance issues. The peer discovery issue is fixed, but we’re still troubleshooting the performance issues where there is less to no gossip between peers until one of them publishes a new piece of data. In doing so, we're also building more robust testing tooling to get finer-grained insight into them. We expect to release 0.2.1 soon given what we've recently learned.</p><p>At this point, we recommend that you stick with 0.1.5. You’re still welcome to try out the 0.2.x series releases (and dev candidates in the 0.3.x series — in fact <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a> is in the process of upgrading to 0.3 already); just be prepared for the aforementioned bottlenecks. We’re also planning to roll some of the work already done on 0.3 into 0.2.1, giving it features we didn’t expect the 0.2.x series to have. Stay tuned!</p> Getting ready for DWeb Camp <p>We’re really looking forward to <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> in Navarro, CA, USA, which started on Wednesday, 21 June. A good number of us from the Holochain community and team from across the world are attending, volunteering, giving talks, hosting discussions, and taking care of meeting spaces. Not only that, but we’ll be a camp sponsor for the first time this year.</p><p>DWeb Camp will be a time for connecting, making new relationships with devs who don’t yet know that Holochain is the thing they’re looking for, and of course showing the DWeb community what Holochain can do. The theme this year is ‘Discovering Flows’, which is a lovely description of what happens there. I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">really enjoyed</a> last year. We’ll be sharing how this year went when we get back!</p>Art and Eric lead a conversation on DAOs at DWeb Camp 2022, with a few others from the Holochain community also among the participants.&nbsp;<p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@promemouse?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Dian Yu</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ZV7CO7hpZdA?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

  WTR II applies to EU-based Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and also comes into play when these EU-based CASPs send crypto transactions to a non-EU-based party.  CASPs must collect and retain sender and receiver information for crypto transfers exceeding 1,000&nbsp;Euros.  Through WTR II, the EU is actively seeking to enhance transparency and accountability in crypto transactions.  <p>In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies, regulatory frameworks are constantly playing catch-up.</p><p>The European Union (EU), known for being a forerunner in policy changes, has once again taken a bold leap forward with the introduction of Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II), sometimes called Transfer of Funds regulation. And as these regulations tighten, the crypto sector must step up to the challenge of ensuring compliance while preserving user privacy and security.</p><p>WTR II, in line with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule, aims to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terror financing. It mandates the exchange of sender and receiver information during crypto transactions.</p><p>With this requirement, the EU aims to usher in a paradigm shift, significantly affecting anonymity, which many would rate as the most prized feature of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The key to navigating these new regulatory waters lies in finding a solution that can reconcile the need for compliance with the equally important need to safeguard user data. One such promising solution is <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Veriscope</a>, Shyft Network’s very own Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>With Shyft Veriscope, we not only allow for the seamless exchange of user data amongst VASPs, but we also manage to do so without storing data on third-party servers or our own, keeping data privacy&nbsp;intact.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope’s peer-to-peer model also helps VASPs comply with the FATF Travel Rule frictionlessly. Moreover, it offers an automated process that minimizes any negative impact on user experience, a major concern for many crypto businesses.</p><p>Although the EU isn’t likely to endorse a specific method for user data exchange, the onus is on VASPs to find a way to conform to the new regulations with minimal disruption. This means adopting a solution like Shyft Veriscope that can offer the necessary balance between compliance and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As the crypto industry grapples with these challenges, solutions like Shyft Veriscope represent a beacon of hope. It demonstrates the potential for harmonious coexistence between regulatory compliance and user privacy, thereby shaping the future of cryptocurrencies in a progressively regulated environment.</p> When Does WTR II&nbsp;Apply? <p>The Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II) primarily applies under two key circumstances.</p><p>The first is when a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP), such as a cryptocurrency exchange, is involved in facilitating a crypto transaction. This facilitation includes activities such as executing, managing, or advising on the transaction.</p><p>The second circumstance is geographic in nature. If the CASP operates or has its registered office within the European Union (EU), the WTR II comes into effect. This geographic condition makes the WTR II relevant not just within the EU but also when an EU-based CASP engages in crypto transactions with entities outside the&nbsp;EU.</p> Information Obligations <p>For crypto-asset transfers, WTR II places obligations on the CASPs to gather and retain specific information about the transaction’s sender (originator) and the recipient (beneficiary). The aim is to ensure traceability of transactions, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability.</p><p>In case of missing or incomplete information about a transaction, it could be flagged as potentially risky. This necessitates the CASP to assess whether the transaction might be suspicious, possibly warranting reporting to the relevant financial intelligence unit under the EU’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing legislative framework.</p><p>As such, WTR II, in its essence, functions as a comprehensive guideline, not merely a regulatory rule. It fosters transparency, safeguards users, and combats illicit activities in the dynamic world of crypto-assets. And hence, for businesses, comprehending the nuances of its scope is crucial to navigating the compliance landscape where the stakes are high, and adherence to rules is paramount.</p> Exceptions to the&nbsp;Rule <p>EU’s Wire Transfer Regulation (WTR II) has a broad reach, yet it’s not an all-encompassing rule for every crypto transaction. There are certain scenarios where WTR II doesn’t&nbsp;apply.</p><p>For instance, when both the originator and the beneficiary of a transaction are Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) acting independently, WTR II provisions do not apply. Why is it so? WTR II assumes that both parties involved are aware of their actions and responsibilities.</p><p>The same goes for person-to-person crypto transfers without a CASP’s involvement. In such cases, the transaction happens directly between individuals, not unlike a cash handover, and thus, WTR II doesn’t apply in such a circumstance.</p> Self-Hosted Nuances <p>Now, let’s navigate the complex world of self-hosted wallets. These are personal crypto wallets that users manage independently, unlike wallets provided by a crypto exchange.</p><p>If a CASP’s client sends or receives funds to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must collect information about both parties. However, they typically aren’t required to verify the self-hosted wallet user’s identity.</p><p>But here’s the twist: when a transaction involves more than 1000 Euros and is facilitated by a CASP to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP has to ensure that the client indeed controls the self-hosted wallet.</p><p>Picture this as a safety check to verify the identity of the individual involved in a high-value transaction, similar to the protocols banks&nbsp;follow.</p><p>However, for transfers that occur between accounts managed entirely within the framework of the CASPs — like those on a cryptocurrency exchange — this 1000 Euro threshold for additional verification doesn’t&nbsp;apply.</p><p>So, while WTR II applies to most crypto transactions, it still leaves room to provide enough flexibility.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What is the Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR&nbsp;II)? <p>The Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II) is an initiative of the European Union intended to curb the purported use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering and terrorism financing.</p> Q2: Who does WTR II apply&nbsp;to? <p>WTR II applies to all EU-based CASPs and cases where an EU-based CASP sends crypto transactions to a non-EU-based party.</p> Q3: What information obligations does WTR II place on&nbsp;CASPs? <p>WTR II imposes specific obligations on CASPs with regard to crypto-asset transfers. CASPs are required to collect and hold detailed information about both the sender (originator) and the recipient (beneficiary) involved in a transaction. And if the necessary information is incomplete or missing, the transaction could be flagged as potentially risky.</p> Q4: Are there exceptions to WTR&nbsp;II? <p>Yes, exceptions to WTR II exist. For instance, the regulation does not apply when both the originator and the beneficiary of a transaction are CASPs acting independently. Similarly, it does not govern person-to-person crypto transfers conducted without a CASP’s involvement.</p> Q5: How does WTR II affect self-hosted wallets? <p>WTR II has a specific impact on self-hosted wallets. When a client of a CASP transfers funds to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must gather information about both parties. However, when a transaction exceeds 1000 Euros and involves a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must confirm that the client truly controls the self-hosted wallet.</p> Final Note <p>As the crypto industry continues to expand and mature, regulatory frameworks like WTR II are playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of crypto transactions. The key challenge lies in balancing the need for robust AML and CTF measures while preserving the privacy and security that make cryptocurrencies attractive.</p><p>Amid this shifting landscape, solutions like Shyft Veriscope are proving instrumental. By enabling CASPs to comply with WTR II and FATF’s Travel Rule in a manner that respects user privacy, Shyft Veriscope demonstrates the potential for harmonious coexistence of regulatory compliance and data protection. This is a significant step forward in navigating the compliance challenges and the fast-paced evolution of the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>Indeed, the introduction of WTR II serves as a stern reminder that regulations are as much a part of the crypto industry as innovation and disruption. By understanding and adapting to these changes, the crypto sector can continue its upward trajectory while ensuring a safer and more transparent environment for all participants.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>With the explosion of Software as a service applications, organizations are juggling a lot – from rollout out hybrid/remote work policies; supporting employee, contractor and vendor hiring and off-boarding; managing various identities, and ensuring only authorized users have access to what their job requires. This work has become critical to ensuring smooth processes, preventing account take over (ATO) attacks and reducing costs.</p>
<p>System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is transforming Identity and Access Management in SaaS platforms, workflow, and Identity lifecycle management. SCIM is an open standard protocol designed to simplify the management of identities in cloud-based applications and services. SCIM provides predefined schema for users and groups, and a RESTful API, for automatic user provisioning and deprovisioning, making it easier for systems and applications to communicate identity-related data.</p>
<p>The key benefits for using SCIM based provisioning are preventing account takeover, mitigate the risk of dormant accounts, and achieve cost savings through permission rightsizing and streamlined onboarding &amp; offboarding processes.</p>
<p>User Provisioning &amp; De-provisioning</p>
<p>For an organization that uses multiple SaaS applications like O365, Salesforce, Slack, WorkDay, Webex, and Dropbox amongst others, manually creating and managing user access for these applications is time consuming and carries high security risks. For example when a new employee joins the organization, an IT administrator would have to individually create access across all these applications, a process that can take hours, if not days. Similarly, when an employee leaves or changes roles within the organization, it is critical to swiftly revoke all access to prevent potential misuse. Implementing SCIM can streamline and automate this process. For instance, when integrated with an Identity Provider (IdP) like Entrust IDaaS, any change in the user status gets automatically updated across all the SaaS applications connected with IDaaS. So, a new user added to Entrust IDaaS gets automatically provisioned in Salesforce, Slack, Workday, Webex, and Dropbox, while an employee leaving the organization gets deactivated immediately, thus preventing unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Streamlining Workflow Management</p>
<p>Each application has it’s own user management, making it challenging to maintain data consistency. For example, if an employee moves from one department to another, their access rights need to be updated in each application – which can lead to inconsistencies if done manually. However, with SCIM, changes made in the central identity management system like Entrust IDaaS is automatically propagated through all connected applications, ensuring up-to-date and consistent access privileges, which enhances workflow management and overall efficiency.</p>
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management</p>
<p>For a rapidly growing tech startup, frequent identity lifecycle events include onboarding new employees, assigning them to projects, updating their roles, and offboarding them when leaving the organization. Each ‘identity lifecycle event’ must be accurately reflected in the organization’s systems and applications to prevent dormant or under / over privileged accounts that could cause potential security threats.</p>
<p>Automating user provisioning and deprovisioning process across different platforms through SCIM will ensure that the update is mirrored across all integrated systems and applications. Direct integration with HR Systems like Workday can kickstart the entire Identity Lifecycle Management of the new, moving or departing employee. Such automated governance with least privilege access helps organizations deploy zero trust framework / architecture (ZTA) that leads to sustained high levels of security.</p>
<p>Cost-Saving</p>
<p>In addition to strengthening security and lifecycle management, deploying SCIM can also yield cost savings through automation, reducing the manual effort involved in identity management. For example, if an IT administrator typically spends 20 minutes managing each user’s access rights across five different applications, then an organization with 1000 employees will need to invest more than 330 hours just for a single round of access updates. With SCIM, this effort can be cut down, saving substantial labor costs while also minimizing the possibility of human errors that could lead to even more costly security incidents.</p>
<p>SCIM is not only a protocol for managing digital identities; it is an essential tool that can enhance an organization’s security posture through a Zero Trust framework, streamlined workflows, and yield cost savings. By automating and standardizing identity management, SCIM alleviates the risks associated with account takeover, reduces the potential security threats posed by dormant and over privileged accounts, and introduces significant efficiency into identity lifecycle management processes.</p>

<p>In a recent survey that spanned six countries, Entrust found that while progress is being made in the way that governments and citizens interact, there is definitely room for improvement.</p>
<p>The vast majority of respondents (84%) interact with governments between one and five times each year, pursuing typical outcomes – a driver’s license, paying taxes, and traveling. It’s no surprise that almost four out of ten respondents (39%) prefer the convenience of web portals over more traditional interaction methods such as mail (5%) and in-person (15%). And while preferences favor digital interactions, governments still must deliver the services and the credentials that citizens require − offering both digital and physical to ensure equal access to services and meet the preferences of its citizens and service providers alike.</p>
<p>Citizen interaction preferences</p>
<p></p>
<p>To meet the evolving needs of its citizens, governments are working with the private sector to deliver the outcomes citizens require. We’re heading toward a simple, smooth, and secure user experience from entry into the system, through the issuance of credentials and completing the required transactions – all relying on a single chain of trust that ensures the privacy and security of personal information and government systems.</p>
 Only half rated their digital interactions as positive 
<p>Overall, respondents rated their last government interaction at 7.1 on a 10-point scale. But when it comes to their last digital interaction, barely half (54%) rated those interactions as positive. While a 7.1 overall rating isn’t terrible by any means, there’s room for improvement. And it’s telling that only half of citizens, who are moving to faster and more convenient methods of interaction, were left with a positive impression. There’s clearly work to be done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Citizens’ pain points with government interactions</p>
<p></p>
 Governments are paying attention…and taking action 
<p>In the countries we surveyed, citizens improving customer service is important to respondents. And many governments know it’s time to step up and simplify end-user experiences, as well as drive operational efficiencies and greater security. In the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2023/entrust-wins-uk-home-office-tender-to-expand-digitization-of-immigration-processes">a new solution</a> enables a streamlined, more seamless way for travelers coming to the UK to be identified via biometrics, bringing more secure border control and speeding up identity and border checks. In the United States, “Delivering Excellent, Equitable, and Secure Federal Services and Customer Experience” is the number two priority on the <a href="https://www.performance.gov/pma/cx/">President’s management agenda</a>. The administration has gone so far as to designate 14 agencies as “High Impact Service Providers” and put the following strategies in place:</p>
 
 Improve the service design, digital products, and customer-experience management of Federal <a href="https://www.performance.gov/cx/assets/files/HISP-listing-2021.pdf">High Impact Service Providers</a> by reducing customer burden, addressing inequities, and streamlining processes. 
 Design, build, and manage government service delivery for key life experiences that cut across Federal agencies. 
 Identify and prioritize the development of Federal shared products, services, and standards that enable simple, seamless, and secure customer experiences across the Federal Government1. 
 
 Digital interactions are important and preferred, but phone, mail, and in-person remain important 
<p>Undoubtedly, phone calls, mail, and in-person interactions will remain among peoples preferences, and governments have the responsibility to make these services equally available to all. Citizens must have digital, physical, and hybrid credentials to fulfill the outcomes they’re after and the Entrust survey responses bear that out. People are asking for quick, convenient services at their fingertips.</p>
<p>Below is how respondents ranked what is important to them:</p>



1
Service when and where it’s needed
55%


2
Secure, easy, and convenient identity verification
53%


3
Customer data privacy and security is a priority
49%


4
Self-service capabilities
44%


5
Ability to track progress
44%


6
Online forms
43%


7
Consistent user experience across government organizations
36%


8
Engage on behalf of others
8%



<p>People are asking for the customer experience they’ve come to expect from their favorite retailers and banks. </p>
 Getting to simple, smooth, and secure. There’s good news and bad news. 
<p>The bad news is that from a technical perspective, simple, smooth, and secure experiences crash head-on into:</p>
 
 Legacy apps 
 Multiple independent solution providers 
 A growing and dynamic threat landscape 
 
<p>The good news is that the challenges presented on the journey to becoming simple, smooth, and secure are being overcome and improvements are within reach.</p>
 
 Composable systems break older models of rigid software development practices and introduce modularity − allowing organizations to quickly design, build, manage, and change systems as the needs of organizations evolve. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) address connectivity to legacy systems and stem the proliferation of vendors, and costs, simplifying and shortening the citizen experience. Systems become easier to deploy, maintain, and scale. 
 A single chain of trust reduces the attack surface and keeps citizen information safe. 
 Enabling the right credential for the right transaction means
 
 No citizen is left behind 
 People get what they need for the outcome they seek leading to happier citizens and increased trust in government 
 Strong identities and authentication methods can lower the risk of fraud 
 
 
 
<p>The next blog in our government-citizen series interactions will explore the similarities and differences among countries and age groups. Are we all really all that different?</p>
 Methodology 
<p>To assess the perceptions, experiences, and preferences of citizens about their interactions with government, Entrust engaged an independent research firm in May 2023. 3,501 online survey responses were received from people between the ages of 18 and 75 residing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany UK, and USA. Only responses that met age and geographic qualifications were included, and respondents had to have interacted with the government in the previous 12 months.</p>

 Exploring the challenges, opportunities, and necessity for cross-functional collaboration. 



 



<p>Attempting to draw similarities between two different industries may not seem the most productive use of one’s time, but there are valuable insights to be gained, if you look hard enough. Let us take the financial services and gambling industries, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the obvious risks in the financial market and the speculative nature of trading, the banking and gambling industry have more in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5370364/">common than one might expect</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both face similar risks, <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/handle/123456789/86115">including</a> operational risk, regulatory compliance, money laundering, liquidity, solvency risk, IT and cyber risks, and reputational risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both invariably have an Enterprise Risk Management function, which, as the name suggests, carries out risk management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As financial services and the gambling industry are both prime targets for fraud and money laundering, there is value in organizations from both sectors implementing a dedicated KYC program to help them comply with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">Terrorist Financing</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJ0KHXidf_AhWCgVwKHacTBaQQFnoECA8QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgdpr-info.eu%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1akHzzz224Oq1yU0pd6qSw&amp;opi=89978449">GDPR regulations</a>.</p>



 Blocking new illegal, intertwined paths. 



<p>In April 2023, a first of a kind trial took place in Basildon Crown Court in the UK. <a href="https://www.essex.police.uk/news/essex/news/news/2023/april/man-jailed-after-betting-fraud/">Jon Howard was found guilty of defrauding Bet365</a>, after the Essex Serious Crime Directorate confirmed he had used more 1,000 identities to abuse bonuses, which, had he been successful, would have netted him £236,000. (Read more about some of the ways that criminals abuse sign-up bonuses in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">‘Exploring bonus abuse in gambling’</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Howard tried to legitimatize these funds via a mortgage application where he added details of a fake job. He was recently sentenced to a five-year jail sentence. In both gambling and financial services, fraudsters continue to find more creative ways in exposing weaknesses in controls. And, as the latest tricks tend to appear in one sector before the other, there is significant incentive for collaboration between the two industries.</p>



 Desperately seeking a global gambling regulatory framework. 



<p>The gambling industry has encountered fast-paced growth in recent years. Indeed, the proliferation of high-speed internet and mobile devices have made it even easier for individuals to access online gambling platforms from the comfort of their own homes or on the go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This convenience factor has attracted a larger number of people to engage in online gambling activities. COVID-19 and multiple quarantine periods further cemented the expansion of online gambling. Despite the rapid growth, many national authorities and regulatory bodies have been slow off the mark in updating regulations or providing the industry with some much-needed clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the UK’s much delayed revision of the Gambling Act 2005 in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">‘Preparing for the UK gambling white paper’</a> here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gambling industry is categorized as a Designated Non-Financial Business and Profession (DNFBP), providing gambling services for entertainment purposes. The gambling industry also engages in similar activities to financial institutions, such as accepting and withdrawing funds. As such, players in both the gambling industry and financial services industry are required to hold a license to operate in most European Union (EU) countries. Traditionally, if you wanted to operate in multiple EU countries, then you would need multiple licenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, however, there have been substantial efforts to ease the headache of operating throughout Europe. In fact, <a href="https://www.egba.eu/eu-market/licensing/">multi-licensing has been adopted in 25 out of 29 European countries</a>,&nbsp; introducing full multi-licensing for all regulated online gambling products, according to the European Gaming &amp; Betting Association. In 2018, the EGBA <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2018/12/Manifesto-A-EU-Framework-for-Online-Gambling-2.0.pdf">published a manifesto</a> to appeal for a globalized regulatory framework for online gambling operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recommending a deepened standardization in the business, the Association is pushing for a more comprehensive regulatory framework to avoid “unnecessary compliance and supervision costs” and limit the risks of non-compliance. This would also have a direct impact on the risk exposure to fraud and money laundering. In fact, during its <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/eu-context-anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism_en#documents">periodic supra-national risk assessments</a> in 2022, the European Commission said it <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/compliance/eu-ups-money-laundering-risk-in-online-gambling-to-highest-level/">considered online gambling</a> “to be especially vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing, with this risk categorized as&nbsp; the highest possible risk level.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, gambling operators would be wise to take a few lessons from the financial services industry to better understand its regulations, and the processes they use to protect themselves against fraud, money laundering, and other types of financial crime. As KYC programs are slowly becoming the norm within multiple industries – from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> – gambling operators should follow suit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step one should be for all gambling operators to familiarize themselves with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> (AML) and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/#:~:text=Terrorism%20financing%20encompasses%20numerous%20actions,instruments%20to%20support%20terrorist%20operations.">Terrorist Financing</a> regulations. Step two is to implement stronger KYC mechanisms. With a robust KYC program in place, gambling operators can anticipate potential regulatory developments and be ready with top notch compliance programs.</p>

 The opportunities that lie ahead. 



<p>Banks encounter significant challenges when collaborating with gambling operators due to the elevated levels of risk and potential for fraud. One of the key challenges is to navigate complex regulatory requirements and AML laws that apply to gambling activities. The cash-intensive nature of the gambling industry further exacerbates the risk, as large financial transactions only increase the potential for illicit funds to be circulated. Understandably, therefore, banks are far more reticent to work with gambling operators, as they represent a higher risk. But there is still value in collaboration, or as mentioned, at least being aware of what is happening in the other&nbsp; industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between credit card fraud, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse</a>, price scraping or account takeover, gambling platforms are often at the forefront of fraud trends, and how best to counter them. Additionally, the gambling industry’s ability to deal with multiple means of payments (<a href="https://www.egba.eu/home-page/at-the-forefront-of-online-payments-innovation/">33 different types in 2018 alone for EGBA members</a>) just goes to show how expansive their experience is in tackling online payment fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, it is no secret that gambling operators are leaders in cultivating customer engagement. Many utilize the latest technology and data analytics to provide seamless, personalized customer journeys, enhance the user experience and retain players. Both <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">fintechs</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">traditional banks</a> should learn from gambling operators and take similar steps to improve the customer experience by meeting and even exceeding customer expectations.</p>



 United we stand. 



<p>While the regulatory framework may bear a heavier weight on financial services than gambling operators, the latter can certainly learn from the best controls and monitoring practices of the former.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To protect against fraud and money laundering, collaboration is a must. As most fraudsters tend to work across multiple industries and targets at any one time, banking and gambling operators can benefit greatly from exchanging information and best practices. For example, by providing feedback on fraud detection systems, secure payment processing or even staff training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professional associations, such as <a href="https://www.egba.eu/">EGBA</a> or <a href="https://www.acfe.com/">Association of Certified Examiner</a>, are two legitimate places to collaborate and exchange. More informal channels like forums or event panels are other valuable channels to gain intelligence on the latest fraud techniques and money laundering trends, and the best ways of identifying criminal and suspicious activities.</p>



 One platform for multiple industries. 



<p>IDnow provides the most powerful, configurable, and secure platform for identity proofing. IDnow’s highly configurable platform for identity proofing works across multiple regulations, use cases, and industries, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">financial services</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gambling</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether automated or expert-assisted, online or point-of-sale, our identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversions or the consumer experience.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The eco-conscious movement is unmistakably a global environmental concern that continues to gain momentum as we see the impacts to our daily lives. Consumers and <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">world leaders</a> recognize that carbon footprints must be reduced, requiring and challenging their business partners (vendors, customers, etc.) to make measurable changes now. Many organizations are taking calculated eco-actions in various product segments: everything from electronics, housewares, clothing and batteries to heavy duty motors and industrial equipment. Careful life-cycle considerations are evaluated at every product stage, from design and concept to end-of-life.</p>
<p>Credit cards are no different. Consumers demand eco-friendly materials, card recycling programs, and even more importantly, the assurance that their bank or credit union is actively engaged in these programs. Increasingly, many products now demonstrate their own unique eco-journey to include these lifecycle eco-considerations along the way – packaging, production efficiency, waste, green-certified buildings, etc. The mere ability to recycle something isn’t enough and even though the term “eco” is many times in absentia of standards or regulations, it’s becoming one of the highest priorities in consumer goods.</p>
<p>What exactly is the scope of eco-cards and why is it important? Traditional credit card materials are typically some variant of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), widely known as the <a href="https://www.ciel.org/project-update/plastic-climate-the-hidden-costs-of-a-plastic-planet/">biggest contributor to global plastics proliferation</a>. Although the credit card form factor is small, global annual card production is estimated to be 3.3 billion cards in 2023, drawing scrutiny around the total lifecycle, use case, and further debate around physical vs. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/04/trends-in-passport-personalization/">digital card</a> issuance. Purists believe the ultimate form of an environmentally conscious card is a digital one. Realistically, the continuation of hybrid credential issuance (the issuance of both digital and physical credentials to cardholders) will remain steady in the near future as <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/us-consumers-prefer-seamless-and-fully-integrated-payment-experiences-new-entrust-survey-reveals">consumers demand both alternatives for different use cases</a>.</p>
<p>More and more companies are driving sustainability efforts into their initiatives, with an increasing trend in qualifying eco-materials. The breadth of these green programs is far and wide, varying from a fractional percentage in material reduction to biodegradable, recycled PVC, PLA, PETG, R, O, P, and everything in between. <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/blogs/2022/11/30/sustainable-banking-payment-cards/">ABI forecasts an 18% decrease</a> in the use of PVC in global card production by 2026, but the full impact of material changes can only be realized if cards are fully recycled at the end of their life vs. ending up in a landfill. Educated consumers recognize companies who promote their <a href="https://www.entrust.com/legal-compliance/environmental-social-and-governance">sustainability programs</a>, looking to bridge environmental awareness with overall product viability. In the absence of eco standards and regulation, companies are looking to partner with material suppliers, equipment providers, and logistic services who have demonstrable programs in place that can help meet overall sustainability goals. To this end, it’s imperative that vendors, customers and everyone engaged in product-centric decision-making, are aware of eco-friendly initiatives and sustainability programs, as well as broader ESG program goals, and the related benefits and value proposition.</p>
<p>In a capitalistic world, consumers, world leaders, and companies alike are at the same crossroads, demanding more from eco and sustainability efforts to make the environment we live in safer and cleaner. For their part, organizations are looking for trusted advisers to lead them through materials research, equipment capabilities, or aligning with industry trends ahead of standardization. This critical juncture is where Entrust has invested resources to bridge the gap between technical feasibility and demand for sustainable practice. We’ve dedicated resources − from our R&amp;D, business teams, material suppliers, and equipment suppliers to logistics services − to co-create meaningful solutions to meet these critical goals now and into the future. Leveraging an eco research and innovation platform that was designed to build the knowledge base for holistic solutions vs. driving product-led materials or features. In simpler terms, eco R&amp;D is the foundation required to build diverse enterprise relationships supporting the broader initiative. The mere existence of an eco-project doesn’t automatically generate “trusted advisers,” but the collective effort will create a roadmap where partners feel comfortable collaborating on technical concepts to support consumer demand.</p>

<p>From inflation and conflict, to rising interest rates and the growth of neo banks, to synthetic identities and deepfakes – banks and credit union leaders are navigating tumultuous times. Yet, through it all, these same leaders recognize the immediate need to meet the demand for an enhanced customer experience to drive loyalty and increase revenue. And it all starts with a streamlined secure onboarding process – one that provides digital-first customer experiences with an accelerated time to value.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the quicker a financial institution can move a prospective customer from account opening to card issuance to making their first purchase, the more satisfied the consumer becomes and the faster the financial institution realizes value. And, if that can all happen in less time than it takes to brew a cup of coffee – all the better! Of course, it’s equally as important to be Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliant, as well as secure through each and every transaction. Fraud is a large and growing problem that can cost banks as much as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">$4MM per breach (IBM</a>), not to mention the potential reputational damage and lost consumer trust that has the power to seriously damage future growth potential.</p>
<p>What follows is a roadmap to navigate this journey.</p>
<p>Enable digital customer onboarding.</p>
<p>We’ve heard from many customers that banks and credit unions alike only have a 90-second to 5-minute window of time that consumers are willing to spend verifying their identity and opening an account. Any longer than that and you risk application abandonment – that isn’t a lot of time to provide a great consumer experience that will lead to top-of-wallet status. That’s why it’s critical for banks to adopt technologies that allow them to offer remote customer onboarding enhanced with biometric identity verification; identity and device reputation authentication (also known as Electronic Know Your Customer, or eKYC); and digital contract signing.</p>
<p>Provide digital and physical payment card options.</p>
<p>Once a new customer account has been approved, it’s time to provide a method to make payments. Traditionally, a customer would need to wait for a physical card to be mailed to their home address after opening their bank account. While this process is still an important part of any bank’s card issuance program, it can be beneficial to offer other methods of card issuance that will help the bank realize time to value more quickly, and to exceed customer expectations.</p>
<p>For those customers that open an account remotely via their mobile device, doesn’t it make sense to instantly issue them a digital card to their newly installed banking app so they can start using it right away? Enhancing existing card programs with digital offerings with functionality like digital card issuance, NFC payment, tokenization, wallet push provisioning, and card controls allows banks to streamline processes, reduce cost of ownership, and provide a boost in customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Many banks and credit unions also offer the option to instantly print a card in-branch. This method is a nice addition to any payment card issuance program because it gives branch employees the autonomy to surprise and delight customers by printing them a new replacement card, or a new card for those who choose to open an account in person.</p>
<p>The key to a successful card issuance program is to ensure that your bank can rise to the customer’s immediate challenge and provide the flexibility to open an account and receive their card via the method that works best for them, and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Secure the end-to-end experience.</p>
<p>Securing the end-to-end customer experience (from account opening to transacting), is vitally important to mitigate costs and reputational damage resulting from banking fraud or a breach. As mentioned in the consumer onboarding and account opening phase, it’s important to make sure to adhere to the latest eKYC and AML compliance requirements.</p>
<p>When it comes to protecting transactions once an account has been opened, banks and credit unions should look for solutions that provide risk-based authentication to proactively identify fraudulent patterns through fraud detection algorithms, device identity scans, and adaptive risk analysis. Applying those solutions across all e-commerce transactions, high-value transactions, and irregular locations will help identify and mitigate potential fraud.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a unique alphanumeric code for legal entities, funds and trusts participating in commercial, trade, or general financial transactions. It enables identification across a wide range of financial applications and has the potential to play a significant role in the modern financial system by enabling counterparty bona fides verification. This verification is essential for the know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) processes required in traditional and modernized financial services activities. </p>
<p>Amit Sharma is the Founder and CEO of <a href="https://finclusive.com/who-we-are/about-us">FinClusive</a>, a global Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) infrastructure provider that enables increased compliant and equitable financial engagement by facilitating traditional banking’s connectivity with emerging technology networks, existing and alternative payment rails, and financial services providers. FinClusive’s CaaS is a globally orchestrated anti-money laundering/financial crimes compliance toolkit with modernized KYC/KYB- backed digital identity credentialing and LEI issuance and validation.</p>
<p>How are Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) transforming businesses—and emerging markets in particular? What requirements does the LEI meet?</p>
<p>As both traditional and non-traditional financial markets incorporate cross-border transactions, there is a significant need for a uniform identifier across jurisdictions that is precise, digitally verifiable, and interoperable across global regulated financial services providers. The hurdles for verifying identities across the world has resulted in financial fraud, crises, and other abuses, which has become even more complex in the virtual assets space, internet-native financial services applications (web3), and decentralized financial services (DeFi). The LEI has both the necessary infrastructure and simplicity for ubiquitous application across bank and non-bank transactions for businesses around the world.</p>
<p>What are the challenges with know-your-business (KYB) and legal entity verification more broadly? How do we enable businesses to interact seamlessly, transparently, and compliantly in a cross-border world with next generation banking and payments needs?</p>
<p>The biggest challenges for KYB across the industry arise from inconsistent regulatory requirements for identification and compliance across jurisdictions, coupled with the disparate nature in which corporate identities are issued, validated, stored, and accessed. In these cases, entities involved in cross-border transactions often lack the ability to verify that their counterparty is legitimate, non-fraudulent, and not posing a significant business risk. Adding processes like Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) goes a long way in addressing these concerns by systemizing the issuance and validation of legal entities, and further, enabling them to verify each other while ensuring adherence to global financial crimes compliance practices and requirements. Broader compliance solutions that are purpose-built for know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) application, including FinClusive’s full-stack compliance-as-a-service (CaaS) platform, are another way that businesses can take security and compliance into their own hands, while enabling near real-time verification and coverage of essential business/entity verification—including the validation of an entity’s beneficial owners.</p>
<p>How are these changes going to happen? Who is driving the changes? </p>
<p>While the best outcomes are reached collaboratively between the public and private sectors, it is important that industry-focused solutions are carefully considered by lawmakers when debating how to regulate the rapidly evolving financial services industry, including and especially those engaged in cross-border payments and virtual assets. As such, industry associations like Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) and companies like FinClusive can work hand-in-hand with government actors to guide policy in order to achieve the safest and most effective results for customers. This collaboration enables efficient due diligence, verification of identity, and applications across multiple jurisdictions, financial services operations, and increasingly between counterparties directly (peer-to-peer/business-to-business).</p>
<p>What timescales are we working towards with adoption and resulting benefits for the areas we’ve discussed? What are some examples of low hanging fruit (use cases)?</p>
<p>Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) have a wide range of use cases, some of which can be actualized more quickly than others. FinClusive already uses LEIs in know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) use cases, allowing organizations to gather key information about a client or counterparty before entering a transaction and conduct the requisite verification of legal entities wherever located. LEIs can also reduce error and friction for banks, creditors, invoicing, and a wide range of other business relationships. For example, organizations often have minor variations in names used across different official platforms, leading to significant confusion when trying to track the financial history of an entity or ensure adherence to global sanctions requirements and individual jurisdiction-based know-your-business and monitoring requirements.</p>
<p>A uniform LEI makes KYC/KYB exercises significantly smoother for all parties. The removal of these hurdles also allows for faster engagement between counterparties and financial transactions around the world. G7 and G20 countries have increasingly looked to LEIs as a strong way to bring global consistency and efficiency to legal entity verification and validation. Coupled with FinClusive’s global KYC/KYB, due diligence, monitoring, and digitally verifiable identity credentials, entities can ensure requisite background checks that mitigate identity fraud, and enable engagement between trading/financial counterparties—and their financial intermediaries—seamlessly and securely, while bringing needed efficiencies to their financial transactions.</p>
<p>How do we drive further adoption and enablement at scale?</p>
<p>Adoption at the international level must come from a coordinated government and private sector approach. FinClusive is one of several organizations globally offering Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) services, but there are only a few based in the United States. Additionally, regulatory mandates are yet to be made requirements—although financial services regulators around the globe are increasingly indicating their importance and use. Building broader infrastructure for LEI adoption around the world and coordinating with federal policy is crucial for widespread use. Enabling multiple financial services providers with LEIs alongside the essential monitoring and other controls to combat fraud and illicit finance, will advance know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) modernization, especially as alternative accounts and payments products and services continue to proliferate in the market.</p>
<p>What potential does the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) have for global financial inclusion?</p>
<p>Reliable, easily accessible identification has the potential to transform businesses in developing markets. LEIs give trading partners and their financial institutions a new way to interact with unprecedented efficiency and is expected to have immeasurable benefits for global trade and business-to-business (B2B) money flows in the developing world. Small businesses, entrepreneurs, non-profits, development organizations, global corporations, and even alternative financial services providers themselves can seek out and receive a fully credentialed LEI through FinClusive or another provider, enabling them to engage meaningfully in the global economy with legitimacy and transparency.</p>
<p>With more than 99% of global growth stemming from small and medium enterprises (including micro enterprises and commercial entities of all types—corporate, LLC, non-profit/public benefit, and others), LEIs can enable seamless engagement and verification alongside financial system controls that can benefit those enterprises struggling to access or maintain their financial services.</p>
<p>Why is FinClusive working with Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs)? How does the LEI fit into your services?</p>
<p>Thanks to our partnership with Ubisecure, FinClusive is one of the only United States-based GLEIF Validation Agents. This allows us to streamline validation of legal entity data and really speed up the registration of LEIs. We are also the only nonbank/non-financial institution to do this.

<p>LinkedIn has joined the ranks of social media platforms offering ID verification badges designed to assure users that the person associated with a profile is in fact who they claim to be. Given <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/04/3cx-breach-was-a-double-supply-chain-compromise/">organized fraud on LinkedIn</a>, it’s about time. But, while I applaud the move, it’s important to note what identity verification is and what it means to users like you and me.</p>
 ID Verification: The Good, the Bad &amp; the WTF 
<p>While social media users and brands have long been able to apply for checkmark-style verifications, these badges have traditionally been bestowed by the platforms themselves. But last November, Twitter changed the game by announcing it was replacing its existing verification system with Twitter Blue. The idea: Enable anyone with a profile (and $8 a month) to add Twitter’s coveted checkmark to their profile.</p>
<p>Quite predictably, chaos ensued as pranksters and cybercriminals purchased blue checkmarks and impersonated brands and their executives with abandon. The Eli Lilly and Lockheed Martin impersonations occurred on Twitter during this time. So did an exodus of top advertisers, contributing to an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-30/twitter-s-revenue-drops-amid-advertisers-concerns-over-elon-musk?leadSource=uverify%20wall">89% drop in ad revenue</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter has since paused, re-launched, and continued to modify its approach to verification. But it’s hardly alone. Impersonation occurs on every platform, including TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, and even new Twitter rivals like Mastodon. The Bird Network is also no longer an outlier in offering ID verification to all users. Meta’s Facebook and Instagram have rolled out paid verification, and now LinkedIn has announced no-fee verification.</p>
<p>As a B2B marketing leader, it’s LinkedIn that matters most. The platform is expected to capture <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/linkedin-will-capture-nearly-25-of-us-b2b-ad-spending-by-2024">25% of all B2B ad spend</a> by 2024, to the tune of $4.5 billion, for a simple reason: It’s an indispensable channel for brand, direct, and account-based marketing. LinkedIn ID verification can serve an essential role in preventing impersonation. But it should be done in a privacy preserving way. Here’s what I mean.</p>
 LinkedIn: More Reassurance—But Not Without Risk 
<p>LinkedIn’s approach includes options for verifying personal identity and place of employment. In the US, users can confirm their identity by uploading their government-issued ID and phone number and then displaying this verification on their profile. Worldwide, users can verify where they work with their company email address.</p>
<p>But while this is a step in the right direction, there are two significant blind spots in this approach. The first is the requirement to provide a government-issued ID. While this can undoubtedly cut down on fake profiles, it forces users to place the scanned drivers license in the care and control of a 3rd party. As if we haven’t seen enough identity data spread all over the Web and compromised in countless ways.</p>
<p>Consumers (AKA LinkedIn users) should be able to control their own data at all times and have the ability to share it with consent and on demand. The dangers are all too real as thousands of data breaches over the years prove in stark detail.</p>
<p>The second issue is as large or larger. Identity verification somewhere at or after account origination doesn’t prove identity at login. It does nothing to prevent <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/98367-social-media-account-takeovers-increased-over-1000-in-2021">social media account takeover</a> (ATO), which is up more than 1,000%, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). Roughly 40% of all victims of social media ATO reported either having their personal information misused, while half lost funds or sales revenue. More than 70% were permanently locked out of their account while the intruder continued to post new content.</p>
<p>Just imagine the potential damage to victims and the platform itself if (and when) a verified LinkedIn account gets pirated. The good news: It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
 Verification Made Simpler &amp; Safer 
<p>Today, verifying identity at login is not only attainable, but readily achievable. At 1Kosmos we’ve implemented passwordless login with verified identity in a number of different ways. What does this mean?</p>
<p>For the LinkedIn and other social media use cases, user enrollment feels much the same way as it does today, but with identity verification, anti-spoofing and privacy baked in. For starters, when the user scans the front and back of their driver’s license, it is verified against AAMVA records to ensure validity, and more broadly can be verified in 205 countries worldwide. Scanned information is sharded, encrypted and stored in a blockchain under the sole control and management of the user. Importantly, the user never gives up control of their PII.</p>
<p>A facial scan is performed and compared to the likeness on their ID. This is configurable, can include liveness detection and is backed by iBeta PAD-2 certification, verifying identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy.</p>
<p>When it comes to use cases that require higher levels of assurance, many organizations look for NIST 800-63-3 certified Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) identity proofing and authentication (AAL2). This typically requires a passport scan, which is then verified with the Country Signer Certificate Authority (CSCA) .</p>
<p>Here, privacy by design means that personally identifiable information is stored and managed solely by the user who can grant access on demand. Their personal information is never stored in a central server accessible by a 3rd party and can be transferred only with explicit user consent.</p>
<p>Once enrolled, our solution can use LiveID technology, device-level biometrics, one-time passcodes and various other authentication mechanisms all bound to the verified identity to ensure the user at login is who they claim to be. Because the 1Kosmos solution is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">FIDO</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">iBeta PAD-2</a> certified, the user’s biometric can’t be spoofed using a stolen photo, video, or other mechanisms.</p>
<p>For LinkedIn and other social media platforms, it would ensure that all verified user profiles and interactions are legitimate, with more than 99% accuracy. This is a significant improvement over knowing that at one point in time the account was in effect claimed by a verified, legitimate user. It truly identifies the user behind the device ad first and every login.</p>

   The key to secure, seamless experiences 

<p>Would you be surprised to learn that 91% of all new car sales in the U.S. are "connected vehicles." Not me. I've been watching the automotive world evolve, creating an ecosystem bristling with distinct entities and relationships that shape the modern driving experience.</p>

<p>The complexity of this ecosystem can be overwhelming. There's the vehicle itself, with its multitude of sensors and software components, plus subscription-based services and smart city infrastructure. And, of course, there are the people involved –&nbsp;car owners, drivers, manufacturers, sales and service personnel, and more. By placing identity at the core of this ecosystem, we can unlock a world of possibilities and ensure secure connections between all entities, with seamless and personalized experiences for all stakeholders involved.</p>

<p>It's not just about any one of these parties or services; it's about the entire web of identities connecting within and around the vehicle – including the head unit in the car that connects to a manufacturer's control systems in the cloud, the sensors and cameras that connect with each other and to the cloud, and even person-to-person and person-to-device connections. With unified identity, we can protect, manage, and govern these entities, while personalizing experiences and supporting sustainable business models. Now that's what I call smart mobility.</p>

 Smart mobility requires identity 

<p>When identity is infused into every part of an automotive manufacturer's connected strategy, it becomes a powerful driver for success.</p>

<p>Consider digital buying journeys. Car manufacturers are shifting towards digital sales models, where customers lead the conversation and have full control over the process – from initial research, to customizing and ordering a vehicle online, to finalizing the purchase at the dealer or directly with the manufacturer. In many ways, this experience is heading towards becoming much like any other retail e-commerce experience.</p>

<p>Once a customer sets up an identity online at the beginning of the buying journey, that identity stays with them through the sales cycle. It lets them receive digital and physical car keys and sign up for in-car services. The vehicle-to-be can be represented with a digital identity, too, ultimately synchronizing its characteristics with its "physical twin" once manufacture is complete.</p>

<p>With a unified approach to identity, the owner can even apply meaningful access controls to other drivers, ensuring safety and personalization – think seat settings for different drivers or automotive performance guardrails for new teen drivers in the family.</p>

 The current reality: identity as an afterthought 

<p>&nbsp;In the absence of a unified identity framework, the integration of physical and digital security measures becomes disjointed and prone to vulnerabilities. The risk of leaking customers' personally identifiable information (PII) increases when each service and application handles identity management independently.</p>

<p>Without an identity-centric approach, it's easier for malicious actors to exploit weaknesses and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. You can see this for yourself when you connect a smart mobile device to a rental car – often, you'll lose control of your entire contact list and driving history. Without proper identity management, the potential for unauthorized or unintentional data sharing becomes a real concern, jeopardizing privacy and leaving individuals vulnerable to unwanted solicitations or misuse of their personal data.</p>

 The vision: identity at the center 

<p>By placing digital identities and relationships between them at the core of the connected car ecosystem, we can solve these challenges from the inside out. Gradually building the security posture over time as digital identities are added, we can ensure a smooth and secure experience for car owners. From tracking the manufacturing process using digital identities to providing real-time updates through a digital key in the owner's phone wallet, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Unified identity requires a powerful, scalable, and flexible solution. It involves storing identity profile information, ensuring synchronization with non-identity data feeds, and delivering a seamless human experience during registration and onboarding. At run time, checking identities and access rights becomes effortless, and reliable communication with various applications and APIs is established.</p>

<p>ForgeRock, a leading provider of identity solutions, drives these powerful, scalable, and flexible solutions. With components that separate policy enforcement from decision-making, ForgeRock empowers enterprises to adopt a Zero Trust architecture for all identities – both <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/CIAM">human</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">IoT "things."</a> By leveraging strong authentication standards like FIDO2 WebAuthn and federation protocols like OAuth and OpenID Connect, identity-related issues, such as impersonation and unauthorized access, can be mitigated effectively.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with the integration of AI-driven technologies, such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a>, identity provisioning and authentication become self-driving and adaptive. This automation enables continuous authentication checks, ensuring a secure environment for all connected vehicles.</p>

<p>Putting identity at the center of the connected vehicle ecosystem is the key to unlocking seamless, personalized experiences. By embracing a unified identity, we can overcome challenges, enhance security and privacy, and foster a thriving connected car environment. With ForgeRock's powerful solutions, the future of connected vehicles looks brighter than ever before. So fasten your seat belts and get ready for a journey where identity drives innovation, convenience, and peace of mind on the road.</p>

 The Shyft Perspective — June&nbsp;2023 <p>As decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow, its allure has expanded to a broader demographic, offering financial services to those unserved or underserved by the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</p><p>Indeed, one of the main reasons for DeFi’s existence is to bank the unbanked and provide a platform for moving assets in a decentralized and permissionless way. However, DeFi is not without its own unique set of challenges.</p><p>One of the most glaring problems in the DeFi landscape is the unknown paths the assets travel — the commingling of funds. This issue threatens to significantly hamper the growth and acceptance of DeFi if not addressed promptly and effectively.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson once said, “The price of freedom is eternal vigilance and personal responsibility.” It is crucial to recognize that there are many misuses of decentralized finance&nbsp;freedom.</p><p>Malicious actors are abusing DeFi protocols for money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption, and scams, among other things. Addressing these issues at the current moment has become paramount for the vitality and growth of the DeFi ecosystem.</p> The Commingling of Funds in DeFi — Ride in the Wild&nbsp;West <p>Commingling of funds in DeFi refers to the pooling of assets from different participants into a single wallet or smart contract. While this helps facilitate transactions and optimizes liquidity, it also blurs the lines of ownership and raises critical questions about the security and accountability of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Such funds, often with a suspicious or unknown origin, create a profound barrier to the sound operation and regulation of the DeFi platforms.</p><p>Envision a scenario where an illicitly obtained large sum of money is deposited into a DeFi liquidity pool. Once mixed with other funds and redistributed through returns, these funds become nearly untraceable, providing a difficult puzzle for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulators.</p><p>The gravity of this issue extends further as it risks ‘polluting’ the liquidity pool with unverified funds, potentially affecting all participants in the&nbsp;pool.</p><p>In an environment that already battles with the problems like lack of oversight, this further compounds the regulatory challenges, potentially putting the entire DeFi space at risk of stringent regulatory measures. As the DeFi space matures, it is crucial to address these pressing concerns.</p> DeFi Investors: Seduced and Often&nbsp;Betrayed <p>Despite all the challenges, many who have tipped their toes in the crypto water perceive DeFi as an attractive and potentially lucrative investment opportunity. But the less adrenalin-tolerant, yet major investment players, are carefully observing the space and waiting for their safe moment to&nbsp;come.</p><p>What’s this irresistible DeFi power of seduction? The yield farming strategies inherent in DeFi platforms, whereby users provide liquidity to earn rewards, are particularly compelling. The DeFi protocols usually offer significantly higher yields than traditional financial instruments, presenting an enticing proposition for investors.</p><p>On top of that, DeFi also introduces a new level of accessibility, allowing anyone with an internet connection to participate in high-yield opportunities, regardless of geographical or economic constraints.</p><p>As the allure of decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to seduce the highly risk-tolerant investors, a surge of new participants is entering the scene. Enticed by high yields and unparalleled accessibility, they contribute to a significant inflow of capital, defining it as an expansion beyond borders of infinite financial opportunities.</p><p>Amid this growing interest, the importance of Compliant DeFi is coming into sharper focus. However, the adventure in the wild DeFi land might be quite tragic for some, so now the issue at hand is how to be better safe than&nbsp;sorry.</p> Compliant DeFi — Is it Safe to&nbsp;Play? <p>Simply put, compliant DeFi is the innovative fusion of decentralized finance with traditional regulatory standards. It marries the borderless, open-access ethos of DeFi with the security and transparency of conventional compliance measures like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">KYC</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML</a>, and CFT. The goal is to cultivate a more trustworthy and secure DeFi landscape that attracts institutional investors and compliance-friendly users.</p><p>One of the significant areas where Compliant DeFi shines is in dealing with regulatory complexities that wild DeFi land is&nbsp;facing.</p><p>Compliant DeFi is the answer to the misuse of financial freedom in DeFi. It eliminates the wild chaos and introduces a level of order, enhancing the sector’s security while maintaining its decentralized nature.</p> Why Compliant DeFi Matters at&nbsp;All <p>Compliant DeFi has the potential to shine bright in the land of finance and attract institutional investors, including those less or none traveled in crypto&nbsp;land.</p><p>By providing an environment that adheres to preventing the notorious comingling of funds and applying regulatory standards such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), complaint DeFi effectively bridges the divide between the decentralized finance world and the traditional financial ecosystem, creating a symbiotic relationship that mitigates risks substantially.</p><p>As the DeFi space swells with new funds, trust and security become increasingly significant concerns. Traditional DeFi platforms, while operationally efficient, often end up nesting commingled funds, and at any moment, unknown toxic issues might crawl out of this Pandora’s box.</p><p>Though at first glance, Compliant DeFi might be less seductive, it confronts these challenges head-on and secures a safe investment environment. This is the new brave new DeFi world where user interests are guarded, safer, more transparent, and accountable. It is a world where major investors (the non-adrenalin driven) feel comfortable interacting and looking at the long-term prospectives.</p><p>In a nutshell, this is the one, and most probably the only, alternative for DeFi, the moment that opens the road to sustainable growth and expansion without the shadows of malpractices or security concerns.</p> Keeping the Books in Check: Accountability in the DeFi Ecosystem <p>The skyrocketing influx of investors in the DeFi space, especially the more traditional institutional ones, calls for a level of accountability. Yet, again, Compliant DeFi stands tall, providing an environment that marries the innovative opportunities of DeFi with the professionalism of conventional financial services.</p><p>By aligning with regulatory standards and ensuring enhanced transparency, Compliant DeFi has the potential to attract an even broader investor base. And logically, such increased and secured participation can foster a robust, sustainable growth trajectory for the DeFi ecosystem.</p><p>In this dynamic era of digital finance, for DeFi, balancing high-return prospects with security, trust, and regulations is a tightrope to walk. Compliant DeFi appears as a reliable solution in this balancing act, solidifying its role as an integral part of a maturing DeFi landscape.</p> Final Note <p>Marking a transformative shift, Compliant DeFi indeed emerges as a significant catalyst, spearheading the drive towards expansive growth and wider acceptance within the DeFi landscape. This innovative approach is not just a tool but a comprehensive solution, proficiently harnessing the extraordinary potential of DeFi, while simultaneously addressing its inherent challenges.</p><p>As we navigate the complexities of the future, it becomes increasingly apparent that compliant DeFi, with its robust approach to security and regulation, is poised to decisively influence the evolution of digital&nbsp;finance.</p> The Flash &amp; his Love for&nbsp;DeFi <p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>As I was walking around Identiverse last week, I was reminded of the old Barbara Mandrell song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRHjl3xMB3o">I Was Country, When Country Wasn’t Cool</a>.” HYPR has been doing passkeys since passkeys (then known simply as FIDO credentials) weren’t cool. It’s given us a unique point of view on the overall impact and security of passkeys.</p>  
<p>First off, passkeys are so vastly more secure than passwords that you should run — don’t walk — to implement them everywhere that you can. Seriously. Stop reading this blog and go implement some passkeys. One of the notable moments of Identiverse was when Ryan Rowcliffe and Cisa Kurian highlighted that CVS has implemented passkeys on cvs.com faster than Google has deployed passkeys. (Go check out cvs.com and register for a passkey. It’s pretty cool.)</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/T98/reports/2023-dbir-executive-summary.pdf">Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report</a> highlights that more than 50% of breaches come from attackers using credentials and a large number come from phishing attacks. The beauty of passkeys is that they’re not susceptible to phishing and can’t be compromised in the ways that passwords can.</p> 
 The Different Flavors of Passkeys  
<p>However, it’s also worth looking at the question of the security level of different types of passkeys. As a quick refresher, synchronized passkeys (the type that you’re hearing the most about) can be synchronized or passed between devices by features in your operating system (iCloud Keychain, etc) or by your password manager (Dashlane, 1Password, LastPass, etc). Device-bound passkeys are tied to a single device.</p> 
<p>As most security practitioners know, meeting the requirements of multi-factor authentication requires having at least two independent factors of “something you know,” “something you have,” or “something you are.” Synchronized passkeys only meet the requirement of “something you know” or “something you are” depending on whether you verify identity with a PIN or biometric, respectively. Because of how they can be shared and transmitted, they don’t meet the possession requirement. This means that some organizations are looking at how they add multi-factor authentication on top of passkeys. (This feels a little bit like buying the latest Tesla and sticking a 1970’s spoiler on it.)&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Organizations also need to be comfortable with who will be managing their passkeys. For implementations of synchronized passkeys, organizations need to accept that they won’t know who is managing the passkeys that they’re provided. The passkey could be managed by the iCloud Keychain, Android, Dashlane, 1Password or another solution yet to be identified. Users will be in charge of who manages the passkeys on their devices.</p> 
<p>(Let me reiterate the earlier point: passkeys are so much more secure than passwords that you should absolutely go implement them right now.)</p> 
 Passkeys Built for the Enterprise  
<p>There are several scenarios where enterprises may want an authentication solution that meets the requirements of MFA and doesn’t have the same challenges highlighted above. This is where HYPR’s Enterprise Passkeys come into play. At their core, these are device-bound passkeys and are the same FIDO credential that HYPR has been based on since we were founded nine years ago. Enterprise Passkeys meet the requirements of MFA, are fully under the enterprise’s control, and can be used for other applications that require proof of possession such as digital signing and funds transfer.</p>

<p>We have the tools to build a greener Internet, one app at a time.</p> The Climate Crisis <p>The United Nations classifies the climate crisis as the defining crisis of our time. Businesses everywhere are called to revamp their infrastructure and processes so that we may stave off calamity.</p><p>In the tech industry, data centers are often the focus of concerns, and rightly so. Water is used to cool data centers to keep them from overheating, causing a big drain on our water supply. In fact, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/30/1119938708/data-centers-backbone-of-the-digital-economy-face-water-scarcity-and-climate-ris">a mid-sized data center consumes around 300,000 gallons of water a day, or about as much as 1,000 U.S. households</a>. </p><p>Furthermore, the amount of data we create every day is astonishing. It's projected that by 2025, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/">181 zettabytes of data</a> will exist. The processing power and electricity it takes to compute and store the massive amounts of data we produce daily is already at about <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/5-ways-big-tech-could-have-big-impacts-on-clean-energy-transitions">1% of global energy consumption</a>, with no signs of lessening.</p><p>These statistics are bleak, but there is hope for a brighter future. While working to make data centers more energy-efficient should be prioritized by those who utilize them, there is another option. </p> Edge Computing and the Decentralized Web <p>Building apps on the distributed and decentralized web comes with several green🌱 benefits.</p><p>Decentralized Data Storage - Instead of sending data to a server at a data center, data can be stored locally or at or near the edge. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> is a distributed file system built on <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, a hypermedia P2P protocol that stores data on various nodes in the network. Apps with WNFS also enjoy offline access, reducing the need for constant Internet access to use the app!</p><p>Reduced Data Transfer - Local-first edge apps can process data locally, meaning fewer data transfers to the network! Our smartphones are sophisticated computers in their own right, and we can do many computations without needing to access additional servers or the cloud.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCAN</a>, Fission's capabilities-based authentication network, doesn't rely on ACLs or Access Control Lists. Therefore, permissions can be validated with fewer calls between the user, the app, and the resource server.</p><p>Energy-Efficient Computing - Instead of running the same computations repeatedly and sending those requests to a server or even the distributed network, why not "cache" the results or save time and compute power in other ways? </p><p>Fission's <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM</a>, or Interplanetary Virtual Machine, takes arguments and applies them to a Wasm function. This outputs a CID or content identifier. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> to inform us if an operation has been run before so we can optimize our efforts and copy the CIDs of those outputs (the receipts) into our work. This saves both time and compute power! </p><p>In addition, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optimization">adaptive/hot spot optimization</a> and make popular operations faster by hardcoding frequently called arguments. </p><p>Finally, we can choose the order of operations that is most efficient while not impacting the results. This is done in IPVM, where we ensure mutations always happen at the end. In <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">RhizomeDB</a>, Fission's decentralized database, this is done with CmRDTs that enable data replicas to process updates in any order.</p> <p>We are working at the protocol level, but many ways exist to help make the Internet greener. What are some ways you are reducing your footprint?</p><p></p><p></p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode over Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. What are the cultural aspects of digital identity? So that’s definitely a good question and very relevant questions and this is one of the questions that our guest today is going to answer.</p>
<p>Our guest today is Kalev Pihl. He has worked with digital identity over 25 years. He started with a topic in governmental side, preparing Estonia for electronic identity, or national identity cards. Since then, Kalev has worked in the financial sector and in Microsoft. During the last 15 years, he has been the CEO of SK ID Solutions, a trust service provider that serves digital identities in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Hello, Kalev.</p>
<p>Kalev Pihl: Hi, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s nice talking with you, Kalev.</p>
<p>Kalev: It’s been a while.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, Kalev. So, let’s talk about digital identity. And the first thing we want to hear from our guest is something about yourself and especially your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Kalev: I think of the journey to digital identity for me went through this very physical, governmentally controlled national identity. So that was my starting point. And I guess that’s where I’m a bit stuck with my mindset as well, sometimes. And this is my limit. But that’s how it started.</p>
<p>So, it started from the idea that in the world of physical human beings. Governments tend to have this role in society to name, number and identify the residents, they treat as their residents of the country, we are speaking about.</p>
<p>And whilst we have probably different other nicknames in different other societies. And somehow, globally, these governmental-issued identities have become the norm of; How do we know each other across the world. How do we identify the people whom we don’t know beforehand. So, I think from that angle, I’ve stuck with the idea that governments have the role of naming and identifying who we are.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. I think it’s – I mean, in my view, probably in the constitution in most countries, I’m not a lawyer, but I’m sure it’s written in some of the laws. So that’s one of the functions of the government. And yeah, and that has been translated in our very, let’s say, not very recent time. But talking, especially in the last maybe 20 years that we have such digital identifications, like Estonia is pioneering and in a few other countries as well. It’s pretty digital, pretty well-established.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah. I think that the – for the beginning of any country or state in the physical world, some limit, some borders, what is the ground they own. Then we are talking about some legal framework, what is the agreement. Then we need to know; between whom is the agreement? And those are then the human beings in the society, and that’s kind of what every state or country is made of, I would say.</p>
<p>And that’s something that if we go now, from this real-life identity and tried to tackle the digital identity, the idea. Then there are two kinds of attitudes. One is that digital world is borderless, global or universal even. And therefore, doesn’t require and there’s no relation to any, these kind of physical limitations and countries, states and therefore, like no borders, no anything. And then the other is that it is just – it should be, is and will be always a reflection of something that physically makes sense. Only then it becomes meaningful in a larger context when it is physically meaningful.</p>
<p>So, I think that’s one of the staring points if we say that there is point to the cultural differences. Then the culture that we started off is clearly not so much digital, but rather what is the culture before any digital and then definitely, we have different digital cultures as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, that’s true. Every country has internally a different culture while some often several cultures inside a country as well. And this is something that shapes digital identities that we, the ones who are in this industry have been shaping and continue shaping today. So, yeah, tell me more about that role that the culture plays in shaping and influencing the current and the ones that are coming in the digital identity.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yep, sure. That’s the topic for today. So, the culture that we can see in the digital identities is quite a lot, related to, the ways how we culturally trust our own governments. How the government trusts its citizens, residents. And also, it’s very tightly connected to the idea of what is and how the privacy as such is defined in the society. A&nbsp;couple of episodes ago, you discussed heavily again, this kind of <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/privacy-by-design-iso-standard/" title="ISO standard on the privacy">ISO standard on the privacy</a>. And privacy is something that is cultural as well, and it’s not globally, universally defined as a value. And where the value kind of lies actually and these cultural differences. How they look in the digital identity is exactly, I would say, let’s take the two extremes.</p>
<p>One of those extremes is that digital identity is something that is central, that binds all of the digital actions that one does in a digital world together. And therefore, makes you, in essence, traceable, recognised everywhere. You cannot hide in a digital world, based on that identity. This identity reveals you everywhere.</p>
<p>And then we have the other extreme. We have digital identity that must, in essence by definition, protect you from being recognised from one environment to another. You must have different representation in different contexts. You have to have the right not to be recognised and not to be traced.</p>
<p>So, I would say that, culturally, the need might be on both of those extremes and something in the middle. And that’s I think, something that we are struggling globally now, that we are trying to talk about digital identity and what this identity does. What kind of privacy does it guarantee and what the privacy means to anybody.</p>
<p>And then we – then we are stuck with the fact that we don’t define the digital identity. We believe that everybody understands the identity and digital identity in the same manner. And then we also tried to say that the privacy is preserved. Privacy is granted. Privacy is by default as we like to say, or by definition and by default. But what this privacy means in this context of digital identity and usability also is not defined. So, we kind of use the buzzwords, and we neglect the background from which we come from. And therefore, we don’t understand each other, and we try to regulate that into different places. And well, do a lot of mistakes in that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah.</p>
<p>Kalev: I don’t know if that makes sense to you, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Of course, a lot of sense. So, one concept, one particular concept you mentioned is privacy, right? Which can – well, not can but means different things in different cultures, in different countries. That’s true. I understand that. And it’s a challenge to try to have a definition and based on that create the laws, create the technologies that support that. Yeah, indeed. It’s a very, very good reflection that you are doing.</p>
<p>Kalev: I think that with the privacy, again, similarly, those extremes. And as I said, one of those extremes is on this identity and the definition regarding that privacy is that: OK, the privacy means that there is no data about me anywhere that I specifically didn’t reveal myself knowingly, giving the consent to that specific data to be revealed about me. Which makes me in the centre of all the transactions about me. And well, gives me a lot of work, let’s be honest, because there are several institutions all the time that work kind of for me. Make my digital life easier, and they need to make decisions. And if those decisions need my data, then therefore I need to make a lot of decisions to reveal or not reveal that data to them.</p>
<p>And the other side of that is and I would say the other way of looking at the same privacy, kind of, from the same concept. Still saying that privacy is preserved, privacy is kind of granted and by default, by definition. Is that whenever your data is used, then you, by nature of the setup, have the control over who and where and for what used your data. And therefore, you can kind of trace back it and say that, well, why did you do one or the other thing? And if they didn’t have the right, didn’t have your permission, didn’t have legal rights to something then they will be punished by the law.</p>
<p>So, it’s kind of – one is preventing anything to happen upfront. The other is giving the privacy through the control that you know everything that has happened with your data. And therefore you are able to take the parties involved and make them responsible for their actions. So, like these are maybe couple of ideas of how to look at the privacy from different angles as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, in the case of privacy, just to give a concrete example. But how this would start if privacy or any other concept has to be defined based on the culture of our country, or our region? So how it has really defined?</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, the question then, when we talk about like, building creating digital identity. We kind of often think that this is one type of things to be done everywhere. What I’ve learned over the years, and I’ve really had happy accidents of meeting so many different countries, cultures, in different places talking about digital identity now, really tens of years. Then it still turns out that we are building the digital identity for a specific set of human beings. And those human beings have some connection to a culture, even if that’s a digital culture. Even if we say that digital identity in a social network, like Instagram, is a digital identity. For the people who use Instagram, who have some cultural preferences, otherwise, they wouldn’t use that environment. So, they have kind of agreed to a cultural norm there.</p>
<p>Or if we say that we are looking at the country, somewhere in the world, like Thailand or Mexico. Then we are building the digital identity for that culture that suits the beliefs and traditions of that set of human beings. It’s not a one-size-fits-all. But rather that this one-size-fits-one kind of thinking that I’m now become to believe, more into recent years. That there is not this one single solution that everybody will, kind of, inherently fell in love into. They have so many things in their historical backpack that it will definitely tilt their preference.</p>
<p>They have some bias to expect something that any other culture would never ever expect from the same solution. And we have to be designing mindfully those digital identity solutions for a specific culture, and I think that this is a value in the world. That we do believe in different things, we do act based in different preferences, culturally and that makes us interesting as human beings. We are not the same everywhere in the world and how to preserve that in the digital world. How not to become culturally one the same. Following one and the same set of rules everywhere, having the same solutions everywhere is an interesting, very interesting challenge, I would say for the humanity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes, it is, and I agree with when you said that there shouldn’t be like one solution to be somehow imposed to the globally. That is a reason why they are in practice. I mean, the reason why then – just in the case of the national digital identities. The one from Estonia is different from one from Finland, Sweden, Singapore, et cetera. They are based on similar underlying technologies; open ID connect, publicly infrastructure, et cetera. But in the end, they are – they were designed differently because they’re solving a problem for different cultures. That is correct.</p>
<p>Kalev: Like facial recognition anywhere in the world, fingerprint-based identification somewhere like. Those are things that either are or are not culturally meaningful. I would say Western Europe has some kind of cultural connection in taking, giving and recognising fingerprints, and it’s deeply I would say, related to the criminalistics and then crime. And therefore, this kind of feeling when somebody asks your fingerprint somewhere, well, wasn’t very, very pleasant, I would say. Touch ID and other similar kinds of things have now a bit eased this feeling. But if we’re talking on the national level, fingerprint collection, fingerprint-based recognitions, then this feeling is still there, whilst it isn’t there with a face.</p>
<p>Although like, if we talk technologically then it doesn’t matter based on which kind of biometrics, I recognise you. But the acceptability within the culture, like face versus fingerprint was really, really different, still is a bit different. And the same kind of routing in the criminology didn’t appear in many Asian countries, in some Middle East countries where these fingerprint-based quick recognition tools in physical interactions were introduced. And there was no objection from the society. It was very, very acceptable.</p>
<p>So, all of those, kind of, bits that we are taking from different either literature, or some really historical reference that we take with us. Those too change the way how we are able or not able to roll out any given technology for the digital identity, absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s a very good example, the one of the fingerprints. I didn’t think about that. But yeah, it doesn’t surprise me that in different parts of the world, the perception is completely different. And it’s just the culture as you said.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, facial recognition in Middle East countries, revealing your face in public for female citizens, well, it’s not very common. And something that again, we from Western Europe don’t recognise easily, but it is, it is a thing.</p>
<p>Oscar: Could you share now some successful examples, or I mean maybe not, it sounds like from these discussion site, like there are not many, at least 100% successful examples. But some, in some extent, successful examples of how these cultural human aspects have been taken into account to deliver good solutions for digital identity.</p>
<p>Kalev: Well, being a CEO for SK ID Solutions. Of course, I have to tell that I believe that we have been able to deliver for at least the Baltic States, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, solutions which are relevant for the culture where we are providing those services. And in that regard, we have also faced some clear opposition from the cultural perspective in some areas here. But yeah, that’s one of the things that maybe is possible here and isn’t possible in some other countries. So, our current service that is really used for more than half of the population in the Baltic countries is based on the fact that people know and use their national identity code as a unique identifier for themselves. And it is used in different environments now but is kind of creating unique identifier per any kind of system.</p>
<p>The same pretty much applies to the other countries. But then when we will take that concept, the same concept that is successful in variations also in Finland, in Sweden, in Norway, those are all kind of based on the single one identity. And all of them have like bank ID in Sweden is definitely a success story, from the usability and amount of users behind it. They are based on this idea that there is this one unique identifier, and you can reuse that in different environments. And it’s really serving the culture there and here. So, I would say that this is the way how it has been functionally well rolled out.</p>
<p>And we have to then say that the same ideology would not be allowed, possible, accepted, for example, in Germany. That kind of falls to the pieces in the border, of Germany. Simply isn’t welcomed there, by constitution. Because the constitution in Germany says that: well you shouldn’t, you should never ever create a solution where user is reusing its attributes in a manner that you can trace them. From one, let’s say government institutions to another, from one company to another. You have to be messed up everywhere. Where you try to figure out if that same person came from one institution to another, you are bound to by constitution to be puzzled by that.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, well, interesting. Well, that’s defined by law in that case.</p>
<p>Kalev: Similarly, it is not allowed in Hungary, for example, to have a unique identifier for a person.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what were the objections or the reactions you had in, you mentioned earlier in the Baltics. So, what, what was not culturally accepted, let’s say there?</p>
<p>Kalev: One of the things was that really this identity code is semantically meaningful, and to use that as user ID at some points definitely was kind of a controversial and needed longer and public debate. In Estonia, I think, 15 years plus, quite long public debate about whether really the identity code as such can be publicly shared. And then it turned out that the reason actually – well, there’s definitely this semantic part that it really reveals your birthdate, which means that well somebody can understand how old you actually are.</p>
<p>But the more practical reason for objecting that was that, and it turned out that and it still is the case. For example, in US a lot of, that kind of identity breaches that we are discussing, and which are like big, big, big fuss around the world. Those are based on the notion that’s kind of user identity, for example, the social security number in US, it is not treated as user ID, but rather as a password. And those are very different things.</p>
<p>So, one is the link like this is who you are. And the other is proof that it is you that the claim is actually correct that this is your user identity. So, when it turned out to be kind of public, then what use cases were hit. And what was discussed quite a lot towards this type of phone-based service when you call in and the operator asks to identify you, your unique identifier. Which is public, which is listed everywhere where you have ever been, which is written into your identity documents. But still, as there was no better alternative then they opted for asking you for the identity code. And therefore, if that was now used publicly everywhere, well, everybody understood that cannot be used anymore.</p>
<p>And somehow the discussion, thankfully, has gone to that direction, at least in this region. that it wasn’t the right thing to do from the beginning to ask this identity code as a password. Because it has never been meant to be secret. The fact that not everybody in the world knows that doesn’t make it a secret.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah. So, what is nowadays, in Estonia, what is the kind of called, the username? Or there is such a username in – for this identity? Tell us a bit on how it works.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, it is like 11 number identity code. It really consists of your, like, six numbers of that represent your birthdate and one of those. Then the seventh one gives the century and the sex you are being given. Then there are four digits that you have to really randomly kind of remember. And it has been long discussion whether those should be or could be changed. And now, in Finland, in Latvia as well. We have had this experiment of introducing another identity code instead of the semantically meaningful one. And this semantically meaningful identity code can be like, in Latvia, you can once in a life, go and replace your meaningful, semantically meaningful identity code to this new identity code, which doesn’t mean anything anymore.</p>
<p>It’s only a couple of years old, this project there so I cannot say how successful it is. But what is interesting with this 11-digit code really that is based on a birthdate is that most of them are able to remember it, because the birthdate is something that you can remember. If a society like Estonia would be able to remember just random 11 digits correctly, I’m not sure. But like bigger populations, I’m even less sure because they should have like more digits remembered, maybe. Then should be based some kind of – and somehow already based in letters and names and so on.</p>
<p>So, in Estonia, it really is semantically meaningful 11 digits which you can easily remember, and people normally do remember their identity code. They are reusing that on a daily basis in different contexts. Therefore, it is something that is not also easy to forget, because the society requires you to remember it. That is also this identifier we are using to allow you to kind of state who you are in the electronic identity context, and the same applies to Latvia, Lithuania.</p>
<p>And then the other, maybe just remember the other part of what was discussed in this context of electronic identity then yeah for the identification maybe the semantical information to recognise person is maybe OK. And then – but is it OK for the signature and then therefore, we have had a discussion of where in the signature this type of information should appear or not appear at all.</p>
<p>So again, something that we are now discussing, not so much on this user identity but still on this, on signature part. You should still uniquely identify who signed something. But do you need anything other than this identification of this unique person? Whether it makes any sense and discussion, culture discussions not happening in all countries in a similar manner. Some countries are more kind of prone to say that it shouldn’t be there. Others say that it is actually well, impossible to do without. It’s very, very different already in those three countries. I don’t know if I answered your question, actually.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, you have definitely illustrated pretty well how it works in Estonia and also in the Baltics. And that gives us a clearer idea that the –yeah, the problem that you are bringing here is, of course, is big and it continues. As you say, there are some experiments in Latvia, Finland, and there are discussions in Estonia. So, this continues, even though there are good solutions, but this continues, this discussion continues.</p>
<p>So, if we focus now on, let’s say, you and I. We are working in companies who are building digital identity products. There are also, for instance, governmental institutions, who are building also digital solutions or services that rely very heavily on these digital identity solutions. So, from – what is the role of technology developers and designers in addressing these issues, these cultural aspects of digital identity?</p>
<p>Kalev: I think the biggest responsibility we carry is to be mindful about these phenomena of the cultural differences. And not to sell this kind of digital utopia that, that whenever we go to technical solutions, and your culture doesn’t matter, your infrastructure readiness doesn’t matter. It’s just “Buy my tech and you will be happy.” Promises should be avoided everywhere where it’s possible, even if there is a customer who’s willing to buy that promise. That’s really, I would say, the threat in the world what I see.</p>
<p>And maybe the other thing that is culturally important and must be addressed, I would say. In those, kind of, sales processes and discussions about future tech. Is focus on really the cultural position of government, of public sector, how capitalism and making money is perceived in society. All of those things have different perceptions and therefore, your solution must suit the ideology that this culture is accepting. Either the government is the trusted, and well-meaning party in the society where everybody is welcoming stuff that comes from the government because it’s always for the benefit of the bigger goods. Or the government is perceived as somebody who is sneaky. Who is always spying on you, who you suspect of making you guilty over the things that you maybe did or maybe didn’t. So, basically, being paranoid about the government.</p>
<p>Similarly, you have to be mindful about if the private sector is something to be perceived as innovative, as providing service for the value they are actually getting from the market. If they are actually stealing behind the people who are paying to them, who are overcharging everybody, who are greedy. Or if they are really making the economy work and able to kind of collect the taxes in the country at all.</p>
<p>So, like, these perceptions are also reasonable to know and to remember. When we are offering – what type of setup should a country, should a society, should this bunch of human beings were requiring the digital identity. What they should ask for, what they should build for, what is the way how to fund, how to make that environment sustainable? Me, being a capitalist believer, I’m always kind of telling that, that when we are building digital identities, we have to see if there is a way how somebody can earn something from the fact that digital identity is successful. That it is used, that it is spreading, that it’s actually making sense to people.</p>
<p>And if such, for example, motivation is in the society, then there is a possibility that somebody will go after this benefit and therefore make the digital identity successful. If the, like monetary value is taken away from the system, there is kind of everything is free of charge, paid by this anonymous taxpayer or government. Then there might be that we have an environment where if the government is trusted, if the government’s promotional speeches about take it, use it, it’s for better, good. Those could be trusted and could be a good vehicle for rolling out a digital identity.</p>
<p>But it again, very much depends on like, did we provide the same model that this culture accepts? Or we took a model from some other culture and tried to sell it to a totally foreign environment for that proposal? So, I think that what we have to – the technology providers do, we have to really build for those cultures that we are selling into and building into.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes, yes, we need definitely to understand very well the cultures and where we are selling or helping with these technologies. As you said in some countries, the government is highly trusted, in others don’t. Then can be the banks are highly trusted in some countries, and in other countries, not at all. And then same can happen with telcos, as you said, also the private sector, some technology vendors from the private sector. So yeah, that’s very important. And the first thing you say is about, yeah, be mindful what you promise. That’s definitely a good reminder.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah. I think that this kind of naivety about technology being all good for every different situation still lives on. Similarly, of course, exists this naivety that technology, whatever it is used is evil. So, I think that both exist, but you should never fall into one or the other. It is never so simple.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. All right. I will ask a final question. So, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, I think that the message I hope has been quite clear that when building and when asking for technical solution, and especially as we are talking now digital identity. If asking for digital identity, ask: What is the fundamental belief of the environment where you are building it to? Don’t try to change culture through technology. It goes the other way around, culture defines technology.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, you said it very clear don’t try to – don’t try to change culture with technology. Yeah, absolutely. Very simply and well said.</p>
<p>While hearing you, your explanations, came to my mind that for business when people are – businesspeople are traveling to other countries, there are some books that I, for every or for most countries say “what is the business etiquette” of every country. So, you should read that before traveling to that country. So, there should be a similar book but for the digital identity, right? We should have for every country, what and how you should – “what is the culture in every country in terms of digital identity and identity?” So, we know before doing business. So that’s something that came to my mind when I was hearing you.</p>
<p>Kalev: It would be nice if those books exist.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, maybe, maybe I think you could be one of the co-authors, at least, you know a lot about this. Thank you very much, Kalev, for this very insightful conversation. So please let us know if people would like to follow this conversation with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, you can definitely find me through LinkedIn or write me. Our contacts on the <a href="https://www.skidsolutions.eu/">skidsolutions.eu</a> site are quite publicly available as well. So, I’m very public person in a sense, nothing is hidden.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. Again, thank you very much, Kalev for joining us and all the best.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, all the best to the listeners as well.</p>

				 <p>The&nbsp; Indicio Academy expands the company’s expert-led training into a new certification program of courses for engineering, sales, marketing, and business development teams who want to master open-source decentralized identity and use verifiable credentials to build Trusted Digital Ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEATTLE, June 20, 2023/Indicio, the market leader in delivering enterprise-class verifiable data solutions, today announced the launch of the Indicio Academy and three new professional certifications. The goal of the Indicio Academy is to nurture expertise in open-source decentralized identity technology so that businesses, organizations, and the public sector can use verifiable data to build and deploy successful Trusted Digital Ecosystems.</p>
<p>A Trusted Digital Ecosystem is a way to issue, share, and verify high-value data in a direct, secure, and privacy-preserving way that enables the data and its source to be trusted. Solutions built on Trusted Digital Ecosystems remove the need for direct integrations between different data systems, avoid the need for third parties to store personal data, enable mobile devices to function as highly secure APIs, and transform how we create and manage digital relationships. Easy to integrate into existing IT infrastructure, flexible, and scalable to any use case, this technology is increasingly being used to drive digital transformation through seamless and secure processes that support Web 2.0 and Web3 applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A certification course from Indicio Academy provides teams with a comprehensive understanding of how to architect, build, and deploy a complete Trusted Digital Ecosystem using open-source verifiable credential technology and how to capitalize on the value of using trusted, verifiable data. With the launch of the first certification program specializing in this technology, Indicio recognizes the urgent need for more expertise in the marketplace, both to support emerging deployments and to drive innovation in a dynamic, open-source, and interoperable technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our goal is to help teams to get to market quickly by giving them an intense training in the technology,” said Heather Dahl, Chief Executive Officer at Indicio. “Verifiable credential technology is driving digital transformation across every industry, fueling a vast number of new products and services. And right now, there is an urgent need for the kind of training that we are meeting with the Indicio Academy. Simply put, the more people we help master this technology—and the business of using it—the more value will be created, the more innovation will happen, the more benefit will be reaped.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each course is based around real-world case studies, how they were developed, and what made their implementations successful. Teams will work through course materials under the guidance of Indicio’s instructors, who all bring extensive experience in building solutions for global enterprises and the public sector using this technology. Interactive demos will help you grasp processes, information flows, and best practices for development and deployment. At the end of each course, there will be an opportunity to take an exam on what you have learned and earn a certificate.</p>
<p>The Indicio Academy offers three certified courses:</p>
<p>Trusted Digital Ecosystem Certification (3 hours): This foundational, three-hour course introduces participants to the concepts and components of decentralized identity technology and is designed for anyone who wants to learn about the technology and its business applications. There are no technical requirements for enrolling. Over three one-hour modules participants will learn about the power of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, how to design solutions for commercial and public sector applications through creating Trusted Digital Ecosystems, and how to communicate the value of these ecosystems to non-technical audiences. This course is a prerequisite for taking the advanced certificate courses.</p>
<p>Trusted Digital Ecosystem Business Professional Certification (+2 hours): This advanced course is designed for executives, directors, business development, marketing, communications, public relations, and sales. It focuses on the business of decentralized identity, value creation, and how to monetize verifiable data in Trusted Digital Ecosystems, especially through creating seamless processes. Participants will also learn how to manage the governance requirements for decentralized identity infrastructure and how to simplify the process of implementation of governance rules for participants in a Trusted Digital Ecosystem.</p>
<p>Trusted Digital Ecosystem Technical Professional Certification (+2 hours): This advanced course is specifically designed for developers, engineers, and architects and covers agent architecture, with a focus on&nbsp; mobile holder agents, mediation, connections, holding and presenting credentials, and using advanced DIDComm features. The second component focuses on how to successfully run a solution demonstration, including what to test prior to demonstration and how to present an effective solution deck.</p>
<p>The Indicio Academy is the companion to the recently announced <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-sandbox/">Indicio Proven™ Sandbox</a>. Sandbox offers a fast, simple way for teams to dive in and explore verifiable credential technology for seamless, trusted data sharing and verification using Indicio’s award-winning Proven ecosystem.

<p>The unique nature of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Digital Travel Credential (DTC) presents an exceptional opportunity to build a next-generation system for passport issuance and inspection, setting a new standard for the traveler experience. Entrust fully supports the vision set out by the ICAO for technological advances from the current eMRTD standard for ePassports to a future state that will see only virtual eMRTDs. But the journey to paperless passports will take many years.</p>
<p>There have been several policy and technical papers released – and, despite the gaps in technical specifications, we’ve seen many seamless travel pilots already. However, much of the policy work at the ICAO level to enable the passport-issuer created DTC remains in-progress or has yet to begin. Governments and industry should begin to contribute to policy discussions now to support future technology decisions.</p>
<p><a></a>DTC Standards</p>
<p></p>
<p>VC = Virtual Component&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PC = Physical Component</p>
<p>There remains significant work to do on communications protocols between the DTC and inspection systems. Most of the Type 2 and 3 specifications are yet to be developed.</p>
<p>DTC Pilots</p>
<p>Pearson Airport, Toronto</p>
<p>The Canada Border Services Agency worked with Entrust and Face4 Systems Inc. on smartphone-based enrollment including DTC derivation for a touchless arrivals process for returning Canadian citizens. The goal was to test passing identity information and traveler declarations to the CBSA back-end for processing, essentially replicating kiosk-based traveler processing, but via a self-service touchless process.</p>
<p>UK / EU</p>
<p>Eurostar is working with iProov and Entrust on smartphone-based enrollment including DTC derivation for a touchless train journey check-in and border processing for passengers departing the UK from St. Pancras International. The DTC can be reused for subsequent journeys. Hundreds of transactions demonstrated improved traveler throughput without compromising security. Eurostar is deploying the service as an operational system before rolling out to stations in the EU.</p>
<p>Netherlands / Canada</p>
<p>This pilot is a collaboration between the Ministry of the Interior, the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (KMar), the National Service for Identity Data (RvIG), Schiphol Airport, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and IDEMIA. Funding is provided by the European Commission. Canada’s engagement is limited to facilitating temporary procedural changes to waive the presentation of a physical passport prior to boarding. The project scope is for Netherlands and Canadian citizens departing Canada for the Netherlands.</p>
<p>DTC Use Cases</p>
<p>ICAO identifies the following potential DTC use cases:</p>
 
 Enable seamless travel 
 
<p>Using the packet of verifiable traveler data as the enabler of touchless travel experiences.</p>
 
 Improve the Advance Travel Authorization process 
 
<p>Authentication of data submitted to Electronic Travel Authorization and similar schemes, and elimination of data errors.</p>
 
 Streamline border management 
 
<p>Pushing the border out before travel starts by enabling the passenger to send data in advance, allowing authorities to make early watchlist checks.</p>
 
 Emergency Travel Document (ETD) 
 
<p>Type 3 DTCs could be issued by authorities to citizens whose passport had been lost or stolen during travel, saving significant costs and inconvenience for traveler and government alike.</p>
<p>What can document issuers do now?</p>
<p>Document issuers could follow the path being paved by the Netherlands Ministry of the Interior by getting involved in seamless travel pilots. Historically, document issuers have had little influence over how their documents are utilized. A pilot of this sort would require forging close relationships with immigration authorities and airlines. A pilot under the control of a document issuer would perhaps be easier to implement. The two obvious use cases within the control of a document issuer are streamlining border management and the issuance of emergency travel documents.</p>
<p>The rate of adoption of innovations in the passport world has some very understandable friction. Most passports are valid for 10 years, and ICAO’s policy to be backward compatible with previous technology whenever possible may make changes appear slower in implementation. But for the people directly involved, whether from industry or government, there is a growing excitement for the changes the DTC will bring to the world of travel.</p>

<p>HYPR recently announced the appointment of Matt Hartley as our Chief Revenue Officer. With more than two decades in cybersecurity and technology, Matt brings invaluable expertise in sales leadership and go-to-market strategies to propel HYPR through the next stage of growth.</p>  
<p>Prior to joining HYPR, Hartley held senior positions driving rapid scale and predictability across the revenue lifecycle at security organizations including iboss, Forescout, Optio Labs and MobileIron. As Chief Revenue Officer at iboss, Hartley led go to market growth in the SASE/SSE market. During his tenure at Forescout, he built their US Federal unit and then scaled the business as the VP of Americas Sales. Before Forescout, he served as General Manager of Optio Labs, head of Federal sales at MobileIron, and held regional sales positions at various technology companies.</p> 
<p>HYPR spoke to Matt Hartley to talk about his new role, the state of the market and why he chose HYPR.</p> 
 What gets you excited about this role? How do you think your previous roles and experiences prepared you for this position?  
<p>MH: I'm excited to join HYPR because the transformations happening in the market, particularly a shift of applications and people off traditional campuses and "perimeters," present security challenges and business opportunities that HYPR uniquely addresses.&nbsp; Identity is a critical market that spans beyond security into risk, HR, compliance and other business-critical functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While the security industry has been talking about the importance of identity for years, it rapidly accelerated with the pandemic.&nbsp; We have also seen legacy MFA solutions built on the password collapse under the onslaught of automated attacks. Importantly, we've now reached a point where we have novel solutions that can address the authentication pain point that has been the top vector of breaches for many years.</p> 
<p>My experiences to this point have shaped an understanding of the cyber security issues and also how solutions to these problems can create lasting business value for our customers.&nbsp; And HYPR is already leading in that direction with the most demanding customer environments at global scale who attest to the enhanced security of the HYPR platform but also of tremendous productivity gains for their end users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Why HYPR?  
<p>MH: HYPR’s vision, culture and world-class talent is what ultimately drew me to the company.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR stood out in its level of expertise, technical breadth and platform approach. I saw a team of collaborative doers, focused on solving problems and moving forward.</p> 
<p>Moreover, I understood that HYPR has a proven Identity Platform used by over 16 million users in 125 countries with a transformative roadmap informed by their global clients. HYPR sits in a unique position with control and visibility at the endpoint, browser, and mobile device.&nbsp; This distinctive advantage provides a powerful combination for customers at the point of authentication where many cyber incidents begin today. I am thrilled to join this team as the company enters a next-level growth phase helping more organizations fix the way they log in and create identity trust.</p> 
 Where do you see the market headed in the coming year, what are some of the major trends and themes we’ll see?  
<p>MH:&nbsp; We are beginning a sea change in the identity industry. The FIDO standard is being broadly adopted for consumer and enterprise use cases. The support of Apple, Google, and Microsoft for passkeys will certainly accelerate user adoption and acceptance. The transition to passkeys will present challenges and opportunities for the market. Companies will need to make critical decisions&nbsp; about how they implement, use and manage passkey-based authentication. Companies need an identity security partner with expertise in change management and a solution that provides flexibility along with the controls enterprises require. HYPR is&nbsp; already helping organizations accelerate their rollout of passkeys to meet internal and customer demand for modern authentication.</p> 
 Anything else you want people to know?  
<p>MH: The next generation of authentication is here NOW. If you're tired of passwords and want a consumer experience for users that makes logging in a delight, while simultaneously more secure, <a href="https://get.hypr.com/contact">contact us </a>to have a conversation.</p>

   Extra Virgin Olive Oil is often inauthentic, according to the article on Well and Good. Not only that, those mislabeled oils can cause health issues due to the unhealthy seed oils or nut oils that are added and which some people are sensitive to. The fake oils make life harder for the honest people of those Olive Brands that put so much work and dedication into producing the real stuff!

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 5th June to 18th&nbsp;June <p>Welcome to the latest edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, keeping you up-to-date with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency regulations.</p><p>From the UK’s Crypto Parliamentary Group advocating accelerated crypto regulations to Brazil embedding robust laws for crypto transparency, we’ve seen significant strides on the regulatory frontlines over the two&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>The US, on the other hand, is grappling with regulatory uncertainty as industry leaders call for comprehensive oversight.</p><p>Let’s not wait any further and dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Shift: Countries Align Towards Robust Crypto Regulations <p>In a bid to streamline and fortify the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector, legislative assemblies across the globe are taking decisive action. The focus appears to be squarely set on creating robust frameworks for regulation and oversight, potentially redefining the global crypto landscape.</p><p>Starting in the UK, the Crypto and Digital Assets All Parliamentary Group (APPG) has urged the government to expeditiously introduce crypto financial services regulations.</p><p>As cryptocurrencies continue gaining momentum, the government’s previous suggestion to include crypto within existing financial service regulations is being championed by the APPG. They aim to see the UK equipped with specific crypto regulations within the&nbsp;year.</p><p>Aiming to leverage the UK’s potential leadership in the sector, lawmakers are also debating bills to grant law enforcement agencies more authority over crypto activities, alongside the current requirement for crypto companies to register with the Financial Conduct Authority.</p><p>Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in Brazil, President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva has solidified his country’s position within the crypto world by signing comprehensive regulations into law. This decree, which defines the roles of the Central Bank and the country’s securities regulator, is set to take effect on June 20, positioning Brazil as a stable, innovative hub for digital&nbsp;assets.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669744785182056448?s=20">Image Source</a><p>A central aspect of the law is the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism within the crypto industry, further solidifying Brazil’s commitment to a secure and transparent environment for digital currency transactions. This regulatory measure harmoniously aligns with Brazil’s ongoing exploration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the Digital Brazilian Real.</p><p>The urgency of these international regulatory shifts is further underscored by the United States’ current predicament.</p><p>The lack of federal oversight in the US digital commodity market has created uncertainty, sparking conversations about the approach of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>The Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, advocates for Congressional intervention to protect customers, ensure market stability, and safeguard the traditional financial system from potential contagion. He suggests implementing well-established regulations focusing on asset protection, trading activity surveillance, conflict of interest prevention, and cybersecurity standards.</p><p>Further echoing these concerns, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has expressed her support for regulatory oversight of cryptocurrency to protect consumers and investors.</p><p>As cryptocurrencies continue to disrupt traditional financial structures, the collective call for swift, comprehensive regulation has now clearly become a global phenomenon. The challenge, as always, lies in striking the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring stability and protection for all participants.</p><p>Now, we’ll analyze two of the biggest developments from the fortnight and look into their possible impacts on the crypto ecosystem.</p> Cross-Party UK Group Pushes for Swift Crypto Regulation <p>The Crypto and Digital Assets All Parliamentary Group (APPG), a cross-party body in the UK, has urged the government to expedite regulating cryptocurrency financial services.</p><p>The APPG recently published a report outlining 53 recommendations for cryptocurrency regulation, aiming to position the UK as a leader in the global crypto market. It advocates for expanded powers for lawmakers over the crypto sector to boost financial security and consumer protection.</p><p>The group’s report, launched in response to a vision of making the UK a crypto hub, also highlights the need for dedicated units within regulatory bodies to handle digital assets. Additional recommendations include backing stablecoins with high-quality fiat currency assets and considering the environmental implications of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>This proposal by the APPG diverges from a recent suggestion by the House of Commons Treasury Committee to regulate crypto-like gambling.</p><p>Instead, the APPG’s report focuses on establishing a comprehensive tax framework for crypto, mitigating financial stability risks, and curbing economic crimes linked to crypto. The group is also examining the potential for a Central Bank Digital Currency.</p> The Impact <p>The ripple effects of these proposed regulations could be far-reaching. From the perspective of crypto users, increased regulatory oversight might bring more security to digital asset transactions. It could help safeguard investors from potential fraud and insulate them from high-risk exposure.</p><p>Clear-cut regulations might also foster transparency in the crypto market, thereby boosting investor confidence and attracting more participants to the ecosystem. However, regulatory decisions could also potentially hinder the freedom and privacy that is intrinsic to the world of digital currencies. It’s a delicate balance between regulation for protection and stifling innovation.</p><p>For the ecosystem at large, establishing a stable regulatory framework can help enhance the legitimacy of crypto transactions and integrate them more seamlessly into traditional financial systems.</p><p>The attention given to the environmental impact of crypto is critical, given the ongoing debate about the carbon footprint of blockchain-based transactions.</p><p>Overall, the move towards regulation signifies the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a significant part of the financial sector. It’s a crucial step towards shaping a more secure and transparent future for digital assets in the global&nbsp;market.</p> CFTC Chairman Advocates Congressional Action for Robust Crypto Regulation <p>CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam is pressing for a shift in the United States’ regulatory response to cryptocurrencies.</p><p>In a recent address to the House Committee on Agriculture, he underlined the need for a more proactive stance instead of the SEC’s current “Regulation by Enforcement” method, citing it as unfit for the fast-evolving crypto industry.</p><p>He highlighted major issues, such as the collapse of large digital asset platforms and market manipulation, as examples of why a change in strategy is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>Behnam’s suggested solution? Adopting regulations familiar to traditional finance, covering customer asset protection, trading surveillance, conflict of interest, and strict cybersecurity measures.</p><p>Such a move could have major ramifications for the crypto ecosystem. On the one hand, it may protect users from mishaps like platform bankruptcies and unscrupulous trading, potentially even easing the market’s infamous volatility. Stricter cybersecurity standards would also fortify the defense against persistent cyber&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Yet, an uptick in regulation could restrict the independence characteristic of digital currencies. It’s, therefore, vital to find a balance that protects users while not hampering innovation in the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>On a broader scale, clearly defined regulatory frameworks could enhance the industry’s credibility, potentially attracting more institutional players and fostering mainstream cryptocurrency acceptance. However, overregulation risks dampening the sector’s innovative flair.</p><p>The proposal to transition from a reactive to a proactive approach in regulating cryptocurrencies signifies a potential watershed moment in the United States’ regulatory stance on digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The impact of this change will undoubtedly shape the role of cryptocurrencies within the broader financial system, setting the tone for their&nbsp;future.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669744785182056448?s=20">What is Shyft Veriscope?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669428636691185664?s=20">Travel Rule Compliance Challenges</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669668973800038401?s=20">Secured User Data&nbsp;Exchange</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

				  Attracting and Aligning Partners in Ecosystems 
<p>When it comes to creating an ecosystem, one of the main challenges lies in attracting and aligning the right partners who can contribute to its growth and success. However, partners may hesitate to join if they are unsure of how they fit into the ecosystem or what their role would be. This is where an EGF comes into play.</p>
 Addressing the “Cold Start” Problem with an EGF 
<p>An EGF serves as a powerful tool to address the “cold start” problem. By providing structure and guidance, it becomes easier for partners to understand how they can actively contribute and extract value from the ecosystem. Additionally, the framework jumpstarts the ecosystem’s growth by aligning partners’ interests and facilitating collaboration.</p>
 Going Beyond Platforms: The Role of Ecosystem Governance 
<p>While platforms primarily handle technical interactions and data movement, ecosystems encompass much more. They revolve around various roles and activities, determining what is encouraged, what is forbidden, and how interactions occur. Furthermore, ecosystems require effective governance, including addressing liability and indemnity concerns.</p>
  Tailoring an EGF for Maximum Value Creation 
<p>When an EGF is specifically tailored for a MVE, it plays a crucial role in delivering a compelling value proposition. It becomes instrumental in attracting partners and establishing a solid foundation for the ecosystem’s growth. By identifying areas where to build and where to rely on partners, organizations can strategically leverage the strengths of different participants to maximize value creation.</p>
 Simplifying Governance for Efficiency and Trust 
<p>While governance frameworks can often be complex, Continuum Loop advocates for simplicity and efficiency. The key is to focus on the core components that require governance, minimizing roles and processes to maintain manageability. Additionally, implementing governance artifacts such as glossaries and assurance levels becomes critical in ensuring shared understanding and maintaining trust among ecosystem participants.</p>
 Empowering Organizations with Continuum Loop 
<p>At Continuum Loop, we are deeply committed to empowering organizations in designing and implementing effective ecosystem governance frameworks. Our expertise lies in aligning governance, business, and technology to help companies build vibrant ecosystems that thrive on collaboration, innovation, and shared success.</p>
 Leveraging Ecosystem Governance Frameworks for Success 
<p>By leveraging the power of ecosystem governance frameworks, organizations can create an environment where partners can contribute their unique expertise, drive value creation, and collectively shape the future of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>The word "wallet" gets used a lot, but is rarely defined. Whether you're fresh to web3 or a seasoned veteran, you've likely felt this confusion. Even worse: maybe you don't know you're confused? Let me explain.</p> What Is a Wallet?   "Which wallet should I use?"  "What wallet should I send this to?"  "Can I import my wallet?"  <p>In each of these questions, "wallet" refers to a completely different part of the Wallet Stack: a <code>Wallet Client</code>, an <code>Account &amp; Account Address</code>, and a <code>Recovery Method</code>—which itself infers the existence of a <code>Wallet Structure</code>.</p>The Wallet Stack consists of: a Wallet Client, a Recovery Method &amp; Wallet Structure, and and Account &amp; Address.<p>Colloquially, calling every part of the stack a "wallet" isn't an issue. For many people right now, they all indeed feel like the same thing. Where the problem becomes real is in the UI copy itself.</p><p>Across and within various <code>Wallet Clients</code>, the word wallet leaks inconsistently into the user experience. It's no wonder people get confused. For new users this can be misleading. For experienced users it may never be clear what's actually going on underneath.</p><p>Let me pick on Coinbase Wallet for a moment to ground this in an example. Not only are they the most successful brand in blockchain, they are also one of the worst abusers of the word wallet.</p>Coinbase Wallet: A tragedy in 3 parts<p>To enter Coinbase Wallet's world, one must:</p>  Install Coinbase Wallet (a <code>Wallet Client</code>), which will prompt you to  Create a new Wallet (aka set up a new <code>Recovery Method</code> that will generate a password protected <code>Wallet Structure</code>), at which point  The app will provision you with 10 Wallets (which are actually 10 <code>Accounts</code> identified by their unique <code>Account Addresses</code>).  <p>Because many people only go through this flow once, and never bother going into settings, their confusion may be fleeting. But can you imagine what internal Coinbase Wallet sprint planning looks like? "Alex, can you fix the bug with wallets being derived non-deterministically from the wallet a user imports into the latest version of our wallet?"</p><p>Poor Alex. Poor us.</p><p>Those of us designing and building need to be more precise. So: let's get precise.</p><p>A couple of notes: This post uses Ethereum examples, but the ideas hold true for smart contract enabled chains in general, and will be identical in practice for all EVM compatible chains. You’ll also notice I’m explicitly not using the word dapp. If a dapp is software whose backend is strictly hosted on a blockchain, that is a subset of all apps. I believe all apps will have wallet interactions in the near future.</p> Wallet Clients <p>When someone asks "Which wallet should I use?" what they're really asking is "Which wallet client should I use?"—examples being Metamask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, a Ledger Nano, or a Gnosis Safe. The <code>Wallet Client</code> is the interface they'll use to connect to an app, sign messages and transactions, and manage their on-chain assets.</p> Varieties Of Wallet Client <p>A wide variety of <code>Wallet Clients</code> exist, and the list grows daily. To thoughtfully recommend one, it's important to know a bit more about a person's intentions. What's their threat model? Which chain(s) are they going to be using? What do they want to do in web3?</p><p>Even with clear answers to those questions, making the right recommendation can be complicated. <a href="https://mirror.xyz/depatchedmode.eth/uxsq5GRcelYkwPB-BicnfjTPisxiNVJCQQ3bIGPPmmQ">There are just so many options out there</a>. It’s helpful to think about the ways you can categorize <code>Wallet Clients</code>:</p>  Software vs Hardware: Most folks will start out by using a software wallet on their laptop, tablet or phone—either in the form of a native app, web app, or a browser extension. Eventually, they're going to want more security and are likely to move to something like a Ledger Nano—a dedicated piece of hardware with embedded firmware. Software and hardware clients mostly map to the concept of hot wallets and cold wallets respectively. TLDR: putting valuable assets into cold storage on a hardware wallet client is a good move.  Finance vs Identity-focused: Historically, folks have turned to their <code>Wallet Client</code> to manage the financial activity they’re engaged in on-chain: monitoring their portfolio value, or swapping and staking assets. But, over the past year we've seen <code>Wallet Clients</code> such as Autonomy and Rainbow begin to support viewing and interacting with an NFT collection, and even constructing public profiles. These features address the emerging desire to garden on-chain identities—or rather, <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e">inventories</a>.  Single vs Multi-chain: Most <code>Wallet Clients</code> focus on support for a single blockchain ecosystem: Metamask on Ethereum, Phantom on Solana, Kepler on Cosmos, or Kukai on Tezos. But there are options that support multiple chains from a single interface. Trust Wallet may have the broadest blockchain support out of the box, while Metamask has begun supporting additional blockchain networks via its 3rd party Snaps add-ons. Single chain <code>Wallet Clients</code> tend to be more mature and have better UX, but multi-chain clients are the final destination.  EOA vs Contract-based: Signing transactions and messages (for better and for worse) is the backbone of web3 experiences. Most <code>Wallet Clients</code> rely on Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) under the hood and require a single signature to "okay" a transaction—we'll explain this in more depth shortly. When you want to up your security, diversify your recovery paths, bundle transactions, set spending limits, or support other sophisticated organizational workflows, there are also contract-based clients. Gnosis Safe and Argent are examples of contract-based clients that enable features such as multiple signatures (multi-sigs) to process a transaction. Beware: not all apps support multi-sigs directly.   Challenges Wallet Clients Face   Overloaded Scope: At this moment in time, <code>Wallet Clients</code> pull triple duty in the web3 space, handling: private key management, application UI, and transaction/asset management. Billy Rennekamp explains how this could be restructured with his proposed <a href="https://billyrennekamp.medium.com/account-coordinator-a-proposal-for-the-future-of-wallets-9fc54032a202">Account Coordinator</a> pattern.  Not Being Metamask: If you're using anything other than Metamask, chances are high you're connecting your <code>Wallet Client</code> to an app using a wallet transport layer like <a href="https://walletconnect.com/">Wallet Connect</a>. Or you’re hoping your <code>Wallet Client</code> has decided to emulate Metamask.  Poor Mobile Support: On mobile, most apps expect you to copy the URL to your clipboard, open your <code>Wallet Client</code>, launch its in-app web browser, and then paste the URL. Once again, implementing <code>Wallet Connect</code> in your app helps alleviate this and allows your users to use their mobile browser of choice. As a sidenote, most web3-enabled apps are neither responsive nor mobile-friendly; it is imperative that developers and designers adopt a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-develop-and-test-a-mobile-first-design-in-2021/">mobile first approach to user experience</a>.  Inconsistent Terminology: Accounts? Wallets? Import? Add? Connect? Link? Different combinations of these words appear all over the place referring to different things. Hopefully this post will help to chip away at some of that confusion, but there is still a lot of ground to cover. It is critical the teams behind <code>Wallet Clients</code> continue to engage in user research to identify the right mental models and terminology to support them—with a mind towards localization as well!  No Settings Portability: If you've ever tried migrating to a different instance of Metamask, or from Metamask to Rainbow Wallet—not picking on either of them specifically—you've learned with some frustration that you have to setup everything from scratch again: account names, block and allow lists, token lists, network settings, etc. That process is both tedious and error prone to do even once, let alone maintain on an ongoing basis.  Centralization Under the Hood: Many of the user experience improvements wallets have achieved in terms of displaying assets and transaction history have been gained through leveraging highly centralized 3rd party APIs. Moxie Marlinspike published an excellent tear down of <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">where this centralization has introduced fragility</a> into the ecosystem. There are better ways.   Accounts &amp; Account Addresses <p>When someone asks "Which wallet should I send this to?" what they're really asking is "What's the account address I should send this to?"—the long base-58 string that identifies your account on the chain.</p><p>So, what exactly is the account that address identifies? Well, there are two distinct types.</p>The triangle is, in fact, the strongest shape. Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs):   live off-chain—ie. they are "external" to the blockchain  are controlled by a private key, from which a public key and address are derived  are responsible for initiating all transactions   Contract Accounts:   live on-chain as code  are controlled by the functions defined in that on-chain code  can only act in response to transactions issued by EOAs  <p>Though Contract Accounts are becoming more common, most people still have EOAs. This is because, even if you use a Contract Account, an EOA must still be present somewhere in the chain to trigger the action you want to take—though there are <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337">plans in motion</a> to address this with Account Abstraction.</p><p>With both types of accounts, the Account Address is the way that you refer to it in a transaction.</p>Differences between EOAs and Contract Accounts Human-Readable Aliases <p>Most folks can’t just remember and rattle off the 20 byte long base-58 string that is their <code>Account Address</code>. So, protocols such as ENS allow a human-readable alias to be mapped to any address. The result is that I can invite you to send tips to <code>depatchedmode.eth</code> (🤑) instead of forcing you to test the limits of human memory (and typing skills). Many apps and <code>Wallet Clients</code> support these aliases in both directions: raw addresses will show up as ENS domains when they exist, and pasting ENS domains in various places will resolve to their underlying addresses.</p><p>It is worth underscoring that you can change the address your ENS domain points to, in case you migrate to a new primary account in the future. Because of this, an ENS domain can be a more stable way to identify yourself to other people in much the same way that your phone number remains stable as you move from one home to the next.</p>ENS domains can be pointed at an EOA or Contract Account. What's In Your Account? <p>Nothing. Surprised? This is one of the reasons that many people say a <a href="https://gaby.mirror.xyz/0Wq9zk0pZu_s3W1S4BiNcYXw9uSfSVbyGjNPgLHcs18">"wallet" is a broken metaphor.</a> When you think of a wallet, you imagine a thing that:</p>  Contains Stuff: It’s full of coins, bills and cards that you fold up and slide into your front pocket.  Is Default Private: Nobody can see any of that stuff unless you decide to show them.  <p>The blockchain account you’re managing in your wallet shares neither of those characteristics. A blockchain account:</p>  Contains Nothing: When I say that nothing is in your account, I mean it. No matter what asset you are referring to, whether it be ETH, an ERC-20, or an NFT, the balance that is attributed to your account is stored elsewhere and points to your account. In the case of an EOA this shouldn't be surprising, because the assets are on chain and—as we just illustrated—your account is not. The same is true for contract accounts.  Is Default Public: Anyone can look up your ENS domain or public address to see the entire list of current and past assets associated with that account, as well as all its transactions.  Realize the truth: there is no wallet. Challenges That Accounts Face <blockquote><p>You need each of the following for Safe NFTing:<br>✅A multi-sig archival wallet for things you don't plan to trade. Don't connect this to any service at all.<br>✅Transaction wallet(s) for selling/buying main marketplaces only<br>✅Aping addresses for connecting to random new stuff</p>— 6529 (@punk6529) <a href="https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1495450982079254541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2022</a></blockquote>

  Account Composition: Beyond the wallet being a broken metaphor, Dan Finlay has gone so far as to say recently that even "account" is a <a href="https://twitter.com/danfinlay/status/1526937584781230081?s=20&amp;t=W4eBXr4S6yUNZ-iSyKZAIg">skeuomorphic dead end</a>. And many folks are weighing in on how you might want to compose your set of accounts in order to best protect yourself against loss and theft.  Consent Layer: Because blockchains are permission-less and the assets are pointed at your address from elsewhere, anybody can put anything "in" your account at any time. This leaves the door open for a great deal of harassment, fraud, and general mischief. We need to carefully consider appropriate counter measures. Where and how does a consent layer (aka requesting permission) best fit into a permission-less system?  Multi-chain Address Space: In many instances, the same addresses can exist on multiple chains and networks. In other instances, it’s impossible for an address on one chain to exist on another. This all comes down to the compatibility of encryption methods used. When someone provides just an <code>Account Address</code> how do you know which chain or network they are targeting? This hasn’t been a problem in single chain <code>Wallet Clients</code>, but in a multi-chain world this problem becomes very real. There are technical standards to address this, but still not many user experience best practices.  Nascent Contract Account Support: As I already mentioned, there are a lot of benefits that Contract Accounts can bring, but they are still not widely supported for interacting with apps.   The Recovery Method &amp; Wallet Structure <p>When someone asks "Can I import my wallet?" what they're really asking is "Can I use my recovery method in this wallet client to rebuild the wallet structure that contains all of my accounts?" Bit of a mouthful, I know. Let’s break it down.</p><p>Let’s start with the <code>Recovery Methods</code>. These do exactly what you’d expect: help to recover your accounts or set them up for the first time on a new device. There are a lot of potential ways to design recovery methods, but let’s focus on the two standards-based approaches most commonly supported by <code>Wallet Clients</code> today:</p>  Private Keys: As we saw above, every account has both a private key and a public key. If you have an account's private key, you can always use it to recover the public key and account address. It’s created from a combination of randomness and cryptographic math. Strong arguments can be made that private keys should never be user facing.  Recovery Phrases (aka Seed Phrases/Mnemonic Phrases): These are the 12 or 24 word phrases (defined by <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">BIP-39</a>) that you are encouraged to back up safely &amp; securely. Their original intention was to be a human readable way to produce the randomness required to generate a private key. They are less prone to transcription errors than a base-58 string, easier to speak aloud (see: accessibility), and possibly (though it’s a stretch for most) even memorized.  <p>These recovery methods are incredibly powerful! They help your <code>Wallet Client</code> consistently derive what we’ll call the <code>Wallet Structure</code>: the list of all your accounts and the private keys that control them.</p><p>"Wait—what do you mean ‘derive’? Why don't you just say ‘create’?"</p><p>Because—brace yourself—every possible account in any blockchain address space already exists 🤯. Check out Dmitri Cherniak's <a href="https://deadringers.dmitricherniak.com/">Dead Ringers</a> for a visually sumptuous example of this in action. So, we say derived because your <code>Recovery Phrase</code> is used to discover a specific public/private keypair that controls an account.</p><p>"But wait… how do you avoid two people getting access to the same account?"</p><p>Incomprehensibly large numbers of things. There are so many possible accounts that, even though we’re deriving keypairs for them randomly, the odds of generating the same one twice are infinitesimally small. You have a better chance of hitting the moon by throwing a rock. But a well designed <code>Recovery Method</code> lets you derive the account deterministically.</p><p>"Wait—can you clarify what you mean by ‘deterministically’? Just so I’m sure."</p><p>We say it is deterministic because the same <code>Recovery Method</code> will derive the same keypairs 100% of the time. Almost all <code>Wallet Clients</code> achieve this through the magic of Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (HD wallet)—the most common <code>Wallet Structure</code>.</p><p>"OMG, yet another thing called a wallet!?" Yes.</p>Please, keep saying wallet. All words should be wallet. What Is An HD Wallet? <p>It's a tree of accounts derived from a single root keypair, and originated in the Bitcoin world as <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP-32</a>.</p><p>An HD Wallet is a pretty interesting construct because, using <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">BIP-44</a>, a <code>Wallet Client</code> can walk what's called a derivation path and "discover" all the accounts that have associated on-chain activity—magic! This aspect of an HD wallet's tree of accounts is pretty under-explored. Most wallet clients support just a single account, or a single layer of accounts. But technically you can have children accounts, and grand children accounts, and so on. There’s no limit to the number of levels!</p><p>Now, I’m but a simple designer. There are many reasons to be cautious about how HD Wallets are used, and how many accounts and child accounts you tie to a single recovery method; as they say, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. But, it seems worth investigating them more deeply as a means of addressing at least part of the account composition problem. Not everybody has the same threat model.</p>Child accounts, literally! Challenges That Current Recovery Methods Face   Diverse Threat Models: Even software professionals are not security experts. It’s hard for most people to know exactly how much time and energy they should put into securing their assets—a problem that is not unique to blockchains—and what sort of practices they should routinely engage in to monitor and respond to changing circumstances. This practice is called threat modelling. There’s a lot of room for building tools and practices that help increase awareness and default people into the practices that best fit their current threat model.  Accessibility: Though recovery phrases push accessibility forward a bit, the BIP-39 spec explicitly states "it is strongly discouraged to use non-English wordlists." The vast majority of people on Earth speak no English. So many things in this space carry with them the baggage of the programming languages that support them being English and ASCII prime.  Fragility: You only have to make a mistake with your recovery mechanism once, and then it is compromised—or lost! You may not even realize you’ve compromised or lost your recovery method until it’s too late. It’s hard to strike the right balance between ensuring a Recovery Method is at hand when you need it, but that also secured against theft. <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">Vitalik has written a great introduction to the importance of Social Recovery</a> as an alternative approach moving forward.   Wallet Out <p>So, I hope you've got a clearer model of how the pieces of the Wallet Stack weave together. And the next 10 times you feel the world "wallet" on the tip of your tongue, I hope you momentarily pause to check that your using the most precise term you can.</p><p>I hope that, in the next Coinbase Wallet sprint, someone asks "Alex, can you fix the bug with <code>accounts</code> being derived non-deterministically in the <code>wallet structure</code> when users input their <code>recovery method</code> in the latest version of our <code>wallet client</code>?" It’ll take some practice, but over time it’ll pay dividends for us, our collaborators, and the ecosystem as a whole.</p><p>Is there any single piece of the Wallet Stack that we can simply call a "wallet", though? In Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver and Vitalik Buterin’s latest white paper "<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul</a>", they opt to use wallet as a synonym for account (emphasis mine).</p><blockquote>We begin by explaining the primitives of DeSoc, centered around accounts (or wallets) holding non-transferable (initially public) "soulbound" tokens (SBTs) representing commitments, credentials, and affiliations. Such tokens would be like an extended resume, issued by other wallets that attest to these social relations.</blockquote><p>I’ll save my quibbles with the word "soul" for a separate post, but as goes Vitalik’s steady thought leadership, so goes much of the community. I suspect the wallet/account terminological collapse is where we’re headed. And that is fine, as long as we aim for consistency and clarity—both in our discussions about what to build, and the UI copy our wallet clients expose.</p>The revised Wallet Stack diagram.<p>Great challenges and opportunities lay ahead for the Wallet Stack in a multi-chain world!

<p>There are many benefits to both users and developers regarding local-first web applications. Here we dive into how local-first apps provide a better user experience while increasing resiliency and responsiveness and improving security.</p> Uninterrupted Productivity and Enhanced Reliability <p>One of the key reasons folks choose to build and use local-first applications is their ability to work offline. Users can access and interact with the app with limited or no Internet connectivity. This is great for users in rural areas with poor networks or when there is spotty coverage.</p><p>Offline functionality is made possible through data synchronization and conflict resolution. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> (Webnative File System) uses a cryptographic tree structure (cryptree) that gives every file and folder a unique key. This enables offline access control while keeping the data encrypted and portable. </p> Instant Responsiveness and Faster Performance <p>Local-first apps store and process data locally! That means less waiting around for a server to respond to the user's request. Fetching data locally leads to quicker load times and a more responsive application. It also helps users with limited bandwidth or costly Internet connections by reducing network costs.</p> Enhanced Data Privacy <p>Since the data remains on the user's device, nothing gets transferred to a server. This minimizes the risk of data breaches and opportunities for bad actors to access personal information. Users are happy because it keeps their information private, and developers enjoy not having to become security experts on top of everything else they are already doing. Another bonus - there is no risk of violating GDPR because the developer cannot access the user's info.</p><p>Fission's WNFS offers users public and private file systems. In fact, we were the first to introduce private end-to-end encrypted data to IPFS! Using <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCANs</a> to manage authorization, users have granular access control of all their files. </p> Seamless Collaboration and Data Portability <p>Users want to be able to work together on files. Concurrent editing allows multiple users to access and edit a file at once. A distributed file system like WNFS uses CRDTs to guarantee eventual consistency.</p><p>While centralized collaboration tools lock users into their platform, local-first applications empower users to switch to different devices, platforms, and services as their needs change since they're not tied to a specific infrastructure.</p> <p>Are you building a local-first application? Tell us about it in the comments! </p>

				  The Complexity of Creating Value-Driven Ecosystems 
<p>Creating an ecosystem that delivers value and attracts the right partners in the decentralized landscape is complex. MVEs provide a solution by offering a framework that demonstrates the minimum set of activities and partnerships needed to showcase the potential value creation of an ecosystem.</p>
 Collaborative Nature of Ecosystems 
<p>Unlike apps or platforms, ecosystems are not about having complete control. They thrive on collaboration, defining roles, and establishing a structure where participants can create and share value. MVEs enable organizations to start small, gradually grow, and attract partners who align with their vision.</p>
  The Crucial Role of Ecosystem Governance Frameworks 
<p>Establishing an Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) is crucial to attract and align partners. The EGF defines the ecosystem’s rules, roles, and processes, providing clarity and structure for all participants. Continuum Loop specializes in developing robust EGFs that align governance, business, and technology for seamless ecosystem operations.</p>
 Driving Innovation and Growth Through MVEs and EGFs 
<p>By embracing the MVE concept and implementing an EGF, organizations can create an environment where partners collaborate, contribute their expertise, and share the value generated. This drives innovation, fosters growth, and contributes to the overall success of the ecosystem.</p>
 Join Us on the Journey of Building Vibrant Ecosystems 
<p>At Continuum Loop, we’re committed to helping businesses navigate the complexities of ecosystem development. Our expertise and practical approach empower organizations to harness the power of MVEs and build ecosystems that thrive on collaboration, innovation, and mutual success.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>The level of activity around verifiable credentials has been nothing short of impressive, and as Kai pointed out, it’s noticeably bustling across the globe. The question is no longer if verifiable credentials will become mainstream, but rather when and how.</p>
<p>Particularly in Europe, where Kai and Anti are based, there’s been significant movement sparked by the initiatives of the European Union. Each European nation-state is making significant strides by investing in various projects. The landscape is punctuated by Large Scale Pilots, creating a wave of excitement.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: for those interested, the Large Scale Pilots were discussed in more detail during my <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet/">recent conversation with Viky Manaila</a></p></blockquote>
<p>As we recognize the value of high-integrity government credentials for commercial use cases, we mustn’t overlook a pivotal interaction: that between public and private sectors. High-value credentials from the public sector become invaluable inputs for the private sector, ripe for integration within their data ecosystems.</p>
<p>But what exactly does a commercial data ecosystem look like? What infrastructure is necessary for these commercial data ecosystems to truly flourish? The concept of a digital ecosystem is intriguing and formed part of the inspiration for this conversation (Note: I suggest reading “<a href="https://identifinity.net/wallet-wars-its-the-war-of-ecosystems-1dc9261afaa9">Wallet wars? It’s the war of ecosystems!</a>“, a blog post co-authored by Antti and Kai). In this piece, they nicely outline the dynamics between different players – the public sector, big tech mobile platform giants, and other technology providers – and various scenarios that could emerge in the battle for ecosystem dominance.</p>
<p>So this podcast discussion is centered on what makes commercial data ecosystems viable. Both guests are well-qualified to delve into these topics. I was particularly keen to hear from Kai about how advancements in his work on data spaces at <a href="https://www.mydata.org/">MyData</a> could offer valuable tools for commercial ecosystem participants to manage governance, liability, and more.</p>
<p>I was also eager to explore how we can learn from existing standard organizations serving the private sector, like <a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS1</a>, and how their approaches could be adapted for a digital-first, more decentralized world. Our conversation was certainly stimulating and I believe there’s a need for more discussions like this. I hope you find it as engaging as I did.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick soundbite from the conversation:</p>
 
<a href="https://northernblock.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sneak-peek-1_E55.mp4">https://northernblock.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sneak-peek-1_E55.mp4</a> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Antti, Kai and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
 
 How do concepts of digital trust apply or differ in organizations versus individuals? 
 How is trust achieved differently by organizations in organization-to-organization relationships versus organization-to-people relationships? 
 Are data spaces a new type of role within this digital ecosystem? Can risk or liabilities be shared within these areas? 
 Are there historical examples of organizations serving similar purposes for different ecosystems? 
 Why is liability more important in this digital space, when the issuing authority or the party attesting to the authenticity of a document don’t necessarily take liability if something goes wrong? 
 How is liability managed in this open ecosystem space, particularly when interactions don’t necessitate a legal relationship between parties? 
 How can risk be managed to ensure enough rewards and shared risk that organizations will want to switch over and engage in the new model? 
 Could consumers manage their possible vendors through a similar scenario by owning their own data, as suggested by Doc Searls‘s writings on vendor relationship management (VRM)? (Recommended book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527</a>) 
 Can the introduction of these digital ecosystems allow for earlier development of relationships in the customer acquisition cycle? 
 How can these ecosystems enable trust-based marketing? 
 How can new data ecosystems for commercial use cases be incubated and developed based on government digital identity or credentialing programs? 
 What would be some recommendations for forming governance bodies for data ecosystems and the incentives for organizations to form and deploy services within these ecosystems?

 Launching currencies on Verus, and any other PBaaS-chain (Public Blockchains as a Service), is better, faster, cheaper and more secure than any EVM-like protocol out there. This article explains why, gives an in-depth view of all the options and parameters, and teaches how to launch these currencies. Welcome to Verus, a fundamentally different protocol, and the future of currency launches and value creation.  What are Currencies? <p>Let’s go back to basics first. Currencies, also called tokens on many other cryptocurrency protocols, are a critical part of what makes blockchain useful. They can be used as a means of accounting, can represent property or rights external to the blockchain, and over bridges can be thought of as a means of communication or data transfer between blockchains.</p><p>A real-life example is a project that uses the Verus Protocol to account for energy production, transfer and usage. Other examples can be a token pegged to a fiat currency which is a representation of property external to the blockchain. Or fractionalized tokenization of assets, so many can share in group ownership of something. With all the capabilities Verus has in ways to relate tokens and currencies with VerusIDs (and subIDs), novel use cases arise naturally.</p><p>And what makes Verus currencies so powerful is that there is no coding involved. It is just creating a transaction, and then sending that transaction to the blockchain making the currency a reality. Anyone can do&nbsp;it.</p> Better, Faster, Cheaper and More&nbsp;Secure <p>Why is it smarter to launch currencies on the Verus Protocol? The answer is simple, because all launched currencies are part of the consensus mechanism. On EVM-like and account-based protocols (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche) currencies are not part of consensus and thus easily exploitable by smart contract bugs and malicious developers. With Verus, a UTXO model, all currencies are accounted for, and verified by the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, making it as secure as sending BTC on Bitcoin. To make it simple — all features on the Verus Protocol are on the first layer, the consensus layer.</p><blockquote>Verus fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape</blockquote><p>Also, where other protocols need L2 solutions which are mostly centralized, Verus includes self-sovereign identities, namespaces, privacy, DeFi, bridges, and currency and blockchain launches on the first layer. An innovation that fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape.</p><p>Launching currencies with Verus is also much faster and cheaper than with the alternatives. The magic here is that there is no coding involved. Anyone can launch a currency by just choosing the options and parameters they would like. It is as easy as typing in a command and the currency is ready to be used by the world within minutes. This process does not involve expensive Solidity developers or security audits, saving a lot of development costs.</p><p>Another big advantage is being able to export launched currencies to Ethereum as ERC-20. These currencies can then partake in the Ethereum ecosystem, yet have better security and cheaper DeFi transactions than when they are created on Ethereum itself. Each ERC-20 token can also be bridged to Verus. It’s all super easy thanks to the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge.</p><p>This is not all some fantasy, this is all functional (the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is in testing), right now, on mainnet, on the Verus Protocol. As you now know, Verus is built fundamentally differently than any other protocol out there, and ushers in a new era for brands, communities, businesses, entrepreneurs and organizations to create value in a better and more secure way than ever&nbsp;before.</p><p>The next chapter explains the options to choose from when launching currencies.</p> Options to Launch Currencies <p>For ease of explaining, all PBaaS-chain launch options are omitted. Good to know — with Verus anyone can also launch fully interoperable, independent and customizable blockchains with all the same L1 features as the Verus blockchain. The focus of this article is on launching currencies only, on Verus or any other PBaaS-chain.</p><p>To launch a currency on Verus (and any other PBaaS-chain) a namespace is needed. That namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. MyBrand@). That namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. product.MyBrand@, user.MyBrand@, more on this&nbsp;later).</p><p>On Verus a VerusID registration costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of a currency costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain’s native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). On other PBaaS-chains these costs can differ since the chain launcher can define its own costs for VerusID registrations and currency launches.</p><p>To define a currency, choose options. Then combine these options to whatever the currency needs to be. Just add the numbers together in the currency definition. The currency options are listed&nbsp;below.</p>  options:1 — The currency has reserves, and can be converted to and from the reserves (option 32 needs to be added). Can have one currency as its reserves, or multiple with up to 10 currencies. Let’s call it a “Basket currency” — a currency with a basket of reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized.  options:2 — Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create&nbsp;subIDs.  options:8 — Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID creation.  options:16 — Referrals are required for subID creation.  options:32 — The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. This option is also used for <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Ethereum ERC-20 mapped&nbsp;tokens</a>.  options:2048 — A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created &amp; has tokenized control of the root VerusID. Which means you can send the single satoshi token to other addresses and then they have control of the root&nbsp;VerusID.  <p>Let’s give some examples of combined&nbsp;options:</p>  "options":33 — this launches a basket currency. It is options 1 + 32 combined.  "options":2080 — this launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID. It is options 32 + 2048 combined.  "options":35 — this launches a basket currency, and only the rootID can create subIDs. It is options 1 + 2 + 32 combined.  <p>And so on. More information on basket currencies, simple token currencies and subIDs in the next&nbsp;chapter.</p> Two Types of Currencies <p>There are two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol. Basket currencies and simple token currencies. Both can be issued decentralized, or centralized (has minting and burning capabilities.)</p> Basket Currencies A simple example of a basket currency containing two reserve currencies.<p>Basket currencies are magical currencies that have reserves. Have a look at the simplified image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency, or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 reserve currencies.</p><p>The basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply&nbsp;burned).</p><p>A basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between. This is called the reserve ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is in the reserves and what the reserve ratio&nbsp;is.</p><p>When a centralized version of this currency is created, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, while automatically lowering the reserve ratio. Or they can burn currencies and automatically raise the reserve ratio. Anyone can also just burn the currency at will without raising the reserve&nbsp;ratio.</p><p>The conversion fees are incredibly low, 0.025% when converting to and from a basket currency, and 0.05% when converting from reserve to reserve currency. These fees go directly to the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, and/or they are accrued into the reserves making the basket currency worth&nbsp;more.</p><p>Because all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price, the protocol is MEV-free. The protocol doesn’t have any of the problems EVM-like account-based systems have. Verus DeFi is fair, cheap and has no rent-seekers.</p><p>Every(!) currency on the Verus network (also mapped ERC-20s!), can be used as reserves for basket currencies. As you might start to understand now — basket currencies are unique currencies that can not be found anywhere else and offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation. And anyone can launch them without needing any programming knowledge!</p> Simple Token Currencies <p>Simple token currencies are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanism, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/unleash-the-power-of-verus-technological-showcase-of-centrally-issued-token-fully-backed-by-gold-dcc9fae7ca0f">A small example of a centralized currency&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>The supply of this type of currency is static when it’s a decentralized version. When it’s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn&nbsp;them.</p><p>This option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">You can read more about it&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>And of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.</p> What are&nbsp;SubIDs <p>SubIDs are powerful objects on the blockchain. They can be registered in an unlimited amount under any created currency (basket and simple token currency). A few examples are product.MyBrand@ or user.MyBrand@. The name MyBrand@ is a VerusID (a namespace) that is converted into a currency. The subIDs are ‘product’ and&nbsp;‘user’.</p><p>SubIDs can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to people and products. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the subID&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Another powerful feature is that it has read, write and delete functions in what is called the “content multimap”. All kinds of information can be read and processed in the mempool of the blockchain.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there, it’s also a friendly name blockchain address that can receive, send, hold and stake funds, and can be used to login to services, password-free. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Read more about VerusID&nbsp;here.</a></p> Parameters to Launch Currencies This is all anyone needs to do to launch powerful currencies. Zero&nbsp;coding!<p>Next up are the parameters. Choose the parameters wisely to launch a currency that suits any need. Not all parameters are needed or combinable. There are many to go through, so let’s&nbsp;start.</p> “proofprotocol” <p>This parameter defines, among others, if the currency is centralized or decentralized. You can choose 1,2 or&nbsp;3.</p><p>1 is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are&nbsp;burned.</p><p>2 is for a centralized currency. If it’s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it’s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>3 is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBrand", <br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}' <p>🔍 A simple token currency called MyBrand, centralized (the controller of the rootID can mint and burn), and has a preallocation of 100 tokens to&nbsp;Klaus@.</p> “currencies” <p>Here you put the names of the currencies (or just one — it must have VRSC when launched on Verus) that will be in the reserves when it’s a basket currency (options:33).</p><p>Or when it’s a simple token currency (options:32), what people convert during the preconversion timeframe will go to the rootID of the currency, as a funding mechanism. In the case of a simple token currency, combine it with "conversions" to determine the preconversion price.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CommunityX", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","MyBrand"], <br>  "minpreconversion":[10,50],<br>  "initialsupply":100<br>}' <p>🔍 A basket currency called CommunityX. It needs to get a minimum of 10 VRSCTEST and 50 MyBrand into its reserves within the preconversion time frame to be launched. The initial supply of 100 CommunityX will be distributed among the preconverters.</p> “conversions” <p>Use this parameter when launching a simple token currency. Together with "currencies", it can be used as a funding mechanism for the rootID. It’s for the preconversion price. So when doing "conversions":[0.1], it means that for every VRSC the preconverter receives 10 CURRENCY after launch. The converted VRSC goes into the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>People can preconvert to this currency within the preconversion time frame. Define a "startblock", or let the default and minimum time frame play out, which is 20&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CoolBrand",<br>  "options":32,<br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"],<br>  "conversions":[0.1],<br>  "minpreconversion":[1000]<br>}' <p>🔍 This simple token currency is called CoolBrand. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 1000 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 10.000 CoolBrand. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds&nbsp;back.</p> “minpreconversion” <p>Use this parameter to set a minimum amount of preconversions. The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.</p><p>There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CompanyX",<br>  "options":32,<br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"],<br>  "conversions":[2],<br>  "minpreconversion":[500]<br>}' <p>🔍 This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds&nbsp;back.</p> “maxpreconversions” <p>Use this parameter to set a maximum amount of preconversions. During the preconversion time frame the amount set can not be exceeded. Everything above this amount will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CoinCommunity", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "maxpreconversion":[100], <br>  "initialsupply":100<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called CoinCommunity. During the preconversion time frame people can convert VRSCTEST into its reserves for 100 CoinCommunity in return. During the preconversion time frame there can not be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves. Whatever is preconverted more will be returned.</p> “initialcontributions” <p>The rootID can contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. Use this parameter to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it’s a basket currency (options:33), or to the rootID when it’s a simple token currency (options:32).</p><p>The funds to initially contribute need to be in the rootID when defining the currency. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency launched, the rootID has received an amount of the launched currency.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CommunityBasket", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","CoinCommunity"], <br>  "initialcontributions":[10,200], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Jane@":100},{"John@":50}]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called CommunityBasket. The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. At the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network, there needed to be 210 VRSCTEST and 200 CoinCommunity in the rootID. The initial supply of 100 went to the rootID (if there weren’t any more preconverters). At the same time of the launch, 100 CoinCommunity was minted into Jane@ and 50 into John@, this lowered the reserve ratio of the currency.</p> “initialsupply” <p>A required parameter for basket currencies (options:33). Does not work with simple token currencies. This is the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial&nbsp;supply.</p><p>Immediately after the currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to "preallocations".</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"SocialBrand", <br>  "options":33, "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":500, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Max@":1000}]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called SocialBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and in return they get 500 SocialBrand distributed among them. Immediately after launch Max@ receives 1000 SocialBrand, lowering the reserve ratio of the currency.</p> “preallocations” <p>Use this parameter to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. Funds can be directed to VerusIDs and R-addresses. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.</p><p>When using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered. This is because new currency has been minted after the initial supply ("initialsupply") is distributed.</p> “prelaunchcarveout” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>After the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, a percentage of the reserves is taken and redirected to the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"BusinessBrand", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "prelaunchcarveout":0.1<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called BusinessBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 BusinessBrand distributed among them. When the currency is launched, 10% VRSCTEST is taken out of the reserves, into the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio by&nbsp;10%.</p> “prelaunchdiscount” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to give people a discount during the preconversion time frame. After the preconversion time frame and the currency is launched, the conversion price will be higher, depending on what percentage the discount&nbsp;was.</p><p>When using this parameter, after the currency is launched, the reserve ratio will be lowered by the discounted percentage.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"DiscountBrand", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "prelaunchdiscount":0.5<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called DiscountBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 DiscountBrand distributed among them. Immediately after the launch of the currency, when people want to convert, the price is 50% higher. Also, the reserve ratio is 50% lower because of the prelaunchdiscount.</p> “weights” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to change the respective weights of the reserves in a basket currency. The total of all weights must equal 1. With a minimum of 0.1, since there can’t be more than 10 reserve currencies in a basket currency.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBusiness", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","BusinessBrand","DiscountBrand"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "weights":[0.5,0.25,0.25]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called MyBusiness. During the preconversion time frame there are various currencies that can be converted into its reserves. They have different weights to them. 0.5 for VRSCTEST, 0.25 for both BusinessBrand and DiscountBrand.</p> “startblock” <p>Use this parameter to define the block height when the currency is launched. There is a preconversion time frame before the currency is launched. When omitting this parameter it uses a 20 block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched.</p><p>The preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks, this can not be&nbsp;less.</p> “endblock” <p>Endblock can not be defined on basket currencies. It does nothing. It could be set as a signal to software that might use the basket currency.</p><p>It can be set on centralized (proofprotcol:2) simple token currencies. When the endblock is reached, it turns the centralized currency into a decentralized one.</p> “idregistrationfees” <p>Use this parameter to change the costs of registering subIDs under the rootID. The default registration fee is&nbsp;100.</p><p>When it’s a decentralized currency the fees are burned, when it’s centralized the fees go to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>To enable discounts when using referrals, add "options":8 to the currency definition.</p> “idreferrallevels” <p>Use this parameter to change the levels of referrals used when registering subIDs. The default is 3&nbsp;levels.</p> “nativecurrencyid” <p>Use this parameter for mapped ERC-20 tokens. The parameter includes the Ethereum contract address for the ERC-20. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Read here for more information</a>.</p><p>These were all the parameters to use when defining currencies. There are many, and combining them in the right ways make powerful currencies and tokens. The community is always ready to help when defining and launching currencies for your use cases! <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Please go to Discord and ask&nbsp;away.</a></p><p>The next chapter explains how to exactly launch these currencies.</p> How to Launch the Currencies <p>Launching these currencies is quite easy. Launch with the command-line interface, or Verus Desktop for Windows, Linux or macOS. <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Download&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>In the chapter before many examples of currency definitions are given. Let’s use one and see how it is launched.</p><p>First of all let’s see the difference between launching with Verus Desktop and the command-line interface. Verus testnet is used for testing purposes.</p><p>⚠️ It is highly recommended to launch currencies on testnet first before going to mainnet!&nbsp;⚠️</p><p>Verus Desktop: go to “Settings” (cogwheel top-right) -&gt; “Coin Settings”. There you see an input&nbsp;field.</p>Here you can run commands in Verus&nbsp;Desktop<p>To use the input field and launch a currency on Verus Desktop (see run before the command):</p> run definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBrand",<br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}’ <p>Command-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency ‘{<br>  "name":"MyBrand",<br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}' <p>Now, after doing these commands in either Verus Desktop or the command-line interface you get a HEX returned.

<p></p> 
<p>There has been much excitement and buzz around generative AI in recent months. New tools pop up every hour that will undoubtedly make us humans far more efficient. At the same time, hackers have the same tools available to them and they are some of the most innovative people on the planet. They spend whole days thinking about how to use the latest and most advanced tools at their disposal to bypass security controls of nation states, corporations and individuals.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In this post we look at how hackers are using generative AI technologies to modify their attack vectors and amplify their success rates. We also discuss the importance of identity security controls in preventing these attacks, and the increasing urgency around adopting them. We primarily focus on how deterministic methods of verifying humans are critical in this new age when artificial intelligence can mimic a human interaction with extreme accuracy.&nbsp;</p> 
 How Generative AI Makes Hackers Better  
<p>Generative AI is brilliant at making repeatable tasks extremely fast and effortless. Let’s put ourselves into the shoes of a hacker and consider the “Before AI” and “After AI” scenarios of the typical attack vectors that one would consider.</p> 
 1. Phishing  
 The practice of sending people fraudulent messages in order to trick them into providing credentials or sensitive information.&nbsp;  
<p>Before generative AI, hackers created generic emails with very minimal context and used mass mailing systems to deliver email, SMS or app-based messages to individuals. These emails often contain a malicious link that would prompt the victim to provide their password as well as a 2nd factor such as an OTP code or approving a push notification. The attacker would then get access to their account and wreak havoc.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This method is a “spray and pray” approach that yields limited results but is still highly profitable. Many hackers have moved to “spear phishing” attacks where the message is more tailored to the individual. This yields a much higher likelihood of success but is far more tedious and time consuming to execute. For example, spear phishing attacks may reference a friend or family member or recent event that a victim may have posted about on social media to increase the likelihood of them clicking the malicious link that the message contains.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With generative AI, hackers can make every single phishing message a highly tailored spear phishing message. The AI can search millions of potential victims' social media profiles, their company’s recent news and updates, and then craft a message that is uniquely tailored to that individual that they are very likely to engage with. The AI can even mask themselves to first have a “real” conversation with a victim that builds trust and then execute the malicious payload after a baseline of trust is established.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This approach is already making <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-phishing-prevention">phishing attacks</a> far more sophisticated and successful. We have seen ample evidence that successful phishing attacks can have a major negative business impact and the AI-strengthened attacks are a major concern for company CEOs and boards of directors everywhere.</p> 
 2. Social Engineering  
 The practice of manipulating humans in order to gain access to systems or resources for gain.&nbsp;  
<p>Hackers who excel at social engineering tend to make the big bucks. Social engineering can be done via many mediums such as email, in-person, over the phone or via video. During the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses had to fundamentally change their working practices and remote work became the norm. As a result, the number of social engineering attacks skyrocketed because a much higher percentage of our interactions (particularly ones that needed elevated assurance) became fully digital.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hackers took advantage of overloaded IT service desk employees and convinced them (over the phone) to reset passwords or get access to accounts. They would search the Internet to find out basic information about an employee and use that to social engineer their way into countless organizations. We also saw many examples of consumers defrauded by scammers through fraud schemes that cost the public millions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With generative AI, a hacker can use an existing model to execute attacks using deep fakes through chat, video or phone calls. These deep fakes will have full context and knowledge about their victim and be able to convince them to provide credentials, send money or divulge sensitive information that can be used for profit or political gain. For example, an AI can fully recreate a company CFO’s voice and use it to call into an IT service desk to reset their credentials. Once they have access to the account, they can send fictitious emails to affect the stock price of the business. Scary!</p> 
 3. Password Cracking  
 The practice of guessing or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/brute-force-attacks-what-to-know">brute forcing</a> a person's password.  
<p>Password cracking is a go-to for hackers. Most people have terribly insecure passwords and almost everyone has had some form of their password leaked in one of the high-profile breaches, such as LinkedIn, that everyone has read about. Hackers who are good at cracking passwords understand that most people use simple variations of the same password and can generally crack it with a little research. Unfortunately, this is a tedious process. At the same time, hackers are often limited in their password cracking due to cultural differences. If a hacker in Russia wants to hack into the account of a victim in Saudi Arabia, they would have to do significant research on this person’s hobbies, history, etc. to reliably be able to guess their passwords. As a result, hackers focus their time on higher value targets because time is money!</p> 
<p>With generative AI, hackers can use a simple prompt to have the artificial intelligence learn everything about a person on the Internet and then use the contextual information about their culture, language and background to quickly crack passwords. Furthermore, AI can be trained to mimic a human and input these credentials into websites that will soon be able to bypass the most sophisticated bot detection mechanisms.</p> 
 4. Malware (and Ransomware) Generation&nbsp;  
<p>Hackers play a never ending game of whack-a-mole against the endpoint detection and response companies such as CrowdsStrike. A hacker creates a new piece of malware, they deploy it using a 0-day, unpatched system vulnerability, or similar attack vector and do the damage they can (such as encrypting the system or stealing credentials). The security community detects this malware, tags it, and blocks this malware’s signature moving forward (they whack the mole).</p> 
<p>Hackers spend significant time modifying their malware code to avoid signature detection. This is tedious and time consuming and the perfect place for AI to be helpful. Using&nbsp; generative AI, hackers can create infinite versions of the same piece of malware and avoid detection. The malware now becomes completely malleable and the game of whack-a-mole starts to become impossible to deal with. A hacker can now make every single payload installed look completely unique. By the time that this malware is caught in the wild, triaged and tagged, the hacker has made a million more variations of it as they sleep using artificial intelligence. To make things worse, when a new 0-day is discovered by a hacker, they will be able to use AI to generate exploit chains in record time. Instead of spending days or weeks building a piece of malware, the AI will be able to use previous knowledge of other exploit kits and modify them in real time to create entirely new and unique viruses or ransomware within seconds of an initial vulnerability being discovered.</p> 
<p>With this new tool, hackers will be able to deploy malware and persist on systems much longer. They will use that time to intercept credentials by using keyloggers, extracting cached credentials, and then use these stolen credentials to spread to other systems in the organization to cause major problems for businesses.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is (and Is not) Phishing-Resistant Authentication  
<p>Phishing-resistant authentication is whenever a human is removed from the equation. A false perception is that passwordless authentication is always phishing resistant. Just like anything else, the details of implementation are critical to understand.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Let’s look at what isn’t phishing resistant:</p> 
  
  Passwords — Humans can be tricked into providing their passwords via phishing attacks or social engineering.&nbsp;  
  SMS <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">OTP codes</a> — Humans can be tricked into providing these codes using social engineering or man-in-the-middle (MitM) proxies.&nbsp;  
  App-based OTP codes — Same as SMS OTP codes but not vulnerable to phone number or SIM card hijacking.&nbsp;  
  Push notifications — Humans can be annoyed or socially engineered to accept push notifications. These are known as push attacks or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">prompt bombing</a>.&nbsp;  
  Number matching — This is typically added as a layer after a push notification is accepted. Malicious MitM proxies can be modified to bypass this control or a social engineering attack can convince a human to provide the number matching digit.&nbsp;  
  
<p>The above methods are now considered “<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">legacy MFA</a>.” They were originally developed to create an additional barrier for hackers and to prevent password spraying attacks that were causing major issues for a number of companies. These legacy methods cannot be relied upon given that fully automated bypass methods are widely available and utilized by hackers.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">Phishing-resistant methods</a> largely take the human out of the equation when they are accessing systems. The legacy methods discussed above always involve a human reacting to an authentication event by typing something in or accepting a notification. This approach is fundamentally flawed because humans are busy and ultimately just want to move on with their day. Phishing-resistant authentication always puts intent behind any authentication request.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To use an example, imagine every time any person walked past your car in the parking lot while you’re inside grocery shopping, you received a push notification to unlock your vehicle. How many people do you think would accidentally unlock their car? This is basically how legacy 2FA methods work. Phishing-resistant methods require a human to have possession of a device (such as your car key FOB or phone) and the system is only accessed when they intentionally push the unlock button.&nbsp;</p> 
 How Phishing-Resistant Methods of Authentication Prevent AI-Strengthened Attacks  
<p>Based on the strengthened attack vectors above, let’s look at how phishing-resistant authentication controls can help us against these sophisticated attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Phishing — By eliminating the need for humans to react to authentication events, credential-based phishing attacks are eliminated. When a person clicks on a link that takes them to a malicious website, hackers will have no credential to steal because there is no password and there is no OTP code or push notification that can be intercepted.&nbsp;  
  Social Engineering — The vast majority of social engineering attacks will be eliminated due to the fact that authentication now requires physical presence at the point of access. Hackers who are executing social engineering attacks remotely will be stuck and forced to focus on in-person attacks, which are incredibly risky and cost prohibitive.&nbsp;  
  Password Cracking — If there’s no password, there’s nothing to crack!&nbsp;  
  Malware Generation and Deployment — The vast majority of malware uses a phished credential to land inside a business environment. The prevention of phishing and social engineering attacks will relegate malware attacks to relying on 0-day vulnerabilities in order to compromise a system. Even when they are successful in doing so, the inability to compromise credentials via keyloggers and cache busting will make it extremely difficult for the malware to spread beyond a single endpoint in the network.&nbsp;  
  
 How to Transition to Phishing-Resistant Authentication  
<p>The exciting news is that moving from legacy methods of authentication to a phishing-resistant method is entirely possible for any size business today.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here are some guidelines on how to move forward with a phishing-resistant method of authentication.</p> 
  
  Embrace the change management. Understand that you will need to roll out a new capability to all of your users as well as train your team to support the new technology.&nbsp;  
  Provide users with choice. Most people are happy to use their personal mobile device for authentication purposes but some are not. Be ready to provide those users with a dedicated roaming authenticator such as a phishing-resistant hardware token (e.g. Yubikey with passkey/FIDO support).  
  Focus on coverage. Partner with technology providers that focus on broad coverage of use cases. This is one of those instances where you may very well have to work with a “best-in-breed” solution provider instead of the giant platforms who only focus on improving the security for their specific products. For example, Microsoft cares a lot about providing phishing-resistant access into Microsoft products, but your technical ecosystem is much more than just Microsoft (even though it’s probably a pretty big chunk).&nbsp;  
  Get top down support. Your CIO/CEO and other members of leadership should be supportive of this change. Even though a phishing-resistant method of authentication is faster and more secure, some people still resist change. Employees of a company follow and emulate the leadership so their vocal support will make your transition easier.&nbsp;  
  Put your marketing hat on. Driving user adoption of a new authentication system is much easier if you gamify it. Make it fun with prizes, positive reinforcement and acknowledgement of forward progress. Once you get to a tipping point of adoption, it takes on a mind of its own and it’s beautiful to watch.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Don’t let perfect be the enemy of great. You will have a few use cases where people may still use a password and that’s OK! These are typically very legacy apps that don’t support any federation or authentication standard such as Mainframe, or thick client apps that were written 20 years ago. In all likelihood, the number of users on these apps are minimal and you can use other controls (such as a PAM system) to better secure the access to these.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Verizon released its <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:ent:ea:na:8888855284">Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)</a>. In this 16th year of the report, Verizon highlighted their analysis of more than 953,894 incidents, of which 254,968 are a breach. The report shows three primary ways in which attackers access an organization:</p>
 
 Stolen credentials 
 Phishing 
 Exploitation of vulnerabilities. 
 
<p>A continuation of the findings in last year’s report, the 2023 report states that hackers continue to exploit the human element (including errors, misuse, and social engineering). Combining this element and the entry points above, hackers gain access to organizations to launch their attacks. In fact, 74% of all breaches include the human element, with people being involved either via error, privilege misuse, use of stolen credentials or social engineering. A slight decrease over last year! But we have a long way to go.</p>
<p>The use of stolen credentials remains the top way for criminals to gain access to organizations. This supports the basic premise that hackers just log in above all else. Stolen credentials continue to be the top access method for bad actors as they account for 44.7% of breaches. Additionally, stolen credentials play a bigger role in web application attacks accounting for 86% of breaches here. To put that in perspective, web applications make up 25% of all breaches,</p>
<p>The takeaway here is the fact that humans and their credentials are still the weak link in the security chain. Why? Because a credential is something that can be shared or stolen. It feels like a difficult problem to solve, but in reality, the market is shifting to meet the obvious demand here. If we can eliminate credentials – user name and password – then the problem can be solved. Passwordless is the answer, right? Well, not so fast.</p>
<p>While these reports can be all doom and gloom, fear not, it’s not all bad, because there are ways to fix the problem.</p>
<p>As I discussed in <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/data-breach-investigations-report/">last year’s blog</a> about the 2022 DBIR report, Verizon recommends the usual approach to solve some of these problems like deploying two-factor authentication and/or implementing password managers for users, all in an effort to avoid the impact credentials introduce. This approach can reduce the likelihood of attackers being able to exploit poor passwords to gain access to applications, systems, and data. These capabilities have been available and in production for years BUT we are still seeing similar numbers year over year from reports like this year’s DBIR.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe we need to focus on credentials. Why? As I stated earlier, bad actors log in. If we can remove their capacity to login we stop a staggering number of breaches. So if we can improve upon authenticating users without the use of credentials then organizations will be better for it.</p>
<p>Let’s examine how a 1Kosmos customer can log in. Our customers systematically replace credentials with <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">real biometrics</a> that are matched to a verified digital identity and it works across all operating systems including Microsoft, Mac, Unix, and Linux. The authentication is IAL2 and AAL2 certified and ensures the user is who they claim to be. Because we do an ID+Selfie at enrollment and compare the selfie at each and every access request we ensure that the user requesting access is that user.</p>
<p>So, how do we, 1Kosmos, replace credentials? With <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/bringing-verified-identity-and-passwordless-to-the-masses/">verified identity</a>. By combining identity verification with access management organizations can eliminate credentials, especially passwords and therefore, prevent most of the 74% of intrusions caused by humans. You may be thinking, this sounds like what my current vendor is claiming by taking you passwordless. There is an important differentiation to what I am suggesting here. Passwordless authentication is a little better than current MFA methods. Multiple biometrics can be stored on a device, more than one face and touch ID, implementing them as a main authentication method means it’s still unknown if the user is who they claim to be. The access request has proven possession, that is all.</p>
<p>The move to an ID+Selfie journey, and using that selfie as a reference during authentication, combines <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/identity-based-authentication/">identity verification and authentication</a>, now siloed activities in most organizations. This approach weaves authentication into the identity fabric.</p>
<p>Hopefully, more organizations will take this approach and next year we’ll have another decline!</p>

  <p>Set aside your preconceptions about the people who are at this moment driving the U.S. information technology (IT) industry's <a href="https://www.trade.gov/selectusa-software-and-information-technology-industry">$1.9 trillion market value</a>. They are neither John Hodgman nor Elizabeth Holmes. They are engineers and artists, marketers and analysts. They are imaginative and they are strategic. They include people who are good with numbers and people who are good with people.</p>

<p>As a career choice, the tech sector has come a long way since it first became a commercial entity in the 1960s. It had to. As technology evolved from its beginnings in government labs to scientific and industrial applications and on to personal computers, the people building and using the technology evolved, too. Now that it is integral to every aspect of our everyday lives — our work, health, education, transportation, commerce, entertainment — technology must reflect the people who use it. In other words, all of us.</p>

<p>But our LGBTQ+ community is underrepresented in tech and that's unfortunate for everyone.</p>

<p>Technology is all about solving complex problems, but if technology is developed predominantly by people from the same background and culture, it may fail to address the needs, values, or perspectives of other people. This is known as technology bias. One example of technology bias can be found in facial recognition algorithms, which are trained to learn patterns and features for identification. If the dataset primarily includes cisgender faces or lacks diversity in gender identity, the algorithm may not effectively recognize transgender individuals.</p>

<p>On the other hand, diverse teams can approach challenges from multiple angles and identify novel solutions to complex problems — and eliminate the risk of technology bias. Technology leaders recognize that diverse perspectives are more likely to generate a wide range of innovative ideas, leading to better decision-making, problem-solving, and success in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world.</p>

 Why Consider a Career in Technology? 

<p>Technology careers are growing far faster than occupations in general. According to the Bureau for Labor Statistics, the field of computer and information technology is <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm">projected to grow by 15% from 2021 to 2031</a>, adding nearly 700,000 jobs over the decade. The median annual salary for employees in computer and information technology was $97,430 as of May 2021, which is significantly higher than the annual median for occupations at large ($45,760).</p>

<p>Best of all, technology permeates every industry, so you can put your skills to work in just about any area that interests you. Whether you join a company on the cutting edge of cybersecurity or a developer of business software, gaming apps, or cloud infrastructure, technology careers offer a number of benefits.</p>

<p>When you reflect on your most used apps, platforms, and services, you’ll notice how often you're the creator.</p><p>You create your profile on LinkedIn, recommend restaurants on Yelp, post thoughts on Reddit, share your life on Twitter or Instagram, and design your latest app in Figma, to name a few. You typically upload your data to the platform, which provides distribution across its vast network along with free hosting and slick user interfaces. In return, it expects to make money from your content and attention.</p><p>At SpruceID, we think that the content you make should, in fact, belong to you. A platform with its own (sometimes competing) interests shouldn't be able to lock your content to its databases or disable your entire account on a whim. Some platforms provide data exports, but almost always as archive files lacking in data portability. This form of lock-in reduces your autonomy and stifles innovation. You should be able to do what you want with your data.</p><p>We could start with portable data formats that declare you as the owner when you create original content. This content can be stored in your own private instances of these apps that you control, and you can give out additional access how you see fit. For example, you could maintain private lists of book reviews, and choose which lists you'd like to share to a friend, without an intermediary that could remove your (or your friend's) access to those lists. They are useful in their own right, without a platform. As a result, instead of you signing in to the platforms with fiefdoms over your data, the platforms could sign in to your data vault that you control entirely.</p><p>We also recognize that digital platforms are incredibly powerful distribution networks serving content creators for cheap or free, and this is especially important for small creators and new brands. However, it is you who owns the content and it should be your explicit choice on which platform to post, and on what terms.</p><p>The Single-Player Ready (SPR) app architecture allows users to maintain control over their data while also participating in a larger network of related content. It has applications beyond just book or restaurant reviews – medical histories, financial records, or any other sensitive information that should first and foremost be under the user's control.</p><p>This next generation of consumer apps is enabled by the proliferation of user-generated content, widespread user adoption of smart devices with digital signing capabilities, and the increasing affordability of cloud computing for individuals. These technology shifts have made it feasible for users to directly manage (or delegate management of) their data instead of relying on de facto management by a few large platforms, separating the custodianship of the data versus use across networks. Digital signing further allows users to originate content with authenticity that can be verified, and create data licenses or digital permission slips that automate compliance with data privacy rules.</p><p>The architecture of users bringing their own data has been pioneered by protocols such as <a href="https://login.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Sign-In with Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ActivityPub</a>, <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, and <a href="https://solidproject.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Solid</a>. To date, these have faced adoption hurdles due to user experience difficulties caused by the usage of digital keys, the need to perform server setup, and complex interfaces for user-granted permissions. With Single-Player Ready apps, these hurdles can be overcome because applications can now offer unparalleled user experiences while maintaining user control and privacy.</p> The Building Blocks of Single-Player Apps:   Key Management: Users can create digital signatures and use encryption over their data. This allows users to originate authentic content, authenticate themselves, grant access to their data vaults, or delegate power to other keys controlled by them or someone else. Users should have many keys, and not concentrate all their control into one that can be lost or stolen. Instead, this should match expectations in the physical world using advances in public key infrastructure (PKI).  Content Authenticity: Users can create digital signatures over metadata that corresponds to original content, such as tweets, posts, follows, messages, videos, images, reviews, and more. This allows users to establish provenance for their content, especially when attested with other signatures from witnesses such as other users, platforms, or blockchains. This creates content authenticity certificates that can be verified.  Data Licenses: Users can issue and revoke data licenses that describe the policies for how their data must be accessed and handled, providing more control over how their information is shared and used, and by whom.  Personal Data Vaults: Users can securely store and manage their digital information, including content. Access to the content within these vaults is granted via digitally signed permission slips (known as capabilities), which can be revoked later.   <p>These core building blocks introduce authenticity and integrity into digital interactions with Single-Player Ready apps. Today, the root of data provenance is typically in a cluster of platform-hosted SQL databases, but there's no reason why data provenance can't be rooted in digitally signed content that users independently hold. The transition away from centralized data silos will allow users to have fuller control over their digital interactions.</p> The Building Blocks: Keys are Digital Empowerment  <p><br>One of the critical components in this new paradigm is the concept that "keys equal digital empowerment." Traditionally, users have relied on either frequently-lost passwords or "Big Login" providers, such as Facebook, Google, or other similar services, to manage their online identities and data. However, with the advent of key-based authentication standards like <a href="https://login.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Sign-in with Ethereum</a> or <a href="https://passkeys.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">passkeys</a>, users can sign messages digitally to directly authenticate themselves and may be able to further authorize access to their data.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/">  Why Sign-In with Ethereum is a Game-Changer - Part 1  Sign-In with Ethereum is a game-changer for user choice on the Internet. Instead of submitting to “Big Login,” users can now login using the same keys controlling their blockchain accounts--without an intermediary.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>However, today's UX for signing different types of transactions or performing encryption does not always reflect the smooth, frictionless interactions we are used to in most consumer applications. If every time a user wanted to “like” a tweet or “follow” someone on Single-Player Ready Twitter, they were faced with a cumbersome digital signing dialog and more confirmations to persist their content, they probably wouldn't be users for long.</p><p>This can be solved by allowing users to use different keys for different purposes. For example, some keys might be generated on the spot (session keys) to perform certain pre-authorized actions without a slew of confirmation dialogs. Other keys might be long-lived, able to grant permissions to the session key after a confirmation dialog. We can innovate on signing standards and better key management to reduce friction for users while also maintaining integrity.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/from-sign-in-with-ethereum-to-session-keys/">  From Sign-In with Ethereum to Session Keys  Session keys let users root all their digital interactions to their keys.  SpruceWayne Chang    </a><p>Keys with existing privileges can manage access to resources by delegating some (or all) of those privileges to another key. For example, you may want to give your new physician's office access to your medical history since 2015. In this scenario, you, the owner of your medical data, create a data license that entitles the physician's office to retain your general medical history since 2015 for 5 years, or until you revoke the license.</p><p>To retrieve the actual data and associated data license, you grant a permission slip to the physician's office so they can access your data vault over the next hour for those specific files, and nothing more. On future visits, you may decide to adjust the data license so the physician's office can further share your data with certain medical specialists, but no further. This kind of system operates on the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=Definition(s)%3A,needs%20to%20perform%20its%20function.">principle of least privilege</a>, where an entity is granted the minimum resources and authorizations to perform a specific function and nothing else. </p><p>You can use these permission slips (often known as "capabilities") to grant others access to your digital resources, and you can also revoke that access at a later time. Enter user-controlled data vaults (or "personal clouds"), which respect the rules set in these permission slips. At SpruceID, we believe that a user should also be able to define where their data live by authorizing who can host the infrastructure for their data. As standards for these permission slips (e.g., <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JWTs</a>, <a href="https://ucan.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">UCANs</a>, and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-spec/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ZCAPs</a>) gain adoption, they will be accepted in more and more places.</p> From Single Player to Multiplayer <p>While "Single-Player Ready" applications can be useful (and fun) without anyone else, they are much more powerful when upgraded to "multiplayer" applications, where interaction with others and network effects become very important. </p><p>We can think about how a Single-Player Ready Yelp evolves to be multiplayer. You would begin with your own personal version of Yelp. You can write the most scathing reviews about your experience at your most recent dinner if you want. Your reviews are stored in your personal data vault–your personal space to store all your honest thoughts, where you control access to the information rather than a centralized application. </p><p>From there, you can grant permission slips via digital signing to share select reviews with other "Personal Yelp" instances based on their digital accounts, such as Ethereum addresses, decentralized identifiers, or even email addresses. You can also grant data licenses that allow further sharing to your friends’ friends, which can be used to crowdsource reviews from a trusted circle. If one of those friends or friends’ friends leaves a review you vehemently disagree with or find offensive, you can eject them from your own review system. Because their content is rooted in their digital keys, you can filter out all of their reviews with a single setting - across all other places where they use those keys. You could message them using end-to-end encrypted messaging to deliver the sad news they have been removed from your reviews circle of trust, assuming they haven't blocked you first.</p><p>Single-Player Ready apps have the potential to revolutionize how we interact with online applications and services. They empower users with data portability, freedom from digital lock-in, and minimized control from intermediaries. They also enable impressive user experiences that can delight while maintaining security. The future of digital identity and data ownership is in our hands, and it’s time to take control.</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

<p>Entrust keeps the world moving safely by enabling secure identities, payments, and data. In the heart of Pride month, I can’t help but home in on that first piece – enabling strong identities.</p>
<p>Protecting and enabling identities makes every life possible. When you cross a border, make a purchase with your credit card, or access trusted accounts in your personal or work life, you’re likely using or being protected by Entrust solutions that enable trusted, authentic identities.</p>
<p>If you were to tell my younger self that I’d be out and proud working for a technology company that builds the world’s most critical identity solutions and emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion within my workplace: I would’ve told you to keep dreaming.</p>
<p>You see, it’s hard to describe the profound impact such a simple word like “identity” has on the LGBTQ+ community. Many of us spend years feeling forced to translate our authentic identities into something “acceptable” for the workplace. There is comfort in knowing my workplace values my authentic identity.</p>
<p>This month, and every month, our LGBTQ+ Alliance at Entrust proudly emphasizes the importance of providing a space for our community members and allies to openly express their identity in the workplace, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Since forming the Entrust LGBTQ+ Alliance in June of 2020, we’ve been raising awareness and visibility for our LGBTQ+ colleagues aligned with our commitment to be inclusive of all forms of diversity by:</p>
 
 Offering a monthly meeting for our Alliance members to share stories, discuss important topics within our community, and come together to celebrate our identities. 
 Hosting internal events with authors and subject matter experts on books and topics that exemplify what it means to lead with inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community. 
 Fundraising efforts for nonprofit organizations like <a href="https://outintech.com/">Out in Tech</a> and <a href="https://outrightinternational.org/">Outright International</a> to show our support and raise our voices globally. 
 Partnering with our talent acquisition team to attend events that focus on recruiting LGBTQ+ people to join our organization. 
 Creating trainings like “Becoming a Better Ally” and “Demystifying Gender Identity” more than 68% of our global colleagues taking such courses to date. 
 Working with our global benefits team to ensure colleague offerings include LGBTQ+ inclusive terminology. 
 
<p>Protecting identities will always be a core principle of what we do at Entrust, and I’m proud to be part of an organization that exemplifies how your authentic identity can be safe and secure through impactful engagement efforts. Happy Pride Month!</p>

<p>As one of the longest established blockchain companies in the UK, <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> feels very positive about <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1668174629695832064">Rishi Sunak’s announcement</a> of the imminent opening of <a href="https://a16z.com/">A16Z</a>’s first international office here in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>In the six years of our existence, Mattereum has seen crypto booms and crypto winters (<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa">2022</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/2018-year-in-preview-the-future-of-cryptocurrency-b99110480ff0">2018</a>) and we entirely agree with Prime Minister Sunak’s belief that the UK’s future success as a Web3 superpower is founded on creating an environment where the right regulations and guardrails are in place to protect consumers and foster innovation.</p><blockquote>As we cement the UK’s place as a science and tech superpower, we must embrace new innovations like Web3, powered by blockchain technology, which will enable start-ups to flourish here and grow the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>“That success is founded on having the right regulation and guardrails in place to protect consumers and foster innovation. While there’s still work to do, I’m determined to unlock opportunities for this technology and turn the UK into the world’s Web3&nbsp;centre.</blockquote><p>UK Prime Minister, Rt Honorable Rishi&nbsp;Sunak</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/announcement/expanding-uk-andreessen-horowitz/">Expanding to the UK - a16z crypto</a></p><p>Mattereum has long realised that the “wild west” atmosphere that formerly characterised the Web3 space does not create a sustainable long-term business environment, and that the future of the blockchain lies in it becoming a sober, regulated, practical space that provides real opportunities for business growth. For this to happen, investment is needed, and A16Z’s vote of confidence in the UK’s approach to Web3 shows that important investors agree and want to support innovators in what is fast becoming the world’s most effective location to do Web3 business.</p><p>As part of our commitment to creating the environment where this is possible, Mattereum has worked closely with the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce (UKJT) to develop the <a href="https://lawtechuk.io/insights/ukjt-digital-disputes-rules">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> (DDRR) that allow rapid resolution of blockchain and crypto legal disputes within the UK jurisdiction.</p><blockquote>The theory is to dispel the myth that blockchain is a fringe technology used only by those wanting to risk their livelihoods or possibly make their fortunes on volatile cryptoassets like&nbsp;Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote>The blockchain is now at a stage in its development equivalent to where the internet was in or around 1995. The internet was unstoppable in 1995 and blockchain technology is unstoppable now. It will become ubiquitous in all major industrial and financial sectors, simply because it allows for the immutable recording of data, thereby reducing friction in commercial and consumer transactions and obliterating the scope for dispute as to what has occurred.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Speech-MR-to-Smarter-Contracts-Report-Launch-Lawtech-UK-UKJT-Blockchain-Smart-Contracts.pdf">The Right Hon. Sir Geoffrey Vos (Head of Civil Justice for the UK) at the Lawtech UK Launch Of Smarter Contracts Report</a></p><p>Mattereum has also gone on to be the first company to fully incorporate the DDRR into our business model. Indeed, Mattereum’s whole business model is based on the provision of appropriate guardrails; our Mattereum Asset Passports (MAP) are a unique innovation that provides a legally binding connection between a physical object and the blockchain, enforceable in 172 jurisdictions worldwide.</p><p>This facilitates safe high-value e-commerce on the blockchain and allows AIs to interface with physical objects by providing means to determine that they are not digital fakes. It is clear that putting physical assets on chain is the next growth area for the blockchain and MAPs are already established and working as a technology to keep assets safe and to protect both businesses and consumers from fraud and manipulation. This helps lay the foundations for a future where the blockchain is a trusted technology operating within established regulations and guardrails.</p><p>The decision by A16Z to locate their first international office here is clear evidence that the UK’s approach to innovation and legislation is working. We welcome the Prime Minister’s commitment to making the UK a responsible Web3-friendly business environment and look forward to seeing a further flowering of innovation enabled by investment from Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>If you are working on a project that you think could enhance or be enhanced by the <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> system get in touch with us via contact@mattereum.com</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/mattereum-welcomes-the-arrival-of-a16z-in-the-uk-f82fe8432f5e">Mattereum Welcomes the Arrival of A16Z in the UK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We built an EVM-based game that tests the limits of blockchain development and user experience.</p> Why Build a Blockchain Game? <p>You may wonder why Fission, a protocol engineering company building a decentralized edge app stack, would set out to make a blockchain game. Fission's developer-friendly SDK works for web apps built on the distributed or decentralized web. We want to bring our tools to blockchain dapps, but first, we need to better understand the current limitations for both users and developers.</p><p>Games require a sustained state of flow, so they tend to be very good at highlighting the constraints of a medium — and directing innovation. We feel so strongly about this we believe Block, Paper, Scissors will only be the first of many game-shaped experiments in what we're calling the SLW RK'D. </p><p>The insights we've garnered from building Block, Paper, Scissors have already helped focus our work on some exciting WNFS updates, as well as Filecoin-based endeavours to be announced soon.</p> So, what is Block, Paper, Scissors? <p>Block, Paper, Scissors is an updated take on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. In our version, Block replaces Rock. So Block &gt; Scissors, Scissors &gt; Paper, and Paper &gt; Block. </p><p>But, there are two critical differences.<br><br>You don't play as an individual. You play as a team. The network you choose to play on is the team you've chosen to join. Right now there are three: Filecoin (calibration testnet), Polygon (Mumbai testnet), and Ethereum (goerli testnet).</p><p>The play is asynchronous rather than synchronous. You're always playing against your own team's previous move. To make a move, each player casts their vote on the network. The move with the most votes is the one that is played. Sounds easy, right? Well, the strategy comes in when a player or group decides to break a streak and sabotage the other players' selections — perhaps you hop onto the Filecoin network to sabotage their vote and end their streak so that Team Polygon can take the lead. These networks are permissionless, after all.</p><p>Take a look at this quick demo video.</p> Bringing the Blockchain to the Fore <p>Because we are on the blockchain, and each frame is equivalent to one block, you might say Block, Paper, Scissors runs very slowly. Part of the challenge was not just accepting speed as a constraint but embracing it! It makes the game more reflective of the medium, and it helps to reveal some key points of friction and confusion.</p><p>Block production speed becomes painful as we attempt to use the blockchain for cases requiring a faster turnaround. And because the objective is to get the longest streak, the chain that is the fastest may have an advantage.</p><p>Finality isn't so cut and dry. A move won't be final until it's a few blocks deeper in the chain state. And if something changes, that has rippling effects on the moves that came after it. If there are a lot of outstanding votes, It's hard to be 100% sure what move you are presently playing against!</p><p>The Mempool is another potential source of information — a place where you might be able to detect an influx of saboteurs, for example. But accurately and reliably presenting its state is not a simple task.</p><p>We've constantly been wrestling with how much of the block-building process to reveal and incorporate and how much to abstract away. And in many cases, addressing the challenges above is most easily achieved by introducing centralization, neutralizing a key advantage of using blockchain technology in the first place.</p><p>Ultimately we've opted to abstract many things away and rely on centralized service providers to address many of these concerns. It's the pragmatic move right now. But we believe we can provide truly decentralized alternatives as our own protocols and platforms mature.</p> Key Learnings <p>The blockchain is still quite volatile. The network goes down, and transactions can fail. <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/foundry-forge">Forge</a>, the command line tool we use to test and deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts, has been breaking down as we deploy contracts to Filecoin. Speaking of Filecoin, not many wallet clients support it yet, making game adoption more challenging.</p><p>We hope the game helps to shed more light on the character of block production and how it differs across various blockchain networks. And that it helps identify targets for further decentralization without sacrificing similar improvements to UX.</p> What's Next <p>Help us test! We invite you to play Block, Paper, Scissors while we're in Play Test mode on the three testnets. Once we've seen how it holds up, we'll deploy to mainnets, and the real game will be afoot!</p><p>New features! We were delighted to discover as we built the game that there are other ways to play. Since each move displays a color that corresponds to the selection (Block, Paper, or Scissors), and each color square is placed on a grid, it creates a visual canvas where users can coordinate to draw pixelated frames. We have a feature planned to recognize those who draft a plan for a future game state and successfully convince people to help them execute it. There will be a leaderboard for these A-Team players (because we love it when a plan comes together😉), and the tracker will be available soon.</p><p>Expansion of the SLW RK'D. We hope you enjoy playing our game so much that it inspires you to fork and build your own. If you do, we'll add it to our library of games. This library will be known as the SLW RK'D (Slow Arcade), and we hope it is both educational and fun for everyone involved. We'd love for you to join the effort and build out more games for people to play — on blockchains or any other type of distributed system! There's no wrong way to do it.</p> The Principles of SLW RK'D   Feel the Network: Game mechanics reveal the capabilities and limitations of the networks the game operates on — typically blockchains.  Embrace the Pace: Each game move corresponds to the speed of consensus on that network. For blockchains, each move is at least one block, tying game speed to block production rate.  Casual Participation: Players might track their personal records &amp; scores, but involvement in every block/move isn’t required. Come and go as you please!  Collaborative Spirit: All players and each network jointly determine each move, encouraging teamwork — mostly.  Cross-Network Competition: The leader is decided across all deployed networks.  One World, One Game: Despite the number of networks the game is deployed to or how many participants are active, there’s a singular game state at any time. The game starts once, and…  It’s Endless: With current technology and physics laws, the game’s end is out of sight—unless all deployed networks cease to exist.

 With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in Germany, what regulations and safeguards are in place to protect consumers and operators? 



 



<p>Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have become very popular in recent years, as increasing numbers of German people invest in digital assets. The rapid expansion of the crypto industry has created an urgent need for regulation to protect the stability of the German financial system and its consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we will explore the growth of cryptocurrencies in Germany, and the need for a regulatory landscape to govern the use of digital assets. We will examine what the current state of regulation in Germany is, and what challenges regulators, consumers and cryptocurrency exchanges are facing.</p>



 Is crypto regulated in Germany? 



<p>In April 2023, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">was passed by European Parliament lawmakers.</a> It aims to protect investors and preserve financial stability, while allowing for greater innovation in the crypto asset sector. It is expected to come into force by the summer of 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a national level, although cryptocurrencies are legal in Germany, they are not considered legal tender or currency. Instead, <a href="https://www.finextra.com/the-long-read/534/understanding-the-regulatory-landscape-for-crypto-assets-in-germany-and-the-eu">regulators classify cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument or asset</a>, which makes them subject to regulations and laws related to securities and investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared with other European countries, Germany has taken a decidedly proactive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, passing a law in 2020 that requires all cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Germany to obtain a license from the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)</a>. This law also established rules for crypto custodians, including the requirement to hold a minimum amount of capital and ensure compliance with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Germany, BaFin is the primary regulator for digital assets and is responsible for the regulation of financial markets and institutions. This includes cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto wallets, and custodians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to the taxation of cryptocurrencies, things get complicated, as they usually do with German tax laws. Cryptocurrency is subject to capital gains tax if it is held for less than a year before being sold or traded. However, if the digital asset is held for longer, it is exempt. Profits from cryptocurrency mining are subject to income tax. If the cryptocurrency is used to purchase services or goods, it may be subject to VAT. Profits from cryptocurrencies of less than €600 per year are tax-free. There is also an exemption limit of €256 per year for income from staking or lending.&nbsp;</p>



 Cryptocurrencies and AML regulations.&nbsp; 



<p>It should come as no surprise that there are strict and rigorous AML regulations that apply to cryptocurrency exchanges and other service providers in Germany. Providers must therefore implement measures including KYC procedures and transaction monitoring to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. An additional measure is to ensure they report suspicious transactions and activities to the relevant authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Providers must also comply with the European Union’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD),</a> which sets specific rules for virtual currency exchanges and custodian wallet providers. It requires providers and exchanges to register and conduct due diligence on their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>German tax residents are required to report their cryptocurrency transactions, including purchases, sales and exchanges, for tax purposes. Failure to do so may result in fines. Cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers must also report any suspicious activity to the <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/Geldwaeschepraevention/Verdachtsmeldewesen/Verdachtsmeldewesen_node_en.html">Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).</a></p>



 Regulation of cryptocurrency trading in Germany. 



<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges in Germany offer a range of trading options, including spot trading, futures trading, and options trading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in Germany are eToro, Bitpanda, Kraken, Binance, Justtrade and Coinbase (Read more about what Coinbase’s recent expansion efforts mean for the industry at large, in our blog: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/coinbase-crypto-winter/">Coinbase commits to European expansion amid brutal crypto winter.</a>) These exchanges offer a variety of trading pairs, low fees, and user-friendly interfaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To buy and sell cryptocurrency in Germany, consumers can use a cryptocurrency exchange or a peer-to-peer trading platform. Cryptocurrency exchanges allow the purchase or sale of the cryptocurrency of choice, which is then stored in a digital wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency trading and exchanges are regulated by BaFin, which requires all <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/blog-de/krypto-lizenz-bafin-erhalten/">cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Germany to be licensed</a> to comply with KYC and AML regulations. Cryptocurrency traders are subject to capital gains tax and must report their transactions in their annual tax returns.</p>



 



 

 



 With great opportunity comes great risk. 



<p>Success stories of Bitcoin millionaires, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/crypto-rues-bitcoin-s-btc-decoupling-from-ai-fueled-tech-stock-gains#xj4y7vzkghttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/crypto-rues-bitcoin-s-btc-decoupling-from-ai-fueled-tech-stock-gains#xj4y7vzkg">decoupling of Bitcoin from the stock markets,</a> and the unstable traditional economy have also contributed to considerable crypto hype in Germany in recent years. Unfortunately, this has also resulted in incidents of fraud rising sharply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem is compounded when first-time investors encounter suspicious crypto firms, that, to the uninitiated, look legitimate. It is only months or years later, after profits have been made in the deposit phase, that the investor realizes he has been taken in by a scam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bafin.de/DE/Verbraucher/Aktuelles/verbraucher_node.html">The BaFin publishes weekly warnings</a> on its website about crypto companies that must cease operations due to legal violations.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the security concerns associated with cryptocurrencies? 



<p>While the underlying technology behind cryptocurrency offers many benefits, including decentralization and transparency, it is also vulnerable to security threats, especially in the German market, where lawmakers and law enforcement agencies are still trying to address the variety of nefarious activities surrounding crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the security concerns associated with cryptocurrency in Germany include:&nbsp;</p>



  Hacking of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets<br>  Identity fraud<br>  Phishing scams or other types of scams, e.g. financial scammers create genuine-looking documents via email featuring a fake balance on the blockchain<br>  Computer infection<br>  Fake deposits of ICOs, tokens or coins on fraudulent crypto or wallet exchanges<br>  Ponzi schemes that use fraudulent technology and deception.&nbsp;  



 Popular cryptocurrency scams. 



<p>Currently, one of the most common cryptocurrency scams is the “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scam</a>“, which uses social media or dating apps to gain the trust of victims, to steal their funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other notable cryptocurrency scams include the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/27/business/bitconnect-ponzi-scheme-satish-kumbhani/index.html">BitConnect Ponzi scheme</a>, whose founder was indicted in February 2022, and the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/co-founder-multi-billion-dollar-cryptocurrency-pyramid-scheme-onecoin-pleads-guilty">$4 billion OneCoin scam</a>, which came to light in December 2016.&nbsp;</p>

 How to keep cryptocurrency safe in Germany. 



<p>One of the most effective ways to ensure that crypto platforms are protected from fraudulent activities is by implementing a robust KYC process to verify customer identity and prevent customers from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">bypassing KYC requirements</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s proprietary AI-powered fraud detection technology can help detect user behavior that indicates potential risk, allowing for real time monitoring and prevention of account takeovers, identity theft, money laundering, and other types of fraudulent activity. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As the leading European identity verification provider, IDnow’s services have a proven track record of success, providing conversion rates of up to 90%, and are not only compliant within the DACH and UK markets, but assist rapid scalability with compliance in 195 countries and support in over 30 languages&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 What is the future of cryptocurrencies in Germany? 



<p>The German government has been working on regulating cryptocurrencies for some time, and in 2019 passed a law allowing banks to hold and sell cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There have also been discussions about new regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs), to protect investors and ensure the stability of the financial system. However, the regulatory landscape is still evolving. As the cryptocurrency market changes, regulation may change as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More and more companies and individuals in Germany are holding digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. According to <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-germany-2022/">a survey conducted by Triple A in 2022</a>, around 4.9 million residents currently own cryptocurrencies.&nbsp; Individuals with an income of €300,000 or more per year hold about two-thirds of all cryptocurrencies. In the coming years, the number of individuals holding cryptocurrencies is expected to increase as Germany as continues to become a more crypto-friendly country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The future of cryptocurrency in Germany looks promising, thanks to increasing adoption and potential regulatory changes that could further boost the industry. The German regulatory framework for cryptocurrency is evolving, with key regulators such as BaFin and the Federal Ministry of Finance overseeing compliance and reporting requirements. Strict <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML</a> regulations are in place to reduce fraud on cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Germany is sometimes known for unnecessary red tape, the country is trying to provide a regulatory framework that creates a supportive environment for the cryptocurrency market while protecting consumers. Nevertheless, individuals and businesses should always remain vigilant and aware of the risks and challenges associated with cryptocurrency and its regulatory requirements in Germany.&nbsp;</p>

 What Is Windows Credential Manager &amp; How Does It Work? 
<p>Windows Credential Manager is Windows software that stores authentication credentials that are used to log in to websites or other computers on a network. </p>
 How Does Windows Credential Manager Work? 
<p>A credential manager stores login credentials securely so that users don’t have to memorize or manage those credentials themselves. More often than not, this means storing usernames and passwords or PINs much like third-party password managers. </p>
<p>The best of these systems operate behind the scenes, creating a seamless user experience while managing a growing list of credentials. Windows Credential Manager does this for Windows users. This tool therefore simplifies the login process while streamlining the user experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0#:~:text=Credential%20Manager%20lets%20you%20view,select%20Credential%20Manager%20Control%20panel.">Windows Credential Manager</a> stores two types of data:</p>
 
 Web Credentials: This software will store login credentials associated with websites and online accounts, working in tandem with a web browser.  
 Device Credentials: The software will also store credentials related to local network resources, including services and shared files and directories. 
 
<p>The Credential Manager encrypts and stores this data securely, and only allows access to users who have the necessary permissions. </p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 Credential Storage: Windows will prompt the user to store credentials when they are entered, creating a link to that resource and the credentials provided.  
 Credential Autofill: Windows will automatically fill in credentials for devices or websites with linked credentials without manual intervention from the user.  
 Credential Management: The manager will allow the user to manually enter, delete, and change existing credentials. While changed passwords will typically be replaced automatically, this gives the user more control over their credentials. 
 
<p>The credential manager uses the Data Protection API (DPAPI), a cryptography system, to secure your credentials. This ensures that only you, as the user, have access to your stored credentials, thereby enhancing security.</p>
 Is Windows Credential Manager Secure? 
<p>Security, in the case of credential management, is a complicated topic. While a system may be secure under ideal conditions, it may not hold up under specific attacks or user behaviors. under others.</p>
<p>Windows Credential Manager has a few components that promote secure credential management:</p>
 
 Encryption: DPAPI is considered relatively secure, using a strong encryption algorithm, typically AES, to protect data. 
 Linked Accounts: The encryption key used by the program is tied to the user’s specific Windows user account. This means that even if someone else has access to that computer, they can’t (technically) decrypt those credentials unless they know the account password. 
 System Password: Access to the Credential Manager itself is protected by the Windows account password. Without this password, no one can access those stored credentials, so if this password (and additional <a>MFA authentication</a>) are secure, then so is the account. 
 
<p>However, like any security tool, it’s only truly secure as the system it is in. That is, if the operating system or applications compromise security, or have been hacked, then Windows Credential Manager is actually not very secure. </p>
<p>For example, the <a>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> database lists several procedures and attacks that can compromise Windows Credential Manager. Some of these include:</p>
 
 LaZagne, an open source tool used to recover passwords on systems. 
 PowerSploit, a set of PowerShell attack modules that allows users to attack and compromise Windows systems. 
 RainyDay, a malicious backdoor exploit tool. 
 Turla, a Russian <a>Advanced Persistent Threat</a> (APT). 
 
<p>That being said, even if systems remain safe from these exploits, it doesn’t excuse users from failing to follow best <a>identity management</a> practices. These include:</p>
 
 Strong Account Password: The security of stored credentials is only as strong as the Windows account password. If your account password is weak or easily guessable, then an attacker could potentially gain access to those stored credentials. 
 Physical Security: with physical access to a computer, a hacker is more likely than not to find a way to break encryption or hack an account password, meaning that they can bypass security.  
 Malware Protection: Malware can essentially work around credential protective measures through techniques like Man-in-the-Middle attacks or keystroke logging.  
 Data Breaches: If user credentials are compromised in a data breach at the site or service for which they were created, having them stored in Credential Manager won’t protect the user. 
 
<p>So while the Credential Manager provides a secure method of storing credentials, it should be used as part of a larger, comprehensive approach to security that mitigates both local and remote hacks.</p>
 What Are Some Drawbacks of Windows Credential Manager? 
<p>Security is a critical issue for Windows Credential Manager, but not simply related to encryption or hackers. This software carries some of the limitations that many system-specific managers have. </p>
<p>Some of these downsides include: </p>
 
 Single Point of Failure: An attacker with <a>credential access</a> to your user account can view or even export all saved credentials. This can be a major problem in cases where an attacker gains access to data that can lead to <a>credential dumping</a>. In this case, they are either all safe or none of them are safe.  
 False Sense of Security: It’s always important to use strong, unique passwords for every account regardless of whether you’re using a password manager or not. This software isn’t a shield against poor authentication practices, nor will it protect you from <a>credential stuffing</a> if users have reused credentials across several platforms.  
 Limited Cross-Platform Integration: This software is only on Windows. If you’re using multiple devices with different operating systems, a third-party password manager might serve your needs better.

				  Why was the internet built without an emphasis on identity or security? Why are we still trying to figure these out 50 years later? What role will AI play in the future of digital trust? Let’s take a brief look at the history of the internet and see what we can learn.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>The first network of networks — the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> — was declared operational in 1971; it was the first thing built that resembles the internet as we know it today. Developed by the Department of Defense, ARPANET was capable of file transferring, remote login, email, and that was about it. Because computers were, at this time, both large and expensive, they were relatively uncommon, and you would likely know everyone who had access to your network. So, no real need for formal trust just yet.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the early 1980s, several national and international networks have been created, one of the biggest launching in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network">(NSFNET)</a> funded supercomputers at several universities and connected them to the network, enabling access for research and academic organizations in the United States.</p>
<p>It was on the NSFNET that interest in international connections grew, leading to several breakthroughs, including the adoption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a> internationally and the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domain name system</a> (before this everyone had to know the Internet Protocol (IP) address of where they were trying to go). In 1989, the first commercial internet service providers hit the scene, and by 1991 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> was available to the public.</p>
<p>Now we have billions of people using the internet, and it would really benefit us to know who is who and how to manage access to private data. But how do we accomplish this given the current scale of digital interaction?</p>
<p>Enter Cryptography</p>
<p>Originally a late addition to email, encryption was developed as the need arose to keep certain sensitive information private. There are two main ways to create encryption: symmetric key cryptography and public key cryptography.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm">Symmetric key cryptography</a> is fairly straightforward. Both parties have a key, or a shared-secret; this key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data and must be known to both parties. An example you likely use every day is a login and password. Both parties know the password and, therefore, can be reasonably certain of the identity using the password and that they can be trusted. Unfortunately, if someone else finds the key, symmetric encryption becomes useless, as now there is no way for the system to tell who the true user is.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public key cryptography</a> is both more complex and more useful for sharing data with a large audience. Through mathematical functions that use large prime numbers, a pair of keys is created. One of these keys is private and is used to “sign” data or prove its origin, the other key is public and is used to verify the source and read the data. One shortcoming of this system is that if people don’t have your public key it doesn’t work, so you need a good way to distribute the key. A few examples of public key cryptography include <a href="https://www.digicert.com/what-is-ssl-tls-and-https">TLS/ SSL</a> (web browser security) systems like Bitcoin, and password managers like <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO</a>/<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Passkey-vs-password-What-is-the-difference">passkey</a>.</p>
<p>Cryptography enables us to do two very useful things: encryption and signatures. While sometimes used together, there is a clear and important distinction. Encryption allows the user to scramble a message so that only a party holding the relevant key can decrypt it; however, there is no level of certainty for the key reader about where the message originated. Signatures, on the other hand, allow you to cryptographically prove the source of data.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> are a good example of a signature in action. When a credential is issued, the person issuing the credential signs the data, and every verifier can check that the data has not been changed since it was issued. This enables the verifying party to trust whoever holds the data the same as if it was coming from the source. These systems are effective at communicating trust however, they are not yet in widespread use.</p>
<p>Signature systems, specifically these decentralized verifiable credentials, are the best solution we have come up with so far for addressing the chronic problem of not knowing who anybody is or where data is coming from on the internet. By ensuring that data is signed by an authority, such as a government, university, or trusted expert in the field, we know that we can trust this data in proportion to our trust in the authority.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the data is signed by a known acquaintance or friend you can be sure it came from that party, as opposed to a bad actor pretending to be them. The internet is ever expanding, with an estimated <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day">328.77 million terabytes of data being created daily</a> (that’s 328.77 billion gigabytes). Being able to rely on the information we find will be critical as our society continues to grow and move toward the digital future.</p>
<p>Living in an AI world</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that is capable of doing some really neat things. Because it is trained to mimic the decision-making process of a human brain, it is very good at certain kinds of tasks: recognizing patterns, such as <a href="https://recfaces.com/articles/ai-facial-recognition">identifying faces</a>, creating <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">strings of words or sentences</a> that make sense, or even mimicking <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">voices</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them">faces or videos</a>. AI has one weakness in that it typically cannot explain why it does what it does, often <a href="https://thenewstack.io/ai-surprises-researchers-by-inventing-new-hide-and-seek-strategies/">surprising even its programmers</a> with the decisions it makes in pursuit of accomplishing a task. But when AI can make almost anything look “real” and can’t really “show its work” for how it got there, how will we be able to trust anything we see online?</p>
<p>The answer will be to implement robust signature systems such as those offered by verifiable credentials. Here are just a few examples of how verifiable credentials could bring trust to AI systems.</p>
<p>For chatbots, the system is typically trained on databases or through scraping websites. If the system was, instead, trained on sets of verifiable credentials, each containing specific data that is signed by the originating authority, then the answers provided by the AI can reference the specific information it came from. Evaluation of those sources can be used to determine what trust to place in the AI-provided answer.</p>
<p>A similar system could be used for voices and videos. The next generation of cameras, microphones, and phones could use software to create a signature at the moment of media capture to provide evidence that the recording has not been altered since the taping. Software that performs light editing, such as boosting audio levels or brightening an image, could also provide a signature across the modifications, ensuring that no significant manipulation of the media occurred.</p>
<p>In short, verifiable credentials could save AI from becoming an engine of mistrust — and provide not only the internet’s missing verification layer but a verification layer able to handle the rapid pace of digital transformation.</p>

 Offering a sign-up bonus is a popular technique by many iGaming operators to attract new players. But is it worth the risk? 



 



<p>In the online gambling world, you would be hard pushed to find a mainstream online casino that doesn’t attempt to entice new customers through bonuses. Offering bonuses to attract and retain bettors has become a staple for new and old brands in the industry, and there is no reason to believe this will not be the case for the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attracting bettors and players is the main reason why sportsbooks and other operators provide bonuses. Players appreciate the chance to play with bonus funds, so seeing appealing offers from sportsbooks makes them more inclined to register.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, while iGaming businesses work toward developing strategies to attract and retain bettors’ interest, gambling fraud proves to be a particularly tricky and dangerous obstacle to overcome. Bonuses themselves are often abused, in fact, it’s quite common.</p>



 Understanding bonuses in gambling. 



<p>Bonuses offered by gambling operators can vary, but typical promotions grant players bonus funds or free spins to encourage them to use their platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonuses are also designed to encourage players to continue betting using their own money when the bonus funds run out. Both parties should gain from a good betting bonus. For example, customers may receive bonus funds to bet with, while operators get to acquire paying customers. Challenges emerge when certain users start using bonuses for malicious activities like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though conversion rates differ depending on the operator, the most popular types of bonuses include the following:</p>



  Sign-up bonus (often with free spins)<br>  Deposit match bonus<br>  No deposit bonus<br>  Reload bonus<br>  Cashback<br>  Free bets<br>  Reward program<br>  Refer-a-friend bonus  



 What is bonus abuse in gambling? 



<p>Bonus abuse involves players signing up to a gambling platform to manipulate the promotion to their favor, unfairly manipulating the promotion incentives aimed at casino players who have yet to sign up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are betting communities that look to exploit such bonuses. This activity goes by numerous names, including bonus hunting and promo abuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering most bonuses can only be used once, this often leads to fraudsters setting up multiple accounts to take advantage of repeated bonuses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fraud terminology, this process is known as multi-accounting. Bettors typically target free bet promotions and bonuses with no deposit requirements, i.e., no deposit bonuses, such as free cash or spins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that only some people who partake in bonus cheating are seasoned fraudsters. Most bonus abusers are regular gamblers who believe they are only ‘cheating the system’, and not venturing into illegal territory. However, there is a sizeable community of tech-savvy criminals who have the resources to utilize <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/betting-bots-casino-bots/">betting bots</a>, virtual machines, emulators, and (simulated) residential IPs, such as mobile networks or Socks5 proxies, to leverage new IP addresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the different types of bonus abuse fraud include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 
  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/chip-dumping/">Chip dumping&nbsp;</a><br>&nbsp;  Collecting sign-up bonuses&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/arbing-in-betting/#:~:text=How%20to%20define%20arbitrage%20in,which%20way%20the%20game%20goes.">Arbitrage betting</a>, a.k.a., arbing&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">Identity theft</a>  
 



 
  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">Money laundering&nbsp;</a><br>&nbsp;  Account takeover&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-to-avoid-world-cup-betting-fraud/">Chargeback fraud</a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/collusion-in-betting/">Collusive play&nbsp;</a>  
 
 



<p>Whatever the type, the process of bonus abuse invariably starts at sign-up. One fraudster (or a group of them) will create as many accounts as possible, a process called ‘gnoming’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They use disposable emails, fake aliases, and fake or stolen credit card information to bypass <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> checks. Once they have created multiple accounts, they then take advantage of the promotion in question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engaging in casino bonus is not illegal per se, but breaking terms and conditions is. For example, all bonuses will typically include terms detailing that they have the right to confiscate any winnings if they suspect the account player to be involved in some form of bonus abuse. These terms can be murky but are typically referring to players who manipulate bonuses to their advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same would apply for any suspicions that the account is being used in a fraudulent manner, such as the account being used by someone else other than the official holder. Fraudsters would be breaking many of these terms if they were to create multiple accounts under other people’s names.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If caught, the user’s bonus money and winnings will be confiscated, and the user’s deposit may also be frozen in their account.</p>

 Recognizing the warning signs. 



<p>To prevent bonus abuse in online gaming, operators must first be able to spot them. There are numerous signs and behavioral patterns to watch out for:&nbsp;</p>



  When the account is fake, there is typically a much shorter period between sign-up and withdrawal or chip dumping. For example, if a newly assigned bonus is instantly lost to a third person at a poker table.&nbsp;  



  Certain games usually attract more fraudsters than others. Games like poker, where players can play against each other and more easily manipulate the outcome, are most at risk of bonus abuse.<br>  Fraudsters use VPNs, TOR browsers, or blacklisted residential-like proxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Understandably, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">KYC and ID verification platforms</a> have become crucial in helping gambling operators identify potentially nefarious or fraudulent practices.</p>



 Techniques used in bonus abuse. 



 Exploiting loopholes in terms and conditions. 



<p>One of the most common restrictions in T&amp;Cs involves preventing players from playing specific games with bonus funds. Blackjack and poker games are usually excluded from bonuses due to their lower house edge. This is because <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/matched-betting/">matched bettors</a> could complete their wagering requirements on an outcome close to 50/50, meaning they were almost guaranteed to make money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While most gambling sites use technology to detect and prevent players from claiming bonus funds on forbidden games, bonus abuse invariably involves avoiding promotional restrictions to play games with bonus money.</p>



 Multiple account creation. 



<p>Most casino platforms allow users to create one account per user, a restriction monitored by the IP address of the device or household used to register and redeem the bonus. Fraudsters trick casinos by signing up for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gnoming-multi-accounting/">multiple accounts</a> via IP addresses, VPNs, TOR browsers, etc. &nbsp;</p>



 Identity theft and manipulation.&nbsp; 



<p>Sophisticated criminals often buy real ID documents on the dark web for use in defrauding gambling platforms. As these documents are not falsified, systems may fail to detect the abuse. Indeed, <a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/synthetic-identity-fraud">synthetic identity fraud,</a> which uses a combination of real-person and fake data to form a new identity can bypass some weak KYC checks.</p>



 The impact of bonus abuse on sports betting sites.&nbsp; 



<p>Bonus abuse is becoming increasingly widespread and costs the iGaming sector approximately <a href="https://www.intergameonline.com/views/a-tale-of-woe-betting-gaming-and-bonus-abuse">15% of its</a> annual gross revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jon Howard, an Essex-based <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2023/04/24/bet365-236k-fraud-plot/">fraudster</a>, was recently imprisoned for five years for his part in various frauds, which resulted in the bookmaker losing over £236,000.&nbsp;This was the first bonus abuse fraud penalty ever seen in the UK.</p>



<p>Howard played a leading part in a syndicate that created over 1,000 bet365 accounts using different aliases to use welcome bonuses and evade deposit limits.</p>



 Responsible gambling measures. 



<p>To mitigate fraudulent gaming activity, operators must deter online bonus abuse. Some operators opt for the removal of deposit bonuses altogether, which is far from ideal, considering gambling bonuses are a sure-fire way of bringing people to a gambling platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other cases, some operators provide loyalty bonuses, rather than sign-up bonuses to discourage bonus abuse. This approach risks alienating the casual, everyday gambler, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many operators also use profiling tools to detect and restrict accounts that are engaging in unwitting cheating or fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must also work toward spreading awareness about the consequences of online gaming bonus abuse. This involves starting initiatives and collaborations among other operators and sharing best practices and helpful information to safeguard the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recently published <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK Gambling White Paper</a>, which details the new approach to the UK’s iGaming regulation, also sets out new proposals to tackle bonus abuse fraud and other fraudulent activities by curbing “bonus” and “free spins” offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonus abuse has also been a recurring problem in Europe, with most countries taking strict measures to put an end to such activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in 2019, Malta-based companies <a href="https://www.egr.global/intel/news/genesis-global-and-ag-communications-fined-for-bonus-abuse-in-sweden/#:~:text=Genesis%20Global%20and%20AG%20Communications%20fined%20for%20bonus%20abuse%20in%20Sweden,-Malta%2Dheadquartered%20pair&amp;text=Malta%2Dbased%20duo%20Genesis%20Global,recurring%20bonuses%20to%20online%20players.">Genesis Global and AG Communications were fined</a> by gambling regulator Spelinspektionen for allegedly offering recurring bonuses to their Swedish player base. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators in other regions of the world have also adopted ways to reduce gambling fraud. With the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gambling-latam/">Brazilian gambling market on the verge of widespread regulation</a>, operators should be concerned about fraudsters looking to take advantage of an immature market.</p>



 Battling bonus abuse fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>As the iGaming industry flourishes, so does the number of fraudsters looking to exploit the system for their illicit interests. As bonus abuse is among the industry’s most significant challenges, operators must seek proactive measures to tackle cybercriminals and their methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides stricter protocols and spreading awareness, KYC and AML checks can reduce bonus abuse in iGaming, combat money laundering, and minimize financial losses.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>IDnow’s user-friendly, efficient, and secure <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">AML and KYC</a> solutions can help with player onboarding, financial risk checks, age verification checks, and more. With IDnow, operators can guarantee compliance with international regulatory standards and curb fraud, such as bonus abuse fraud, without compromising the player experience.</p>


 
 
 
 What is bonus abuse?&nbsp; 
 

<p>Bonus abuse occurs when people sign up for multiple accounts to abuse promotions offered by online gambling operators.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 Are there any legal consequences for engaging in bonus abuse?&nbsp; 
 

<p>If caught partaking in bonus abuse, the user’s bonus funds and winnings are confiscated. They might also have their deposited funds frozen. For punishments more severe, it depends on the technique of bonus abuse. For example, receiving permission from a friend to use their details will be viewed very differently than stealing personal information.</p>

 
 
 
 What steps can online casinos take to prevent bonus abuse?&nbsp; 
 

<p>The steps to prevent bonus abuse include setting more complex bonus terms, lowering bonus payouts, and ensuring the site’s KYC process is as rigorous as possible.&nbsp;</p>

 Bluesky: A Short Overview 
<p>Our digital lives are fragmented — we all maintain profiles across multiple social sites. If you move from one site to another, you have to start over with no history of the friends or content you created there. This is because the original web protocol made it easy to link websites, but had no built-in way to link people and their content, making it hard for people to maintain control over their online identities.</p>
<p>When a centralized platform owns your online identity and is the only host of your content, you’re vulnerable to getting cut off without warning. It’d be like if the city you lived in one day decided to kick you out, and there was no way to move your stuff to a new city and keep in touch with your friends. An analogy for what Bluesky is building is an identity and transport system between cities, so you can move from one place to another and keep your friends.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s goal is to rebuild social so that:</p>
 
 Users own their data and can take it anywhere they want to go. 
 Developers will never get locked out of the ecosystems they help build. 
 Creators will always own their relationships with their audience. 
 
<p>To achieve these goals, Bluesky has developed a social protocol — in other words, we designed a new approach to storing and retrieving information about people in a social network. This is where the “decentralization” part of Bluesky comes in. A protocol is a set of instructions for computers to talk to each other. It creates a set of rules for how your data can move across different services, even ones not run by us. This open protocol is why most data – your posts, follows, likes, and blocks  – is public on Bluesky right now. Making a post on Bluesky is like making a blog post you publish to the web. The underlying protocol for Bluesky is ATP, much like the underlying protocol for the web is HTTP. Our goal was to make social media work more like the open systems that defined the early web, like blogs and email.</p>
 A Network of Cities 
<p>ATP, or the Authenticated Transfer Protocol, is a federated social protocol. Here’s an analogy using cities in the real world to describe federation online: Centralized social platforms are like one big city that everyone lives in, and federated protocols are like a network of cities, of all different sizes. In the federated network, people can move between cities depending on what kind of community they’d like to be in. The Bluesky social app we’re running right now is just one city in a network that will grow over time. The AT Protocol gives you a passport (identity) to travel with, and lets you take all of your belongings (data) with you, enabling an eventual network of cities to interoperate. When we launch federation, more cities (servers) will pop up.</p>
<p>Just as different cities can have different laws and cultures, different parts of a federated network can be governed differently. Systems like<a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation"> composable community moderation</a> can help create a system for governing the different “cities” in the network. In the future, we hope to see many new and different kinds of cities (i.e. other social apps like dating apps or video feeds) get built by users and developers, as well as the bridges and tunnels that connect these cities. With your Bluesky passport, you can travel freely between digital spaces, with the tools to create your own or to curate your experience at home. We believe that the future of social media is co-created and open. Join us!</p>

<p></p> 
 Introduction   
<p>Nearly every aspect of conducting business today begins with an act of authentication. Communicating, using tools, interacting with data, processing transactions – all depend on the ability to verify our identity to gain access. Much attention is paid to the consequences of poor authentication security — just check the headlines for the latest breach — but the user’s experience (UX) of authentication also has a profound impact on an organization.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=b7a7dd2c-7826-451f-b282-f8fd5cc8923f&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
<p>HYPR and Vanson Bourne recently published our 2023 State of Passwordless Security Report, which surveyed 1,000 IT and security experts to better understand current perceptions, challenges and trends when it comes to authentication and IAM. In this State of Passwordless Spotlight report, we dig deeper into the findings, focusing on how the authentication user experience affects organizations and their employees and customers.</p> 
<p>This Spotlight report also specifically looks at the impact of UX on financial services organizations. Finance is the top sector for attacks and is subject to rigorous regulations around security and authentication. As such, it frequently serves as a bellwether in the IAM sphere, providing an early look at important developments and trends.</p> 
<p>Key Takeaways</p> 
  
  
   
    
      64%  <p>of organizations say a poor user experience is a major authentication pain point</p>  
      Four  <p>different systems for authentication are being used by employees daily</p>  
      $375/ employee  <p>spent on password-related help desk issues annually</p>  
      39%  <p>of financial services firms plan to adopt or use passwordless (or passkeys) authentication in the next 1-3 years&nbsp;</p>  
    
   
  
  
 Authentication UX Challenges  
<p>Our research shows that organizations face significant challenges when it comes to authentication and user experience. Nearly two-thirds of surveyed companies (64%) cite challenges with user experience as a major pain point in their authentication processes.</p> 
<p>Poor UX not only leads to user frustration and dissatisfaction, it obstructs work, increases costs and actually decreases security because users can bypass certain security features meant to protect the user, systems and data.</p> 
 Productivity Lost to Time Consuming Logins and Lockouts  
<p>There’s no getting around it, login methods that rely on passwords create friction, which only gets worse as security stipulations like long, complex strings, frequent rotation and additional authenticating factors are imposed. In 2024 this will be compounded with PCI 2024 requiring longer passwords.</p> 
<p>There’s also significant time wasted when employees forget their passwords and require resets. Nearly 3 in 10 (29%) of IT and security professionals cite password/ credential resets as an ongoing pain point for their organization . Moreover, around eight in ten (81%) report they’ve been unable to access critical information due to forgetting their password.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Password-Based Authentication Increases Help desk Spend&nbsp;  
<p>Poor UX not only harms employee productivity, it places a significant strain on the help desk support system. Over the last 12 months, 76% of organizations had an increase in help desk requests relating to password resets or other authentication issues. In terms of actual costs, organizations spend 32% of their IT help desk budget on password resets and password-based authentication issues. This breaks down to $375 per employee per year, wasted on password issues.</p> 
<p><br></p> 
 Array of Authentication Systems and Requirements  
<p>Organizations also face challenges from the sheer variety of authentication systems used on a daily basis — four on average. This means multiple, varying sign-on requirements that employees must remember and use, adding friction and frustration in their day-to-day work.</p> 
<p><br></p> 
 A Good UX Is Critical to Security  
<p>Any security control is bound to fail if people don’t use them willingly. Nearly a third (31%) report resistance from employees in using their organization’s authentication technology.</p> 
<p>Resistance frequently expresses itself in workarounds that create security risks for organizations. Employees may share passwords, store password lists on their computers or leave their systems signed in while they are away, some even use tools like a mouse jiggler to avoid having to re-authenticate.</p> 
 Don’t forget IT  
<p>We don’t usually put the IT experience in the UX category but we should. The IT user experience also impacts adoption, costs and security. The survey found that&nbsp;</p> 
<p>56% of organizations face IT-related obstacles in their current authentication approaches, including management complexity (34%) and integration difficulties (31%).</p> 
 Outsized Impact on the Finance Sector  
<p>We already know that the finance sector experiences the most attacks on its authentication processes — 81% for those in financial services vs. a global average of 74%. They also face tremendous pressure from regulations and security frameworks to implement stronger authentication processes to combat these greater risks.</p> 
<p>Most of the regulations currently on the books require multi-factor authentication, which traditionally incorporates a password as one of the factors. This is creating demonstrable friction in financial services organizations. For nearly every UX issue discussed above, the finance sector has been hit even harder.</p> 
  
  85% of respondents in the finance industry report they’ve been unable to access work-critical information due to forgetting a password; 5% higher than the global average  
  The help desk spend on password-related authentication issues is $389/employee vs. a $375 average across industries  
  Nearly half (48%) face challenges in implementing traditional 2FA/MFA due to time consuming login  
  
 Passwordless Authentication Improves UX&nbsp;  
<p>Authentication plays a central role in enterprise digital transformation and almost every other strategic initiative or service. A poor authentication experience can slow or even derail projects so it’s critical to get it right.</p> 
<p>Nearly half of the IT and security (45%) experts name improved user experience as the reason to move to passwordless authentication. A full 86% believe passwordless authentication helps ensure user satisfaction. Benefits of passwordless authentication, specifically FIDO-based (passkeys) authentication include:</p> 
  
  No password resets  
  Faster login speeds: FIDO-based passwordless MFA uses a single, secure gesture for login that is up to 3 times faster than traditional MFA  
  Reducing account lockout  
  Consolidating multiple authentication systems into one  
  Increased employee and customer satisfaction  
  
<p></p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>These findings reveal the toll that the authentication user experience can take on all aspects of a business. Many organizations are contending with significant hits to productivity and their bottomline due as a result of their current authentication practices.</p> 
 Passwordless MFA That Is Built for Users  
<p>HYPR’s passkey-based solutions are designed from the ground-up for the way people work and live. We apply UX best practices and principles in tandem with strong security for phishing-resistant authentication that people want to use. Designed to deploy rapidly into existing infrastructure, it turns an ordinary smartphone into a FIDO Certified passkey for frictionless authentication everywhere.

  Data is the lifeblood of any modern business organization. It is therefore critical to maintain data security and integrity by protecting it appropriately depending on what the data is, what it is used for, who is accessing it, and how it is used. But implementing consistent and comprehensive data protection across an enterprise, on premises and in the cloud, can be challenging.

 As the rise of crypto continues, so does the risk of criminal activity. What can crypto firms do to protect their business and customers from fraud? 



 



<p>Could Satoshi Nakamoto have predicted how profoundly Bitcoin would change the landscape of the traditional financial system when he released his Bitcoin White Paper on October 31, 2008?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that whitepaper, Nakamoto wrote of virtual currencies that use cryptography to secure and verify transactions. He explained that bitcoin miners (or nodes) support the network and provide a way to initially distribute coins into circulation. Since there is no central authority to issue coins the nature of the Bitcoin blockchain lends itself to decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within just a few years of the white paper, so-called cryptocurrencies had blossomed all over the internet. However, because there is no central authority, cryptocurrencies are operated independently and exchanged with a much more limited supervision, mostly through crypto exchange platforms. Since cryptocurrencies provide a high degree of anonymity that is often unattainable in the traditional financial system, it has attracted criminals looking to launder money from their illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the 2010s to modern day, the steady increase in use of cryptocurrencies forced the hand of European lawmakers to devise a European legal framework. With the creation of countless crypto-related businesses and exchange companies, European institutions had to implement proper legislations for crypto activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two legislations were specifically created for that purpose: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto-Assets</a> (MICA) and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti Money-Laundering Directive 5</a> (AMLD 5). Note: As the UK is no longer part of the European Union, UK lawmakers have started work on their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">own proposed crypto regime.</a> In addition to defining clear rules for designated actors conducting crypto transactions, the EU and the UK has also established a set of rules and principles to safeguard against the misuse of crypto assets.&nbsp;Each country will however be required to enforce said requirements on a national level. Read more about one country’s journey toward compliance in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/cryptocurrency-germany-regulations/#:~:text=Compared%20with%20other%20European%20countries,Financial%20Supervisory%20Authority%20(BaFin).">‘Cryptocurrency in Germany: Is it regulated and safe?’ blog</a>.</p>



<p>Newly adopted regulations now require crypto exchanges and custodian wallet providers to implement <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC/AML regulations</a> to better deter money laundering. However, non-compliant crypto platforms are still out there, posing numerous risks to their businesses, and their customers.&nbsp;</p>



 The long and bumpy road toward compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>It’s safe to say that in the early days of crypto, crypto firms were perhaps not as ‘keen’ on transparency as they are now. These days, KYC and compliance measures are top of mind for crypto firms, as operations are now under heavy scrutiny by national and international authorities. Crypto firms must therefore enforce strict screening processes, by ensuring there is a robust KYC process in place to verify customers’ identities, addresses, and source of funds. Monitoring transactions and assessing risks are also part of their requirements. Implementing such measures means processes invariably need to be revamped, or new programs developed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of the arduous road to becoming regulation-ready, many exchanges decide to forgo improvements, and are still operating non-compliantly and without KYC measures in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Criminal actors, whether traditional finance or crypto, are always on the look-out for platforms without proper KYC mechanisms, to gain access and engage in fraudulent activity. Even when crypto platforms comply to the highest KYC standards, some users are still able to circumvent those controls (see our previous article: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk">‘Buying crypto without a KYC check? Here’s why it’s risky for both users and platform operators.’</a>). Using non-compliant crypto exchanges can be risky for customers, as they may lose their funds following a mandatory shutdown. On top of that, non-compliant exchanges may not have adequate security measures to protect user funds and personal information. This makes them vulnerable to a whole host of different attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>History has shown that authorities have little patience with non-compliant crypto platforms. In 2017, BTC-e was <a href="https://www.ccn.com/btc-e-users-funds-stuck-in-limbo-as-companies-blame-each-other/">shut down by law enforcement in the United States</a> after it was accused of facilitating money laundering and other illegal activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alexander Vinnik, one of BTC-e’s founders, was alleged to have stolen identities, facilitated drug trafficking, and helped to launder criminal proceeds from syndicates around the world. He <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/btc-e-founder-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison-for-laundering-ransomware-funds/">was later sentenced in France</a> to a five-year jail sentence, after a long and complex legal battle with U.S. and Russian authorities amid an intelligence imbroglio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, crypto exchange platform BitMEX was charged with violating AML/KYC regulations by the U.S.&nbsp; In October 2021, the Seychelles-based company agreed to <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/bitmex-agrees-to-settlement-up-to-100m-with-us-cftc-and-fincen">pay as much as $100 million</a> to resolve charges with CFTC and the Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network.&nbsp;</p>



 Laundering crypto money 101.&nbsp; 



<p>Thanks to weak AML and KYC policies, non-compliant crypto exchanges provide an accessible avenue to launder money, particularly when they offer on- and off-ramp facilities, which facilitate cryptocurrency being exchanged for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp">fiat</a> (government-issued currency).&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-money-laundering-2022">Chainalysis</a>, illicit addresses sent nearly $23.8 billion’s worth of cryptocurrency in 2022, which was an increase of 68% compared to 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dark net marketplaces offer money laundering services, but they are not the only means used by bad actors for laundering crypto. On-chain money laundering mixers help criminals convert crypto from illicit origins, by obfuscating blockchain transactions with a view to masking the proceeds of crime. More traditional intermediaries can also be used to hide the origin of funds for crypto trading, such as offshore accounts and shell companies.&nbsp;</p>



 Most popular money laundering crypto scams. 



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/smurfing/">Smurfing</a>: Large sums of money are split into smaller amounts that are sent through via multiple transactions. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/one-of-darkwebs-largest-cryptocurrency-laundromats-washed-out">Mixing</a>: These services are used to obscure the transaction history of a cryptocurrency by blending cryptos of multiple users.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  Offshore Transactions: Offshore accounts are used by criminals to obscure the origin of funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Exchange Hopping: Criminals also use multiple crypto exchanges to transfer funds across different platforms, thereby making it difficult to trace the money trail.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  Privacy-Oriented Cryptocurrencies: Some blockchains employ advanced cryptographic techniques to hide transaction amounts, addresses, and other information.&nbsp;  



 Preventing money laundering through dedicated regulations and mechanisms.&nbsp; 



<p>In recent years, regulators have stepped up to enforce sanctions toward non-compliant operators in the crypto industry. Between criminal charges and sanctions lists, crypto entities operating either knowingly or unknowingly for illegal actors are now facing increased regulatory pressure and scrutiny. In fact, in 2023 and beyond, taking steps to become compliant with AML regulations should be the top priority for all crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto operators must implement strong KYC/AML mechanisms to ensure they are in full compliance with local legislation. This can also help regulators by identifying any red flags associated with certain transactions. For example, by adopting a layered approach through geofencing, account profiling and identity screening, crypto exchanges can drastically improve their AML/KYC programs. Recent developments in artificial intelligence mean the implementation of such detection tools can help to significantly deter criminals looking to launder money, whilst improving compliance levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The implementation of these robust controls will enable exchanges to participate in the fight against money laundering and contribute to the democratization of crypto currencies, which will ultimately lead to further mass adoption.</p>



<p>Read our latest blog to discover <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/red-flags-money-laundering/">money laundering red flag indicators</a>.</p>



 KYC to power crypto adoption.&nbsp; 



<p>Although enforcing KYC measures was a controversial decision for some crypto purists as it appears to go against many of the principles outlined by Nakamoto, they are an important tool for cryptocurrency platforms to prevent money laundering. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to increase, KYC processes have become an essential step in safeguarding the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Non-compliant exchanges will remain a target for money laundering specialists as they offer an opportunity to exploit gaps in controls. Non-compliant exchanges are also at risk from the authorities, which could not only impose major financial sanctions and business closures, but also criminal charges for mismanagement. In short, the existence of non-compliant exchanges poses a threat to crypto firms, crypto customers and the crypto industry itself.&nbsp;</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Institute of Human Rights &amp; Business x Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs  Introduction <p>This blog series aims to present the results of the common investigation project of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="http://ihrb.org">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB) which seeks to explore further the opportunities and barriers to just transition in the built environment in Europe (and beyond). This time, we will look at the urban land ownership patterns; their dynamics, transparency as well as some of the societal, economic and environmental implications.</p><p>At <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, we see this work as a part of <a href="https://medium.com/tag/built-envrionment">our built environment mission</a>. In this area we have been working together with <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/what-we-do">Laudes Foundation</a> on <a href="https://medium.com/search?q=BendNotBreak">New Economic Thinking</a> where we analyzed the deep trends in the built environments in Europe, as well as mapping multiple actors and organizations seen as seeds of hope and opportunity in this space (see: Blog <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">1</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-961744d2cb36?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">2</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">3</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-part-4-89c7683bd2c7?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">4</a>). Furthermore, in the <a href="http://radiclecivics.cc">Beyond Property</a> project, where we are collaborating with a diverse group of organisations including the <a href="http://rockefellerfoundation.org">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/">Berggruen Institute</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society</a>, as well as in the <a href="https://www.radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle Civics: Freehouse</a> demonstrator, we are working on the question of what a world beyond prevailing understandings of property would look like. Last but not least, in the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">Smart Commons</a> we have been demonstrating how public goods create private wealth, and presented ideas about how one could re-balance this equation.</p><p>For <a href="http://ihrb.org">IHRB</a>, this piece of work will contribute towards the project “<a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/building-for-today-and-the-future">Building for Today and For the Future</a>”. The project is developing a collaborative and field-defining agenda for a <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/explainers/just-transition-in-the-built-environment">just transition</a> in the built environment, through deep-dive action research in eight cities, visioning sessions, and regional and international policy advocacy. The work will also open up broader conversations on beneficial ownership as it relates to urban areas, and identify gaps and opportunities for future research. The work is in the context of IHRB’s <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment">Built Environment Programme</a>: bringing a human rights approach to built environment decision-making.</p><p>In follow-up blogs through 2024 we will share insights on the largest public and private owners of land in four European&nbsp;cities:</p>  Copenhagen  Lisbon  Prague  Athens  <p>We hope that this work can not only give insights into the dynamics of different contexts in terms of urban land ownership but also help to support and expand the ever growing community of changemakers who are working to achieve outcomes leading to the just transition. It draws inspiration from ownership mapping initiatives in other cities such as <a href="https://itsmaterial.substack.com/p/who-owns-cairo">Cairo</a> and <a href="https://therealdeal.com/magazine/new-york-september-2018/who-owns-all-of-new-york/">New York</a>. And we will be sharing interviews and insights from urban land-mapping in additional contexts, including <a href="https://cmmm.eu/">”Critical Mapping for Municipalist Mobilisation</a>” which looks at Belgrade, Berlin and Barcelona; and the work of <a href="https://geodevops.org/">GeoDevOps</a> in&nbsp;Kenya.</p><p>We hope that the blog series thoughts will prompt fruitful discussions and questions. We would welcome all readers’ views and critiques.</p><p>Please do get in touch if you would like to contribute: Aleksander Nowak <a href="mailto:aleks@darkmatterlabs.org">aleks@darkmatterlabs.org</a> / Annabel Short <a href="mailto:annabel.short@ihrb.org">annabel.short@ihrb.org</a></p>Fig 1. Initial mapping of urban land ownership in the Copenhagen municipality Land ownership and city-making: what are the connections? <p>IHRB’s <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/framework-for-dignity-built-environment">Framework for Dignity in the Built Environment</a> begins with the lifecycle stages of Land, Planning and Finance, recognizing that these are fundamental underpinnings for all that follows. Urban land ownership patterns significantly influence the possibility of just transition in the built environment.</p><p>1) Firstly, the ownership patterns of urban land can determine access and affordability of housing, infrastructure, and amenities. Concentrated ownership by a few powerful entities and consequent potential single-minded model for development can lead to exclusionary practices, gentrification, and displacement of marginalized communities. In multiple contexts, it has become evident that the shortage of housing is not the only driving factor behind the affordable housing crisis. Even in urban areas where, for example, high density zoning has been systematically applied, the rise of land values relative to building values, is vastly disproportionate. (see i.a. <a href="https://apsc.ubc.ca/news/2022/how-controlling-land-prices-could-help-solve-housing-crisis">Patrick&nbsp;Candon</a>).</p><p>2) Secondly, Land ownership influences the ability to implement sustainable development practices. Owners with a long-term perspective and commitment to place and sustainability may be more inclined to invest in energy-efficient buildings, renewable energy installations, green spaces, or public transportation infrastructure. Short-term, profit-focused ownership may hinder incentives to invest in sustainability, leading to environmentally harmful urban development.</p><p>3) Furthermore, concentrated land ownership can concentrate power and decision-making in the hands of a few stakeholders (public or private) limiting community input and participation in shaping the built environment. Inclusive land ownership models that involve local communities in land co-ownership can empower them to actively participate in decision-making processes, ensuring that the transition is just, equitable, and responsive to community needs.</p><p>4) Moreover, Land ownership patterns can influence economic disparities within urban areas, exacerbate income inequality and limit economic opportunities for marginalized communities.</p><p>5) Consequently, the way land is owned and managed can impact social cohesion and community well-being. Concentrated ownership that prioritizes profit maximization or highly debt driven urban developments without considering social needs can lead to the fragmentation of communities and the erosion of social&nbsp;bonds.</p><p>The project will also provide insights into land ownership mapping methodologies, contributing to a community of practice. The process will contribute to understanding of data transparency and accessibility in different cities. The context in each of them will likely pose different challenges, therefore, a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods will result in new strategies to get the most accurate picture of each of the contexts.</p><p>Contact:</p><p>Aleksander Nowak <a href="mailto:aleks@darkmatterlabs.org">aleks@darkmatterlabs.org</a> / Annabel Short <a href="mailto:annabel.short@ihrb.org">annabel.short@ihrb.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/urban-land-ownership-mapping-towards-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-1-72ff315fefff">Urban Land Ownership Mapping— Towards a just transition of Europe’s built environment #1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What is Open-World Compute? <p>Serverless computing has been promised as the next big thing™ in computing. There are many advantages: not needing to build and manage complex backend code, and granular billing per invocation means that you only pay for what you use. Many of these systems have adopted workflow systems (e.g., AWS Step Functions, GitHub Actions) on top of batch requests. Unfortunately, the systems to date have serious limitations: they’re locked into cumbersome proprietary APIs, have a finite number of integrations, and often don’t handle partial failure elegantly (e.g., can leave a database in an inconsistent state if something goes wrong in another step). Furthermore, many of the compute offerings today lock developers into an ecosystem, making it difficult to switch to other solutions in the future.</p><p>A more principled generation of workflow systems has developed to address some of these problems. They typically depend on the developer writing their code “correctly” and not doing things that make their code repeat work on multiple calls. This doesn’t play well with many common functionalities: what about when developers want to access time or random numbers? They also often don’t handle rollback out of the box. In short: they’re closed systems that depend on the programmer working hard to ensure that abstract properties are respected. This is a real problem: networks can (and do!) fail. Developers write buggy code (we all do it). It’s an extremely high bar.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, brings content-addressed computation to IPFS using Wasm, PKI, and capabilities. IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability. </p><p>IPVM (and Homestar) takes a different approach. Instead of depending on the developer to be careful, it restricts their programming environment. For example, WebAssembly (Wasm) can be limited to deterministic computation: any code that you compile to Wasm has to have these properties that we want by definition. IPVM also acknowledges that failure happens and pulls from recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-m-b-r-o-s-i-a-providing-performant-virtual-resiliency-for-distributed-applications/">research</a> about hiding that as much as possible by leveraging content addressing and Wasm.</p><p>Fission's vision for open-world compute is highly usable and collaborative. We want an open, multitier system that runs everywhere, connects all the world's users and services, and is substantially better than Web 2.0. Anyone will be able to broadcast a task type on the network, and it will be automatically usable without having to fork the project or ask permission.</p> Key Characteristics <p>There are several key characteristics we're considering as we build IPVM. As mentioned earlier, idempotence and determinism are key to reliable computing, but they can be challenging to understand and implement. </p><p>Wasm allows developers to bring their own language, run computations on a server, in their browser, or even on their phone, and run them in a deterministic environment so that the same inputs always produce the same outputs. </p><p>Furthermore, when we run computations with CIDs, the results output more CIDs. The CIDs do not get recomputed and reproduced each time we run them - they are essentially cached in IPFS. When someone applies that same input, it simply calls back that cached result. No new records are being created, making it idempotent. This comes for free on Merklized data, but we can also Merklize data that's read from anywhere and cache it for later use. </p><p>While pure computation is useful for many applications, you still need mutability in many cases. There are queries (reads) and pure computations, and these can go back and forth as long as we end with mutation. Because we are not giving users the ability to define the order of execution, we can reorder computation so that the mutations happen at the end.</p><p>If we bring these three properties together - determinism, idempotency, and purity, we can achieve virtual resiliency. This gives the developer peace of mind, knowing that, eventually, the computations will work no matter what crashes or curveballs are thrown at the system.</p><p>We also want replayability. The cached computations, or receipts, never have to be re-run. And when we need to make non-deterministic requests or work with time of day or random, instead of losing out on the guarantees of deterministic compute and having to use client libraries, the node can call itself, store the information, and run the RPC call. Then if we run it again, we can have replayability because those previous computations were already saved. This creates a "run once, never run again" system, making it more efficient and scalable. Using capabilities based on UCAN, we can determine who can run different computations. Perhaps one job is better for Bacalhau, another for Fastly, etc. Maybe you only want computation to happen on a cluster of machines that you and your friends run and no others. We let IPVM handle the matchmaking and authorization checking so that different systems can work together to complete the job.</p><p>And the best part is this is all happening behind the scenes! The developer doesn't need to set any of this up. 👍</p> Compute over Data Summit 2023 Presentation <p>Fission Staff Research Engineer <a href="https://github.com/zeeshanlakhani">Zeeshan Lakhani</a> gave a presentation on IPVM and his work on the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">Homestar</a> implementation at the Compute Over Data Summit, which can be viewed below.</p><p>Learn more or get involved by joining the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM working group</a>.</p>

 What Are Login Credentials? 
<p>Login credentials are unique pieces of information that verify the identity of a user accessing a digital system. </p>
 How Do Login Credentials Work? 
<p>The functionality of login credentials changes based on the type of system and its security demands. The type, complexity, and number of required credentials will change in different contexts. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, credentials come in two different forms:</p>
 
 Static: Static login credentials are fixed and don’t change over time unless manually updated by the user or the system administrator. These are easier to implement but are more vulnerable to various threats like phishing or brute-force attacks. 
 Transient: Transient login credentials change over time. Transient credentials are often used alongside static credentials to provide an additional layer of security. Transient login credentials include one-time passwords, session tokens, and the codes generated by hardware or software tokens in <a>multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) systems. 
 
<p>Transient credentials offer enhanced security because even if an attacker manages to intercept or otherwise acquire a temporary credential, it will soon expire and become useless. However, implementing transient credentials can be more complex and require additional resources, such as an OTP generation and delivery system or hardware tokens.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are several different “factors,” or types, of login credentials that play a role in multi-factor authentication:</p>
 
 Something You Know (Knowledge): This factor represents knowledge-based information that the user needs to provide to authenticate their identity. It typically includes passwords, PINs, or answers to secret questions. 
 Something You Have (Ownership): This factor involves a physical device that the user possesses, which generates or receives information for authentication. Examples include a mobile phone receiving an SMS-based code, a hardware or software token generating a one-time password, a smart card, or a security key. 
 Something You Are (Inherence): This factor pertains to the biometric characteristics of the user. It can include <a>fingerprint recognition</a>, facial recognition, <a>voice recognition</a>, or retinal or <a>iris scans</a>. 
 
<p>There are several types of login credentials, each providing different levels of security:</p>
 
 Username/Password: The most common form of login credentials. The username typically serves as a public identifier for the user, while the password is a secret word or phrase (ideally) only known only to the user.  
 <a>Biometrics</a>: Biometrics are the use of unique physical or behavioral characteristics of the user for authentication. These can include fingerprints, facial scans, or voice recognition. 
 Token-Based Authentication: Here, the user is provided a token, or time- or context-specific string of alphanumeric characters, after successful login with a username and password. This token is then used for authentication in subsequent interactions. This form is often used for federated or Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication approaches. 
 Certificate-Based Authentication: This approach involves using digital certificates issued by trusted authorities that verify an organization is who they say they are. The certificates contain cryptographic keys and the owner’s identity, providing trust and security. This is often used in online encryption, such as with the <a href="https://https.cio.gov/faq/">Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS)</a>. 
<p>Each type of login credential comes with its strengths and vulnerabilities that apply to the specific requirements of your business. </p>
 What Are Some of the Threats to Login Credentials? 
<p>While some login credentials are more secure than others, they all face some sort of potential threat. There is no truly fool-proof approach to authentication.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common threats:</p>
 
 Social Engineering: The most widespread form of login threat is social engineering, or approaching users fraudulently to gain access to their information. For example, <a>phishing</a> attacks involve users revealing their login credentials to attackers posing as trustworthy entities. This is often done through deceptive emails or websites that mimic legitimate services. 
 Data Theft: hackers directly attack an authentication database, including hashed or plaintext login credentials. Following this, the hacker has immediate access to the credentials or, if they are encrypted, access to the database to attempt to crack that encryption at their leisure. 
 Brute-Force Attacks: The attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of passwords until they find the correct one. This type of attack is typically only effective on short or common passwords.  
 Dictionary Attacks: In a dictionary attack, the attacker tries a predetermined list of words and phrases as possible passwords. This can be effective against accounts with weak passwords that use common words or phrases. 
 Keylogging: These malicious programs record keystrokes on a user’s device, often without the user knowing. While insidious, these often require either direct access to the system or a larger-scale hack of that system. 
 <a>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</a>: The attacker can intercept data moving between the user and the service they’re trying to access, capturing it and reading it. 
 
<p>These threats underscore the importance of solid login credentials, careful handling of sensitive information, and ongoing vigilance about potential threats. It’s essential to keep systems updated, use secure and unique passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and educate users about potential threats and how to avoid them.</p>
 What Are Some Best Practices for Using Strong Login Credentials? 
<p>Creating and maintaining strong login credentials is essential to personal and organizational cybersecurity. Note that most of these requirements refer to passwords or other changeable authentication methods where the user has direct control over the credentials.</p>
<p>Here are some best practices to follow:</p>
 
 Require Complex Passwords: A strong password should be at least 12 characters long, with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. 
 Update Passwords: Require that users update passwords on a regular schedule, and disallow them from using repeat passwords. 
 Enable Multi-factor Authentication: MFA requires two or more authentication credentials to verify a user. This will typically be two or more forms of credentials across different categories of factors.  
 Beware of Phishing Attacks: Be vigilant about where you enter your credentials. Phishing attacks often trick people into entering their login credentials into fake websites. Always double-check the website’s URL before entering your information. 
 Implement Strong Security Questions: If your service uses security questions for account recovery, these should also be hard to guess. Treat them like additional passwords. 
 Use <a>Passwordless Authentication</a>: Some security platforms will provide ways to bypass the need to re-enter credentials constantly. These passwordless solutions eliminate some of the most common forms of authentication fraud around passwords.  
 
<p>Follow these best practices and you can significantly boost your authentication security.</p>

 DPI is neither good, nor bad but never neutral — governance is the key to achieving the goals of DPI and Digital Transformation <p>The digital technologies that serve as the ‘infrastructure’ of widespread digital transformation are increasingly recognised as key drivers of development. In recognition of the importance of these technologies in enabling development, the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">United Nations</a>, <a href="https://t20ind.org/taskforce/our-common-digital-future-affordable-accessible-and-inclusive-digital-public-infrastructure/">G20</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/digital-public-infrastructure/">WEF</a> and others increasingly highlight the importance of thinking about these technologies as ‘digital public infrastructure’ (DPI), flagging technologies such as the infrastructure and standards of digital identity, payments and data sharing as core ‘rails’ of digital transformation.</p> A technology-only approach to DPI will fail — getting governance right is&nbsp;critical <p>We know from the history of technology and development that technology alone is never a solution — from <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3560107.3560193">e-government</a> initiatives to <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/selling-charisma-circa-2010-the-mit-media-lab-and-its-one-laptop-per-child-program/">laptops</a> the lesson is that technology alone is no silver bullet. If anything, without care it <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1940761.1940772">‘amplifies’ existing patterns of power and inequality</a>. We need to establish governance of digital technologies as a critical enabling layer to ensure all DPIs deliver on their promise, and to ensure a digital transformation that is rights based, protective and inclusive. A framework for the governance of digital technologies can set the rules of the road for all digital technologies — including DPI but also private sector&nbsp;too.</p> Three thoughts on why governance is key to making DPI a&nbsp;success <p>At Caribou Digital we’ve been working on technology in development for a while — from increasing access to digital technologies, supporting dialogue around what ‘good’ digital technologies look like to enabling entrepreneurs to better use technology. Underpinning this work is a commitment to listen and learn from the way technologies are increasingly part of everyday&nbsp;life.</p><p>1. Making technology deliver for development requires institutional capacity and expertise: one form of digital public infrastructure is ‘digital public goods’ (understood as open source software, data, AI models, standards and content). There has been big progress in developing DPGs — there are <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/">150 DPGs in the DPG registry</a>, and <a href="https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2023-04/Digital%20Public%20Goods%20for%20the%20SDGs%20-%20Emerging%20Insights%20on%20Sutainability%2C%20Replicability%20%26%20Partnerships.pdf">DPGs have helped solve real problems</a>. But we know that open source alone is never a solution, and that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401205000393#aep-section-id27">it also requires institutional competency</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/puar.12141">champions</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584918301277">sustainable business models</a>. Without these, <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09593841211232677/full/html">open source software deployments commonly fail</a>. Open source systems also introduce new dependencies — for example on <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/automation/beware-systems-integrator-lock-in-open-source-dependency/d/d-id/754863">companies who integrate new open source technologies into existing systems</a>. In the Philippines, the government has advanced one of the most significant deployments of the open source digital identity platform MOSIP, one of the most developed DPIs — yet the contract for the integrator alone was just under $40m and is <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1514108/psa-eyes-national-id-listup-for-filipinos-abroad-after-may-2022-polls">a ‘crucial’ component</a> of the project. The contract is&nbsp;ongoing.</p><p>Design is key to inclusion: ensuring that DPI meet standards that reflect core values is key — especially around issues such as individual agency, inclusion and protection. We’re currently researching the implications of the design of the EU’s wallet initiatives for migrants, looking at where identity wallets have been implemented — such as <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/estonia-to-trial-mobile-id-app-based-on-ukraines-diia-409191/">Ukraine’s Diia,</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1672385">Pakistan’s Pak Identity</a> or the <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/document/digital-identity-analysis-humanitarian-sector">IFRC’s DIGID</a>. From the humanitarian context we know that many vulnerable populations such as migrants <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/document/digital-identity-analysis-humanitarian-sector">see little value in digital wallets</a>. But while design matters, we shouldn’t expect governments to become technology companies, developing all their own inhouse development capacity. Instead, governments need to be smart customers, with informed procurement practices.</p><p>2. Impact and risk assessment is key: in our research on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-and-management-information-systems-for-humanitarian-and-social-protection-response-b1b25e5623a2">registration and identity systems and management and information systems in refugee and social protection</a>, it’s clear that many deployments lack assessment of impact. For example, while there are broad policy goals of linking humanitarian systems with social protection systems, there are <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2021/6/21/rohingya-data-protection-and-UN-betrayal">widespread concerns about the transfer of vulnerable peoples’ personal data from humanitarian agencies to host governments</a>. While the humanitarian sector has established principles and approaches such as ‘do no harm’ to assess potential danger, there is a <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CWC-Managing-Digital-Risks-To-Refugee-Connectivity-Report.pdf">growing attention to the issue of ‘digital&nbsp;risk’</a>.</p><p>Due diligence and impact assessment tools are key. The UN has established <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/Blog_post_GNI_Blog.pdf">due diligence assessment tools</a> for assessing technology use across the organization. In our work on HR due diligence for tech investors, we developed an assessment tool to support technology investors consideration of rights in their decision making. Impact assessment is key to assessing the design and deployment of a specific system. To address other technologies, systems or wider path of digital transformation, a broader framework is required. A broader framework is also needed to ensure a sustainable, long term solution for countries who wish to manage the range of digital technologies in use within a sovereign jurisdiction.</p><p>3. Governance is the key to safeguarding, protection — and defining the values of digital transformation. A national set of rules of the road for digital technology under a sovereign jurisdiction can set the direction of digital transformation. This can include determining things like procurement rules to establish interoperable, transferable data formats, as well as wider principles such as civic participation, oversight and recourse. With the right rules in place a nation can benchmark systems against agreed standards and rules — and determine whether a particular system meets what we have decided are ‘good’ standards. What should a governance framework look like? Each country’s governance framework will be unique — though it’s important to recognise that its not about new laws/elements but ensuring existing laws are fit for the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>We’re currently working with UNDP to develop a model framework, and in our work so far key elements for this framework include: Legal framework; Capable institutions; Data Protection and Privacy; Policy and system design principles; Facilitating access to services; Procurement &amp; anti-corruption; Transparency and access to information; “Rights, Risk &amp; Inclusion” and Accountability.</p><p>The governance layer enables national sovereignty and interoperability: the governance layer sets out the rules of the digital railroad — ensuring that any digital transformation and technology can meet the goals of DPI. But like a railroad, standards determine whether trains can safely move from one country to another — or not. The governance layer can determine a country’s ability to interact with international partners — such as the digital governance heavyweights of the US, EU and&nbsp;China.</p><p>Governance is key to defining the private sector’s&nbsp;role:</p>  DPI is not just public or government owned tech — financial sector, data brokers and managers.  A sustainable national digital public infrastructure ecosystem requires private sector technology vendors, investors and innovators.  Getting the governance layer right — from data protection laws, procurement regulations and financial reporting — is key to ensuring that private actors and capital can be confident their role and interests will be protected.  <p>These governance frameworks have deeply value laden dimensions — consider the emphasis on individual rights in the EU’s suite of digital regulation (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">DMA</a>, <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package">DSA</a>, <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>) and on national socialism in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/4/13/china-spearheads-ai-regulation-after-playing-catchup-to-chatgdp">China’s AI Act</a>. All <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/117307/">technology systems, regulations and principles</a> reflect values and ideas about the goals that governance is intended to&nbsp;support.</p><p>DPI are technologies — and as such are neither good, nor bad — but never neutral. Governance is the key to determining the impact of digital public infrastructure, and the destination of the resulting digital transformation.

<p>In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, blockchain has emerged as a transformative tool, capable of revolutionizing computational foundations of industries. Among its plethora of applications, one area where blockchain and AI show potential is in the realm of supply chain management.</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2021/10/21/ongoing-supply-chain-issues-are-the-result-of-a-stale-model-heres-why/?sh=63b78c2641e1">Image Source</a></p><p>Ocean Protocol is the privacy preserving, data sharing protocol for data, web3, and AI. The protocol is capable of architecting computational output and a real time data-sharing framework.</p><p>Computation is essential for understanding the world around us. The ability to run computations on sensitive data while preserving its privacy and sensitivity with Ocean Compute is a capability that supply chain and data analysts have never seen. That is, computation on a dataset without revealing the underlying data.</p> Ocean Protocol: A&nbsp;Primer <p>Ocean Protocol sets a standard for digital ownership and access control. OP tools allow people to connect real assets with compute jobs. As humans, we cannot predict the future or guess the aggregate outcome of events…accurately that is. Ocean allows everyone (individuals, industries, enterprise, and governments) to share, monetize, and leverage data while maintaining privacy and control. Ocean’s “Compute-to-Data” feature gives compute access on privately held data, which never leaves the data owner’s premises.</p><p>By leveraging the core functionalities of Ocean’s smart contracts, such as <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/datanft-and-datatoken">data NFTs</a> to represent IP ownership, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-tokens-2-fungible-composable-54b6e0d28293">datatokens</a> to define the rules of IP access, as well as <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">compute-to-data</a> to orchestrate privacy-preserving access to data — users can now build next-generation marketplaces and token-gated applications.</p><p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean-based marketplaces</a> enable monetization of private data while preserving privacy. Ocean brings together open-source blockchain technology, data tokens, AI agents, and advanced access control in a unified, interoperable ecosystem.</p><p>Access to data, computing said data, decentralized data sharing and verifiable time blocks are Ocean Protocol features that outline a foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) designed to enhance and streamline supply chain processes.</p> Decentralized Applications (dApps) in Supply Chain Management <p>Decentralized applications (dApps) are software applications that run on a distributed computing system, like a blockchain (Ethereum Mainnet for example). Unlike traditional web applications, dApps are not controlled by a single entity, providing a level of transparency, security, and efficiency not achievable in traditional, centralized systems.</p><p>In supply chain management, dApps powered by Ocean can leverage Ocean Protocol’s data-sharing capabilities to bring significant process improvement: transparency, traceability, and efficiency. Here are some potential dApps that can be built on the Ocean Protocol for use in the supply chain industry:</p> 1. Traceability dApp <p>One of the most critical issues in today’s global supply chains is the lack of transparency and traceability. A dApp built on the Ocean Protocol could provide a solution to this problem by enabling a transparent, tamper-proof record of product journeys from origin to end consumer (example: farm to&nbsp;shelf).</p><p>Such a dApp could use data tokens to provide access to product data at each stage of the supply chain, including manufacturing details, transportation logs, and quality checks. This data can be shared securely and transparently with all stakeholders, allowing consumers to verify a product’s authenticity and sustainable practices.</p> 2. Smart Contract-Based Automation dApp <p>Ocean Protocol’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">smart contracts</a> library is home to the most advanced smart contract infrastructure available on the web today. Smart contract &amp; blockchain-based structure supports the use of self-executing contracts and AI agents with the terms of the agreement written into code. A smart contract-based dApp can automate various supply chain processes, reducing manual intervention, minimizing errors, and improving efficiency.</p><p>For example, a smart contract could automatically trigger payments upon meeting certain conditions, like the delivery of goods, confirmation to a warehouse, or sale of a shelved good.&nbsp;. This would significantly reduce payment processing times, fees and disputes over transactions.</p> 3. Real-Time Inventory Management dApp <p>Managing inventory efficiently is crucial in supply chain management. A real-time inventory management dApp built on Ocean Protocol could offer a powerful tool for companies to keep track of their inventory in real time, helping to minimize storage costs and prevent stockouts or overstocking.</p><p>This concept dApp can use IoT devices to collect data on stored goods and share it on the blockchain. Stakeholders could access this data using data tokens, providing a real-time, accurate view of inventory levels.</p> 4. Data-Driven Demand Forecasting dApp <p>Understanding and predicting demand is vital for successful supply chain management. A dApp using Ocean Protocol’s data-sharing capabilities could aggregate and analyze data from various sources to provide accurate, data-driven demand forecasts.</p><p>This could include historical sales data, market trends, social media sentiment, and more. Companies could access these insights through data tokens, enabling them to make more informed decisions about production and distribution, reducing waste, and improving customer satisfaction.</p> Ocean Protocol: Blockchain x Supply Chain dApps built&nbsp;Today <p>One example of a supply chain initiative inside the Ocean Protocol Ecosystem is <a href="https://www.transportgenie.ca/">Transport Genie</a>: who aims to make it possible to transport animals humanely through AI powered smart sensors, whilst monitoring livestock from farm to their next destination. Transport Genie offers real-time alerts and uses blockchain technology to keep a digital twin record of activities throughout the transportation value&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.transportgenie.ca">https://www.transportgenie.ca</a></p> Conclusion <p>Ocean Protocol’s decentralized data sharing and compute to data framework offers fertile ground for developing dApps that can revolutionize supply chain management. By providing a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for data sharing and decision making, Ocean Protocol can help the supply chain industry overcome its current challenges and pave the way for a more sustainable and efficient future.</p><p>These use cases of Ocean Protocol highlight the transformative power of combing blockchain, AI and cryptocurrency in reshaping traditional industries.</p><p>From ensuring transparency and traceability to automating processes and enabling real-time inventory management, these dApps could revolutionize the way we manage and monitor supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>The use of data tokens to access shared data can create new economic models within the supply chain, providing incentives for data sharing and collaboration. This can lead to the democratization of data, where every stakeholder in the supply chain, from producers to consumers, can benefit from shared information.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable people to privately &amp; securely publish, exchange, and consume&nbsp;data.</p><p>Follow Ocean on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a> to keep up to date.

<p>At UNISOT, we’re at the forefront of this transformation.</p>
<p>These are just 3 keyways the public blockchain can transform your supply chain. Let’s shape the future of Supply Chains together!</p>
<p><a href="https://unisot.com/request-a-demo/">Contact us</a> today to schedule a personalized demo and embark on a journey towards increased transparency, efficiency, and competitiveness.</p>
       Customers and End Users 
<p>With the public blockchain, customers and end users can be sure about the quality and authenticity of the products they want to buy. It keeps a record of all the important information about the products, such as quality control tests, certifications, and where they come from.</p>
<p>This means customers can easily track and verify the origin and journey of the products, ensuring they are genuine and not fake. Customers can now shop with confidence, knowing that they’re getting the real deal and not counterfeit products.</p>
       Suppliers and Producers 
<p>With public blockchain, suppliers and producers can easily track and trace their goods, raw materials, and components as they move through the supply chain. This gives them a clear view of where everything is at any given time. It helps them stay accountable and ensures that everything is running smoothly. Plus, blockchain’s <a href="https://unisot.com/global-inventory-management/">real-time inventory tracking feature</a> helps them manage their inventory more efficiently. They can now avoid running out of stock by knowing exactly when to restock and can reduce unnecessary costs and waste by keeping just the right amount of inventory on hand. In short, public blockchain helps suppliers and producers streamline their operations, save money, and improve overall sustainability and efficiency.</p>
       Logistics Providers 
<p>With public blockchain, logistic providers can have real-time tracking of their shipments, which means they always know where they are and when they’ll arrive. This helps avoid delays and plan routes more effectively. It makes logistics operations smoother and more efficient. Additionally, the public blockchain allows providers to securely share logistics data with others involved in the supply chain, like suppliers and customers. This means they can collaborate easily and directly, without relying on intermediaries. It simplifies communication and reduces costs. In a nutshell, the public blockchain helps improve logistics operations, save time, and work more seamlessly with other parties in the supply chain.</p>

<p>We’ve all had terrible login experiences. You sign into an app, only to realise you have to log in again to access another system on the same journey, and often supply personal data that you’ve already supplied. It’s frustrating, and doesn’t exactly create a positive impression of the brand – especially as sign up/login is right at the start of the user journey, setting the tone for the continued experience.</p>
<p>Clunky customer experiences lead to abandoned service sign ups, fewer returning users, fewer word of mouth recommendations, and – perhaps worst of all – security risks. When access to a service is complex, users tend to cut corners when it comes to credential management. For example, they may reuse a common password out of “credential fatigue” – a practice that risks data breaches when hackers try credential stuffing. Not to mention the security risks that come from internal workforce inefficiencies when managing several accounts/data silos per user.</p>
<p>It is a far more user friendly and secure experience for users when you offer one simple login to your organisation’s apps and services. The options within this area are varied, and will be tailored to your systems and requirements, but a great place to start is single sign-on (SSO).</p>
 One login with single sign-on (SSO) 
<p>Users want simplicity when it comes to access to your services. Single sign-on is key to achieving it. SSO lets your users log in once to authenticate to all permitted services and apps. This means that moving between different services is transparent, without the need to have multiple accounts and credentials, or input the same data multiple times.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Single sign-on also means single sign-out. Once the user has logged out, or had their account revoked, you don’t need to worry about forgotten access/logged in sessions presenting a security risk.</p>
 Customising SSO 
<p>You might be thinking that SSO sounds simple enough, but what about your unique (sometimes complex) business requirements. Can SSO still simplify your user journey?</p>
<p>Perhaps you have some of your services based on external systems. In these cases, Federation allows single sign-on between two security domains, so you can still reap the benefits of SSO.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of your systems contain more sensitive data than others. You might want to have more assurance over the identity of the user for these areas – likely requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) – but without requiring this step for more basic services. A great solution to these cases is <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/what-is-step-up-authentication/" title="Step-up Authentication">Step-up Authentication</a> – still using SSO with your usual level of authentication, then asking for further verification only when the user is accessing the more sensitive system(s) or completing a higher risk transaction.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have the same users accessing your systems in different contexts – e.g. as a private individual, but also in their work role. With the right identity solution, you can choose to authorise one account to have different permissions depending on the context in which they are accessing the account. For example, where a user may have permission to purchase something on their own behalf, they may not on behalf of their company. So, again, you can still take advantage of SSO and only requiring one account per user.</p>
 How to implement SSO 
<p>SSO is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) staple capability, and can usually be implemented quickly and easily – particularly when installed as part of a SaaS or hybrid cloud/on-premises IAM solution.</p>
<p>Many organisations who are looking to simplify their user journey get started with SSO from an IAM solution stack, which gives them the option to add on further functionality when required. For example, if the user base grows or needs become more complex later on, additional capabilities from the IAM solution stack may be added on. The key here is to choose a flexible solution that will evolve with your business.</p>

<p>In her CoD Summit 2023 presentation, Fission co-founder and CTO Brooklyn Zelenka discusses the need for location-independent compute, and how content addressing and open protocols are making it possible.</p> We're Living in a Server-Centric World <p>Since the invention of the LAMP stack in the '90s, we've been working with a server-centric model. It has led to developers specializing in front-end, back-end, DevOps, Kubernetes, Docker, and more. &nbsp;Over the years, it has become more difficult to train and maintain this complex system.</p><p>Amazon, Microsoft, and Google control the majority of data centers, which has led to further centralization. In places like South America, Central America, and Africa, the lack of compute infrastructure means that users in these areas have less access to resources.</p><p>IoT, compute over data, and LLMs cannot work long-term if we keep sending data to a small number of data centers. It's an overwhelming, massive amount of data. &nbsp;</p><p>We have to bring compute to where the data is produced, closer to the user.</p> Building a New Compute Stack <p>We know we need location-independent compute and data, but to do this in production, you first need location-independent auth.</p><p>A capability-based model like <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-ucan-decentralize-auth/">UCAN</a> removes the authorization server, simplifying permissions handling. We no longer need pristine APIs for everything and can pass around auth as necessary.</p><p>The direction and the layout of the requests become the flow of authority.</p><p>Not only is it more efficient and energy-saving, but it's also more resilient because there is no central server that can bring the rest of the network down if it goes offline.</p><p>Now that auth is handled, we can solve for location-independent compute.</p><p>We started with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> because you can write in any language you want, and it runs anywhere and deterministically. </p><p>When running a computation, we take arguments and apply them to a Wasm function. This outputs a <a href="https://proto.school/content-addressing/04">CID</a> or content identifier. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. </p><p>This means we can compute over that content-addressed data without needing a centralized server! &nbsp;</p><p>We can roll all of this and a scheduler up into a task and run it, and when it executes, it returns a receipt. The receipt includes pure values (EX: 1 + 1 = 2), effects (something you want to happen next that needs to take resources off the network, like sending an email), and metadata.</p> Input Addressing <p>With content addressing, we take data, hash it, and use that data as the key value. </p><p>Here, we're introducing input addressing, where we get a receipt as the value, and the input is the hash of the instruction (the description of what you want to have run).</p><p>Instead of validating with a hash, we validate with a receipt, making it fully deterministic!</p><p>Finally, we use an invocation (a signature) and build a workflow (by authorizing multiple computation requests at once). </p> Benefits of Wasm Compute   The distributed runtime can decide the most efficient way to run tasks in the network by handling the matchmaking for the user.  The more returned receipts, the fewer computations we'll need to run. We can skip steps and reuse receipts because they've been deterministically run already. &nbsp;  If the system crashes, you can always pick up where you left off by following the CID trail.  Reverse lookup allows the user to check if a certain input ID has been entered. If it has, they can retrieve the computed result without running the task again. This is especially helpful when running AI language models over the same data or cryptographic operations.

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The words “blockchain” and “energy” usually make uncomfortable reading as people think of the <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/05/04/cryptocurrency-energy/">outsized</a> energy and environmental costs that come with using cryptocurrencies; recently, however, blockchain technology is being seen — and being adopted — to do the opposite and drive sustainability in the energy industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a recent article in Finance Magnates <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/the-use-of-blockchain-technology-in-the-energy-industry-to-promote-sustainability/">reports</a>, blockchain is driving sustainability initiatives “by improving energy traceability, facilitating peer-to-peer energy trading, streamlining supply chain management, and decentralizing energy infrastructure.”</p>
<p>It all makes for fascinating reading; but, we draw attention to it mostly because it’s a timely reminder that not all blockchain is crypto, and that distributed ledger technology can be used to do lots of beneficial things without using much energy at all, let alone draining the grid.</p>
<p>Simply put, the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x">energy intensive computation</a> required to validate bitcoin transactions — known as “proof of work”— is unique to that activity; other uses of a blockchain, such as to support verifiable credentials for decentralized identity, do not.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
 
 A distributed ledger for identity uses signatures rather than mathematical computation to generate proof. No complex mathematical processes are needed. You either accept the signature or you don’t. 
 A write to the ledger (and one write can be the basis for millions of identity credentials) or a look up on the ledger uses no more energy, and possibly less, than browsing a web page. 
 A decentralized network using a blockchain-based distributed ledger means you can use <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DIDs</a> to move most “transactions” and their cryptographic proofing off the ledger. As no personally identifying information is written to the public ledger identity blockchains don’t need to do any ledger transactions at all. 
 
<p>Although harder to quantify, the energy saved from using a technology that enables you to trust information is also something that should be taken into account. You can build seamless, frictionless processes to take advantage of data that can immediately be verified and acted upon. This is what is happening in the energy industry use cases described in the Finance Magnates article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this saves time and money and mitigates error and fraud. So remember, when you hear the word “blockchain,” it’s not just about bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Give consumers a priceless asset: more time. Endless errands, work tasks and countless obligations big and small chip away at their free time and fill their schedules. Applying for a loan shouldn’t add to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To power a faster, better mortgage experience for consumers,&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">Freddie Mac’s Loan Product Advisor&nbsp;asset and income modeler (AIM)</a>&nbsp;continues to evolve, now including paystub data in addition to direct deposit data for income assessment. These cost-saving efficiencies provide increased rep and warrant coverage while continuing to meet Freddie Mac’s strong credit underwriting standards.</p>



 Open banking drives new mortgage capabilities 



<p>Using consumer-permissioned data from trusted third-party providers like Mastercard (with some services delivered through Finicity, a Mastercard company), direct deposit plus paystub increases the confidence in income calculations by matching digitized paystub data to borrower direct deposit history sourced from trusted providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Mortgage Verification Service</a> (MVS)&nbsp;supports this new AIM capability by providing direct deposit transaction data paired with digitized paystub&nbsp;data to fuel this innovative, data-driven approach. It identifies&nbsp;the income stream that matches the paystub, delivering accurate risk assessment results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assets, income and employment verifications are vital to mortgage lenders looking to verify borrowers’ finances. However, between unreliable results, miscommunications and paperchases, verifying assets, employment and income can be cumbersome. MVS helps borrowers get faster approvals with fewer conditions up front, allowing them to close and move into their homes faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“Partnering with Mastercard ensures we can deliver the best tools and insights the industry has to offer. This collaboration will assist lenders with quickly and easily obtaining income verification.”</p>Daniel Miller, Freddie Mac Single-Family Director of Strategic Technology Partnerships</blockquote>



<p>MVS can help lenders:&nbsp;</p>



 
 More easily assess borrower capacity/automate income calculations.&nbsp; 



 Reduce frustrations caused by paper submissions and re-asking for documentation to verify assets, income and employment.&nbsp; 



 Remove subjectivity and manual&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/docs/pdf/digital-innovation-drives-loan-quality.pdf">errors in processing and underwriting</a>.&nbsp; 



 Lower risk and probability of fraudulent activity.&nbsp; 



 Increase referrals by providing a better borrower experience.&nbsp; 
 



 Efficient assessment&nbsp; 



<p>AIM leverages consumer-permissioned data from open banking providers like Mastercard to better identify pay deposits using accurate and verifiable data that meets Freddie Mac’s underwriting standards. Lenders can automate the manual processes of assessing borrower assets, income and employment. This can improve the success rates for identifying income and employment by reading information provided on a paystub and verifying income transactions within a borrower’s bank account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Partnering with Mastercard ensures we can deliver the best tools and insights the industry has to offer,” said Daniel Miller, Freddie Mac Single-Family Director of Strategic Technology Partnerships. “This collaboration will assist lenders with quickly and easily obtaining income verification.”&nbsp;</p>



 How it works&nbsp; 



<p>Previously, direct deposits to a consumer’s bank account would qualify for rep and warrant assessment. With enhanced direct deposit and paystub capabilities, a borrower or a loan officer can upload a paystub and the technology will match the data on that paystub with the deposits from the borrower’s asset report, boosting the rep and warranty success rates and income gross-up.</p>



<p>The asset report can include 24 months of direct deposit transactional history and also includes income streams identified by the open banking platform. Now, with the added paystub capability, Mastercard can add a paystub report that can provide greater success assessing income through direct deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paystub report generated through MVS has two sections; the top section includes digitized paystub information. The bottom section is up to 24 months of income stream credit transactions only. These income streams are reconciled with the deposits shown on the asset report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an added bonus, the reduced cost of implementing MVS is reflected directly in the balance sheet. On average,&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/docs/pdf/digital-innovation-drives-loan-quality.pdf">up to 7&nbsp;days</a>&nbsp;can be cut off the processing time for each loan. The hours formerly spent by loan officers chasing down borrower documents are invested in higher-return work activities such as marketing and sales to drive additional loans.&nbsp;The new AIM capability will be available to Freddie&nbsp;Mac-approved Sellers using Loan Product Advisor beginning June 7, 2023.&nbsp;MVS is available via direct integration and ecosystem integrations including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com">ICE Technology</a>&nbsp;and Order Reports Service in the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/client-hub/">Client Hub</a>&nbsp;today. </p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Joni Brennan, President of the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC). 
<p>In episode 92 Joni Brennan joins Oscar to discuss how the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) are working to close the digital identity public trust gap – including the key findings from the DIACC’s 2022 research and how this can inform future policies, the issues with poorly designed solutions and the importance of balancing accessibility and ease with privacy and security within these solutions. As well as discussing how education and awareness can help bridge the gaps and what can be done within governance and policy to support digital identities, transparency and data control.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us on new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity and I’m super happy to bring a former guest back, she is joining for the second time. One reason is that there has been released, super interesting results on her research. Especially in a vast country like Canada.</p>
<p>So, our guest today is Joni Brennan. She is the president of the Digital I.D. and Authentication Council of Canada, DIACC. Building on more than 15 years of experience in identity and access management, innovation adoption and industry standards development. Joni helps the DIACC to fulfil its vision by delivering the resources needed to establish a digital identity ecosystem that accelerates the digital economy, grows Canada’s GDP and benefits all Canadians.</p>
<p>Joni builds diplomatic and impactful relationship and formalises strategic partnerships. She has participated in influential committees from organisations including SCC Data Governance Initiative, OECD, IEEE, OASIS, the ISO, among others.</p>
<p>Hello, Joni.</p>
<p>Joni Brennan: Hello, Oscar. Great to be back.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, welcome back. Super nice having you. So again, we are here to talk about digital identity. Even though some of our listeners might have heard you before, I think four years back. Please tell us about yourself and this journey that you have to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Joni: Well, thank you so much for the invitation. In terms of my personal journey in the world of digital identity, I think it’s been just a bit over 20 years now, working in this space. And really starting in the, and all of this career, in the non-profit sector. Working with private sector and public sector, helping to develop standards and frameworks. Particularly focusing on risk management frameworks now, that help to contextualise the way that standards and open source have been implemented. To help to manage risks and help decision makers and adopters to make better decisions about which kinds of solutions they would like to adopt.</p>
<p>So, it certainly has been a journey moving from classic identity federation and single sign on now to web3 and distributed ecosystems. So, there are some things that have changed, but then there are also some core foundational concepts and thematics that have stayed the same. It’s great to be here to discuss the topics with you today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. As I said, one of the main reasons to discuss is that there is a very interesting report. Actually, I have it here in front of me, it’s the – title; Canadian Digital Identity Research 2022. Of course, I am sure it has taken a few years to gather and process all this information. It is a very nicely designed document and also many of those findings were like, ‘Wow’. Super interesting how things are going in Canada and I’m sure some of these findings will be similar in some other countries as well.</p>
<p>So, we’d like to hear more deeply a few of these findings and what we can learn. If we start telling us some of these key findings from this report.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, thanks so much. I find the research to be interesting as well. The research – we’ve developed four consecutive years now of research, and so the latest report is the data from 2022. So, some things that are interesting about that, as well, is that we began to perform this research; before COVID happened, during COVID, and now arguably, I would say post-COVID or the next phase. So, it’s been interesting to see both kind of how the space is developed and how people’s perceptions have developed over that period of time. </p>
<p>One of the reasons that we’ve done this research is that we found that in the Canadian ecosystem there wasn’t this kind of ‘perspectives research’. We spend a lot of time working together as practitioners, whether we’re working with policy, technology or business processes. We’re often speaking with practitioners that are in the space. So, to have the opportunity to better understand and quantify the perspectives of people, who may not be practitioners. Maybe they do understand the space, maybe a little bit, maybe not so much. So, to have the ability to have a better perspective on what people are thinking, about the work that we’re doing, this is very valuable. And of course, putting people at the centre of the work that we do is a priority. So having these perspectives is quite important.</p>
<p>Because we’ve done this research annually over the course of four years. What we have done as well as we’ve asked some questions each year to have baseline, to have trend lines. To know, how has the perception changed, year over year, over the course of four years? Or maybe that perception has not changed, maybe it’s stayed the same over the course of four years. So, we’ve seen that timeline. That’s been an interesting feature. And then each year we have also customised some of the questions. So that, we could ask the questions of the participants that were, maybe, more specific to what was happening in the world at that time. So, I think it’s a great opportunity to see what people are thinking, both at a point in time and in over time.</p>
<p>Now, how did we perform the research? Well, the research has been developed through a third-party research firm, so they manage the sample, the participation sample. To make sure that it has diversity and that it’s really asking questions to Canadians across our country, from one side to the other. As well as, we have two official languages in Canada, French and English, so as well as making sure both official languages have been consulted. So, we’ve had some regional findings as well, as we’ve gone forward.</p>
<p>With that, maybe I’ll share some of the key findings from the survey.</p>
<p>So, what I would say is that when we started this survey four years ago, this research. We asked people, first of all, do they understand the words ‘digital identity’? And I can say that for the first three years, people did not. Less than half felt that they had somewhat understanding of the words ‘digital identity’. So, without assistance, they could produce a kind of, a definition of digital identity. Now, last year, the fourth year of our research, for the first time, we’ve seen more than 50% feel that they have some understanding of digital identity without being assisted.</p>
<p>So, while the findings, I would say, are arguably low. Meaning less than 50% had some understanding for years, one, two and three. There is a sign that education, and knowledge, and awareness has been growing over each year. Now with just over half understanding. So, it’s a good trend line, meaning that education and awareness has grown. So, I think that’s interesting. It also helps us to know what kind of language we should be using when we’re speaking with people, what they might understand or where more education.</p>
<p>Now, this year we also saw in 2022, we also asked people what was their perception of the impact that digital identity could have on their lives. And I think positive news, the impact more than 55% of respondents felt that digital identity had a positive impact on their lives. And really, this was to manage records, to be able to have electronic boarding passes, things that were really around convenience and doing business anywhere and everywhere. So, this is great news. So, people feel that there is a positive impact, more than half.</p>
<p>Now, that said, 23% do remain unsure about the type of impact that digital identity has on their life. And so now we see that the 23% this is a group that we need to focus on. So, they don’t know if digital identity will help them or if it will harm them. So, there we see – okay, this is a place where we can educate that 23% on; What are the privacy impacts? What are the security impacts regarding digital identity? And how can that improve their lives for the better? So that’s a place to spend some time for education.</p>
<p>Now, the remainder felt that digital identity had a negative impact on their lives. And we do know, of course, people are free to have perceptions, positive, unsure, negative, as they so choose. But we do know as well in the Canadian ecosystem, there has been quite a bit of misinformation and disinformation, mal information. And primarily that type of information is moving in what I would call unauthenticated spaces. So, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, places where information can become viral and sometimes that information isn’t verified. Sometimes it’s being spread by mistake and sometimes it’s being spread with bad intent. So, we know that that’s been a challenge in the Canadian ecosystem and that maybe part of the group that feels a negative impact in their lives.</p>
<p>So, our focus will be on the 23%. To help them to better understand the space so that they can make better decisions about their perception of the type of impact that digital identity can have on their life.</p>
<p>Now, we have also seen, year over year, for four years, we’ve collected some demographic information about the types of people who are responding, and the types of people who are most interested, and feeling the benefits most, and most interested to use digital identity or most interested to also learn more about digital identity. And year over year, the people who are most interested and most looking forward to the benefits that digital identity brings are what we call the caretakers. So, the caretakers tend to be parents who are taking care of children alone or dependents in their home. So, this could also be senior caretakers. Whether they’re in the home or outside of the home. So, these are people who are taking care, really caregiving in all aspects of their life as well as taking care of themselves.</p>
<p>So, these people have the most interest to use digital identity to help to manage their care, so primarily tracking health care records and school and government registrations, for example. These are seen as the primary benefits. And these are the people who are most feeling pressure to manage data, to manage access to data, and really need that extra help, that these types of technologies can provide people. The conveniences and the security that can provide people in their life. These are the people that I think is a great area of focus for the work that we do. Caregivers are also workers. Caregivers are also students. And so, in all aspects of their life, they feel that this is something that can help.</p>
<p>In the Canadian ecosystem as well, we do have some, what I would call paradoxes. Meaning we do also each year, year over year, ask people their willingness to share personal information online if it makes their life more convenient. And what we’ve seen over time is there has been a slight rise in people’s willingness to share their personal information. And so, for example, in 2021, 75% were willing to share information, personal information for convenience. That went up to 78% in 2020 to be willing to share personal information if it meant that they would have more convenience in their lives.</p>
<p>Now, that said, again paradoxically. The same amount of people just around 75% between 73 and 75%, also having the highest concerns about personal information being compromised. So, yes, while people are willing to share information for their convenience. They’re equally concerned about their information being compromised through identity theft or through hacking and through other means. So, we need to be aware that people are both feeling the desire for convenience, but they’re also very concerned along the way.</p>
<p>So, when we think about that 23%, again, who are unsure about digital identity. We can help them to better understand where digital identity can help people to manage their information and get convenience while protecting themselves online. I would say that this is a paradox, but also something that we can help. And we can support by working together with more education.</p>
<p>Now, year over year, for four years, we have also asked people about their preferences regarding the way forward on digital identity. So, what we’ve asked them is basically three options. Would people prefer public sector and private sector to work together on a framework? On an approach, a collaborative approach of public sector and private sector. We’ve also asked them would they prefer government to move alone and take the lead? Or would they prefer private sector to move alone and take the lead?</p>
<p>And I can say that year over year and in fact, we’ve seen growth to 71% of respondents. They believe that collaboration is the best way forward of the public and private sector. And their thoughts on that for why is because they felt that public sector and private sector, by working together, would have more checks and balances on each other. To make sure that each was behaving with the best interests of the client, the customer, the citizen. They really like that collaborative approach, and that’s grown over time up to 71% in the last year.</p>
<p>Now, typically year over year, the people who prefer only government to take the lead or only private sector to take the lead has been a bit of a split. Tends to be around 17% wanting one or the other to go the pathway alone. And in this year, this last year we actually saw a little bit of a change in that research where, for the first time, the preference for public sector was private sector.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of a lower preference this last year for public sector to go alone. So, the finding was 12% prefer the government only to take the lead, with 17% preferring that private sector only take the lead. And I think this is actually – if people have reviewed the Edelman’s Trust Barometer and trust overall as a trend globally in the public. There does seem to be an erosion of trust in large institutions and in new technologies as well, we should say. So, seeing the trust in government a bit lower this last year, I think maps as well with the global trending lines that we’ve seen in the Edelman Trust Barometer research as well. So not entirely surprising and common with what we’ve seen around the world.</p>
<p>Now, unsurprisingly, we’ve also since as we started, we’ve done this research before COVID, during COVID and now post-COVID ecosystem. And while we were in the middle of the pandemic challenges, we asked people if the requirements of the pandemic made people feel that it was more important for them to have access to digital identity that was secure and trusted and privacy enhancing. And people felt absolutely, 66%/67%, over the two years that we asked that question. People thought; Yes, COVID was driving a need for that secure and privacy enhancing digital identity capabilities. So, of course, we think about working from home and social distancing, so people absolutely connected the benefits of digital identity with the things that we were going through at the time.</p>
<p>We also have asked some questions, and I’ll share actually what I think is one of my favourite findings right now. And then we’ll talk a little bit more about some specific capabilities. But I think for me my favourite finding over the last two years has been we asked people ‘do they want to have access to personal information that’s issued and collected about them by public sector and private sector, and do they want the ability to use that information?’ So, we’ve asked that question for two years now, and actually we’ve seen the highest numbers we’ve ever seen on our research over four years regarding this question.</p>
<p>And so, people responded overwhelmingly, 92%, that they want to know and have access to data that’s issued and collected by our federal government and by our provincial or jurisdictional governments in Canada. And so, what this says to me is that – while the words ‘digital identity’ are challenging for people to understand. What exactly does this mean? When we asked people, do they want personal data control and transparency right away without a lot of education, very high number, 92% want to have access control to personal data.</p>
<p>That was followed very closely by 87%. So, they want that same access and control, 87% of data that’s collected by the private sector. So, I think, again, right away, emotionally, people understand personal data control. It’s something they demand no matter what their background, their culture, their politics, their region. Everyone wants to have transparency and control to data about themselves. So, I think that’s just a fantastic finding. And rarely have we ever seen in fact, never have we seen numbers that high in our research.</p>
<p>Now, I share this finding because I think it very much sets up some specific capability finding around digital wallets, something that’s an emerging space. So, whether we’re thinking about the concept of the digital wallet or a trusted container of some sort. Over the last two years, we’ve asked questions specifically about digital wallets, concepts around digital wallet to work. There’s a degree of personal information sharing and personal information control that has to happen. So that’s why I wanted to set that up with that primary finding.</p>
<p>So, over the course of the last two years, we have seen the familiarity of the concept; What is a digital wallet? We’ve seen that rise. And so, the first year that we asked it was 54%. And it’s actually gone up to 59% in the last year of the research. So, people are understanding the concept of the digital wallet. What it is, what it means and why it’s important to them. When we’ve asked people about their use of digital wallets in 2021, we saw around 38% of people reported that they were using some kind of digital wallet and that rose to 41% in 2022, of respondents saying that they were actually using digital wallets.</p>
<p>And so, of those digital wallets, the highest usage recorded was of the Apple wallet. And so, in 2022, roughly a quarter, 24% were using the Apple wallet, with the remainder of the usages on wallets being spread, Samsung Pay was the next highest and then third-party wallet providers after that.</p>
<p>Why are people using digital wallets? They really like contactless payment, less clutter and less concerned about losing their cards, their plastic or physical cards. They feel that these are the benefits of using a digital wallet. So again, the setting up this ecosystem for personal data control. So, whether it’s the type of wallet that we might be familiar with, on the phone or some kind of trusted container or network. This all requires the ability to share information and to have data control. This is something that people are demanding without a lot of education.</p>
<p>So, all in all for the audience, I would say is – be aware that your customers and your clients, they may be challenged to understand, what those words ‘digital identity’ means. They may have different ideas. Among them, what the words ‘digital identity’ means. And so, there’s some education that can be done likely with your audience, and particularly for us, for our ecosystem. Again, we’re focusing on that 23% and really educating them about the privacy and the security protection that can be found, that can be achieved by using digital identity capabilities. And so that’s the place that will focus as we continue to move forward in our ecosystem in Canada.</p>
<p>And I think it’s reasonable to say that it’s probably a similar finding around the world. We might see some differences for countries that are a bit more advanced. But I do think we’re going to find some commonality, in each region around the world. And even within our customers, whether we’re thinking about their personal lives and their personal transactions. Or the way that they manage their data at work or at school. I think these findings are very valuable no matter what the lens or the ecosystem that we’re looking at.</p>
<p>So hopefully the audience will find that information helpful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, quite revealing many of the very useful facts that you have. Just share with us. Actually, one of the first one, the understanding or awareness of the concept itself of digital identity. Is quite revealing that you have evidence that it has grown. So people are understanding more. The concept is getting more familiar.</p>
<p>So, I don’t know how you ask them, but I guess you ask them to elaborate, right? So, you understand – ‘What is digital identity – and people have to elaborate in their own words.</p>
<p>Joni: We just ask them; What do you think digital identity is? So, we ask them to try to produce a definition that the research asked them. And then we measure, were they very confident, were they are able, with their definition, accurate. Or were they not confident and did they need some help? And so, at that point in the research, depending on their ability to answer the question about what they believe digital identity is. There would then be a degree of assistance. If they weren’t sure they’d be provided with a definition, so that they could then move forward in the rest of the research with a common understanding as they answered more questions going forward.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very well done. And the other thing you mentioned one paradox, so people are more willing to use the digital identity solutions, but at the same time, I’m more concerned about the privacy issues or protecting their data. So that’s also very interesting is good in old census because people are using more tools, but at the same time consciousness is increasing.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, I think for me at least, I think that this finding really is part of a call to action to say identity management practitioners who are working together to identify the risks, to mitigate the risks, to provide better solutions for citizens, clients, customers and residents. We really are responsible to move forward together in this space in a way that’s designed around people where benefits, managing their risks and their needs.</p>
<p>Because without the work that we’re doing, they’re going to take part anyway. Maybe they’re going to take pictures of their driver’s license or send me an email. And I know I have you’re not supposed to do this. But sometimes when you need to get what you need to get to on the other side of the transaction, you do what you have to do, right? So, I think we’ve all been there. So, I think this is a call to action for us to continue to work together to provide people with the option so that they can do what they need to do in a safe and secure way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. In Canada, there is a major public sector within Canada, actually there are two tiers of public sector, right? Provincial and the federal government. So, I understand that each of them makes their own solutions, and there is a private sector. So, there are like, let’s say three main developers, the creators of details in these solutions. Have you found solutions that were not properly designed and what was the effect of those?</p>
<p>Joni: In the Canadian ecosystem we do have jurisdictional governments. We have our federal government, which is a collaborative, all of us working together. And then we have provincial governments and territorial governments as well. Then of course as municipalities. So, we have the different layers of the governments and then we have the different private sector industries. And some of those industries are federally regulated like finance, and some are not.</p>
<p>So, what makes that space interesting as well is that when it comes to your legal instantiation for who you are, this is really spread out in Canada. And so, if you’re born in Canada, your legal instantiation for who you are is with your jurisdiction where you were born. If you immigrated to Canada, your legal route of your identity sits with the federal government.</p>
<p>So really the federal government is in fact a very large customer of digital credentials or digital verification. Unless you’ve immigrated. But if you’ve not emigrated like the majority of Canadians, then the federal government is a customer there to know who you are. So there does need to be a collaborative. And I would say that both in the public sector and in the private sector. It’s very important to focus on all of the element’s – trust and risk management, convenience of use. And if solutions are poorly designed, then it leaves people not happy with the experience and not trusting the experience.</p>
<p>So, whether we’re using a solution from public sector or private sector, it’s also very important to do the user testing and the alpha testing and the launch to see how were people experiencing the service? Were they able to produce the information that they needed to produce to take part in this service?</p>
<p>Because that user experience, we only have a small opportunity to create a delightful, secure experience with the people that are using the services. So poor design or in fact, it may be great design from a technical perspective. But without doing that user experience testing and finding that people’s – their emotion and how they felt while they were using the service wasn’t there. That can lead to a low adoption, low trust, and people will feel that and they will sense that and maybe they don’t come back to the solution again. Or maybe they feel, ‘oh, this was terrible’ and they tell other people.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it can’t be stressed enough that as you’re designing, public and private sector, to really work with your small set of users to see; how are they experiencing the solution? In addition to, of course, the priorities. Making sure that it’s safe and secure and using data minimisation. And all of those techniques that we would want to use for privacy and have in service.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes and related to that, and checking now the picture. We can see that they said the majority of Canadians believe that both government and private companies should work together to create a digital I.T framework. And I can see in the three years where this survey has been executed, it keeps growing. That’s the feeling of the public. That the collaboration needs to be strong. So how is that resonating with the ones who create the data services?</p>
<p>Joni: It is an interesting finding, right? And I do think it’s interesting to how people seem to hold the governments a little bit more accountable. The higher percent. So, 91-92%, they want that access to that data. I was in fact surprised that it’s a little bit lower expectation for the private sector. Around 87%, still close but a little bit lower.</p>
<p>And I think what that means is something that we all experience ourselves as well, where one person, no matter what, you know, in our lives, we Oscar is Oscar and Johnny as Johnny. Sometimes our person is work business, school, sometimes we’re a patient with our doctor. So, we have these different experiences within our lives. We are the centre of all of them. Us being at the centre is a priority to making sure that as we move through these different solutions and services, we are the constant. And we can then use data and present data as we’re moving through those contacts of the type of transaction that we’re trying to provide. And so, while let’s say for example, quite often we’re asked to show government issued ID.</p>
<p>Now, we know that we need to be able to authenticate, we need to have a verified identity and we need to be able to authenticate in a verified way to government to say, okay, this is data about us, and we want to use that data. Yes, but quite often we don’t log into government necessarily, maybe every day. Maybe if we’re at a certain phase in our life or a certain time of the year, yes, we do authenticate the government, but more often than not, we’re using that government issued data, that government issued credential to open a bank account or to go onto an aeroplane or check into a hotel.</p>
<p>So, the areas where the data about us that has different levels of verification, whether that’s our driver’s license, which for us is a provincial or territorial credential. Or a passport, which is a federal credential. Or maybe something like a verified address for the bank that we’ve been banking with over the last five or ten years.</p>
<p>Where becomes very interesting is, again, the constant in all of those equations is that there’s one person at the centre of them. And so having that collaborative, it’s very important to bridge the gap to not only are you, as a government, solving the primary use case, that is your most priority. Maybe it’s how do I authenticate the government or you as a bank are solving your use case. How do I authenticate you to access your financial information? Really, people need to traverse across both of those contexts and across many different contexts.</p>
<p>So, collaboration is the way forward and people do get that sense. And as you said that desire for collaboration has really grown over time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay, excellent. So, you are having, say, perceiving that – I’m sure you talk very often with people from all the governments. Plus, people from the private sector then, in the country. So that’s something you are already perceiving.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, absolutely. And of course, each group of stakeholders. If it’s a good government or like finance or credit networks or other. Each group has their priority use cases. And one of the things that we look at in our ecosystem in the DIACC is what are those common use cases we’re most concerned with. Really, where those ecosystems work together. Where we’re using government issued credentials to open a bank account, for example. That’s a great use case because the financial institutions want to lower their Know Your Customer anti-money laundering costs. We bring these types of government credentials into a physical bank all the time. So how can people use those credentials digitally? And how can each party be sure that the right level of risk is managed? And that’s where we focus on DIACC.</p>
<p>So, for us, use cases that centre around Know Your Customer anti-money laundering, they’re very powerful use cases. There is a global framework on Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering, and this is a place where we always see collaboration between public and private sector is an important feature. That’s one of the areas where we see a lot of commonalities, for example. Not the only area, but definitely one of the areas where that commonality exists.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, this research is super fascinating indeed. I will ask you a final question, for all the business leaders that are listening to us now. What is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Joni: I would say that this research should be used as an additive tool. It’s all available. And so, if you’re an English speaker or a French speaker, it’s available in our website, DIACC.ca. I would also say that one of the things that we focus on within the DIACC. Because we are not developing the technical standards or the technical open-source code for the methodology for how to move forward. What we’ve developed is a very high level and prescriptive risk management framework. And so, one of the things that we see in our ecosystem is that; a single solution that is one size fits all doesn’t map to the ecosystem, really. Ecosystems are living things and sometimes there’s more security needed, sometimes less. There are different conditions. </p>
<p>So, I would say for one activity for people, business leaders who are listening today is to; try to evaluate your risk. Maybe you already have. Evaluate the types of risk that you have within your ecosystem. And then look at something like our Pan-Canadian Trust Framework or risk management framework to determine, be sure that you are managing the risks that need to be managed to ensure that there is a duty of care that is set out. How do your customers expect to be cared for? How do your partners expect to be cared for? When they’re interacting with a solution or service. And then make sure you’re mitigating those risks.</p>
<p>We provide one tool, The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework. As a tool to help people measure and make sure that they’re mitigating risks in a verifiable way. And this helps decision makers to then adopt solutions today, while looking forward to knowing where and how these solutions might interact. Should I interact with another ecosystem? Are they managing risk in the same way that I am?</p>
<p>Whereas the technical solution for; Do I need to transform this data model? The software engineers I have all the confidence and the software engineers to solve. How do we transform from one data model to another? And using tools like risk management frameworks, like the pan-Canadian trust framework. Can help you to know, should you be looking at how you interact with different sets of credentials or different solutions or different ecosystems?</p>
<p>So, know your risk, manage your risk. Do your duty to care for your customers, clients, citizens and residents. And the rest of the ecosystem will evolve as it does. And we’ll continue to work together to make sure that people are at the centre. Privacy is enhanced and that people have transparency and control in this evolving and emerging digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent and for our listeners, we’re going to put in the show notes, the links to this research. So you can find it from there, from the show notes. Thanks a lot, Joni, it was a really interesting conversation. So let us know how people can follow this conversation with you or find more information all the work you’re doing.</p>
<p>Joni: Thanks so much, Oscar. Yeah, it’s been a real pleasure. I’m so glad to be back. I really appreciate the work that you’re doing with this podcast, having very interesting and insightful conversations. For people who would like to continue the conversation with us. You can find us at DIACC.ca. That’s our website. And then we do a lot of sharing and conversations in our LinkedIn group. Which you can find us at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mydiacc/">The Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada</a> in our LinkedIn Group, which is quite active.</p>
<p>So, we’d love to connect with you and continue the discussion from today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay. Fantastic. Again, thanks a lot, Joni. All the best.</p>
<p>Joni: Thanks, Oscar.</p>

<p>Fission co-founder and CTO <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a> shares how UCANs simplify authorization while keeping it decentralized and preserving user agency.</p><p>When we think about authorization, an image of a central authority determining what a person is and is not allowed to do comes to mind. In technology, this translates to authorization servers checking a list to see if the person has the correct permissions to access a service.</p><p>Even on the decentralized web, this still occurs. For example, if a user is on a machine that isn't running an IPFS node, or the IPFS node they are trying to access is asleep, the only way they can access the namespace that that IPFS node is managing is to log in through some other mechanism. The same goes for many edge apps or dapps. They create a point of centralization, even in a mostly distributed system.</p><p>But what if we got rid of the authorization server entirely? What if the user acted as their own auth server? Then we would have decentralized auth. This is where UCAN comes in.</p> Capabilities <p>There are two ways to handle authorization - access control lists and capabilities. </p><p>Access Control Lists are designed for when users are sharing a terminal. Think of a shared computer register where each sales associate logs in and out of the machine to tie their transactions to their individual profile. </p><p>Properties:</p>  Stateful Auth - There is a user, a gatekeeper, and a service. The gatekeeper determines if the user can access the service according to the list.  Pro - There are three clear stages in the process.  Con - Neither the user nor the service is in control. They have no agency, and all the data is centralized in one list.  <p>Capabilities are designed for networking.</p><p>Properties:</p>  Stateless Auth - There is a user who has an address (pointer) to the service they are trying to access and a cryptographic token that says that they can access the service.  Pro - The user and service are in control.  Pro - All the required info is in the token. We can make copies of the token, share those copies with others, and revoke access to copies if we choose. Access can also be set to expire after a certain timeframe has elapsed.    UCANs vs DIDs - DID you know UCAN have both? <p>How are UCAN tokens different from DIDs?</p>  DIDs are building blocks inside of UCANs!   DIDs say who you are. They give you a public key, and you can prove you're allowed to sign (AuthN - authentication)  UCANs say what you can do (AuthZ - authorization)   The UCAN Token <p>The UCAN comprises three main components: The JWT Header, the Payload (which includes the issuer / a DID - and proofs / CIDs), and the Signature (which must match the DID in the issuer).</p><p>The proofs demonstrate what capabilities the user has access to. The capabilities include a resource (for example, a path to a document), read or write access, and other extensible fields, like an email address.</p><p>The best part, we can delegate authority without sharing keys, making the process much more secure!</p> What UCAN do with UCANs <p>Authorized Data Retrieval - When you make your files shareable, UCAN ensures no unauthorized users can request them. In other words, unless you have a valid UCAN, you can't download a content address.</p><p>Apps - UCANs are used to delegate write access in <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">WNFS</a>, and WNFS, in turn, is used in many different apps like FxFotos and Fission Drive to manage files.</p><p>Authorized Channels - If you'd like to set up a group chat or gossip with specific peers, you will want a way for folks to prove that they are allowed to be in that channel so they can be admitted. Giving peers a shared capability provides them with that proof. </p><p>Decentralized Compute - We're using UCANs in <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a> to power distributed pipelines and collaborative processes.</p> IPFS Thing 2023 Presentation <p>Watch Brooklyn's full presentation below:</p><p><a href="https://noti.st/expede/Ykh5xH/ucan-decentralize-auth#sSWVwVc">Brooklyn's Presentation Slides</a></p><p>If you'd like to learn more, UCAN visit the <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">GitHub working group</a>, check out the UCAN validator on the <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">community site</a>, or even play a fun <a href="https://ucan.lol/">adventure game</a> to see UCANs in action!</p>

<p></p><p>Recently on the blog we talked about why<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers"> decentralized identifiers </a>(DIDs) are a practical solution to real problems. <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/practicality-of-decentralized-identifiers">In that post</a> we discussed some high-level concepts behind how and why DIDs could solve many of the identity and data problems we face today, but today let’s dive deep on a specific problem set DIDs could solve: parental controls and minors’ digital security.</p><p>It’s an inescapable reality for parents today that their kids will be online. There’s no avoiding the reality that minors are going to consume a diverse array of content and interact with others on the internet, but parents do want to have a say in what’s put in front of their children. Digital safety is already incorporated by some services - such as Netflix - and platforms - like iOS - but universal parental controls and safety monitoring don’t presently exist. That could change, however, via DIDs and a concept known as DID controllers.</p><p>Before we dive into how DIDs can facilitate universal parental controls, it’s fair to acknowledge that giving adults the ability to have such control over minors may represent a potential risk to those minors’ freedoms. While that is absolutely a valid concern, it’s also true that regardless of DIDs or Web5, as a society we are pushing forward towards a future with more sophisticated parental controls. Federal lawmakers recently <a href="https://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHhYEbJQr-2FOms0-2Budh-2FjizGqQjBZ-2F-2Fr1OqtAW5Vk-2Fh5nDTBbGXewV1rTmTAQ8J-2FnHutGze-2FZdRujL0z-2BT7TPQq2rMPP57Ry7H581UcM0jJNpbmEdo_JY5fc7bPIFJAvDYWnO7d4p-2FX8FAV-2BsZ9F4kAeTjyMnD-2BG0K2bZ0-2FUf-2BuopiaAntAAkVBHDuQJAFvEBGYqFHT51-2FSOTDJz-2B8jhQIBwTwwfjU6PpsWQkmsRZ-2FHGMwJynKK9gXf8AtDP1YE6sEYYtMtmmDlG6CvQMea0rUNVpY-2FTuOKnGNSHlL9NK2Jk0q4-2FRpQ-2BbFtdlnhiQK67JNVXPiMBWqgHoT-2FNCfxxr-2F4bbdre3UHJXnBVp4xhgpxhidBEbUjonDeOsX9WuX1m9sAXLuuDylpr6dFaUbCX7V9cjRoJcnvuSBxBCwsyz0eXjWABCQjrAy9oqfdT13fwQv3bIrZGwi4hMa7GsMULwMU-2BKacfPI2kJLSHpJVUvTj0CZluT9SEPpZc9wYkLrSqv2BgqnbOZJ7IEA2ZR7oNF91e94HvIaC4j-2BaatuJDdofN1Qyqph57vfWyKDAUWfEKruDuKv7ecdo-2BsRt4-2B7nt9ljpyuTRmSS458UlBFpp4g2s9qHyc0FXVVo4C3KZLpSWPmsT58L-2BObuk46zQ4wSPr-2B7SqxnCCx-2BoK4Ttt0AhCjjxnitNriSjzZgupScdseXH00RSO3rOmi1G295urhUXfGvnevAqZh2CKf-2F3fPEn5uA9-2BNDOSVhZB-2BUEqZmRd8ND43TkEmHRQ-3D-3D">introduced</a> a bipartisan bill that seeks to establish a national minimum age for posting on social media, signaling this direction in public policy. The “Protecting Kids on Social Media Act'' would ban platforms like TikTok, Snap, and Instagram from letting kids younger than 13 create accounts — and require platforms to get parental consent to open accounts for users under 18. </p><p>With things like government-run age verification and limitations on tracking minors, it’s very clear that minors will experience restrictions and the infrastructure to enforce those restrictions is coming. In this post, we’ll cover how Web5 could provide the implementation of that system.</p> DID Controllers and the Controller Paradigm<a title="Direct link to DID Controllers and the Controller Paradigm">​</a> <p>Every DID is a string representation of an entity - the subject - that is described by a DID document enumerating things like cryptographic public keys and delegate/controller patterns. Those patterns allow for another DID, the controller, to make changes to the DID document. So what does this all mean for parents?</p><p>Minors are constantly interacting with new digital and physical services that carry age restrictions or limitations. For example, it’s generally viewed as a good thing when platforms censor certain content from being viewable to those under 18. While these types of constraints are generally tied to age and state-issued licenses, those forms of identification can be forged and circumvented and offer no entry point for parents to intervene. A DID controller model, however, allows for parents to intervene at an identity level to place appropriate restrictions on their children.</p> Parents of a DID Child: A Case Study<a title="Direct link to Parents of a DID Child: A Case Study">​</a> <p>Imagine Alice and Bob welcome their new daughter Carol into the world, and at birth she’s assigned a DID over which Alice and Bob are made controllers. Immediately, whenever anyone tries to resolve Carol’s DID and obtain her DID document, they’ll see that Alice and Bob’s DIDs are controllers over her DID. As Alice and Bob check their daughter out of the hospital, there’ll be a million pieces of paperwork to fill, but proving their identity will be easy so long as they provide proof that they own the DIDs that are controllers over Carol’s DID.</p><p>As Carol starts to take her first steps, Alice and Bob enroll her in daycare. Wanting to be certain only Alice, Bob, and their parents can pick up Carol from daycare, Alice and Bob edit Carol’s DID document to ensure that the “daycare” or “supervision” <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/protocols">protocol</a> only allows for Carol to be picked up by the specified DID-holders.</p><p>With Carol growing older, she may begin to want to explore more shows and media than the educational programs her parents put on for her. Alice and Bob may want to allow Carol to explore the internet on her own a bit, so they give her access while restricting her usage. For now, she’s only allowed to visit YouTube with some strict parental filters they’ve set at her DID-level, so that even when they graduate her to more websites she does not accidentally stumble onto content they don’t want her seeing. Additionally, because they’re controlling her DID and not just her account on a single service, any service that accepts that DID and communicates over the protocols that they’ve specified will honor the restrictions they’ve placed on their daughter. For example, let’s say Alice and Bob want to always restrict videos that contain violence from being viewable by Carol, and do so by specifying that videos with violence should be blocked according to a universal video content moderation protocol. Then, all content platforms that respect the universal video content moderation protocol should automatically block that content!</p><p>With her teenage years coming on, Carol may be tempted to stay up late and message her friends, but mom and dad know that Carol needs her sleep. Bob and Alice could, as controllers, restrict her access to her texts after 10pm with the exception of a few critical family members.</p><p>Finally, when Carol does age out of her parents’ home, they can relinquish their controllership or even set it to expire at a given date. This parental use case is perfect for Web5 as it showcases how open, universal protocols, a decentralized web, and DID controllership enable improved and seamless experiences over our currently fractured, standardless web.</p><p>If all of this sounds interesting to you, join us in building Web5 by checking out our <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub</a>, including our growing <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/">web5.js SDK</a>, where you can find and collaborate on the tools we’re creating to build the next web.</p>

  MiCA aims to regulate crypto, but its stand on DeFi remains&nbsp;unclear.  “Compliant DeFi” is becoming a topic on the rise while user security becomes a priority.  The regulatory applicability of MiCA varies based on the degree of decentralization in DeFi services.  <p>Markets in Crypto Assets, which is popularly known as MiCA, came as a proposal from the European Commission on 24th September 2020 with an objective to bring crypto-asset issuers and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under one regulatory framework. After significant deliberation and consultation between EU member states, it has been finally voted to enter into force as of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>On 16th May 2023, the council introduced an EU-level legal framework by adopting a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/05/16/digital-finance-council-adopts-new-rules-on-markets-in-crypto-assets-mica/">regulation</a> on Markets in Crypto Assets. The new rules covered utility token issuers and the issuers of asset-referenced tokens and “stablecoins.” Additionally, it took trading venue providers and crypto-asset wallets under its ambit. However, no specific mention of the DeFi crypto-assets.</p><p>The EU-wide regulatory framework that MiCA aims to introduce as of next year is rather broad in its scope and requires a rather thorough understanding.</p> Crypto-Assets and Businesses Covered by&nbsp;MiCA <p>In assets, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">MiCA</a> applies to asset-referenced tokens, including commodity-backed or currency-backed stablecoins, e-money tokens, and other tokens, including utility ones. E-money tokens are usually stablecoins backed by a single fiat currency, while utility tokens include protocol tokens, access tokens, loyalty tokens, and community tokens.</p><p>In businesses, MiCA applies to crypto asset service providers who deal in custodial wallets, exchanges, crypto-asset advising firms, and crypto-portfolio management agencies or managers involved&nbsp;therein.</p><p>A custodial wallet is a virtual asset wallet that stores both the users’ assets and private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>MiCA might also apply to NFTs if the NFT — by its founding nature — is similar to the asset types that MiCA covers. Many NFTs serve as utility tokens or financial instruments at their core. MiCA might also consider large-series NFTs to be fungible and ask for authorization.</p> Crypto-Assets and Businesses Not Covered by&nbsp;MiCA <p>In May 2023, a document came into public titled “Remaining Regulatory Challenges in Digital Finance and Crypto-Assets after&nbsp;MiCA.”</p><p>As requested by the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), the document said that, in principle, MiCA applied where the overall financial services regulation did not apply. It led to the non-applicability of MiCA to crypto-assets that qualified as financial instruments and were regulated by other EU financial law instruments. Such assets include security tokens or electronic money (excluding e-money&nbsp;tokens).</p><p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/740083/IPOL_STU(2023)740083_EN.pdf">ECON document</a> also highlighted that “partially decentralized” finance services came under MiCA’s scope, while “fully decentralized platforms” that acted without intermediaries fell outside the scope of&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>However, the ECON document could not yet decide how to deal with gaps where solutions like DeFi came under conditional supervision. And it is where the need arises for a deeper understanding of MiCA’s intricate relationship with DeFi solutions and instruments.</p> DeFi and MiCA: An Intricate Relationship <p>Whether MiCA is fit to regulate DeFi is a contested topic. DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is not a legal or technical term.</p><p>According to researchers, Decentralized Finance may include multiple elements of multiple tenets, including decentralization, distributed ledger technology, smart contracts, disintermediation, and open&nbsp;banking.</p><p>Decentralization is seen as a countermodel to traditional finance, where power centralized in the hands of a few powerful intermediaries would be replaced by technology.</p><p>However, whether DeFi comes fully under the ambit of MiCA is a function of the decentralization status of the DeFi solution.</p> Compliant DeFi: A Notable Development <p>As discussions about the intersection of DeFi and regulation unfold, the notion of “Compliant DeFi” has garnered increasing attention. This term refers to DeFi systems designed with regulatory considerations in mind, aligning decentralized protocols with existing legal frameworks.</p><p>While the essence of DeFi rests on decentralization and democratization, it doesn’t inherently resist regulatory structures. The objective remains to construct an equitable and accessible financial system. For some, this mission could involve adopting regulatory measures to safeguard participants and uphold the integrity of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>In the context of Compliant DeFi, protocols might integrate mechanisms to align with guidelines related to Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, and other regulatory criteria, while upholding the decentralized nature of blockchain-based systems.</p><p>It’s crucial to note that the emergence of Compliant DeFi doesn’t mandate a particular direction for the evolution of DeFi. It represents a trend, not a dictate. It is one of the diverse paths that DeFi innovation might take, combining traditional financial safety measures with DeFi principles.</p><p>However, the broader DeFi ecosystem continues to explore a variety of solutions, each with unique perspectives on the intricate balance between decentralization, democratization, and regulatory compliance.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/compliant-defi-the-way-out-of-commingling-clean-and-illicit-funds-in-a-decentralized-finance-economy">Compliant DeFi — the way out of Commingling Clean and Illicit Funds in a Decentralized Finance&nbsp;Economy</a></p> Fully or Partially Decentralized: That is the&nbsp;Question <p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/740083/IPOL_STU(2023)740083_EN.pdf">ECON document</a>, which is the latest to come out from the most appropriate authorities in this regard, explains the current situation by saying that “partially decentralized services are in scope of MiCA, while MiCA exempts (only) fully decentralized services in crypto&nbsp;assets.”</p><p>Afterward, it points towards an anomaly, where legal entities claim themselves to be fully decentralized to avoid transaction risks but “develop and maintain, directly or indirectly, the platform and market its services.” However, the legal entity continues to serve as an “infrastructure provider and sales intermediary.”</p><p>In this regard, the ECON document analysis poses a crucial question, “is this intermediary function sufficient to apply&nbsp;MiCA?”</p> Is the Rationale Driving Regulatory Leniency for “Fully Decentralized Services” Adequate? <p>There are ‘fully decentralized’ lending platforms that create an asset pool from various users prior to lending. It could be seen as liquidity centralization, similar to what a trad-fi institution — such as a bank — does.</p><p>Fully decentralized platforms also see a concentration of influence at a governance level. While studies point towards evidence of developers and founders retaining control over their protocols after the Initial Token Offering, there are developers who receive compensation for their stack development and maintenance efforts.</p><p>Keeping these inconsistencies in mind, the ECON document advocated for “including fully decentralized platforms in the scope of EU financial regulation and harmonizing thresholds across EU financial, legislative acts.”</p> Regulatory Challenges of Decentralization <p>Be it partial decentralization or full, intensified decentralization, some challenges exist.</p><p>Concepts related to private ordering must possess legal certainty. These include concepts pertaining to property rights, title-based asset separation, segregation, tracing, and lawsuits. The current EU financial regulations also lack legal certainty in these&nbsp;aspects.</p><p>There is also a lack of clarity concerning the functioning and governance of crypto ecosystems. The final barrier arises in the form of cross-border enforcement and supervisory cooperation issues.</p> The Road&nbsp;Ahead <p>Effectively incorporating decentralized services into the MiCA regulatory framework necessitates a thorough understanding of the intricate concept of decentralization.</p><p>Given the diversity and novelty inherent in fields like decentralized finance, it is crucial to comprehend the associated risks.</p><p>A risk-based approach, focusing on mitigating potential harm to users, is more productive than an approach merely targeting the nature of the service. Whether platforms are partially or fully decentralized, risks associated with technological incompetence could emerge. Accordingly, regulation should address root causes rather than merely managing the symptoms or outcomes.</p><p>Various risks may arise depending on the level of decentralization. These could include issues related to leverage in crypto lending or crypto staking and risks that AML/CFT provisions must mitigate.</p><p>Consequently, it would be both prudent and efficient to focus less on the degree of centralization in a DeFi solution and more on identifying and eliminating risks at their&nbsp;source.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is an EU law regulating electronic payment services within EU states and the European Economic Area (EEA). </p>
<p>As economic ties between the EU member states become more binding, it is important that citizens and businesses in these regions have laws to help streamline banking, eCommerce, and security. </p>
 The Evolution of PSD2 and Financial Security Regulations in the EU 
<p>Developed in 2018, this regulation was intended to streamline payment security and tech development throughout the regulated area. </p>
<p>PSD2 compliance follows its predecessor, the First Payment Services Directive (PSD1). PSD1, adopted in 2007, established modern rules applicable to all payment services in the EU. The goal was to make cross-border payments standardized and simplified without sacrificing security.</p>
<p>PSD1 was a step in the right direction but had several limitations. It did not cover all payment services or implement effective customer authentication or identity verification methods. The development of PSD2 introduced new consumer protections and promoted innovation in security and the open banking movement.</p>
<p>Some of the key parts of PSD2 compliance include:</p>
 
 Open Banking: Under PSD2, banks must provide access to open APIs so that third-party banking providers (TPPs) can build additional financial services on top of that infrastructure.  
 Third-Party Providers (TPPs): Speaking of TPPs, PSD2 introduces new types of regulated service providers that can manage payments or mediate interactions between cardholders and payment processors.  
 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA): PSD2 also introduces more rigorous requirements for customer authentication during electronic transactions. This process is known as Strong Customer Authentication, which generally requires at least two independent authentication elements from the customer. 
 Increased Consumer Rights: PSD2 also enhances consumer rights in several areas, including reducing liability for non-authorized payments, introducing an unconditional refund right for direct debits in euros, and banning card surcharges. 
 
 Who Has to Follow PSD2? 
<p>PSD2 compliance applies to various organizations, including traditional banks, credit institutions, electronic money institutions, payment institutions, and certain fintech companies. The directive introduces rigorous requirements for these organizations, such as enhanced customer authentication measures and the need to open access to customer account data for third-party providers (with the customer’s consent).</p>
<p>Some of these organizations include:</p>
 
 Banks and Credit Institutions: Traditional banks and credit institutions must comply with PSD2 regulations. This includes providing access to account information and payment initiation services to third-party providers (TPPs) where the customer has given explicit consent. 
 Payment Institutions: This refers to institutions that have been granted permission to provide payment services but which are not necessarily banks. These institutions might offer services such as money remittance, execution of payment transactions, and issuing/acquiring payment instruments. These include TPPS, Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) and Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs).  
 Card Issuing and Acquiring Institutions: Organizations that issue debit or credit cards to consumers or process payments for merchants must also comply with the PSD2 regulations. 
 Other Financial Institutions: Other institutions involved in the processing or receipt of payments, including money transfer operators and certain types of mobile network operators, may also have to comply with the directive. 
 
 What Can Happen When You Don’t Comply with PSD2? 
<p>PSD2 compliance is mandatory for all applicable entities operating within the EEA, marked into law by the EU and participating countries. Organizations that fail to comply with the PSD2 risk financial penalties of up to 4% of annual returns.</p>
<p>Note that PSD2 applies to transactions where both the payer’s and payee’s service providers are located within the EEA using EU currency. </p>
 How Can Organizations Meet PSD2 Requirements? 
<p>Meeting PSD2 requirements often involves significant changes to an organization’s operations, technology, and business model if they still need to be prepared to implement secure payment technologies. </p>
<p>There are a few key areas where organizations can focus their efforts to maintain PSD2 compliance:</p>
 
 <a>Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)</a>: SCA requires that authentication use two independent factors related to MFA verification: something the customer knows, something the user has, and something the user is.  
 Open APIs: Banks and other financial institutions must provide access to their customer’s accounts via open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to allow third-party providers (TPPs) to develop new services. These APIs must enable TPPs to retrieve account information (if the customer consents) and initiate payments directly from the customer’s account. 
 Transparency and Communication: Organizations need to provide clear information about all transactions, ensuring complete transparency with the customer about any applicable fees, charges, and the timeframe for transactions. This includes information related to incidents of fraud. 
 Data Security and Privacy: Organizations must protect data confidentiality and integrity, including implementing rigorous data security measures and ensuring PSD2 compliance with other applicable laws and regulations, such as GDPR. 
 Registration and Licensing: Certain organizations, such as PISPs and AISPs, must register with their national financial regulator and may need a license to operate. 
 Fraud Monitoring and Reporting: PSD2 requires service providers to establish a framework for the monitoring and reporting fraudulent transactions. 
 
<p>It’s also worth noting that EU member states may have slightly different laws, requiring different applications based on the jurisdiction.</p>

 In recent years, soft mobility has seen explosive growth, particularly in major cities as a means of urban transport. Whether it’s electric bikes, scooters or self-service electric scooters, micromobility is seen as an environmentally-friendly and practical alternative to traditional modes of transport. However, the way it is regulated is being called into question. Some countries now require age verification of users for greater safety. 



 The future belongs to soft mobility. 



<p>Walking, cycling and even electric scooters are increasingly popular means of transport in major cities, and are referred to as “soft mobility” or “active mobility.” Why is this so? Soft mobility is seen as a solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion and promoting health and well-being.</p>



<p>Many cities around the world are turning to soft mobility or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">shared mobility</a> to meet these challenges. Dedicated self-service vehicles have appeared in urban centers in recent years. Governments and companies are also encouraging this transition to more sustainable modes of transport by offering tax incentives, subsidies and user benefits.</p>



<p>Although people are increasingly turning to these modes of transport and services are improving all the time, there are still challenges to be overcome if soft mobility is to become widespread.</p>



 What are the challenges for soft mobility? The example of electric scooters in Paris. 



<p>One of the main challenges facing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">shared mobility is safety</a>. Users of these modes of transport are more vulnerable to road accidents, particularly in urban areas with heavy traffic. Cyclists and users of electric scooters are often confronted with obstacles, so it is crucial to regulate the use of these services. For example, by ensuring that a user is not too young to hire an electric mode of transport, or that they <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">actually have a driver’s license</a> to use a scooter.</p>



<p>The laws and regulations governing the use of micromobility services vary considerably from one country to another, and even from one town to another. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/parisians-vote-on-banning-e-scooters-from-french-capital">Scooter use in Paris</a> is a concrete example of how the lack of clear regulation can undermine the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/micromobility-and-the-future-of-transportation/">future of micromobility</a>. Since the arrival of self-service electric scooter operators in the city, streets have become more congested, raising safety concerns for pedestrians and other road users. In response to these challenges, municipalities have introduced stricter rules for operators, including limits on the number of scooters available and parking requirements. However, it is not certain that this will be enough.</p>



 
   
     
                     The state of micromobility regulations in 2023 
                     Industry leaders debate the current regulatory framework for micromobility and the best ways of balancing safety with innovation and accessibility. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/state-of-micromobility-regulations-in-2023/">Watch now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


 Age verification: what do European regulations say about the use of electric scooters and bicycles? 



<p>There are currently no specific EU regulations for micromobility. However, the European Commission is encouraging coordination between Member States to develop harmonized rules and ensure responsible use of these modes of transport. Some countries have already adopted specific national regulations for micromobility, while others have incorporated these modes of transport into their existing legislation on motor vehicles.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F35470/0_0?idFicheParent=F308&amp;lang=en#0_0">France and Belgium adopted specific regulations in 2019</a> to govern the use of self-service electric scooters. These include speed and age limits for users, as well as insurance and parking requirements. It stipulates that <a href="https://www.connexionfrance.com/article/French-news/France-raises-minimum-age-for-using-an-electric-scooter">users must be at least 14 years old to use a service</a>. Spain subsequently applied the same framework in 2020.</p>



<p>Although electric scooters are considered to be motorized vehicles in many European countries, in the same way as cars and motorbikes, it is not currently necessary to have a driver’s license. Only an identity document may be required to ensure that the user is of legal age to use the service. However, with the ever-increasing number of accidents and non-compliance with parking regulations, it is conceivable that the rules will eventually be tightened.</p>



 What resources should be put in place to provide a better framework for soft mobility services? 



<p>To rent a scooter or electric bike in Marseille, you will now need to scan your identity card and perform facial recognition. The ID card will be linked to the credit card used on the user’s account, thereby helping to combat credit card fraud and provide a better framework for the use of these services. If users are easily identifiable, they will be less inclined to break the parking rules (e.g. don’t use sidewalks, don’t leave your scooter in a red zone, etc.).</p>



<p>Remote identity verification is increasingly seen as an effective solution for supervising micromobility services, but also for ensuring the safety of users by reducing dangerous behavior such as drinking and driving or speeding. By having information on users, operators can inform the authorities in the event of an offense.</p>



<p>In the long term, it is conceivable that a driver’s license could be required as a supporting document when subscribing to a micromobility service, as is currently the case for car-sharing or car-pooling services. Operators need to be on the lookout for new regulations and ensure that their services are compliant and safe for their users.</p>

			<p>June 6th, Luxembourg – <a href="https://defactorlabs.com/">Defactor Labs</a>, a trailblazing DeFi lending platform for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), proudly announces the launch of tokenizing $100 million worth of Alpha Bonds, using the ERC3643 token standard to enforce compliance on the Polygon Network, to lend capital to SMEs using real-world assets (e.g., receivables) as collateral.</p>

			<p>SMEs are often subject to the same stringent lending criteria as large corporations by traditional banks. This can impede their ability to secure funding, limit their potential for growth, and hinder their competitiveness. Defactor Labs aims to address these challenges via tokenized Alpha Bonds to bridge the $1.5 trillion USD global funding gap to ultimately better cater to SMEs’ funding needs worldwide.</p>
<p>In traditional investment practices of bonds, the transparency surrounding traditional bond instruments has often been obscured, accompanied by lengthy settlement cycles and cumbersome manual processes. On the contrary, the Alpha Bonds create unparalleled transparency, efficiency, and instant settlement through tokenization. Moreover, the Alpha Bonds are compliantly distributed to a global network of audiences to allow eligible investors to digitally subscribe and purchase these digital bonds with an e-commerce-like experience that leverages the benefits of tokenization.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the secondary trading of Alpha Bonds is enabled due to them being issued on the ERC3643 standard. With ERC3643, the compliance rules are embedded into the digital securities, where investors have the opportunity to achieve liquidity by trading their Alpha Bonds with eligible counterparties without a middleman — a possibility that has historically been unattainable. This increased liquidity further strengthens the appeal and viability of these innovative investment instruments.</p>
<p>Defactor Labs, in collaboration with <a href="https://cms.law/">CMS</a>, a globally renowned law firm with 78 offices across 40 countries, have chosen Luxembourg as the jurisdiction to issue the digital bonds. While CMS provides legal guidelines and documentation, <a href="https://blackmanta.capital/">Black Manta Capital Partners</a> provides a BaFin broker-dealer license and marketplace, powered by <a href="http://tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>‘s ERC3643-based tokenization engine for Defactor Labs. These partnerships streamlined the launch of the Alpha Bonds to allow Defactor Labs to focus on their core businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, the effectiveness of the Alpha Bonds has already been proven through their pilot projects. These projects have already facilitated $30 million in transactions and successfully financed $2M in the past three months, emphasizing the practical viability and reliability of their approach, with no defaults recorded.</p>

		 
	 
    Launching Alpha Bonds is a monumental milestone for not only us at Defactor but for the worldwide network of SMEs. Our goal has always been to create a truly inclusive global economy with access to liquidity for all. With this partnership with Tokeny and Black Manta Capital Partners, they are the missing pieces we needed to ultimately fulfill our goal. We are excited to officially launch Alpha Bonds and allow investors to earn a return, while at the same time helping SMEs to grow around the world.  Alejandro GutierrezCEO and Co-Founder of Defactor Labs       Tokeny, as the technology partner of Defactor Labs, is excited to contribute to bridge traditional finance to DeFi through the launch of 'Alpha Bonds'. By leveraging the ERC3643 standard to tokenize $100 million worth of bonds, Defactor Labs aims to not only allow institutional investors to compliantly access DeFi, but also provide them with liquidity options in an open network thanks to ERC3643 protocol’s on-chain compliance nature.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny       Traditional finance is in a constant state of transformation, and we at Black Manta Capital Partners believe that an important part of the financial market will be permissioned decentralized finance. The ‘Alpha Bonds’ project, as Europe’s first institutional grade DeFi product, lays the foundation for bringing real world assets into the DeFi space, and we are delighted to be working with Defactor Labs and Tokeny to bring this innovative product to market.  Alexander RapatzFounding &amp; Managing Partner at Black Manta Capital Partners

<p>New services and checks for use cases regulated by the FCA and UKGC</p>



<p>Munich, June 6, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, announces the expansion of its platform to include fully automated document liveness capabilities, data checks and Financial Risk Checks as well as new fraud prevention features. The platform expansion will also include a central, no-code workflow management tool.</p>



<p>Document liveness checks to combat the most sophisticated fraud attempts</p>



<p>The automated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">document liveness check</a> relies on IDnow’s expertise in video analysis and requires the end user to record a video of their ID document, thus enabling an automated check on the visible security elements of the document, such as holograms. This feature helps companies in their fight against the rising risk of fraud through forged documents.</p>



<p>Fully automated KYC and AML services with data checks</p>



<p>IDnow’s new fully automated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) services, the latter of which screen against multiple global <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> and Sanction lists, ensure real-time AML compliance at the onboarding stage while allowing ongoing&nbsp;monitoring to confirm compliance post-onboarding.​ Fintechs, crypto providers and more traditional financial service providers can benefit from a complete alert management functionality and audit history&nbsp;with tailored alert matching.</p>



<p>The new data checks enable a frictionless KYC process&nbsp;which takes just a&nbsp;few&nbsp;seconds, particularly&nbsp;for&nbsp;use cases regulated by the UK’s&nbsp;Financial Conduct Authority (<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">FCA</a>) or by the UK Gaming Commission (<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/">UKGC</a>). However, they also add&nbsp;an additional layer of security&nbsp;to protect businesses around less regulated use cases, for example, in the mobility industry.</p>



<p>Additionally, the latest platform expansion also includes Financial Risk Checks that use public third-party and self-declared data.&nbsp;These provide gambling companies with insight into affordability indicators which protect online gamblers and comply with the latest updates to the UK Gambling Act, helping businesses to avoid potential fines and reputational damage. The public and third-party data allows for ongoing monitoring of changes in player circumstances and verification of reported income without the need for additional documentation.</p>



<p>A single platform to access data sources and orchestrate KYC workflows in real-time</p>



<p>These new data check capabilities are added to IDnow’s single platform, thus allowing customers to orchestrate both data checks and document- and biometric-based identity proofing workflows. Data checks are required by the responsible regulatory bodies, document and biometric checks can be added for other sensitive use cases for an extra layer of security.</p>



<p>The AML services and real-time data checks are easily configurable via the online self-service orchestration portal which offers complete control to IDnow’s customers. It lets them tailor and optimise data checks and document-based identity verification in one intuitive dashboard via drag-and-drop functionality, thus providing a single entry point for all the new integrated services.</p>



<p>Proprietary fraud prevention technology and a high level of compliance</p>



<p>To detect single and serial fraud attempts, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">IDnow’s platform</a> uses proprietary fraud prevention technology that collects risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources. In addition, IDnow regularly collaborates with law enforcement agencies, providing the company’s dedicated fraud team with the latest knowledge of fraud techniques and methods from around the world.</p>



<p>Bertrand Bouteloup, Chief Commercial Officer at IDnow, said: “With the help of our AI-powered engine, which employs the latest fraud prevention capabilities, we can combat the most advanced fraudsters and allow our crypto, fintech and financial customers to grow their businesses with confidence and be a strong partner for large financial institutions at the same time. Our document liveness feature is clearly a game changer in this market.”</p>



<p>“We are pleased to be able to enhance our platform offering, specifically in the UK, to help our customers fight fraud, achieve compliance and build trust across Europe and beyond. Thanks to these new functionalities and our strong regulatory expertise, our customers can easily expand their services and rely on a&nbsp;platform that achieves&nbsp;compliance according to the&nbsp;most rigid regulatory&nbsp;requirements within the UK, the EU and beyond.”</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 22nd May to 4th&nbsp;June <p>Welcome to the latest edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, keeping you up-to-date with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency regulations.</p><p>In the last fortnight, we’ve seen global bodies and economies make strides in crypto regulation.</p><p>IOSCO has proposed the first global crypto-asset market regulation, whereas the World Economic Forum is advocating for regulatory cooperation, illuminating the complexity of the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>In the face of these changes, Georgia, too, is bolstering its crypto-friendly reputation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong and UAE’s central banks are uniting to push the envelope in digital currency and fintech cooperation.</p><p>Let’s not wait any further and dive straight&nbsp;in.</p> A Global Journey Towards Unified Crypto Asset Regulation <p>The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is steering the ship toward the world’s first unified regulation of crypto asset markets. This move, catalyzed by the collapse of the FTX exchange, aims to quell a wide spectrum of industry issues, from market manipulation to customer protection.</p><p>The call for a harmonized regulatory framework resonates across the crypto industry, compelling regulatory bodies such as the US SEC, Japan’s FSA, Britain’s FCA, and Germany’s BaFin to rally alongside IOSCO. As these bodies collaborate and invite public feedback, a clear regulatory vision may begin to&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>Elsewhere, the European Union has recently concluded its comprehensive crypto regulations, nudging nations like the United States and Britain to follow suit. And amid regulatory uncertainty, India is hedging against potential risks, having implemented a new tax policy on crypto&nbsp;gains.</p><p>Amid all these, an intriguing alliance has formed between the Central Banks of Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates, united by a shared vision for crypto regulation and fintech development. Notably, Hong Kong granted retail investors access to crypto trading services on June&nbsp;1st.</p><p>Echoing these global movements, Georgia strides ahead with new crypto regulations, setting the stage for compulsory supervision of Virtual Asset Service Providers from September 2023. This initiative is part of the country’s aspirations to become a global crypto hub and fortify against money laundering.</p><p>From the think tank realm, the World Economic Forum has recognized the urgency for global coordination in crypto asset regulation. Through a paper exploring the inherent challenges and suggesting best practices, they add another layer to this global dialogue on crypto regulation.</p><p>Now, let’s analyze two of the biggest news from the world of crypto regulations over the last two weeks and decode their impact on crypto users and the broader ecosystem.</p> Decoding The World Economic Forum’s Take on Crypto Regulation: A Mixed Bag for the Crypto Ecosystem? <p>The World Economic Forum, in collaboration with its Digital Currency Governance Consortium, recently published a paper articulating the urgent need for global cooperation and regulation of crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>While emphasizing the avoidance of regulatory ambiguity and inconsistent enforcement, the paper sheds light on the challenges the current regulatory framework faces, particularly its failure to align seamlessly with the crypto ecosystem’s unique characteristics.</p><p>The paper’s analysis of the issues is meticulous, exploring the complexity added by crypto mixers, self-hosted wallets, and decentralized exchanges. It asserts that such elements, when coupled with the crypto sector’s growing interconnection with traditional finance, escalate the potential contagion risks, necessitating a robust regulatory response.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1662148287875498012?s=20">Image Source</a><p>The paper also breaks down regulatory frameworks into understandable categories, such as outcome-based regulation and risk-based regulation, and highlights the emergence of an “agile regulation” approach involving a multi-stakeholder effort.</p><p>Illustrating this, the paper cites Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority’s agile regulatory practices.</p><p>However, the paper does critique the “regulation by enforcement” approach prevalent in the United States, arguing that it obstructs meaningful dialogue around the regulatory framework.</p><p>So what does all this mean for crypto users and the wider ecosystem? A global regulatory framework might offer clarity for crypto users and businesses, simplifying cross-border operations. Agile regulation, in particular, could nurture continued innovation and growth in the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Global cooperation and the sharing of best practices could simplify the regulatory landscape, offering a fair playground and increasing overall stability. This could lure traditional investors and institutions, encouraging mainstream acceptance of the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>On the flip side, the push for regulation could clash with the crypto community’s privacy values. Regulation might also stifle innovation, especially for smaller entities struggling with regulatory compliance.</p><p>A global regulatory framework risks centralizing power, contradicting the decentralization that many crypto assets champion. Striking a balance between fostering innovation, maintaining user privacy, and ensuring market stability is the challenge at hand. This crucial juncture for the crypto ecosystem will shape its future direction.</p> Banking on Crypto Regulations: The Cross-Border Partnership Between Hong Kong and the&nbsp;UAE <p>The collaboration between the central banks of Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) promises to enhance financial cooperation, particularly in cryptocurrency regulations and fintech development. This partnership has wide-ranging implications for crypto users and the overall ecosystem.</p><p>With harmonized regulatory measures, investors could gain confidence due to stronger consumer protection and reduced risk of fraud. This cooperative approach might encourage other countries to develop aligned rules, promoting regulatory consistency for global investors.</p><p>At the same time, tighter regulations can pose challenges. Crypto creators might find a complex regulatory environment daunting, possibly resulting in slower growth in the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Additionally, new rules could conflict with the basic principles of decentralization and anonymity that define cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The central banks’ commitment extends beyond regulation to fostering fintech development. Joint initiatives and knowledge-sharing could stimulate innovation, creating a positive cycle that advances the industry.</p><p>Through this collaboration, both Hong Kong and the UAE can draw on each other’s strengths to enhance their financial ecosystems.</p><p>Still, there could be potential pitfalls. Development might lean towards the strengths and interests of these two countries, limiting the breadth of fintech innovation and possibly restricting the applicability of these solutions in other&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Navigating the complex landscape of cryptocurrency and fintech, the partnership between Hong Kong and UAE central banks offers an intriguing case&nbsp;study.</p><p>The outcomes will likely have a profound influence on how these areas evolve in the future, not just within these countries but potentially on a global&nbsp;scale.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan to Enforce Crypto Travel Rule from June&nbsp;1st</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">MiCA Paving the Way: From Liability to Transparency</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1664701122714521601?s=20">May Monthly&nbsp;Overview</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 At Identiverse 2023, the narrative around removing the password has reached inevitability: it’s not if or how, it’s when. Unsurprisingly, passkeys were a common theme because they’ve achieved the two requirements for finally pushing the 62-year-old password into retirement: They’re faster than a password and they are easier for the user.

<p>At Identiverse 2023, the narrative around removing the password has reached inevitability: it’s not if or how, it’s when. Unsurprisingly, passkeys were a common theme because they’ve achieved the two requirements for finally pushing the 62-year-old password into retirement: They’re faster than a password and they are easier for the user.</p> 
<p>In the recent <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-security-report">State of Passwordless</a> vol 3, we showed that 45% of Security decision makers think that improving the user experience is the reason to go passwordless. Users have discovered an incredible number of ways to get around security they find irritating (I’m looking at you,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vaydeer-Undetectable-Multi-Tracks-Simulate-Realistic-dp-B093WN48SD/dp/B093WN48SD/ref=dp_ob_title_ce"> Mouse Jiggler</a>).&nbsp;</p> 
 Adding Pain With Number Matching  
<p>Given Microsoft’s recent announcement that Authenticator will now mandate<a href="https://www.itpro.com/security/cyber-attacks/microsoft-authenticator-mandates-number-matching-to-counter-mfa-fatigue-attacks"> number matching</a>, we’re likely to see even more focus on the experience. The new policy requires that the numbers in a user's password match exactly with those on their registered mobile device. (You can see a video demo<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhyRpB5xv-A"> here</a>.) This has led to a layer of complexity in the authentication process. Users now have to remember not just a password, but also ensure that certain numbers correspond to those in their personal devices. While<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf"> CISA’s guidelines</a> for moving to phishing-resistant MFA respect number matching as one way to get to phishing-resistance, the experience is pretty challenging.&nbsp;</p> 
 Adding Pain With Complexity?  
<p>We’re going to see another level of complexity added to passwords with the implementation of the 2024 PCI requirements. Password length and complexity requirements drive users nuts. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) 2024 password length requirement is a perfect example of how security measures can impact user experience. With the updated requirements requiring a minimum of 12 characters for passwords, users are being forced to remember more complex and lengthy credentials. While this might enhance security, it will also lead to frustrated users, increased password reset requests and significant account lockouts. Fortunately, the PCI 2024 requirements also acknowledge FIDO and that this can serve as one or more of the factors required for authentication.&nbsp;</p> 
 FIDO and Passkeys to the Rescue  
<p>So where does this leave us given that both of those changes are designed to address the ability of hackers to use automated attacks <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">to bypass traditional authentication systems</a>? This is why FIDO has developed so much market momentum, particularly around passkeys. First off: a passkey is any FIDO credential. If you’ve been using FIDO for years, you’ve been using passkeys, it just has a new name.</p> 
<p>Passkeys offer a more streamlined experience for users by reducing the need for remembering complex passwords. The good news is that with Apple, Google, Microsoft and a number of the password management solutions offering to support synchronized passkeys, it’s increasingly easy for companies to adopt passkeys and for consumers to use them. It’s soon going to be as natural as anything that we do to authenticate on our phone today.&nbsp;</p> 
 The User Experience Holy Grail  
<p>From a user experience point of view, passkeys can help us to achieve the holy grail: having an authentication experience that is simpler and faster than passwords. HYPR not only supports passkeys through our app, we also provide what Apple, Google and Microsoft don’t — the servers and infrastructure required for organizations to authenticate based on passkeys. Beyond that, we also offer Enterprise Passkeys: passkeys bound to a single device with the controls that enterprises need to feel confident that they have control of their credentials and authentication strategy.</p>

It has also been crossposted on the blog of our project partner, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/category/climate/">mysociety</a>.</p>Rodborough Common,&nbsp;Frome Month 1 <p>We wrapped up <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2023/03/30/neighbourhood-warmth-monthnotes/">our first instalment of monthnotes</a> with thoughts on how to tackle our overarching enquiry:</p><p>“How can we support communities to organise locally around a simple and achievable home energy&nbsp;action?”</p><p>Since then we’ve been sculpting <a href="https://neighbourhood-warmth.staging.mysociety.org/">the skeleton of a digital service</a> that we’re planning to test in June. Currently it outlines the benefits of collaboration and enables neighbours to connect with each other, by forming&nbsp;teams.</p> Questions lead to questions <p>You may have noticed that our timescales have slipped a bit! After an initial burst of brainstorming we spotted an impending crunch and decided to extend our partnership for another month. This provided breathing space to organise workshops. And it allowed us to unpack a few questions that are bubbling up as we revisit the drawing board and&nbsp;iterate.</p><p>Here’s a&nbsp;flavour:</p>  How can digital technology facilitate purposeful connection, and on what basis (eg proximity, housing type, tenure, existing relationships or motivations)?  What mechanisms enable teams to form, evolve and progress together?  How strongly do we want to encourage a particular sequence of&nbsp;actions?  <p>As we crumble these and related questions into more granular design decisions, we’re regularly referring back to the research questions in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u46mfXRYYdzpxWi5d40-Yb-f86FxL5z8AT_zEhyPegM/edit#heading=h.u9dfvp64qkns">our plan for this Alpha phase</a> to maintain focus. We’ve made strides on the first three, and our attention is now turning towards the remaining two:</p>  How a service like this could signal demand to the council or to retrofit organisations, to help build the supply of retrofit finance and services in an&nbsp;area.  How a service like this could connect residents with suppliers for services across parts or whole of the retrofit&nbsp;journey.   I’m gonna get myself connected <p>We’ve also been laying <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVhoGaWMBPpVNND2AXnu4gvdM4OTVnPhyFi6eJmru8Y/edit?usp=sharing">foundations</a> for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LWGJJz3P3Hl17DdO2VOp8xaSb3kQ-lz2VOno8KC0Faw/edit?usp=sharing">co-design workshops</a> that we’ll use to test and learn with communities in Frome, Birmingham and hopefully at least one more location. Due to their distinctive characteristics, these communities allow us to run parallel experiments.</p><p>In Balsall Heath, John Christophers is at the heart of a community-led effort to make the most of government funding that involves <a href="https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/">Birmingham City Council</a>, <a href="https://www.mecctrust.co.uk/">MECC Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.midlandsnetzerohub.co.uk/">Midlands Net Zero Hub</a> to name a&nbsp;few.</p><p>And in Frome, thanks to funding from <a href="https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/funding/programmes/climate-action-fund-programme">The National Lottery’s Climate Action Fund</a>, the town council has partnered with the <a href="https://www.cse.org.uk/">Centre for Sustainable Energy</a> so that <a href="https://www.frometowncouncil.gov.uk/mayor-of-frome-welcomes-free-energy-advice-home-visit-session/">its Healthy Homes team can advise residents</a>.</p><p>We’re interested to see how people’s perspectives on Neighbourhood Warmth may be shaped by these diverse contexts, histories and experiences. By shining light from different angles, we hope their responses will help us to resolve some of the questions that we’re still grappling with.</p><p>Thanks to generous engagement with fellow travellers on the road to community-led retrofit, our thinking continues to be stimulated in the meantime. Thanks to everyone who read and shared our previous monthnotes, and made time to meet in the&nbsp;interim.</p><p>In relation to the research questions above, we’re honoured to have been invited to drop in to the <a href="https://ukgbc.org/">UK Green Building Council</a>’s local authority retrofit forum. This is a golden opportunity to share our work with council officers. We’re curious to know how a richer picture of home energy action could bolster their efforts to support residents. If Neighbourhood Warmth provided a clearer view of demand, how could that help in the development of local supply chains? And zooming out a bit further, we’re exploring the potential for knock-on benefits at regional and national levels with the <a href="https://www.wmca.org.uk/">West Midlands Combined Authority</a>.</p><p>As always we’re all ears. So if you have thoughts please get in touch via <a href="mailto:climate@mysociety.org">climate@mysociety.org</a> and <a href="mailto:info@darkmatterlabs.org">info@darkmatterlabs.org</a> and spread the word so that we get more feedback.</p>

 We sat down with our Sales Director, Olivier Artus, to discuss the PVID framework, its impact on the financial market, its evolution over time and its implementation at IDnow. 



 What will the PVID certification mean for the financial market in practice? 



<p>The PVID certification offers a clear and precise reference for all remote identity verification players on the French market. It allows financial market players to integrate a certified solution of substantial level into their process, which will make the entry into a relationship consistent with a face-to-face equivalent. This is the first time that the French authorities that regulate the financial services market have proposed a solution, integrating biometrics, that is 100% compliant with the Monetary and Financial Code (CMF), without having to add any additional measures other than ID and biometrics.</p>



 What will the PVID standard add to the remote identity verification process? 



<p>The real difference is the instant compliance of the entry into the relationship. Until now, the use of biometrics in a transaction, although secure, had no substantial value, i.e. was not recognized or certified by an authority. Thanks to PVID, we finally have a solution that offers a face-to-face equivalent, in line with the requirements of the regulators.</p>



<p>In addition, the PVID standard makes it possible to offer online access to unbanked populations. Thanks to the certification, it is no longer necessary to add additional measures such as the first payment by bank transfer, for example, which is less inclusive and often a source of failure or even cost. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">use of biometrics</a> is now recognized as a full complementary measure.</p>



<p>The rules imposed by traditional financial institutions for opening an account have made the entry into a relationship a real challenge. If we had had a PVID standard at the time of the health crisis, for example, traditional banks would have been able to do even more business securely and therefore more transactions.</p>



 Will all players in the financial sector be affected by this certification? In particular the crypto players, the fintech world… will everyone be on the same page? 



<p>All players subject to <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr/">ACPR</a> and <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/regulation/regulation-homepage">AMF</a> regulations will now be able to include a biometric entry path in their solution: credit institutions, personal and capital insurance, fintech, payment institutions, etc. Some other sectors will not be immediately affected by PVID, such as property and casualty insurance, which does not have a KYC obligation as it is not considered a risk area.</p>



<p>Other sectors of the financial sphere such as issuers of prepaid products and so-called credit FinTechs will obviously be interested in the development of such solutions to enhance trust when entering into a remote relationship.</p>



<p>As far as crypto is concerned, the AMF in France has defined the PSAN status (Service Provider on Digital Assets) in order to better supervise the market players and requires for this the implementation of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">complete KYC path</a>, including identity verification. This is equivalent to the PVID process for banks. More globally and in order to harmonize the European crypto regulatory landscape, it is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets)</a> regulation that will enter soon, still with the objective of protecting investors and preserving financial stability.</p>



<p>The first beneficiaries of the PVID standard will therefore be banks, neo-banks, payment institutions and credit players. What is important to remember is that players who are not directly concerned by PVID will be able to accelerate their insertion into the market and strengthen confidence in the construction of a customer relationship, thanks to this type of standard.</p>



 What will be the benefits of a PVID certification for financial market participants? 



<p>The last two years have seen a significant increase in cases of online identity fraud. In our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">latest Identity Fraud Trend Report</a> we found a 144% increase in the use of fake identity documents between November and December 2021. PVID certification strengthens traditional remote identity verification solutions, and improves the fight against identity theft through the use of biometrics.</p>



<blockquote><p>Beyond the fight against fraud, the challenge of the PVID standard is to fight against financial crime during remote identification, and therefore money laundering. This involves identifying the origin of funds and the destination of funds. The PVID process completes the financial institution’s AML/CFT system.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



 Do you think that the arrival of PVID will increase confidence in the market? 



<p>Of course. The primary objective of PVID is to strengthen the trust between the financial institution and the customer when subscribing to a service or opening an account.</p>



<p>The end customer will go through a process that is based on a public repository published by a recognized government agency, which represents an additional element of trust for him. For its part, the financial institution will rely on an expert company that provides it with a solution certified by the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ANSSI</a> to a substantial level with regard to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">European eIDAS regulation</a>, in order to verify the authenticity of the identity of the customers it deals with.</p>



<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/solution-pvid/">PVID standard</a> adds control points to identity documents. The dynamic capture of the document allows the detection of security features that cannot be verified in static mode. Then, a manual analysis completes the automated verification of the captures. It is carried out by operators trained in fraud who check, correct and give a final verdict on the user data in less than 5 minutes.</p>



 What, in your opinion, are the challenges to encourage the adoption of this new type of standard? 



<p>The first challenge is the user experience, which must be simple, intuitive, fast and perfectly integrated into our customers’ acquisition flow. The use of a mobile phone in the context of a long-distance relationship can be a barrier for less technophile users. For this reason, we offer an omnichannel pathway (on smartphones, tablets and computers). Our PVID certified pathway offers an intuitive, step-by-step guided experience to simplify the identity verification process for the user, for high conversion rates.</p>



<p>Furthermore, citizens are becoming increasingly vigilant about the handling of their personal data. Here again, our solutions are compliant with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Our solutions and all processed data are securely hosted in Europe and we have our own infrastructure. Thus, we guarantee the complete confidentiality and protection of all shared data and analyses performed.</p>



<p>In addition to the user aspect, we also have a duty to support financial institutions in learning how to use the solutions and optimize their processes.</p>



 In terms of geography, who will be affected by PVID? And in your opinion, will this certification evolve? 



<p>From a technical point of view, the solution will initially apply to the entire French market under the aegis of the ACPR. As France is a recognized financial center, it is likely that the PVID process could also be recognized as compliant in other EU countries in the context of remote entry.</p>



<blockquote><p>It can be assumed that this regulation will continue to exist and that it may evolve from a functional point of view. Optional modules may be added to the solution to suit different countries and local regulators.</p>Olivier Artus, Senior Sales Director Global Financial Services </blockquote>



<p>In the context of the emergence of digital identity and identity wallets, our near future will be to rely on a PVID certified solution for the creation of a recognized digital identity of substantial level.</p>



 What is the status of certification at IDnow? 



<p>We have never been so close to being PVID certified. We are at the end of the certification process, so we hope to be able to announce this very soon.</p>

A SAID is uniquely and cryptographically bound to a serialization of data that includes the SAID as a component (or field) in that serialization.</p><blockquote>Note 1: Serialization is defined as a process of translating a data structure or object state into a data format that can be stored, transmitted, and reconstructed at a later&nbsp;time.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: In KERI, all identifiers are SAIDs. For example, Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) are SAIDs of their associated key inception events. Identifiers of Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs) and their schemas are also&nbsp;SAIDs.</blockquote> Content-Addressability <p>An identifier that is content-addressable is based on an encoded cryptographic digest and is, thus, cryptographically bound to the content that it identifies.</p> Self-Reference <p>An identifier that is self-referential appears within the content that it is identifying.</p> SAD (Self-Addressing Data) <p>SAD (Self-Addressing Data) of a SAID is defined as a representation of data content from which the SAID is derived. The SAID is both cryptographically bound to (content-addressable) and encapsulated by (self-referential) its&nbsp;SAD.</p><blockquote>Note: the example SAID above starts with the character “E”. This is a CESR character code that specifies that the SAID is generated using a Blake3–256 digest.</blockquote> SAID Protocol <p>A “naive” cryptographic content-addressable identifier is not self-referential. This is because the naive cryptographic derivation process of a content-addressable identifier is a cryptographic digest of the serialized content. Changing one bit of the serialization content will result in a different digest. Therefore, a self-referential content-addressable identifier requires a special derivation protocol.</p><p>The generation and verification protocol of a SAID—which makes it both content-addressable and self-referential—is outlined with an example&nbsp;below:</p>  Here is an example of a python dict with the empty field&nbsp;“said”.   {<br>  "said": "",<br>  "first": "Sue",<br>  "last": "Smith",<br>  "role": "Founder"<br>}   Serialize the data into JSON with no extra whitespace.  Replace the “said” field value in the serialization of data with a dummy string # of the same length as the to-be-generated SAID. Here, we use a Blake3–256 digest with 44 characters.   {"said":"############################################","first":"Sue",<br>"last ":"Smith","role":"Founder"}   Compute the digest (Blake3–256) of the serialization that includes the dummy value for the “said”&nbsp;field.   EJymtAC4piy_HkHWRs4JSRv0sb53MZJr8BQ4SMixXIVJ   The value of the “said” field is now replaced with the computed and encoded SAID to produce the final serialization with embedded&nbsp;SAID.  The final serialization may be converted to a python dict by deserializing the&nbsp;JSON.   {<br>  "said": "EJymtAC4piy_HkHWRs4JSRv0sb53MZJr8BQ4SMixXIVJ",<br>  "first": "Sue",<br>  "last": "Smith",<br>  "role": "Founder"<br>} <blockquote>Note: The SAID protocol preserves the insertion ordering of its content. That is, it preserves the order in which elements are added to a data structure</blockquote> Advantages of Using&nbsp;SAIDs <p>Here are some advantages of using SAIDs over other types of identifiers:</p>  SAIDs facilitate greater interoperability, reduced ambiguity, and enhanced security in the management of&nbsp;data.  A cryptographic commitment—such as a signature, digest, or another SAID—to a given SAID is essentially equivalent to a commitment to its associated serialization.  Any change to the serialization invalidates its SAID thereby ensuring secure immutability and evident reasoning with SAIDs about serializations or equivalently their&nbsp;SAIDs.  SAIDs facilitate immutably referenced data serializations for applications such as Verifiable Credentials and Ricardian Contracts.   ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) <p>An ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) is a variant of the Verifiable Credential (VC) that is designed to be used with other protocols in the KERI ecosystem.</p><p>ACDC or Authentic Chained Data Container has the following meaning:</p>  Authentic: ACDCs are authentic using digital signatures that are signed and verified by keys associated with&nbsp;AIDs.  Chained: ACDCs may be chained together as a directed acyclic&nbsp;graph.  Data Container: A data container is a serialized data structure of label-value pairs. That is, it is a way of bundling together data&nbsp;items.  <p>A Data Container is a way of bundling together data items. An Authentic Data Container (ADC), therefore, is a data container that provides cryptographic verifiability of the integrity and source of its bundled data. In other words, that data is both tamper-proof and is non-repudiably attributable to its source. Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs) are ADCs that are chained/linked together to provide granular proof-of-authorship (i.e., authenticity) of their contained data as a directed acyclic&nbsp;graph.</p><blockquote>Note: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of vertices and edges, with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed&nbsp;loop.</blockquote><p>As a variant of the VC, ACDCs share the same fundamental properties as traditional VCs. However, ACDCs are specifically designed to work with the KERI protocol and consequently benefit from its best-in-class security properties. Unlike W3C VC, ACDC also provides normative support for credential chaining. The features that distinguish ACDCs from traditional VCs will be discussed in detail later in this&nbsp;blog.</p><blockquote>Basically, you can think of ACDCs as VCs on steroids!</blockquote><blockquote>Note: As defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credentials">W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model v1.1</a>, a verifiable credential is a set of tamper-evident claims and metadata that cryptographically prove who issued it. This definition also applies to&nbsp;ACDCs.</blockquote> Simple ACDC&nbsp;Example <p>Here is an example of an ACDC from an issuer to an&nbsp;issuee:</p> {<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON000113_",<br>  "d": "EFprJkdpcJSet8aLY9PaMicyyUkEFnVjrIRZTmftmhkg",<br>  "i": "EmkPreYpZfFk66jpf3uFv7vklXKhzBrAqjsKAn2EDIPM",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EgveY4-9XgOcLxUderzwLIr9Bf7V_NHwY1lkFrn9y2PY",<br>    "i": "EQzFVaMasUf4cZZBKA0pUbRc9T8yUXRFLyM1JDASYqAA",<br>    "dt": "2021-06-09T17:35:54.169967+00:00"<br>  }<br>} <p>Here, each field has the following description:</p>  “v” is a version string that provides protocol type (ACDC), version (1.0), serialization type (JSON), the size of the ACDC in the lowercase hexadecimal notation (00113 = 1*16**2 + 1*16 + 3 = 275 characters), and the terminator character (_).  “d” is the SAID of the&nbsp;ACDC.  “i” is the AID of the&nbsp;issuer.  “a” is the block of attributes (claims) of the holder (i.e. the data subject).  <p>There are the following fields inside&nbsp;“a”:</p>  “d” is the SAID of the nested “a”&nbsp;block.  “i” is the AID of the&nbsp;holder.  “dt” is the date-time of the issuance.  <blockquote>Note 1: The primary field labels in ACDCs are compact, i.e., having only one or two characters. This design choice was made so that ACDC can support resource-constrained applications such as those in supply chains and&nbsp;IoT.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: an ACDC may be untargeted, that is an ACDC without a holder. An untargeted ACDC provides an undirected verifiable attestation or observation of a piece of data. For example, a thermometer may make verifiable non-repudiable temperature measurements and publish them as&nbsp;ACDCs.</blockquote> Naive Conversion to a W3C&nbsp;VC <p>The example ACDC above may be converted to a W3C Verifiable Credential (W3C VC) in a “naive” manner as&nbsp;follows:</p> {<br>  "@context": [<br>    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",<br>    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"<br>  ],<br>  "issuer": {<br>    "id": "EmkPreYpZfFk66jpf3uFv7vklXKhzBrAqjsKAn2EDIPM"<br>  },<br>  "validFrom": "2021-06-09T17:35:54.169967+00:00",<br>  "credentialSubject": {<br>    "id": "EQzFVaMasUf4cZZBKA0pUbRc9T8yUXRFLyM1JDASYqAA"<br>  }<br>} <p>This conversion is naive since some security properties of the ADCD are lost during the conversion. For example, the SAIDs of the ACDC and its attribute do not appear in the W3C&nbsp;VC.</p><p>A more secure conversion standard between ACDC and W3C VC is currently being developed by Kevin Griffin from GLEIF in this draft specification:</p>  <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/vc-acdc/">https://weboftrust.github.io/vc-acdc/</a>  <blockquote>Note: Unlike W3C VC, an ACDC does not have a “proof” section. A digital signature is attached to the ACDC using the CESR Proof Signature protocol.</blockquote> Distinguishing Features of&nbsp;ACDCs <p>ACDCs have features that distinguish them from traditional VCs. Some of the major distinguishing features&nbsp;include:</p>  The security model that is derived from&nbsp;KERI,  Compact formats for resource-constrained applications  Composable JSON&nbsp;Schema,  Support for credential chaining,  Support for Ricardian contracts,  Support for chain-link confidentiality, and  Support for graduated disclosure.   1. KERI Security&nbsp;Model <p>An ACDC inherits its security properties from the KERI protocol that enables the ACDC to be used in a portable but securely attributable, fully decentralized manner.</p><p>A security property that I would like to emphasize here is the one that emerges from using SAIDs as identifiers. In fact, all identifiers in ACDCs are SAIDs or URIs that contain SAIDs. Hence, a digital signature on an ACDC provides a cryptographic commitment to the ACDC itself as well as to all the data from which the SAIDs in ACDC were derived. Examples of SAIDs in an ACDC&nbsp;include:</p>  the top-level identifier of the ACDC itself and the identifiers of nested data blocks inside the ACDC: Using SAIDs as identifiers enable a compact but secure representation of the ACDC and associated blocks.  the identifier of ACDC’s issuer and holder: The identifiers of the issuer and the holder (i.e., the issuee) are autonomic identifiers (AIDs), which are SAIDs of the inception events of their key event logs (KELs). A digital signature on an ACDC can be verified using the issuer’s KEL while the holder may cryptographically prove its holdership over the ACDC using their&nbsp;KEL.  the identifier of the ACDC’s status registry: The status of an ACDC is determined by a status registry, called a transaction event log (TEL). The issuance and revocation events of an ACDC are recorded as TEL entries that are anchored to the KEL of the ACDC’s&nbsp;issuer.  the identifier of the ACDC’s schema: The schema of an ACDC is a JSON schema where the schema id field ("$id") is the SAID of the schema. This ensures that the ACDC schema is static and verifiable to the&nbsp;SAID.  <blockquote>Note: With the use of the SAID protocol, the schema of an ACDC is static, i.e. immutable. This makes the ACDC protected against the schema malleability attack where an adversary attacks the source that provides schema resources.</blockquote> 2. Compact ACDC&nbsp;Format <p>An ACDC may be expressed in multiple ways including in compacted or uncompacted formats. Simple examples of the same ACDC that is expressed in compacted or uncompacted formats are given&nbsp;below.</p> # Compacted ACDC variant<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON000119_",<br>  "d": "ECh56mUZGxTZtpiTrxaB7wZlQtRsD4N5pY5adc_B1748",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",   <br>  "ri": "EMrPQvNVXag7MtTXVNtOBtUmjBWj6QLpPH8QBqBITUH_",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": "EBkbsuJIH_8aCUKNFFpRjT5G5_YsQ6_pZrcrCVQFnzC3"<br>}  # Uncompacted ACDC variant<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON00018c_",<br>  "d": "EDycvNBB5c1cqvgOnCmwBPmcrk80bYyRVfc-G_351kO9",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "EMrPQvNVXag7MtTXVNtOBtUmjBWj6QLpPH8QBqBITUH_",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EBkbsuJIH_8aCUKNFFpRjT5G5_YsQ6_pZrcrCVQFnzC3",<br>    "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T00:30:16.261184+00:00",<br>    "name": "Jane Doe"<br>  }<br>} <p>Here two more fields are introduced:</p>  "s" is the SAID of the JSON Schema that is used to produce the&nbsp;ACDC.  "ri" is the identifier of the ACDC’s status registry.  <p>In the compacted variant, the value of "a" is the SAID of the attribute section, which is equal to the value of the digest "d" inside "a" of the uncompacted variant.</p><p>Compact ACDCs are useful in resourced-constrained applications where the receivers/verifiers of ACDCs may cache some piece of data with their SAIDs. Other uses of compact ACDCs will also be discussed in later sections of this&nbsp;blog.</p> 3. Composable JSON&nbsp;Schema <p>The schema used by ACDCs is the JSON Schema. The JSON Schema supports composable schema that enables the use of any combination of compacted and uncompacted sections and subsections in an ACDC. With this property, the ACDC’s verification protocol allows the same ACDC to be expressed in multiple forms while still being verifiable using the same digital signature from an&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>For the above examples of compacted and uncompacted ACDC, the schema of their attribute section "a" may be constructed with the keyword "OneOf" as&nbsp;follows:</p> {<br>  "a": {<br>    "oneOf": [<br>      {<br>        "description": "Attributes block SAID",<br>        "type": "string"<br>      },<br>      {<br>        "$id": "ELpLieummE-O6FzaQ7RW-yPV__x36x6XkmdFBr6ua7ec",<br>        "description": "Attributes block",<br>        "type": "object",<br>        "properties": {<br>          "d": {<br>            "description": "Attributes block SAID",<br>            "type": "string"<br>          },<br>          "i": {<br>            "description": "Holder's AID",<br>            "type": "string"<br>          },<br>          "dt": {<br>            "description": "Issuance date time",<br>            "type": "string",<br>            "format": "date-time"<br>          },<br>          "name": {<br>            "description": "Name",<br>            "type": "string"<br>          }<br>        },<br>        "additionalProperties": false,<br>        "required": [<br>          "d",<br>          "i",<br>          "name"<br>        ]<br>      }<br>    ]<br>  }<br>} <blockquote>Note: If an ACDC schema allows for multiple variants, the issuer of such an ACDC must digitally sign the most compacted variant. A verifier who subsequently receives an uncompacted variant may convert it into the most compacted variant before verifying it against the digital signature.</blockquote> 4. ACDC&nbsp;Chaining <p>Unlike the W3C VC data model, the ACDC specification provides normative support for credential chaining. Chaining between ACDCs forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the ACDCs are nodes in the graph. The directed edges between ACDCs are represented by field "e", which specifies the relationships between the connected ACDCs. A simple example is given below where an edge represents a mother-son relationship between Ms. Jane Doe and Mr. John&nbsp;Doe.</p> # An example ACDC that attests to the identity of Ms. Jane Doe.<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON00018c_",<br>  "d": "EDycvNBB5c1cqvgOnCmwBPmcrk80bYyRVfc-G_351kO9",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "EMrPQvNVXag7MtTXVNtOBtUmjBWj6QLpPH8QBqBITUH_",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EBkbsuJIH_8aCUKNFFpRjT5G5_YsQ6_pZrcrCVQFnzC3",<br>    "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T00:30:16.261184+00:00",<br>    "name": "Jane Doe"<br>  }<br>}  # An example ACDC that attests to the identity of Mr. John Doe. <br># The edge section indicates that Ms. Jane Doe is his mother. <br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON000203_",<br>  "d": "EFh8dlxwT2EjhknxNAP5xIhYmiurtGbeDQ-pS5jOaOlE",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "ECHkWfh71fLmkeJpeMvic6RQp5P73PizTGQelXB7ZNEE",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EFFD47E5Ev1zJF3zIagGEM7kbTI9DoT3scItzDPq9Jnm",<br>    "i": "EKW8xHilZH8-CetHzBOddWpG0bS_vJlphrK3zh95u0zF",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T01:07:44.885411+00:00",<br>    "name": "John Doe"<br>  },<br>  "e": {<br>    "d": "EE12DuT-V4IPumKmRsirulOeroO38aCEb4mjKy8SlE0m",<br>    "mother": {<br>      "n": "EDycvNBB5c1cqvgOnCmwBPmcrk80bYyRVfc-G_351kO9"<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>The edge section "e" is the representation of the directed edge that originates from the embedding ACDC. Inside the edge section, the fields have the following meanings:</p>  "d" is the SAID of the edge&nbsp;section.  "n" is the SAID of the ACDC to which the edge is directed, i.e., the SAID of Ms. Jane Doe’s&nbsp;ACDC.  <blockquote>Note: The edge section may also be compacted using the section’s SAID.</blockquote> 5. Ricardian Contracts <p>An ACDC may consist of a rule section "r" to provide a Ricardian Contract. To satisfy the properties of a Ricardian contract, the rule section may be hierarchically structured into sections and subsections with named or numbered clauses in each section. The labels on the clauses may follow such a hierarchical structure using nested maps or&nbsp;blocks.</p><blockquote>Note: A Ricardian contract is a type of digital contract that combines legal and financial terms with computer-readable code. It aims to create a machine-readable representation of a legal agreement by embedding the terms of the contract within a digital document. This approach allows both humans and machines to interpret and execute the contract.</blockquote><p>An example of an ACDC with a rule section for warranty and liability disclaimers is given&nbsp;below.</p> # An example ACDC with a rule section<br>{<br>  "v": "ACDC10JSON0003e0_",<br>  "d": "EKZ0qdcyz2Mpl9QNuP0p1Sd0vr1Ov4g4wsDeZ7DJqGh6",<br>  "i": "EKxICWTx5Ph4EKq5xie2znZf7amggUn4Sd-2-46MIQTg",<br>  "ri": "ECHkWfh71fLmkeJpeMvic6RQp5P73PizTGQelXB7ZNEE",<br>  "s": "EAxP7acR20ckPKh581y6bWrqhCMZToBhoGHLoQgqJQtW",<br>  "a": {<br>    "d": "EDhg1jZaNPJdYpiNwQRsjlZMiXF6XYAzlNhgkGBfXwMb",<br>    "i": "EKW8xHilZH8-CetHzBOddWpG0bS_vJlphrK3zh95u0zF",<br>    "dt": "2023-06-05T01:14:49.919153+00:00",<br>    "name": "John Doe"<br>  },<br>  "r": {<br>    "d": "ENyB1FGejfsC2MoYXJO9WOFJttmB3lw5NC0y_dSBPlq0",<br>    "usageDisclaimer": {<br>      "l": "Usage of a valid, unexpired, and non-revoked credential does not assert that the holder is trustworthy, honest, reputable in its business dealings, safe to do business with, or compliant with any laws or that an implied or expressly intended purpose will be fulfilled."<br>    },<br>    "issuanceDisclaimer": {<br>      "l": "All information in a valid, unexpired, and non-revoked credential is accurate as of the date the validation process was complete. The credential has been issued to the person named in the credential as the subject."<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>In the rule&nbsp;section,</p>  "r" is the rule section of the&nbsp;ACDC.  "d" is the SAID of the rule&nbsp;section.  "l" is the text of a Ricardian contract&nbsp;clause.  <blockquote>Note: A rule section and its subsections may be compacted using the section’s and subsections’ SAIDs, respectively.</blockquote> 6. Chain-Link Confidentiality <p>One of the most important features of ACDCs (using their rule sections "r") is support for Chain-Link Confidentiality that imposes contractual restrictions and liability on a recipient (i.e. a disclosee) of confidential information. This property provides a powerful mechanism for the protection of personal data and confidential information.</p><p>The concept was first coined by Woodrow Hartzog and is defined as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>“A chain-link confidentiality regime would contractually link the disclosure of personal information to obligations to protect that information as the information moves downstream. The system would focus on the relationships not only between the discloser of information and the initial recipient but also between the initial recipient and subsequent recipients.”</blockquote><blockquote>[Woodrow Hartzog. “Chain-link confidentiality.” Georgia Law Review 46 (2011):&nbsp;657.]</blockquote><p>This approach links recipients of information in a chain, with each recipient bound by the same obligation to protect the information. These chain contracts would contain at least three kinds of&nbsp;terms:</p>  obligations and restrictions on the use of the disclosed information,  requirements to bind future recipients to the same obligations and restrictions; and  requirements to perpetuate the contractual chain.  <p>An exchange of an ACDC compatible with chain-link confidentiality starts with a disclosure offer from a discloser to a recipient. This offer includes a metadata ACDC with the information to be disclosed such that the recipient can agree to those terms. Once the recipient has accepted the terms (with a non-repudiable digital signature) then full disclosure of ACDC may be&nbsp;made.</p>A simple example of chain-link confidentiality. 7. Graduated Disclosure <p>A discloser of an ACDC may choose not to reveal the entire content of the ACDC in their initial interaction with the recipient. Instead, the discloser may opt to partially or selectively present the information contained within the ACDC that is needed to further a transaction with the recipient—i.e., revealing only the information that is necessary for the recipient to continue the interaction. Subsequently, the discloser would disclose further information only after the recipient agrees to the terms established by the discloser. This process may involve multiple steps, where the discloser progressively reveals more information as the recipient consents to additional terms. This process is called graduated disclosure.</p><blockquote>Note: Here, “graduated” means “arranged in a series” or “divided into different levels.”</blockquote><p>ACDC leverages graduated disclosure that enables adherence to the principle of least disclosure, which is expressed as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>The system should disclose only the minimum amount of information about a given party needed to facilitate a transaction and no&nbsp;more.</blockquote><p>ACDCs employ three types of graduated disclosure mechanisms, including compact, partial, and selective disclosures. Different types of disclosure may be defined as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Compact disclosure: Compact disclosure of an ACDC discloses the SAID of its content (blocks or sections of the ACDC). Both partial and selective disclosure rely on compact disclosure.  Partial disclosure: The content of an ACDC can be partially disclosed via the exchange of only the SAID of a given content block, i.e., using compact disclosure. The SAID of a content block provides a cryptographically equivalent commitment to the yet-to-be-disclosed content. A later exchange of the uncompacted content is verifiable to an earlier partial disclosure. Another type of partial disclosure is the disclosure of metadata about the&nbsp;content.  Selective disclosure: In selective disclosure, the set of attributes is provided as an array of blinded blocks, where each attribute in the set has its own dedicated blinded block. A selectively-disclosable attribute section appears at the top level using the field label A, which is distinct from the field label a for a non-selectively-disclosable attribute section.  <p>To give an example that demonstrates the difference between partial and selective disclosure, let’s consider the following attribute block&nbsp;a:</p> # An example of an attribute block "a"<br>"a": {<br>  "d": "EA5Fm9mP5tWreQTw2xjiXYDDGzuPVtqyfekYIz6y2jMY",<br>  "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k",<br>  "name": "Jane Doe",<br>  "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, USA"<br>} <p>With selective disclosure, the attribute block may be transformed into a selectively-disclosable attribute block as&nbsp;follows:</p> # An example of a selectively-disclosable attribute block "A"<br>"A": [<br>  {<br>    "d": "EJ1FZBKhdVcAiaZS6eHAHMrL_ANysjLkyyOXTyAEA-lb",<br>    "u": "0AAJ1MJgB3aqLHNencIF-CcH",<br>    "i": "ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k"<br>  },<br>  {<br>    "d": "EL1EbFKUR_brFCt3knKOW92STd67AuNbRfmUzgplV12G",<br>    "u": "0ABLGaIT_A5yLMDEBUCCPaF7",<br>    "name": "Jane Doe"<br>  },<br>  {<br>    "d": "EN-gWdH5AWQwfdyGmK6CSA5ciXKZbvTYEvKXaSE-74rL",<br>    "u": "0AAlI8guN7866YoSeK7cZR5M",<br>    "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, USA"<br>  }<br>] <p>where each selectively-disclosable block has its own SAID d and a random universally unique identifier (UUID)&nbsp;"u".</p><p>By using random UUIDs for each selectively-disclosable block, an adversary—which possesses both the schema of the attribute block and its SAID—is not able to discover the remaining contents of the attribute block in a computationally feasible manner by using, e.g., a rainbow table attack. Therefore the UUID "u" field of each attribute block enables the associated SAID "d" field to securely blind the block’s contents.</p><blockquote>Note 1: The field labels of the selectively disclosable attributes are also blinded because they only appear within the blinded block. This prevents un-permissioned correlation via contextualized variants of a field label that appear in a selectively disclosable block.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: The primary difference between partial disclosure and selective disclosure is determined by the correlatability with respect to its encompassing block after its disclosure. A partially disclosable field becomes correlatable to its encompassing block after its disclosure whereas a selectively disclosable field does not. After selective disclosure, the selectively disclosed fields are not correlatable to the so-far undisclosed but selectively disclosable fields in the same encompassing block.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e">KERI jargon in a nutshell.

       It calls out illicit activity from cyber thefts, ransomware and scams as among the types of criminal activity that may be perpetrated in the DeFi space, or that may use DeFi services for money laundering.<br><br>  
       The Treasury highlights that: “The primary vulnerability that illicit actors exploit stems from non-compliance by DeFi services with anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) and sanctions obligations.” In this case, the Treasury warns that even decentralized services engaged in regulated activity could fall within the scope of AML/CFT regulations and may face compliance obligations.&nbsp;<br><br>  
       The department indicates it is undertaking a review to close gaps in the US AML/CFT framework that allow certain DeFi services to operate outside of the regulatory perimeter.&nbsp;<br><br>  
       It also calls out poor cybersecurity controls among DeFI services, which leaves them vulnerable to hacks.&nbsp;<br><br>  
       The Treasury warns of the money laundering risks that DEXs and DeFi bridges pose in terms of enabling cross-chain laundering.&nbsp;<br><br>  
       It warns also of proliferation finance risks, given North Korea's use of DeFi services – both to raise funds through hacking and theft, and laundering funds through the DeFi ecosystem.&nbsp;<br><br>  
       The department highlights the transparency of the blockchain as a critical tool in combating financial crime in DeFi, noting that “a wallet address publicly identified with a hack may be the subject of intense public scrutiny, making it hard to launder proceeds in that wallet, even though its owner remains unknown”.  
       
     <p>The Treasury also cites Elliptic’s recent <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/reports/the-state-of-cross-chain-crime-2022/">State of Cross-Chain Crime</a> report, noting that ransomware actors laundered more than $50 million through DeFi services in the first half of 2022.</p>

			 The New Financial World: AI Meets Tokenization 
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain are two groundbreaking technologies that have the potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance and investment. When combined, they can create powerful synergies that enable more efficient and optimized decision-making processes. The prospect of these two potent and transformative technologies intertwining is thrilling, yet somewhat daunting, given their virtually limitless potentials.</p>
<p>Tokeny has always been at the forefront of technology. In fact,&nbsp;in 2018 we started to bridge AI with tokenization. Identity checks of individual investors are already greatly accelerated by the KYC software solutions that are integrated into our onboarding processes. The software compares investors’ identity documents with the information and “liveness” tests by using AI-powered face scans to verify the user matches the photo on authorized documents. Furthermore, our tokenization platform represents these ID verifications on the blockchain with on-chain identities, which makes these certifications actionable. Token issuers, DeFi protocols, and other relevant users can trust these identity proofs to enforce compliance or filter their participants.</p>
<p>However, this example is just the tip of the iceberg. We believe that AI’s ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data with speed and accuracy is invaluable in the financial realm. It can&nbsp;help investors and financial institutions make better-informed decisions&nbsp;by identifying patterns, trends, and correlations that may go unnoticed by human analysts, or simply take too much time to find. AI algorithms can analyze market data, news articles, social media sentiment, and other relevant information to generate real-time insights and predictions on markets and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>One area where AI excels already is in portfolio optimization. By utilizing advanced algorithms, AI can identify optimal investment strategies based on an investor’s risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. It can analyze historical market data, perform risk assessments, and make dynamic adjustments to portfolios, ensuring they remain aligned with the investor’s objectives. This already exists and is continually evolving at an outrageous speed.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;without a programmable financial infrastructure, it would be too complex for AI applications to take action&nbsp;based on their conclusions, and achieve the goals requested by its owner. An AI agent cannot easily open a bank account, move money, buy and sell assets, or anything in that nature.</p>
<p>Here is where blockchain technology comes into play: Blockchain networks provide a programmable and secure infrastructure that enhances the transparency, integrity, and trustworthiness of financial transactions, and enables programs to access valuable financial resources. By leveraging blockchain, AI systems can access real-time, tamper-proof market data and execute trades directly on decentralized protocols.</p>
<p>Indeed, smart contracts, a key feature of blockchain technology, enable the automation of financial agreements and transactions. AI algorithms can leverage smart contracts to autonomously execute predefined investment strategies, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs.&nbsp;Artificial intelligence decides, and the blockchain executes.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Our prediction is that the integration of AI and blockchain technologies has the potential to optimize financial and investment decisions in a variety of ways. AI’s data analysis capabilities can provide real-time insights and assist in portfolio optimization, while blockchain networks enhance transparency and automation. Together, they enable more efficient and trustworthy financial services, paving the way for a future where decentralized and AI-powered systems play a central role in optimizing our financial decisions.</p>
<p>Blockchain networks are the programmable financial infrastructure that AI has been missing. Now the technology is there, the only missing part is a large selection of tokenized assets.</p>
<p>What do you think about AI: Opportunity, or the path to apocalypse?</p>

<p><a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-2-2023-bluesky-beta-app">Since our last update</a>, quite a bit has changed. Just a few months ago in February, we only had a couple hundred users, and in April, we crossed 50,000 users. We recently passed 100,000 users, and are excited that so many people have joined us. Our priorities continue to be a focus on moderation and curation to ensure a safe and pleasant environment for users, and protocol work to launch federation.</p>
 Recently Released Features 
 
 Custom feeds. Users can have more ownership over their social media experience by <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">picking the algorithms</a> that power their feeds. So far, third-party developers have created feeds ranging from mutuals only, first posts from new users, cat photos, the #nba hashtag, and more. 
 Blocks and mutelists. Blocks on Bluesky prevent interaction, and organizations and community leaders can maintain shared mutelists for others to subscribe to. 
 More fine-grained content moderation controls. Users are able to select hide, warn, or show for content categories ranging from nudity to impersonation. 
 Custom domains as handles. Both individuals and organizations can set their account handle to their domain, creating a unique identifier across the network. Read our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">tutorial here</a> for how to set this up. 
 Production desktop app. We launched the desktop web app at <a href="https://bsky.app/">https://bsky.app/</a>. 
 Invite codes per account. We added server-level tooling to distribute invites on a regular cadence. Previously, accounts did not have invite codes of their own. 
 Accessibility improvements. We added alt text to images, an improved dark mode, and more. 
 App passwords. We released this as a short-term solution for people to use with third-party apps while we continue to work on Single Sign-On (SSO).

<p>A few weeks ago, we intentionally slowed our invite roll-out while we built more moderation tooling and capacity for users on the app. We staffed a content moderation team with shifts that cover a 24/7 schedule, and consulted with trust and safety experts to establish new processes and policies to support a growing userbase. We’ve resumed sending out daily invites to the <a href="https://bsky.app/">waitlist</a>, which is where the majority of users already on Bluesky received their invites. For those who don’t know someone personally with an invite code, the waitlist is the fastest way to receive a code, though please be patient as we work through the list.</p>
<p>We recently shared our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/5-5-2023-federation-architecture">technical architecture for federation</a> and are releasing a sandbox environment for developers to test soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who have used the feedback form within the app; we’ve heard your product feedback over the last few months. In the near future, you can expect these features and improvements as we move towards federation:</p>
 
 Improved labeling, reporting, and related moderation tooling 
 Account portability between servers 
 Updated community guidelines for the app 
 Protocol documentation and specifications 
 
<p>Meanwhile, we’re actively hiring. If you’re eager to join our effort to build the open social web, please apply to one of the listings on our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/join">jobs page</a>.</p>
 Giving Feedback 
<p>When the population of beta testers was even in the tens of thousands, it was still fairly manageable for the team to receive bug reports and requests from tags and mentions directly in the app. However, this method of feedback does not scale, so we’ve implemented some changes to our preferred feedback routes. Please do not tag the entire team’s personal profiles for bug reports or support requests in the app — this makes it difficult to surface important notifications. Instead:</p>
 
 To flag specific posts or profiles for the team’s attention, please use the in-app reporting feature. Our mods review every report we receive. 
 For bug reports or app feedback, please use the feedback form in the app itself (located in the side menu on mobile or the right side on desktop). 
 If you’re familiar with GitHub, you can also file an issue <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social">on our repos</a>, though please read our contribution guidelines in the README first. 
 For support requests, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a>. 
 For security reports, please email us at <a href="mailto:security@bsky.app">security@bsky.app</a> or visit <a href="https://bsky.app/.well-known/security.txt">https://bsky.app/.well-known/security.txt</a>.

<p>Flux is a fully distributed, human-centered platform that facilitates social coordination with greater privacy, agency, and flexibility. With a Discord style design for communities to grow on, Flux is customizable open-source software made for Web3 integrations.</p> Flux at a Glance <p>Description: Flux is a fully distributed, Discord style platform.</p>  Website: <a href="https://fluxsocial.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Fluxsocial.io</a>  Developer Docs: <a href="https://docs.fluxsocial.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">docs.fluxsocial.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp?ref=blog.holochain.org">discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/flux_social?ref=blog.holochain.org">@flux_social</a>   Why is Flux being built? <p>When using traditional social media applications you are always restricted by the feature sets that the developers of that specific app have decided to implement. Discord, Facebook, Slack, and others are all implementing features like events, chat, groups, posts etc. The vision for Flux is to become a general purpose platform for collaboration. Community members themselves decide which features they want to install using our plugin store. And any developer can extend their community’s plugins by developing their own.</p> Why did they choose Holochain? <p>Flux is built on AD4M, which is an agent-centric framework for decentralized social applications. The core of AD4M uses Holochain, which makes Flux extendable and customizable while ensuring validation rules are enforced. </p><p>Flux, as a project, grew out of Junto which had set out to build a social media platform using Holochain where people held their own data. As it developed Junto shifted focus to more intimate communities, becoming Flux. The importance of agent-centricity and data ownership remains however. So while there are many p2p technologies out there, Holochain continues to be a key tool for delivering on this vision.</p> Flux Ecosystem Session <p>Get a hands on view of Flux as David Atkinson downloads and uses the app with the Flux team in an ecosystem session.</p> Can you say more about the collaborative potential of Flux? <p>While the collaborative nature of Flux seems apparent in its basic Discord-like features, its true power lies beneath the surface. First, as an AD4M app, Flux is completely interoperable with any other AD4M app — meaning you can see data from Flux in any other UI built over AD4M. This means you could turn chat messages into “to-do” stickies in a different view, without actually duplicating or siloing any data. Because AD4M decouples data from the front-end, it’s super simple to develop new apps or UIs, deploy them, and invite others to use them with you. In this way, Flux is a fully evolvable and extendable platform in which any user can develop new features and put them into play with others. </p> How are they using Holochain? <p>AD4M is a sort of spanning layer that connects lots of different protocols together, from Ethereum to AWS. AD4M uses Holochain to store these connections and ensure their security. While it is designed to connect all of these different protocols together, AD4M needs Holochain to bootstrap everything and make it open, resilient, and scalable.</p><p>In many ways AD4M is an extension upon Holochain, taking the same root ideas of agent-centricity, and giving them access to all of these other systems to interact with. Holochain is the key enabler of this social technology.</p> Can you say a little about your experience developing on Holochain? <p>The way that Flux accesses Holochain through the AD4M spanning layer makes it even easier to build applications on Holochain as the SDK really feels like working with a traditional real time database like Firebase! This is a different way of interacting with Holochain than most developer teams have, but we really think that this is just the beginning of all the ways this technology will be used. We are learning and building alongside Holochain with excitement for the future. </p> How can I get involved? <p>Join the AD4M Discord, where you can connect with us about Flux and other AD4M apps: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp?ref=blog.holochain.org">discord.com/invite/mP4vQkVgwp</a><br><br>Try Flux yourself! First download ad4m (<a href="https://ad4m.dev/download/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ad4m.dev/download</a>), and then connect to Flux (<a href="https://app.fluxsocial.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">app.fluxsocial.io/</a>) and join our test community.</p>

				  Your product or service lives and dies by your brand. So how can you make sure your brand is remembered and leaves a good impression? It all starts with user experience. In this article we’ll look at how UX impacts your brand, a few tips and tricks, and look at Indicio’s approach.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>It is typically said that you only get one chance at a first impression. Unfortunately, when it comes to new technologies, that often means it can’t just “work;” it also needs to look and feel enticing enough to the end user to get them to try it in the first place — and come back for more.</p>
<p>In the decentralized identity space, many companies are working on creating digital wallets to store digital identities using verifiable credentials that are held on the end user’s mobile device. Unfortunately, given the sheer number of options people have with apps on phones, it’s not a surprise that a recent survey found roughly 25% of apps are used only once after being downloaded.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Percentage of apps used only once by year</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Chart credit: <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271628/percentage-of-apps-used-once-in-the-us/%20">https://www.statista.com/statistics/271628/percentage-of-apps-used-once-in-the-us/&nbsp;</a></p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>So how do we make sure that digital wallet apps don’t suffer this fate? Verifiable credentials have to be useful. The more useful they are, the more people can do with them in everyday life, the more they will be used. But that alone isn’t a guarantee of success. Digital wallets and verifiable credentials have to be easy to understand and easy to use. That’s obvious, right? But even that is not enough: They must be visually attractive. A <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265002981_Visual_Appeal_vs_Usability_Which_One_Influences_User_Perceptions_of_a_Website_More">2009 study</a> examined the effects of visual appeal and usability on user satisfaction found that user satisfaction was higher when using websites with high visual appeal and low usability than when using a site with low visual appeal but high usability. That first impression counts — but it’s often the last thing teams will think about when creating innovative technology. If you’re wondering how long that first impression lasts, according to research done by Google you have just <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/38315.pdf">17 milliseconds</a> to “hook” someone. The secret sauce to doing that is providing a combination of low complexity and high prototypicality (basically what the user expects to see — most users will have an assumption in their mind of what an ecommerce site or blog should look like and how they can interact with it).</p>
<p>When it comes to UI/UX, Indicio employs a simple, clean design. “We want someone to be able to pick up this technology and be able to use it without having to put a lot of thought into it,” says Indicio’s VP of Operations Scott Harris. While we have a step-by-step guide for our Holdr+ app (our version of a digital wallet) and other customer-facing products, we recognize that users are busy, or simply don’t want to read an exhaustive manual (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article-abstract/28/1/27/2363584?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">only 25% of people read manuals</a> for consumer products), the shortest learning curve is the path to success.</p>
<p>If you’re building a decentralized identity solution and would like to review your UI/UX or discuss best practices, Indicio is happy to help. You can get in contact with our team <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">here</a>. And if you are just looking for a plug-and-play solution we can easily adjust <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a> or <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a> to fit your needs.</p>

<p>Detecting stolen and synthetic identities at the very front end of new account origination for every type of user can pay huge dividends but too often, tightening fraud controls can deliver an alienating experience to legitimate customers and impact employee onboarding. Recent reports reveal that identity fraud remains an escalating issue, resulting in annual losses exceeding $24 billion (USD). Consequently, the significance of accurate identity verification and robust fraud prevention measures cannot be overstated, as they directly impact your business’s profitability.</p>
<p>The digital landscape of our economy introduces vulnerabilities to the process of identity verification, necessitating organizations to fortify themselves against these threats. The digital identity verification arena is swiftly adapting to counter the expanding menace of fraud. Emerging tools and technologies are empowering numerous companies to validate a consumer’s true identity in real-time, prior to finalizing any transaction. Today, we explore six prevailing trends in the realm of identity verification.</p>
 
 Addressing Challenges with Hard-to-Verify, Underserved Populations<br>
Identity verification professionals are encountering difficulties in authenticating the identities of hard-to-verify populations, such as young adults and recent immigrants. These groups often lack conventional forms of identification or a presence in traditional data ecosystems, making their verification challenging. To tackle this issue, identity verification professionals are exploring <a href="https://www.enformion.com/alternative-credit-data-vital-information/">alternative data providers</a> that can facilitate better verification of these populations’ identities. 
 The Surge in Identity Theft and Synthetic Identity Fraud<br>
	The rise in identity theft and <a>synthetic identity fraud</a> poses a growing concern for identity verification professionals. Losses from synthetic identity fraud are projected to exceed $2.42 billion in 2023, emphasizing the crucial role of identity data in detecting fraudulent activities. Criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods, making it difficult for traditional identity verification solutions to detect fraudulent behavior. Consequently, there is a heightened focus on security and compliance as businesses strive to safeguard themselves and their customers from the financial and reputational damages resulting from identity theft. 
 Leveraging Identity Verification for KYC and KYB<br>
Identity verification for <a>know your customer (KYC)</a> is gaining importance as businesses strive to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations. Identity verification professionals are utilizing advanced technologies like machine learning and blockchain to enhance the identification and verification for KYC, assisting businesses in maintaining compliance and avoiding financial and reputational harm. 
 Mobile Identity Verification – The Rise of Phone-Based Identity Verification<br>
	Phone-based identity verification, also known as mobile identity verification, is gaining popularity as a means of verifying individuals’ identities. The increasing number of mobile users and the convenience of using mobile devices for identity verification are driving this trend. Identity verification professionals are harnessing the capabilities of mobile devices, such as Face ID and Touch ID, to enhance identity verification and detect fraudulent activities. This trend is expected to continue as mobile devices become even more ubiquitous and powerful. 
 Integration of Biometrics<br>
	Businesses are turning to biometrics integration to aid in identity verification. By utilizing biometric technologies, companies can verify client identities through fingerprints, facial recognition, and <a>LiveID</a>. With the prevalence of fingerprint and facial recognition technology in many mobile phones, more consumers are adopting these methods. In most cases, businesses can combine multiple biometric methods to increase the accuracy of identity recognition. 
 Consumer Concerns Driving the Need for Change<br>
44% of American consumers consider banking fraud and identity theft to be their top concerns according to a <a href="https://www.fico.com/en/newsroom/fico-survey-us-consumers-fear-bank-fraud-and-id-theft-more-terrorist-attack">report by FICO</a>. Financial institutions are also deeply worried about identity theft, given the annual losses of approximately $16.8 billion. Hence, there is a clear demand for action against identity theft.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Finance is one of the most tightly regulated sectors in the Western world, and not without reason. It forms the foundation on which modern welfare states are built on. Historically, it has been one of the most fragmented sectors within the European Union, as each of the member states had spent centuries co-evolving with their local finance providers. Each has adapted to local needs and has been shaped by local histories.</p>
 European Monetary Union 
<p>Slowly but surely, the European Commission is seeking to accomplish a true monetary union within the member states, mimicking the formation of the largest contemporary federal republic – the United States of America. The process has been far from a walk in the park, and there is still considerable work required before the “United States of Europe” becomes a sovereign superstate.</p>
<p>Adopting the Euro as a common currency was a major accomplishment towards the goal. Another important aspect, hidden from plain sight, is unifying the regulation between the member states. For the traditional banking sector, one of the most important regulatory frameworks is called the <a href="https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/index.htm">Basel Framework</a>. Now in the third iteration of the framework, it is often referred to as <a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm?m=">Basel III</a>. Banks are currently implementing the latest updates after the previous iterations, Basel I and Basel II.</p>
<p>Following the delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Commission has published its long-awaited proposal on implementing the final Basel III reforms. These reforms were required to be implemented in European law by January 1st, 2023.</p>
 What is the Goal of the Basel Framework? 
<p>The end goal has been clearly stated since the Basel I agreement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Taking a major step towards European unification by completing an EU-wide finance union and trying to prevent a continent-wide economic collapse by strengthening bank capital requirements, increasing minimum capital requirements, mandating the holdings of high-quality liquid assets, and decreasing bank leverage dynamically.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This has proved to be controversial from the start. To address the presented concerns, the Commission is expected to launch a public consultation on the review of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), and the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD).&nbsp;The implementation of the Basel III reforms is another major milestone towards the goals of the Commission.</p>
 Ongoing Issues in Implementing the Basel Framework 
<p>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the persistent inflation stemming from the extremely stimulatory monetary policy practiced by the European Central Bank (ECB) since the 2008 financial crisis, is far from over. It is likely to fuel arguments in favour of allowing more divergence in European law from the Basel III standard. For example, Nordic banks are currently operating at noticeably lower risk levels than major French and south European banks.</p>
<p>The Nordic banks have more of their assets tied to mortgages that are already stress-tested to 6% Euribor rates, instead of holding large quantities of sovereign debt from highly indebted southern European countries. In addition, the mortgages are typically valued at 70% of their face value, compared to 100% of the face value of sovereign debt. This is because the current regulation allows the assumption that a sovereign state cannot become insolvent – until of course one does, like Sri Lanka recently. EU-wide <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/nordic-banks-would-outperform-eu-peers-in-stress-test-worst-case-scenario-66008634">stress tests</a> clearly reflect the difference in resilience. If this difference will not be reflected in the regulatory environment, then banks that have historically operated at higher risk than their competitors – by, for example, not diversifying their assets clearly across asset classes – could gain an unfair advantage. We will see whether the inevitable Basel IV will address these concerns.</p>
<p>For private investors, not all of the changes have been positive. For example, artificially limiting access to non-EU markets and financial instruments helps to keep the fees of European brokers at much higher levels than their American and Asian counterparts. In addition, some EU countries continue to blatantly ignore both European law and national one-to-one agreements on taxation, instead pushing all the burden to correct double taxation to the private investors themselves. They are now faced with complex legal procedures in foreign languages with little to no help from the national authorities – who were supposed to handle everything automatically already, years ago.</p>
 Remote Identity Proofing 
<p>Many could argue therefore that the changes have been without a net benefit so far, but there is one positive change on the horizon. This change is about allowing one to create a strong digital identity via remote connection, without already possessing a strong electronic ID (eID). This is called remote identity proofing, and it could potentially change the fintech landscape dramatically throughout the whole European Union, by allowing its more than 300 million residents to utilise financial services in all of the 27 member states, without having to physically travel. </p>
<p>The identity verification process is necessary to fulfil the legal requirements of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) legislation. Despite the common misunderstanding, identity verification does not, by itself, represent any kind of trustworthy relationship between the end user and the organisation. Unlike the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable LEI</a>, for example.</p>
 How Remote Identity Proofing Works 
<p>The verification would traditionally be carried out in person, by verifying a physical identity document and comparing the photograph of the holder of the document to their face in real life. For remote identity proofing, the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/">European Telecommunications Standards Institute</a> (ETSI), an independent organisation that standardises norms at the European level, has created a standard framework for remote identity proofing.</p>
<p>The standard recognises identification through video in a live stream, with the recording of the entire process, as the only way that remote identity proofing can have the same level of legal compliance as a physical face-to-face verification. This repeats what is already stipulated in the eIDAS regulation for the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI, often referred to as EU ID or EUID). This is as opposed to using still photographs or selfies, which have high fraud rates and therefore are not eIDAS compliant.</p>
<p>The first national launches of the EUDI are scheduled for 2024, and a continent-wide rollout will hopefully follow soon after. That will bring strong individual identities to the masses, then it’s time for the other half: strong organisational identities.

 Collaboration increases IDnow’s document checking capabilities in the air travel industry 



<p>Munich, May 31, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, announces its participation in the <a href="https://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)</a> Public Key Directory (PKD) pilot program to further enhance its document checking capabilities in commercial air travel. First established in 2007, the ICAO PKD is a central repository for exchanging the information required to authenticate electronic Machine Readable Travel Documents (eMRTDs), such as ePassports and electronic ID cards. </p>



<p>Today covering 90 issuing authorities worldwide, the <a href="https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/PKD/Pages/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20ICAO%20Public%20Key%20Directory,cards%20and%20Visible%20Digital%20Seals.">ICAO PKD</a> offers an effective means for countries to upload their own technical data related to ePassports and electronic ID cards and download that of other issuing authorities, thus eliminating the need for bilateral exchange of this data. Essentially, the ICAO PKD takes on the role of a central broker for this technical information while also helping to ensure that the information adheres to the necessary technical standards (i.e., ICAO 9303 specifications) to maintain interoperability.</p>



<p>Security is a top priority in air travel</p>



<p>By joining the time-limited ICAO PKD pilot, IDnow has received temporary permission to read out the data stored in the NFC (Near-field communication) chip of ePassports and electronic ID cards and to use this data in their commercial solutions in the air travel domain.</p>



<p>“Security and facilitation are a top priority in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">air travel</a>, and identity verification plays a crucial role in any travel security equation nowadays,” says Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow. “We are therefore very pleased to participate in the ICAO PKD pilot. Being part of this program allows us to verify the authenticity of an electronic ID document and its rightful origin. In addition to our advanced in-house fraud fighting measures, we are thus able to verify that the data on the document’s chip is authentic and that the issuing authority is the one it claims to be. Furthermore, we can extract the embedded portrait photo of the document holder from the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">NFC chip</a> and use it for biometric verification, knowing that it has not been tampered with,” he adds. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p>Manually granting access to entitlements and access reviews is not easy. Organizations are shifting focus towards learning and discovering capabilities. Automation tools such as policy mining are being introduced to reduce the burden of governance for granting access and reviewing access. Policy-based provisioning of access and access reviews can help to reduce the efforts of reviewing fine-grained or coarse-grained access by automating these processes.  In this whitepaper, we will take a look at Tuebora’s model for mining provisioning policies, the importance of birthright provisioning, and automatic access to entitlements.

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the latest <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a> feature that allows issuers to conveniently send credentials directly from the platform to recipients’ emails and Dock Wallet. Now, issuers can enjoy a streamlined process that saves time, improves efficiency, and ensures secure delivery of important credentials.</p><p>When you issue a credential by using the recipients’ decentralized identifiers (DIDs), they will immediately receive the credential in their <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Digital Identity Wallet app</a>.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identifiers?ref=blog.dock.io">decentralized identifier</a> is a unique digital identifier that you fully own and control through your ID Wallet. DIDs enable you to securely receive and present their credentials in a privacy-preserving way.</p> Steps for Sending the Credential by Email <p>Let’s say the Nursing Licensing Authority wants to send each nursing graduate their credential by email. They will now see a field in Dock Certs to add the recipient’s email whenever they issue a credential.</p><p>1. The Nursing Licensing Authority enters Clarissa Olson’s email in Dock Certs.</p><p>2. The Nursing Licensing Authority previews the credential and selects Send credentials.</p><p>3. Clarissa will receive the credential by email as soon as it is issued from Dock Certs.</p><p>4. Clarissa scans the QR code with her Dock Wallet to import it on the app. She then gets a wallet notification saying she received a credential from the Nursing Licensing Authority. The QR Code becomes voided after Clarissa imports the credential.</p><p>Free trial users can only send themselves a &nbsp;Credential and will need to choose a plan in order to email it to other people. <br>See the complete <a href="https://www.dock.io/guides/dock-certs-user-guide?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs issuer guide</a> on how to use all of the features.</p> Send a Credential by DID <p>With our latest feature, an issuer can send a credential directly to a recipient's Dock Wallet by simply entering the recipient’s DID in the Subject ID field in Dock Certs. If, for example, an employer wants to send an employee a job status credential, the employer would simply enter the staff’s DID in Dock Certs and they will receive the credential directly in their Dock Digital Wallet. This feature is powered by our DID Relay Service.</p>  The Nursing Licensing Authority sends the credential by using Clarissa’s DID.  <p>2. Clarissa receives the notification in the Dock Wallet.</p><a href="https://certs.dock.io/dashboard?ref=blog.dock.io"></a> About Dock <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently and securely.

  Japan’s enforcement of the Crypto Travel Rule from June 1st, 2023, marks a significant step in tightening cryptocurrency regulations.  The new regulations, while promising increased transparency and trust in the market, may also pose challenges to privacy and operational changes.  Shyft Veriscope, with its strategic partnership with Sygna, emerges as the best frictionless Travel Rule Solution, balancing regulatory compliance, cost-efficiency, and user&nbsp;privacy.  <p>In the world of technology and innovation, Japan has always been a front-runner, setting trends that many&nbsp;follow.</p><p>With a unique blend of technological adeptness and a robust economy, the country continues to maintain its global significance, and its latest move in the cryptocurrency domain is no exception.</p><p>Starting June 1st, 2023, Japan will enforce stringent Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations to further refine and intensify the oversight of cryptocurrency transactions while supporting the crypto&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Announced by the Japanese parliament on May 23, this decision exemplifies the nation’s proactive efforts to align with global crypto regulations more effectively and exhibits the state’s adaptability to the evolving financial regulatory requirements.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">The Most Googled Questions on FATF Travel Rule&nbsp;Answered</a></p> Work in Progress Since March&nbsp;2021 <p>In a regulatory journey spanning over a year, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) received a request in March 2021 from the Financial Services Agency (FSA) to introduce self-regulatory rules concerning the “crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.”</p><p>This was followed by the JVCEA incorporating these rules in April 2022, which further led to the enforcement of the crypto Travel Rule through an amendment to the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds (APTCP) in December&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Later, to clarify how the “crypto Travel Rule” applies to Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), the FSA initiated a consultation process on these guidelines, signifying its intent to uphold transparency and dialogue within the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>And by March 2023, the FSA concluded its public consultation on APTCP guidelines, and now, in June, the Travel Rule will soon be officially enforced in Japan. In a country where cryptocurrencies have been adopted legally, the implications of these new AML regulations are far-reaching.</p> The Impact on Crypto Ecosystem <p>The enforcement of the Travel Rule in Japan is set to cast a wide net of implications across the cryptocurrency landscape. For starters, it may infuse a greater degree of trust in the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>By taking stringent measures against potential illicit activities, the rule can effectively alleviate some of the concerns existing and potential users might have about the crypto industry. This could increase crypto use and investment, lending greater liquidity and stability to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Moreover, the Travel Rule brings the promise of heightened transparency. The mandate for exchange providers to share crypto sender and receiver information allows for a more open view of transaction flows. This could significantly reduce fraudulent activities and make it difficult for malicious actors to exploit the system, fostering a safer trading environment.</p><p>Despite these positives, there are some contradictions not to be&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>For instance, for many crypto users, the allure of cryptocurrencies lies in the anonymity they&nbsp;offer.</p><p>But with the new regulations in place, this veil of anonymity gets partially lifted, potentially dissuading some users and investors. This loss of anonymity could slow down the growth of the crypto market in Japan, at least in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that the effect of the Travel Rule on users’ privacy and businesses’ operations will largely depend on the nature of the platform and the Travel Rule solution they&nbsp;employ.</p> Choice of Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution <p>The choice of a Travel Rule solution can substantially impact the user experience and the level of privacy maintained in these transactions.</p><p>One promising approach is the adoption of a fully automated, peer-to-peer Travel Rule solution, like Shyft Veriscope. It allows for the necessary data exchange between VASPs without storing any sensitive user information on its servers. This approach not only mitigates the risk of data breaches but also restricts any third-party access, thereby adding an extra layer of privacy protection.</p><p>Moreover, Shyft Veriscope’s fully automated nature ensures that user experience remains positive and seamless, an essential factor that could influence users’ decision to continue engaging with the crypto market amidst these regulatory changes.</p><p>Ultimately, the choice of the Travel Rule solution becomes a critical determinant in striking the right balance between adhering to regulatory standards and preserving user privacy and experience. This will be a key factor in shaping the impact of the new regulations on both users and businesses in the crypto&nbsp;sphere.</p> CEX vs DEX: How do They Fare Under Japan’s Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>For Centralized Exchanges, which already have strict Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols in place, the impact may not be substantial. After all, these platforms already possess much of the required information about their users, minimizing the effect of these new regulations on their operations and user experience.</p><p>On the other hand, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms, known for their anonymity and less stringent KYC procedures, may face a greater challenge. The enforcement of the Travel Rule could disrupt the degree of privacy users enjoy on these platforms, potentially affecting their appeal to a certain user&nbsp;base.</p><p>So, while this regulatory change is undoubtedly transformative, it’s also diverse in its impact, affecting different areas of the crypto ecosystem to varying degrees. This difference, in effect, underscores the importance of a Travel Rule solution that can navigate these challenges while preserving user privacy and experience.</p> Comparatively Higher Threshold <p>Another noteworthy aspect of Japan’s enforcement of the Travel Rule is the transaction threshold set at $3,000. This means the rule will only apply to transactions exceeding this limit. This is a significant figure, higher than many other countries’ thresholds for applying similar AML regulations.</p><p>This relatively high threshold could have important implications for the crypto market in Japan. Smaller, everyday transactions, which constitute a large volume of crypto activity, will remain largely unaffected by these new regulations. This allows a significant portion of crypto users to continue enjoying the benefits of anonymity and ease of transactions they are accustomed to.</p><p>However, for larger transactions, the enforcement of the Travel Rule will necessitate more stringent information-sharing and verification processes. While this could potentially slow down transaction times and complicate the process for some users, it will also provide added security and transparency, helping to protect users against fraud and other illicit activities.</p><p>For crypto businesses, compliance with the Travel Rule means embracing operational changes. As such, the rule necessitates significant investments in infrastructural upgrades and personnel training to meet the new regulatory standards. This could impose a heavy burden on smaller businesses and startups, which might struggle to keep up with these requirements.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/demystifying-the-fatf-travel-rule-your-most-googled-questions-answered-part-2">Demystifying the FATF Travel Rule: Your Most Googled Questions Answered — Part&nbsp;2</a></p> How Should VASPs&nbsp;Comply? <p>With the impending enforcement of the Travel Rule in Japan, VASPs are faced with the challenging task of choosing a Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>Although the FATF doesn’t advocate for a specific compliance solution or method, VASPs have a moral duty to choose a solution that seamlessly navigates the intricate compliance requirements while preserving user privacy and experience. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Shyft Veriscope</a> ticks all the&nbsp;boxes.</p><p>Not only does Shyft Veriscope demonstrate cost-efficiency when compared to other available options in the market, but it is also a one-of-a-kind solution. As we highlighted above, being a Peer-to-Peer Travel Rule Solution, Shyft Veriscope blends efficiency and regulatory compliance without infringing upon user experience or&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope’s appeal in the evolving Japanese crypto market is further strengthened by <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/sygna-and-shyft-veriscope-partner-to-enhance-crypto-travel-rule-interoperability-and-compliance">Shyft’s strategic partnership with Sygna</a>, a well-regarded name in the realm of crypto AML compliance services with a robust presence in&nbsp;Japan.</p><p>The result is a solution that moves beyond mere compliance, addressing the “sunrise issue” of the Travel Rule and nudging the crypto industry closer towards full interoperability.</p><p>More details here: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Shyft Veriscope — The Critical Infrastructure Underpinning FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> Frequently Asked Questions on Japan Enforcing Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule  Q1: When will the Crypto Travel Rule be enforced in&nbsp;Japan? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule will be enforced in Japan from June 1st. The Japanese parliament announced the decision on May 23, aligning Japan more effectively with global crypto regulations.</p> Q2: How will the Crypto Travel Rule impact crypto users in&nbsp;Japan? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule will inject more trust and transparency into the cryptocurrency market, potentially increasing cryptocurrency usage and investment. However, the rule may also deter some users and investors as it partially lifts the veil of anonymity associated with cryptocurrencies.</p> Q3: What does implementing the Crypto Travel Rule mean for crypto businesses in&nbsp;Japan? <p>For crypto businesses, the Crypto Travel Rule means they will need to undergo operational changes to comply with the new regulations. This includes significant investments in infrastructural upgrades and personnel training to meet the new regulatory standards.</p> Q4: What is the role of the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in implementing the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Japan? <p>The FSA is the primary regulatory body overseeing the implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule in Japan. It works in collaboration with self-regulatory entities such as the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) and the Japan Security Token Offering Association (JSTOA) to develop policies and rules that shape the cryptocurrency landscape in the&nbsp;country.</p> Final Note <p>The Travel Rule brings a significant shift towards a safer and more transparent crypto market in Japan, but not without impacting some of the very elements that made cryptocurrencies attractive to a certain segment of users and businesses.</p><p>As the industry adapts to these regulatory shifts, the long-term implications will largely hinge on the evolution of this new paradigm and the ensuing global&nbsp;trends.</p><p>However, amidst this sea of changes, one thing remains crystal clear: Japan, the “Land of the Rising Sun,” is taking a proactive and exemplary stance in tackling regulatory challenges.</p><p>Therefore, as countries across the globe grapple with the intricacies of crypto regulation, they can look towards Japan’s progressive strides for valuable insights and guidance.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>This week Simon and David review the recent <a href="https://heliview.com/identity-access-management/">Heliview</a> IAM Conference that took place in the Netherlands. The main topic for the day was the rise of the identity fabric (or mesh) and how this can enable the modern organisation with a range of agile IAM components that supports both business and security use cases. Simon presented a <a href="https://www.thecyberhut.com/heliview-identity-access-management-conference-netherlands/">keynote</a> on the future of IAM - using some research from The Cyber Hut focusing on where IAM may look like in 2028 and beyond...</p>
<p>They also discussed the need for people, process and technology integration, in order to map the existing IAM landscape to future investment and metrics.</p>
<p>They finish off by discussing the rise in cyber threat reports that have emerged in the past month that all have a very strong reliance on IAM - and why ITDR is a process not a product. </p>

 Network-agnostic tokenization platform for enterprises 
<p>Any type of asset can be easily and compliantly represented on-chain using our platform, with the freedom for the issuer to select their preferred blockchain network.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in May 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>We started Tokeny with the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to effortlessly purchase and trade financial products they are eligible for. With our&nbsp;network-agnostic tokenization platform, supporting multi-chains,&nbsp;we enable enterprises to turn this belief into a tangible reality.</p>
<p>Any type of asset can be easily and compliantly represented on-chain using our platform&nbsp;with the freedom for the issuer to select their preferred blockchain network.&nbsp;We cater to institutions seeking to tokenize assets, empowering them to benefit from direct securities distribution, automated subscription processes, and diverse liquidity solutions (<a href="https://tokeny.com/dvd-transfers/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">DvD transfer</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/new-feature/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">CEX feature</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">Billboard</a>, etc.), regardless of the underlying blockchain network.</p>
<p>Our T-REX tokenization platform acts as a&nbsp;data aggregator&nbsp;that harmoniously aggregates relevant information from blockchains, ensuring data on the platform is always synchronized with the selected blockchains. With a user-friendly interface, it facilitates efficient&nbsp;smart contract management, streamlines operations, and enables ERC3643 token trading. Moreover, it provides seamless&nbsp;connectivity&nbsp;to both external platforms and the DINO distribution network, covering centralized and decentralized trading platforms within the same blockchain network that the securities were issued.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>In the realm of digital securities, the <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC3643 token standard</a> brings compliance and control by only allowing transfers when both the investor rules (via ONCHAINID, digital identity smart contracts) and offering rules are met. While this standard is open-source, its implementation is considerably more intricate compared to the permissionless token standard ERC20.&nbsp;Building a functional platform from scratch demands a significant amount of time, resources, and expertise.</p>
<p>With an extensive track record spanning 6 years, our team of 20 experienced developers has built an end-to-end platform covering the entire lifecycle of ERC3643 tokens. Our value proposition revolves around&nbsp;expediting time-to-market for institutions to increase their market share with proven solutions.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that our SaaS platform and API are&nbsp;technically capable of supporting all EVM blockchains, which constitute a dominant share of on-chain activities (94% as per DefiLlama, a DeFi data aggregator). Our solutions have been meticulously optimized for three prominent networks: Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. Notably, the presence of key multi-chain components, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/from-start-up-to-scale-up-how-tokeny-prepared-for-large-scale-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">indexer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/gas-tank-on-polygon/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">gas tank</a>&nbsp;smart contracts, allows us to efficiently add new EVM networks to our platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, issuers have the flexibility to&nbsp;move digital securities from one chain to another as well as<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-v4/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9x73qveMeQkR0DFsga0I1HnTDdvCL2qlviD4kLz-mYVttONy5YNJg5rl_u27q-luVnfIV8">&nbsp;upgrade their smart contracts</a>&nbsp;via our solutions. This dynamic future-proof solution allows issuers to confidently begin asset tokenization in response to any evolving circumstances. By providing a catalyst for tokenization adoption, we ensure a secure and reliable foundation for issuers to embrace this transformative trend.</p>

<p>In this vlog, our COO, Huzefa Olia, is joined by Kevin Shanley, Principal at Amazon Web Services Identity to discuss bringing verified identity and passwordless to the masses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Hello and welcome. Hi Kevin, how are you?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Hey, Huzefa. I’m doing great, thanks and yourself?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Wonderful. So you are new to this particular vlog our so would love for you to introduce yourself first to our audience.</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Absolutely. My name is Kevin Shanley. I lead go to market for AWS consumer identity services. And while I’m relatively new at AWS, I’ve actually been an IM for over 25 years.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Thanks for the intro. Now, in your world today you see so many different types of identities that are coming in. What are the different challenges that you see with respect to authentication?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Well, in three words, passwords, friction, and passwordless. If we double click on passwords, they’re difficult to make both complex and to remember. And this makes them susceptible to being these weak, easy, remember simple passwords that are often reused at different sites. And then that next problem becomes friction. So as we try to add security to passwords, we add friction, you make it harder for those legitimate users to actually authenticate.</p>
<p>And then the solution to that is passwordless and this is where everyone wants to go, we all want to go passwordless but that really brings it own set of problems. You may not have hardware that supports passwordless. You may not be a tech savvy person and know how to use passwordless. And so while passwords may not be very secure, at least everyone knows how passwords work, it’s just a known quantity. So that question becomes how do we get to passwordless?</p>
<p>And so well, it can brings up a couple of other points. Huzefa, can you explain how bringing a user’s true identity into authentication enhances both the security and mitigates risks?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Kevin, very interesting question. When you talk about passwordless, there’s so many different ways to get to passwordless in the market today, and most of them always take into the equation what a user’s device is.</p>
<p>But what is important is also to know who’s the user behind the device. You need to know if the user is authorized to access that particular device and the user is in fact the one that you provisioned or you created the account for. At the end of the day, identity and access management has to work together and identity has to be brought in into any kind of an access or a sign on scenario.</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Thanks, Huzefa, that’s great. And so I guess what specific strategies or technologies can be employed to incorporate a user’s true identity into authentication?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Often when we look at any kind of access, we always looking at how do I register a user’s device and then give them access?</p>
<p>What we advocate is when you bring on a user, right, already you, onboard a employee, contractor, customer of yours, do identity proofing or identity verification, and there are various different standards, the most prominent one being the NIST 800-63. So you have a guideline to how to proof and verify a user as well. But the result of that proofing and verification can be not just a verified user, but also using the user’s biometrics to authenticate them.</p>
<p>So today, when you look at any connect for passwordless access, you can essentially ask a user to prove who they are by taking their live biometrics or their live selfie to access various different systems and mainly critical systems as well where you no longer are requiring an OTP, you’re no longer requiring a user just to use a push notification but actually validate themselves by looking at the camera and us identifying if that’s the same user who registered for the service as well.</p>
<p>So hopefully that gave you some context, but now let me ask you this question, Kevin, right? When you see this flow of an identity based authentication, right? How do you think that would benefit? Which industries would benefit from this kind of an authentication?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
So, well, AWS especially, it’s really anything you care about securing, any industry that cares, cares about securing your site, financial services, healthcare, commercial sites. I mean even social networking because you’re concerned about data mining.</p>
<p>This point, bad bot traffic is now the majority of traffic on the internet. And what are these bots doing? They’re creating fake accounts, they’re attempting to break into existing user accounts. And so I mean, why do they even create these fake accounts and how can they create them? It’s because for the most part, nothing is actually verifying that there’s a real person on the end of the line and that that’s a real user identity.</p>
<p>And as we kind of pivot over to identity verification, identity proofing and stronger authentication, passwordless, that’s where we start to really close the loop on that and that’s both, it’s going to mean that you’re going to have real accounts actually in your databases. You’re going to see real traffic and real metrics and not have it all abstracted with a bunch of bad bot traffic and you’re going to end up as well as saving money because you’re not going to have to pay for that bot traffic that are taking up your monthly user accounts and such.</p>
<p>And so I guess from your perspective Huzefa, what steps can an organization take to successfully roll out an identity based authentication for the masses?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Simple answer to this would be to include any kind of identity proofing and verification into your onboarding flow. And your onboarding flow can be depending on the persona of the user, if it’s an employer or contractor, when you’re creating them as a new user. If you have customers when you’re registering them, for example, for financial services, if you’re doing a KYC or if you’re in retail and if you need to know for any kind of offer sensitive transaction that needs to be done, know who the user is, do the proofing and verification that is required, which will have all the added benefits of reducing fraud like you mentioned Kevin. And then not just do this one time, but use this identity template that has been accumulated for that specific user to use that into their authentication as well.</p>
<p>So all of, our companies have worked together to put 1Kosmos and the AWS solutions. Where do you think this collaboration with 1Kosmos and AWS will contribute to the market?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Oh, great question. So well, coming from the AWS side and how I see it, AWS is the leading cloud provider and AWS identity and access management services were recently given a top customer choice award from Gartner. In fact, AWS IM handles hundreds of millions of API calls per second, which is just a crazy number. I mean hundreds of millions of API calls per second. So we go big, we do identity well, but we can’t be everywhere. We can’t do everything.</p>
<p>And as an agile startup, 1Kosmos has both, I think the technical depth and focus to really innovate in identity-based authentication. And together I think we bring that targeted innovation together with the stability, scale availability, and cost-efficient computing to drive identity over to all to the masses.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Thank you. Thank you for that, Kevin. This is very, very insightful and I’m sure our audience wants to learn a little bit more about this. So you are going to Identiverse, you will be speaking at Identiverse. Can you tell our audience where will you be?</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Yeah, absolutely. So, at Identiverse, I’ll be speaking with Mike Engle in Las Vegas. The title of our session is Bringing Verified Identity and Password List to the Masses, and that’s going to be running at 4:30 PM on Thursday, June the 1st.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Awesome. Look forward to. I’ll be audience as well.</p>
<p>Kevin Shanley:<br>
Great. Looking forward to seeing you there.</p>

				  Vital records&nbsp;— such as your birth, death, marriage, and divorce certificates&nbsp;— are going digital. The only question is how. In this article, we explain why verifiable credential technology offers the best solution.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>As we look to modernize legacy systems and create digital equivalents of our most important and personal documents, it is important to get this transformation right. As a leading developer of verifiable data solutions using open-source decentralized identity technology, Indicio would like to offer the following recommendations for governments looking into turning vital paper records into vital digital records.&nbsp;</p>
 Do 
<p>Build on open-source technology</p>
<p>To put it simply, don’t tie yourself to proprietary technology when technology is evolving at a rapid pace. Plus, there’s the risk of not being able to interoperate with other identity and data ecosystems unless you go down the path of costly and complex direct integrations. With open source you own your solution and can develop on it as you see fit. You also benefit from the innovation generated by a vibrant open-source community. Community-developed code tends to be more resilient code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make use of decentralization technology</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technology allows people to hold their own data and share it in a way that the authenticity and integrity of the data can be verified without having to check in with or create a direct integration with the issuer of the information. This means that a vital record can be immediately trusted and easily shared across different systems. Sharing records through a peer-to-peer encrypted channel further enhances privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide verification methods for partners and stakeholders</p>
<p>When it comes to vital records, digital copies will only be as useful in proportion to their adoption and verification. To have a successful solution businesses and organizations must be able to easily recognize and verify a vital digital record as an acceptable document.</p>
<p>More partners and stakeholders also bring their own points of view, priorities, and use cases; they may have ideas for adoption and use cases that you haven’t thought of yet!</p>
<p>Start somewhere</p>
<p>You need to make something. Excitement over an idea can spread easily, but progress cant happen until you have a prototype or proof of concept. Even if it’s not perfect, it drives feedback from stakeholders, customers, or partners.</p>
 Don’t 
<p>Get locked into a proprietary solution</p>
<p>Even if it’s a solution from a big name there’s alway the risk of loss of support or costly upgrades. Open-source code provides longevity—it’s something you can fully own, develop on as you see fit, or draw on new features being added to the codebase by other users. This is why governments are increasingly requiring open-source solutions in RFPs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait for the perfect solution</p>
<p>Several states have already implemented virtual driver’s licenses. The technology is mature and has already been deployed by many governments. As the technology evolves incremental changes are possible to keep your solution up to date.</p>
<p>Build a siloed solution</p>
<p>Interoperability is important to creating a vital record that is widely recognized. Building and testing your solutions with other compatible solutions guarantees your records will be easily verifiable.</p>
<p>A key takeaway here is that this technology is not difficult to integrate into current systems. All this data is already available in government databases. The addition of verifiable credentials allows people to better manage their own documents and have an extra layer of security and verification.</p>
<p>The effort to move vital records from paper file cabinets to digital wallets or files is both nuanced and exciting to the team here at Indicio.

 We need to improve privacy in the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">surveillance economy</a>. Data breaches have eroded consumer trust in organizations that collect and store their personal data and users urgently need to regain control. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/inside-the-massive-projected-growth-in-the-decentralized-identity-market/">Decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;enables selective disclosure around digital proof of identity, and we’re already seeing rapid uptake of this in government uses such as licenses and everyday applications such as gym memberships. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">Verifiable credentials</a>&nbsp;(VCs) have quickly become the “killer feature” of DI because they’re making selective disclosure of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">PII</a>&nbsp;possible and will drive DI’s&nbsp;ubiquity across the internet in the next decade.&nbsp; 



 The rise and rise of VCs has led to the widespread need for the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallet</a>, a massive growth area. 



 <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">Blockchain</a>&nbsp;is the anchor of&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in decentralized systems, and therefore DI is one of the most important use cases for blockchain technology.&nbsp; 



 DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity/">standards</a>&nbsp;are rapidly evolving to drive interoperability of DI solutions across the internet.&nbsp;

<p>Many organizations are turning to passwordless authentication solutions to secure their systems and remove vulnerabilities from identity management.</p>
<p>Discover magic link authentication—a secure, passwordless login method that simplifies user access and enhances security through unique URLs.</p>
 What Is Magic Link Authentication? 
<p>Magic link authentication is a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">passwordless authentication</a> method that allows users to log in to a website or application using a unique, one-time-use URL sent to their registered email address.</p>
<p>When users want to sign in, they enter their email address, and the system generates a “magic link,” which is then emailed to them. The user clicks on the link and is automatically logged into the website or application.</p>
<p>Magic links, like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/one-time-password/">one-time passwords</a>, are often time-sensitive, expiring after a certain period or once they have been clicked. This helps enhance security and reduces the chances of unauthorized access. Using magic links simplifies the login process but relies on the user’s email account, which could be a potential point of vulnerability in case of phishing attacks or email service issues.</p>
 How Does Magic Link Authentication Work? 
<p>Magic link authentication uses a “magic link,” or one-time-use URL sent to a user’s registered email address. This link facilitates specialized and time-based authentication that doesn’t rely on passwords.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:</p>
 
 User Access: Users who want to log in to a website or application enter their email address and request a magic link. 
 Link Generation: The system checks if the provided email address is associated with a registered user. If so, the system generates a unique and time-sensitive link that contains a token specific to that user and session. 
 Delivery: The system sends an email containing the magic link to the user’s registered email address, assuming only the user has access. 
 Token Validation: When the user clicks the link, the website or application receives the token via the user’s web browser and validates it across several criteria, including user credentials, time (has it expired?) or use (has it already been validated?). 
 Authentication: If the token is valid and corresponds to the correct user, the system logs the user in, granting them access to their account without requiring a traditional username and password. 
 Token Expiration: If the magic link is used for authentication or if a predetermined time passes, the token is invalidated. Any future attempts to use the link will result in rejection. 
 
<p>Some magic link authentication systems will use SMS alongside or in place of email. However, these are rare in widely-adopted consumer platforms (although they might be more realistically implemented in enterprise systems).</p>
 Are There Drawbacks to Using Magic Link Authentication? 
<p>This process seems relatively straightforward and, ideally, secure. It removes the necessity of using passwords which, as we’ve talked about in previous articles, removing passwords can significantly reduce an organization’s attack surface.</p>
<p>While magic link authentication offers several benefits, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider:</p>
 
 Dependency on Email: Magic link authentication relies on the user’s email account, which can be an issue if the email service is down or the user loses access to their email account. It also requires users to access their email whenever they want to log in, which might only sometimes be convenient. SMS can provide an alternative to circumvent this issue. 
 Vulnerability to Phishing Attacks: If users become more comfortable clicking links in emails, they may mistake phishing attacks for authentication emails. Therefore, it’s also critical that organizations offer training and education around technology. 
 Context-Specific Security: Magic link authentication might not be ideal for specific situations, such as when a high level of security is required or when compliance and regulations call for a specific approach to authentication. Magic links also do not support identity verification independently and can open up issues when such proof is required. 
 Delays: Users might experience a delay in the authentication process since they have to wait for the magic link to be delivered to their email inbox. The email containing the magic link may also be misidentified as spam and end up in the spam folder, complicating the login process. 
 Token Management: The server-side implementation of magic link authentication requires proper management of tokens, including generating, storing, and verifying them securely. This adds complexity to the system and could introduce vulnerabilities if not done correctly. 
 
<p>While magic link authentication has advantages, these drawbacks should be considered when deciding whether it’s the best choice for a particular website or application.</p>
 How Does Magic Link Authentication Support Passwordless Login? 
<p>Magic links support passwordless authentication by providing a secure and convenient alternative to traditional username and password combinations. Instead of relying on passwords, users authenticate themselves using unique, one-time-use URLs sent to their registered email addresses. Here’s how magic links enable passwordless authentication:</p>
 
 Simplicity: Magic links eliminate the need for users to remember, manage, and enter passwords, making the authentication process more straightforward and user-friendly. 
 Security: Since magic links are time-sensitive and generated on-demand, they offer a secure authentication method. They expire after being used or after a predetermined period, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. By not requiring users to enter passwords, magic links also help mitigate the risks associated with weak passwords, credential leaks, or password reuse. 
 Improved User Experience: Magic link authentication streamlines the login process, making it faster and more efficient. Additionally, if the user has access to their email via a mobile device (or they use SMS-based authentication), they can essentially authenticate themselves wherever they are. 
 Reduced Reliance on Passwords: Magic links reduce the dependence on passwords, which can be problematic due to forgotten or reused passwords and the need for regular password updates. Passwordless authentication through magic links can also reduce the burden on users and IT support. 
 
<p>With magic links, passwordless authentication offers a more convenient and potentially more secure method for users to access their accounts without relying on traditional passwords. However, it is essential to remember that this method depends on the user’s email account, which could be a potential point of vulnerability in case of phishing attacks or email service issues.</p>

The overall goal of the collaboration is to look with fresh eyes at the challenges and opportunities presented by an equitable decarbonisation of Europe’s land and buildings. We are heartened by the response that this blog series has generated so far and we will incorporate the insights into our future thinking and work. If you have any thoughts or reflections on this final blog (or on blogs <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">one</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-961744d2cb36">two</a> or <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada">three</a>) then please share them to progress this critical just transition conversation.</p> Part 4 (of 4): Network building: strategies to support and amplify the network of innovative organisations operating within Europe’s built environment  Boldly inviting a more regenerative and inclusive future to be discovered <blockquote>“It is exceptionally easy to become adjusted to catastrophe” — Adrienne&nbsp;Buller</blockquote><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada">Blog 3</a> of this series, we highlighted some inspiring examples of actors innovating in the social and ecological spaces of Europe’s transition. These sparks of fierce hope must be celebrated and bolstered, but we must also challenge ourselves to recognise and lean into the strategic gaps between them. If we want to move from lifeboats and beautiful exceptions to enduring social and spatial justice, we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent.</p>Mapping the density of alternative housing and land models in&nbsp;Europe<p>The gaps and inadequacies in the more intangible aspects of our political economy, have been surfacing with increasing frequency across many aspects of our work. Despite this initiative being focused on the specific context of Europe’s built environment, some institutional and social intelligence gaps are pervasive across all sectors. In our recent conversations we have started to think about these insufficiencies in terms of three strategic themes, as summarised below:</p><p>(1) A new cultural&nbsp;logic</p><p>In our view the current cultural logic for how we share and use assets and spaces in our cities is outdated and unjust. In the future, how can we think about creating a new Use Justice Economy, to unlock fundamentally different ways of coexisting in Europe’s built environment? The melting pot of our physical constraints and social thermodynamics is forging a new political landscape that we are ill equipped to navigate. We must therefore begin constructing the inclusive, everyday politics for a post-abundant yet just society. This will require designing and testing new generative public engagement processes, together with facilitating the R&amp;D that will be needed to support and evolve&nbsp;them.</p><p>(2) An interconnected understanding of civic&nbsp;value</p><p>The dominant economic theory of value is stifling appropriate adaptation and mitigation responses. Outdated accounting frameworks are no longer capable of capturing and presenting the intangible value of buildings and land (for example, the reduced levels of depression that are associated with co-housing models). They also ignore many of the associated risks and liabilities (such as the negative shared impacts on air quality of privately owned buildings continuing to be heated using fossil fuels). In reality, there are entire classes of assets that are missing from our investment and scenario plans; why for example are intangible public assets like preventative health still considered as a cost rather than an investment in governmental budgets? It is becoming apparent that the accounting, legal and investment frameworks of a just future are missing, whilst the existing versions will become increasingly obsolete as the constraint pressures escalate.</p><p>(3) Next generation institutions</p><p>As we have been writing these blogs a constant nagging question is the yes but…..How will many of the pathways we are suggesting be given the legitimacy and teeth to be impactful at the city, regional or country level? There is a clear need for an entire suite of next generation institutions; agile, multidisciplinary governance and decision-making vehicles, capable of building strategies and responses for the years of transition and beyond. Examples might include city land trusts (to collectively own and regulate the real estate prices), public-city banks (to receive and allocate funding on behalf of residents) or carbon and material city guardians (to measure and regulate the use of limited resources).</p> People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw&nbsp;stones <p>It is very easy to sit behind a screen, talking and writing about the opportunities and challenges of a just transition. We might leave our comfort zone at times, sharing our models for feedback and inviting others to critique and improve our thinking, but the consequences of our actions are limited. Yet what would our response be if we were actually held to account? If Dark Matter Labs was somehow granted carte blanche over EU decision making for a day, what policies or interventions would we introduce? Let’s suppose we had a large endowment; how would we allocate those funds and why? Or, if we were asked to play an orchestration role in coordinating the transition landscape, how would we&nbsp;proceed?</p><p>In reality, any strategy is restricted by the quality of the inputs that shape it. If we had the required resources and authority, we would therefore seek to rapidly increase the number and diversity of people who are able to interact with the problem space. Many people have an intuition of what could and probably should be happening, but having the time or resources to engage deeply with such ideas is a privilege reserved for the minority. We are well aware that writing blogs such as this one, is a well-intentioned yet wholly inadequate contribution towards democratising the response dialogues. In our view, socialising the constraints and implied response strategies, together with actively engaging citizens from across Europe in their design, is an absolute priority. If we had the agency we would co-create a playbook for the future, a kind of break glass in case of emergency set of policies, designed by the citizens of Europe for our shared&nbsp;futures.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@isawred?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">iSawRed</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> The evolving funding landscape: opening a space for collaborative dialogue <p>From a funding standpoint, our instinct is that any collectively intelligent strategic response could (and in fact should) include varied and co-existing approaches. If we start from a constraints frame and fan out towards an ecosystem of desired outcomes, there is the potential to build coherence across the system without limiting the scope of imaginative possibility. It seems likely that there are areas of interest, geographical points of focus, or thematic investments that can be interwoven to support the overall transition. Or, perhaps by collating narratives, ideas, case studies and conversations we could encourage new connections to form that are beyond our current perception. It feels important that we move beyond conversations about distributed power, to open space for aspects such as the equity and inclusivity of who is included (and / or centred). In our experience, there is a delicate balance between the desire to be regenerative by design and the constrictive arrogance that can be contained within that aspiration. This is an interesting point of tension that we aim to respect without surrendering our agency or accountability.</p><p>Encouragingly, we have recently observed an increasing appetite amongst funders to discuss and coordinate their strategies. This is an exciting and emerging area of our wider work and is explored in depth in our BeyondTheRules publications (for example in this <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/grantmaking-beyondtherules-8dfc752df3da">grantmaking provocation)</a>. At this point however, it is important to acknowledge that all the funders we interact with, already have deeply thoughtful and considered strategies in place. The following four groupings are therefore solely offered as prompts for discussion and reflection:</p><p>(1) Horizontal knowledge networks</p><p>How can we think about building the deep expertise needed to reimagine core components of the built environment? An example would be Community Land Trusts which have the potential to fundamentally change the unjust economic logic of land speculation. Encouragingly, the <a href="https://www.clteurope.org/">European CLT Network</a> will launch in June 2023 (with support from <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/">Laudes Foundation</a> and <a href="https://world-habitat.org/">World Habitat</a>) with the aim of scaling and deepening the impact of the CLT model across Europe. Despite this potential many challenges remain; for example, what kind of legislative changes will be needed across different geographies to support their wider uptake? How can we ensure they are not co-opted or exploited in the future? Will we need new accounting methodologies to represent their holistic&nbsp;value?</p><p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.youngfoundation.org/">Young Foundation</a> partnered with the <a href="https://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/">Community Land Trust Network</a> to bring together a group of researchers, to highlight barriers and opportunities in relation to diversity and inclusion in the CLT movement¹. A similar idea would be to analyse international best practice to identify existing and potential future pathway gaps. For example, a strong collaboration might be between the <a href="https://groundedsolutions.org/strengthening-neighborhoods/community-land-trusts">Grounded Solutions Network in the US</a>, <a href="https://www.communitylandscotland.org.uk/">Community Land Scotland</a> and a university research&nbsp;team.</p><p>(2) Moving from new economic demonstrators to full system demonstrators</p><p>System demonstrators intersect at multiple levels of the system; from mapping available land to designing new forms of finance or advocacy, thus shifting the boundaries of political possibility. If we think about eliminating vacant space in cities, what kind of actors would be needed to create viable operational models? How could they be replicated (or adapted) for varied geographies and contexts? How can we ensure robust knowledge sharing is built into their blueprint?</p><p>We conceive a system demonstrator to represent four intersecting elements:</p>  The physical, tangible demonstration of a new way of organising. For example, innovative multipurpose space use in a central district;  The system innovations that service it, such as holistic (multi-value) business plans and care agreements (as opposed to transactional contracts);  The market making infrastructure that will enable scaling (e.g.<a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/publications/public-common-partnerships-building-new-circuits-of-collective-ownership"> public-commons institutions</a> or inclusive planning&nbsp;laws);  The cultural conversations that are necessary to expand the Overton window and shift market dynamics.  <p>The coordination of these different threads is nuanced and complex. The space for creative divergence needs to be balanced with supportive, committed orchestration to drive the overall mission forwards. This is a critical area of collective capability which we believe will only be realised via deeply rooted place-based experimentation, combined with the development of technical tools and institutional reforms. Laudes currently supports some specific demonstrator projects, for example the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/press-releases/eit-climate-kic-and-partners-collaborate-with-laudes-foundation-to-advance-madrid-and-milan-sustainable-urban-approach-across-europe-2/">EU Cinco collaboration</a> which is showcasing projects for bio based and circular construction in Madrid and Milan. In the future, could we think about connecting demonstrators relating to different scales and contexts, to systemically amplify alternative visions and cultural attractors?</p><p>(3) Coordination / orchestration hubs</p><p>There is a vital requirement for actors who can play system facilitation roles in the built environment. Developing system capabilities is deep, complex work (with infinite unfolding directions and feedback loops) and thus requires reimagining our networks of governance. How can we begin designing and testing new types of highly agile institutions and equitable decision-making processes for this sector? For example, could cities with strong administrative innovation capacity (e.g. <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/innovation/">Amsterdam’s Innovation Unit</a> or <a href="https://www.stadtwohnen-chemnitz.de/arbeitsbereiche/">Chemnitz</a> in Germany) be facilitated to support hubs in emerging locations (e.g. <a href="https://ekyl.ee/en/">EKUL</a> in Estonia or <a href="https://restartukraine.io/">Restart Ukraine</a>)? Similar existing examples are the <a href="https://urbact.eu/who-we-are">EU EUBACT</a> that supports cities to coordinate and share knowledge and the <a href="https://www.alt-bau.eu/en/">ALT/BAU Transfer Network</a> that connects cities to activate unused and decaying housing&nbsp;stock.</p><p>(4) Distributed communities of practice and geographical hubs</p><p>Is there an opportunity to focus on core organisations who are centred on the inclusivity of ownership (e.g., CLTs, cooperative housing, other shared equity models) and support them to make the pathways for their operations (e.g, materials, governance, legals) and scaling (e.g, publicity, finance, policy) both more inclusive and regenerative? An example could be to look at the inclusivity of materials used in retrofitting and whether nature-based solutions could (a) improve the outcomes for low income groups in hot countries by reducing the costs of cooling (b) make the buildings more sustainable through carbon capture. Or, a cooperative housing network such as <a href="https://moba.coop/">MOBA</a> could potentially collaborate with an organisation in the same region (such as <a href="https://fundacjabrda.org/en/">Brda </a>in Poland) to improve the equitable and regenerative elements of their material procurement processes. In some cases this network could be enabled across contexts as a type of distributed community of practice. In others, a geographical capability hub might be more effective. In both cases the goal would be to strengthen or create the support pathways needed, for inclusive and regenerative scaling of the anchor&nbsp;model.</p><p>Alternatively, organisations who are creating these pathways could be supported individually, on the assumption that they will be needed for the future development and scaling of any collaborative housing models (including those that do not exist yet). These foundational pathway organisations could be conceptually clustered by theme; for example to address specific constraints (e.g. dematerialisation), or by leverage points in the system such as inclusive financing models.</p>Tracing potential networks of coherent collaboration The end comes before the beginning and the beginning comes after the&nbsp;end <p>At times during this project, looking for organisations who are working at the intersection of economic, ownership and governance issues, whilst concurrently striving for social inclusiveness and a regenerative future for Europe’s built environment, has felt like looking for a needle in a haystack. This is strangely reassuring! If the responses needed were clear and neatly packaged, we would most likely have missed the point. We are living through a complex, epoch-making moment that demands a planetary level of collective intelligence. In many respects, our understanding of the scale of Europe’s just transition challenge is only beginning to crystallise as we conclude this 4-part blog&nbsp;series.</p><p>We are grateful and honoured to be part of this community and look forward to continuing the conversation. Some immediate steps to move this work forwards are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  We will write a follow-up blog to respond to challenges, thoughts and suggestions that we have received in response to this initial blog&nbsp;series;  If you have an innovative model or idea that requires funding to scale or develop, then Laudes invite you to contact Laudes Foundation via this <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/contact">contact page</a> and address the enquiry to Alice Haugh in the Built Environment team;  Laudes is supporting a group of organisations to develop a collective theory of change to scale up the principles of collaborative housing across Europe: <a href="https://sostrecivic.coop/">Sostre Civic</a>, <a href="https://moba.coop/">MOBA</a>, <a href="https://www.urbamonde.org/?lang=en">UrbaMonde</a> and <a href="https://urbanlabtorino.it/projects/netco/?lang=en">NETCO</a>. This initiative is led by <a href="https://www.odsupport.eu/">ODS</a> and they will be attending the <a href="https://socialhousingfestival.eu/">International Social Housing Festival in Barcelona</a> (7–9th June) and <a href="https://urban-future.org/">Urban Future Festival in Stuttgart</a> (21–23rd of June). If this area of innovation appeals to you and is geographically practical then it could be a good opportunity to connect to this new&nbsp;network.  <p>The Dark Matter project team who co-authored this blog are Emily Harris (emily@darkmatterlabs), Aleksander Nowak (Aleks@darkmatterlabs), Vlad Afanasiev (vlad@darkmatterlabs) and Indy Johar (indy@darkmatterlabs).</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) <a href="https://www.youngfoundation.org/peer-research-network/projects/diversity-and-inclusion-in-community-land-trusts/">https://www.youngfoundation.org/peer-research-network/projects/diversity-and-inclusion-in-community-land-trusts/</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-part-4-89c7683bd2c7">Laudes x Dark Matter Labs: A just transition of Europe’s built environment (Part 4)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Have you been involved with acquiring a software product for your company? If you have, you know that finding and purchasing a solution that meets your specific enterprise needs can be a challenging process. We understand the difficulty that buyers face when trying to match vendor capabilities with business requirements. After reviewing multiple vendor solutions, product web pages, and data sheets, they all start to sound the same. And videos often focus more on the muzak and narration than on educating the viewer on a specific point. Free trial accounts provide rudimentary access to the product that does not give the user the ability to explore more complex use cases.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And today, we’ll hear some new ideas about open finance, open banking and definitely a bit more.</p>
<p>For that, we have our special guest today who is Michelle Beyo. She is the CEO and Founder of FINAVATOR, an award-winning payments and future of finance consultancy. She’s also a strategic adviser to FinTech’s, a Money 20/20 Rise Up alumni, a Global Council Member of Women in Payments, the Membership Chair at Canadian Prepaid Providers Organisation, a Payment Advisor at the National Crowdfunding and FinTech Association of Canada and a Board Member at Open Banking Initiative Canada.</p>
<p>Michelle started for FINAVATOR as she is passionate about payments and financial inclusion. She has 20 years of extensive industry experience, driving innovation across the retail and payments industry. Hello, Michelle.</p>
<p>Michelle Beyo: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. I’m really happy to have you here in the show.</p>
<p>Michelle: Happy to be here as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, Michelle, let’s talk about digital identity. I want to start hearing a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I’m happy to share a little bit. I actually spent 20 years in the corporate space. Six years in telco and eight years in online shopping affiliate marketing. Ran Alaska, Lufthansa, Delta, United online shopping mall platforms. I really got to understand the relationship between customer and loyalty infrastructure.</p>
<p>And then I moved into the payment space. Working for the largest prepaid company globally, called InComm, out of their international office for 30 countries. And was running sales and marketing, launched their B2B division, got to see what was happening in innovation across these 30 other countries, including Singapore, Australia, UK. Helped launch WeChat in North America at 711 through the Gift Card rail, QR payment system. And truly realised – a little fearful that my kids were going to end up with Asian banking. Due to the advancements, and how far beyond where we are in North America, that Asia basically was from a banking infrastructure set in 2017.</p>
<p>And I took a leap into the startup world focused on blockchain digital identity at a startup as a Chief Client Officer in 2018. And after a year with them and helping with Bahama digital ID infrastructure and helping consent on blockchain. I actually won Money 20/20 Rise Up. Where they picked out of 500 women, 30 women to come into the Vegas largest payments conference in the world and have a separate accelerated track.</p>
<p>And as soon as I found out that I had won one of this coveted 30 spots, I quit my job at the startup and started FINAVATOR. Which is actually now four years ago in July. And starting this consultancy, did not have any consultancy experience. But did have all of my background, which I felt was touching the future of finance from telco infrastructure to affiliate marketing, online shopping. The move to digital prepaid payment infrastructures, how they were backing all new challenger bank infrastructure, BaaS infrastructure, and then digital ID.</p>
<p>So FINAVATOR truly became my ability to try and help banks, credit unions, FinTechs and corporations move to the future of finance. And really have enjoyed my journey out on my own.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely quite interesting, because you have been involved in several industries that are pretty different itself. So many are, yeah, oriented to interacting with the customer. So, understanding how the customer – what the customer needs, etc. And then just in the last year, you came to identity. So now you have this amazing experience and you’re doing your own consultancy.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, you have been working on a lot of payments and that is leading you to the future of finance. So, the topics we’d like to start addressing today are open banking and open finance. So, if you can give us what are these two terms in a nutshell, what would you say?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. I think, at its simplest point – open banking, which started in the UK in 2017. Is a safe and secure way to share data in an ecosystem. So, thinking of back to my telco days, when I started. You would sign up to one provider for three years, and you couldn’t leave. If you left, there was a penalty, and your number was owned by that telco. So, if you went to a different telco because they had a better service, you’d basically lose your identity, which was your phone number. And have to send an email to all of your friends with your new number. And they would have to reprogram your phone number in their phones.</p>
<p>There was something called Open Telco. Or at least number portability, that was mandated in Canada and many other countries around 2015. And this allowed to empower the consumer to officially own their phone number. So, if I left one telco to go to another, I didn’t have to lose my identity, which I had built for, let’s say, 10 years. As this phone number represents myself. So, I was able to port it to a competitor to get better service.</p>
<p>So, to me, open banking is that same concept of having a safe and secure way to port my data. From one bank to another bank, from one bank to a FinTech, from a bank to a wealth advisor. So really just giving me the freedom that – the information that is mine, that defines me, can be utilised to help me get a better loan. Help me get a better rate, help me get the service that is customised to myself. Based on the data that happens to live with my current bank.</p>
<p>So open banking was a regulated movement that started in the UK to force the CMA 9, which is the nine biggest banks in the UK, to create an API that was standardised. To allow for safe and secure data sharing, that was all based on consumer consent. As well as create competition, by allowing FinTechs or third-party providers to hit a certain bar of the certification to be allowed in the system.</p>
<p>So, let’s say Revolut. If you were a Lloyds customer, and you wanted to go to Revolut. And you wanted Revolut to have these five pieces of data to offer you a different product that maybe had better pricing. You were able to do that through consent through the Revolut app. And that data was then able to safely port from Lloyds to Revolut.</p>
<p>And the biggest point, I think on all of this is – in open banking there is a right to delete your data. So that data can then be deleted and to me, this is creating less data in the world. And having more control over it as a consumer. As well as empowering new services, new offerings, new companies to help serve the underserved and help serve the current market in a better, more efficient way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And I like your analogy. You started talking analogy also in telecommunication in the mobile, consumer mobile networks. The mobile number portability, which is something I think at this point, I’m not sure it’s everywhere in the world. But I think it’s by large in many countries, it’s available and it’s something that today we take for granted. But it was very painful, not long ago, it was very painful as you have described.</p>
<p>So just the idea of having a similar easiness in translated to the to the banks sounds like a dream for the ones who still have not experienced. I have not experienced something like that yet. Yeah, so definitely it sounds like a great thing to keep it spreading. And you have summarised saying that this open banking is in a nutshell is securely sharing data of the consumers. So, one consumer can move from one bank to another, or even a FinTech as you mentioned so.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, and I think the evolution of that is open finance. Which I would say is a hot topic in today’s market. The UK is moving to PSD 3, which is bringing them to open finance. Australia started with open data as a concept through a Consumer Data Right for all citizens across five industries. Which I think is the most concise vision across all countries. So, they started with open banking, moved to open finance, open telco, open energy, and then they’re going to land in open data. And it’s all centred around a Consumer Data Right across all data.</p>
<p>Very empowering vision coming out of Australia, that many countries are just starting with open finance. Turkey, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, just moved to open finance. So just to describe it – it really is, instead of just being banking, FinTech, third-party payments data or bank account data. It’s broadening the spectrum to the insurance, wealth, mortgages. Kind of more of a holistic view of anything that touches your finances. So, it’s really expanding to allow you to port your data from multiple different aspects of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So, the key here in open finance is that you do similar – let’s say portability. We use it, we use the same word between different services. Not necessarily financial services, but as you said, that touch some financial data, correct?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yes. So if you want to use some data from your Lloyds account to help you get a faster, cheaper, better mortgage that’s more customised to you. Maybe that mortgage provider is not a bank, but they’re a licensed mortgage provider that has certified in the system. Then you’d be able to facilitate that data sharing, same example to a wealth provider or an insurance provider.</p>
<p>Oscar: Alright. And besides that, benefits of the portability that we can, I can even visualise on my mind. What are the other benefits that there are for both the consumers and for businesses?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I would say one of the biggest ones is – when you think of FinTechs trying to get certain aspects of data. And not having to get data they don’t need – so only getting the five pieces of data, with clear consent from the customer. And the customer not having to screen scrape this data out of their account without their knowledge.</p>
<p>So, a lot of screen scraping issues are when open banking first came to fruition in the UK. It’s largely because 1 million UK citizens were screen scraping. Which is a service that is being utilised where it looks like you’re logging into your bank. You’re putting in your passcode, and then it’s giving access to that FinTech to look at your overarching account and scrape the whole data. To only grab the five pieces they need to push it into the system.</p>
<p>So, what this does is [A] it’s unsecure. [B] the customer has no idea they’re breaching their bank agreement by using the service. And then the FinTech ends up with all this data that they don’t need, or want. Have to store it safely and securely, when they only needed the five pieces.</p>
<p>So, when you get to an open banking system, they request the five pieces, they get the five pieces in a safe, secure type of API. And then, therefore, they’re able to delete those five pieces of data, because the way that it was coded into the system, if so requested by the customer. So, it’s a data management system, all based on consent.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds pretty good absolutely. Because imagine that all my data that is on my bank is passed to the – let’s say insurance. And then the insurance has the duty to delete whatever they don’t need as well, sounds terrible. Because you know, the less data that is transferred, the less data that is stored somewhere, the lower the risk of so many data breaches that are happening nowadays.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, on the data breach point, I always like to bring up unfortunately Marriott because they had 7.1 million data breach occurrences at one time, and it was an internal issue. They were like layering in some accounting, or loyalty system and it was an internal data breach. And this was back I think in 2018. They didn’t compensate any of the users. But think about anytime you check into a hotel. At this point, they asked for your driver’s license or your passport, plus your credit card. The amount of data a hotel has on you is pretty concerning, considering they don’t have the data security standards that you would have at a bank.</p>
<p>So, if we can get to a world – getting to your digital identity questions. Where a QR check in doesn’t actually have them store any of my data, but just validate I am who I say I am. So that they don’t need to actually hold my actual passport image with all of my sensitive data. In a non-secure, I don’t want to say non-secure, but not highly secure infrastructure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Another good example, obviously, the hotels. They will benefit, both the businesses and the consumers would benefit with open finance. And yes, I start – while you explain this idea, I was, OK, some of the data passes from one, let’s say from the bank to the insurance company. But just a minimum should be passing, so that – also thinking from the identity point of view. I’m imagining the federation, right? So, at this point, what is on your view the role of identity on this paradigm that you just described?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think it’s quite paramount as a base layer to most systems. Because if you can authenticate you are who you say you are, that’s the most important part of any one transaction. Especially a transaction that has to do with your data or has to do with your finances. So, I think it’s quite crucial that we find a way that authenticates ourselves. Especially with AI, and all of this machine learning infrastructure, cybersecurity challenges.</p>
<p>How do we ensure that we are the only entity that is Michelle Beyo and that I can then surely authenticate myself? Before I do a data share from one bank to the other, or before I do a financial transaction. And we’re going to have to layer up from our six-digit code being sent to a phone text to authenticate yourself. As we move forward in the future of finance. So, I think digital identity is crucial. And has to be put into a system, in a way that ensures that there’s only one identity for any one person.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. There has to be some level of strong authentication, that that is a must. And as you have mentioned a bit earlier also, always with a consent, inevitably, data sharing transactions.</p>
<p>Now, moving into what are the standards to also understand – without going into too much detail. You mentioned that this started in UK and in UK, there more implementations. This is really happening in real, but what are the main standards that are making this possible? Or are going to make this even more possible if we think of open finance?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. So you know, what’s interesting is – as you look at the world at the moment, and you look at open banking, open finance. Not all countries have a digital identity infrastructure. So, what that does is makes the open banking infrastructure more complex, harder to authenticate. And I think even more than open banking –&nbsp; real-time rail infrastructure needs the authentication. Digital identity for any type of fraud reduction of authenticating you are who you say you are, and it’s going to an entity who is authenticated. So that we can remove the scams out of the system.</p>
<p>I’d say the best digital identity infrastructure is probably the Indian-based UPI. It was government issued; it was a mass amount of people. And it was done very early on, on a global scale. It’s not the exact model that probably should be utilised for other countries. But they have definitely – through their digital identity framework, have been able to even. There’s homeless people in India with QR codes and a bank account due to their digital identity infrastructure. And when you pass them in the streets or you pass a tiny shop selling something, they have QR-based payment infrastructure that is largely attached to their digital identity. Which creates a more financial inclusive infrastructure.</p>
<p>In Australia, they have a digital identity framework but it’s not as widespread to the same degree as India. The UK is still working on their digital identity infrastructure. So not every country has lined up, open banking, digital identity and real-time rail. But these are three very crucial aspects to the future of finance because the authentication from digital ID is a safety point. The real-time rail is the fast and secure movement of the funds. And the open banking is the safe, consent-driven data sharing aspect. So, once you have all three of them, you’re really setting yourself up to be facilitating the future of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned one term that maybe is not so familiar, at least for me, you mentioned real, real-time rail. What is that exactly?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, they’re real-time rail is an instant payment system, sometimes called that. And the first one ever created was in Switzerland, actually, in 1989, 66 countries have faster payment systems. The UK launched quite a long time ago. But the US just launched their FedNow, that is what it’s called in the US. Which is their real-time instant payment rail, just this year. And Canada hasn’t launched theirs just yet. So, there’s many countries who have this payment infrastructure. When you look at the US last year, or Canada, still, it takes three days, three to five days for bank payments to clear and that’s just the older infrastructure of payment settlement.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, OK. Perfect. Yes, indeed, you have emphasised that all these components needed in, of course, the authentic the national digital identification is a key point. You are correct, not many countries in the world have something, I will say, suitable enough for doing this open finance. I was – in terms also of authentication that reminded me that, for instance, the FinTechs has been for a while. And not long ago the authentication was just username and password, nothing else. So, of course, now, most of the FinTechs have something better than that. But yeah, I can see something that it takes time. All this component takes time to come together to make possible some of these use cases.</p>
<p>So, if you can tell us some of these success stories, now seeing from the perspective of use cases. Let’s say success stories from, if you can, from different part of the world also to illustrate it better.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, so if we’re talking digital identity, I think Scandinavia has done probably one of the best jobs. I think Estonia was one of the first. The other really crucial part of digital identity is you can’t have CBDC, or digital currency in a very safe and secure way without a digital identity framework. So, I think there’s some great examples down that front.</p>
<p>When we’re talking open finance, open banking, the countries I’m most impressed by, obviously, is Australia. They are a country that has five major banks. They are kind of an oligopoly in the sense that those five banks hold quite a bit of the customer base. But they took an initiative past open banking, past open finance, to embed a consumer data rights to every citizen across five different industries with a roadmap to start with open banking. Moved to open finance, open telco, open energy, land with open data, which is really future proofing their country, for the future of the ecosystem. A digital ecosystem, which every business is now turning into a digital business.</p>
<p>So, they’re going to have a really great base layer of understanding that the customer owns the data, the customer is able to port the data, and the customer is able to delete the data. So, by creating a data right infrastructure, and then porting it across multiple industries. I think they’re going to have incredible innovation and eyes are definitely on them as they’re enabling this ecosystem. That really is kind of the future of any one country’s vision of how do you enable digitisation of an economy.</p>
<p>The other country that I’m pretty impressed by is Brazil. In the sense that in the middle of the pandemic, they made their first move to open banking. They made a 12-month mandate that they were going to hit an open banking live ecosystem within 12 months. And open access to their Central Bank of Brazil. And therefore, by opening the access to registered TTPs, which are Third-Party Providers. Companies, like Pix, were able to create a FinTech that reduced the cost of sending money and took the underbanked, underserved in Brazil, and gave them a digital bank with faster, more affordable payments. And I don’t have the exact number. But I believe they’re past 7 million customers and doing billions of transactions on a daily basis. And I believe they reduced the cost something like by 40%, by being able to have direct access to the central bank and fall directly in line with the open banking system.</p>
<p>And after 12 months of being enabled to an open banking system, they immediately started working on an open finance system, and are launching that within 12 months. So, I think the alignment, the passion, and the execution out of the Brazilian market is pretty impressive. And just the pure enablement of new FinTechs that are more affordable services. And finding ways to serve the underbanked, underserved, they’ve done a phenomenal job.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds like that – it sounds definitely amazing. Among all these, well, existing use cases and what comes in the future for open banking and open finance, what are some potential privacy issues that you could tell us?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think every system has to be truly based in a liability model. This liability model has to be extremely clear to everybody within the system. There has to be protection on that liability model. And I think it’s just ensuring that the certification system that allows for third parties to come into the system is robust, is reviewed, that these parties that have been certified inclusive of banks are always looked at to ensure that they’re continued to be certified to have access to the system.</p>
<p>But I do foresee in the future that customers are going to choose to have some type of insurance on their data. That they so choose, just like you have insurance on your travel, or insurance on your health, like actual data privacy insurance.</p>
<p>Because – think of the Marriott issue, or gosh, there’s data breaches every day of the week, and none of the data breaches have to do with open banking, open finance, they’re internal data breaches or external data breaches, or hacks. That there’s no real repercussion to the customer, like, or to the actual party who has had this data breach. There might be a fine, but there’s no settlement to the actual end user whose data has been potentially put on the dark web or given to different parties.</p>
<p>There’s got to the point where, if we have enough of a safe and secure data sharing infrastructure, we should be able to insure our data and be safe and secure. And if it’s breached, have some type of offset. But we have to get to a much safer secure infrastructure of how data is shared in the first place.</p>
<p>So, I just truly see that open banking, open finance is creating the pipes for the water to go through and be able to turn them on and turn them off. And we just don’t have those pipes today in every country. And I think it’s just super important for the next layer of the future of finance.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. Now, if we look at the future, what kind of use cases or what open finance can do in the future? Something that we are not seeing today.</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah. So, in some countries, they started to enable dashboards, like holistic dashboards of your financial health. So, in these dashboards due to open banking, you would be able to see what your mortgage is. And then it would be able to AI predict what other offerings you should potentially layer in. To add to this product, or tell you that your current mortgage is not serving you. And that there’s three or four other offerings that would be a better mortgage based on your current finances, or the market. And then they’d be able to offer you three different companies that you might want to look into.</p>
<p>So, what this service can then do is you can actually put in your loans – this dashboard would be personalised, just for you to see kind of your financial health. It would help people have an ability to plan better, understand their finances a little bit better. From that perspective, I think it’s going to also create a whole bunch of things we haven’t even thought of, new services, new opportunities, and new ways to ensure you’re saving for your retirement.</p>
<p>Just kind of like round up did in the sense of, you know, if you’re paying for coffee, and it’s $1.50, rounding it up, or if it’s $1.40, rounding it up to $1.50 and then putting that in your pension plan or putting that into a robo-advisor. So that you’re earning money by saving without knowing it, or without feeling it, kind of perspective. So, I think just like the Internet has changed so many ways of what we are doing, and made our lives easier, in many ways. I do think that open finance, layered in with a digital identity can truly help us plan better, execute, have better offerings, save money, and really just be able to plan better for our future.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, sounds definitely a lot to expect for the future what open finance will bring us. So, Michelle, last question for you, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, I think what they should write is that innovation is driven by ideas. And that there’s an opportunity, especially now that the world has gone digital, to listen in to panels, topics that interests you, but you don’t have all the details on, similar to this podcast.</p>
<p>There’s panels happening in Australia on open finance, or Brazil, that you could listen into. You don’t actually have to travel to these conferences. But you can truly grasp the innovation that’s happening in other countries. And then think about how you can create something for your citizens, for your company. To pivot and start moving towards the future of finance, by learning from other countries who are already there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, I couldn’t agree more. And that’s really one, learning more about these interesting topics that are going to impact us mostly positively in today, in the future is also one reason why we invited you. So, thank you. Thanks a lot for being with us and this was really fascinating conversation with you, Michelle. If people would like to follow the conversation with you, or know more about what you’re doing, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Michelle: Yeah, definitely to follow me on LinkedIn. Simply find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellebeyo/">Michelle Beyo</a>, follow <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/finavator/">FINAVATOR</a> on LinkedIn and <a href="http://www.michellebeyo.com/">Michelle Beyo</a> as well as reaching out to us on our website at <a href="http://www.finavator.com/">finavator.com</a>.</p>

  The EU’s new MiCA regulation holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer losses, representing a major shift towards increased protection and transparency in the&nbsp;sector.  MiCA regulation introduces significant compliance challenges for crypto exchanges while promising enhanced user protection, potentially boosting confidence and cryptocurrency adoption.  The MiCA regulation could set a global precedent for cryptocurrency regulation, emphasizing the delicate balance between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation in the rapidly advancing field of cryptocurrencies.  <p>Europe’s ascent as the “World’s biggest cryptocurrency economy” is underscored by several telling statistics. In 2020 alone, the continent <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/09/29/europe-is-now-the-world-s-cryptocurrency-capital#:~:text=Europe%20is%20now%20the%20world's%20biggest%20cryptocurrency%20economy%2C%20with%20the,blockchain%20data%20firm%20Chainalysis%20found.">received over 870 billion Euros in crypto</a>. Moreover, the Central, Northern, and Western Europe regions accounted for a quarter of the global cryptocurrency activity.</p><p>Significantly, between July 2020 and June 2021, transfers from large institutional investors mushroomed from 1.2 billion Euros to 39.6 billion Euros, highlighting the escalating crypto activities in the region and setting the stage for imminent regulatory interventions.</p><p>In response to this burgeoning crypto economy and a series of high-profile incidents leading to significant customer losses, the European Union has enacted a sweeping set of regulations. The newly introduced Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p><p>This fundamental shift in the handling of digital assets is aimed at providing a protective shield for investors. By imposing higher standards of transparency, data security, and operational integrity on exchanges, the rules promise to enhance protection and reliability for customers.</p><p>Beyond Europe, these pioneering regulations could act as a blueprint for the global crypto industry, stimulating broader acceptance of such rules while presenting significant compliance challenges for crypto exchanges.</p><p>As the EU navigates this new terrain, the balancing act between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation could shape the future of the crypto industry worldwide.</p> EU’s Landmark Crypto&nbsp;Rules <p>On 16th May 2023, the European Union adopted a regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), initiating a continent-level legal framework for the crypto industry for the first time. The regulatory framework would apply to crypto assets, asset issuers, and crypto-asset service providers.</p><p>The provisions on assets issuers and e-money tokens will apply from 12 months after entry into force, expected to be spring 2024. Other provisions of MiCA will apply from 18 months after entry into force (i.e., in the second half of&nbsp;2024).</p> Significance of the&nbsp;Rules <p>The rules will hold providers liable for losing investors’ crypto assets. All 27 EU member states need to comply with these rules from 2024&nbsp;onwards.</p><p>Under these new rules, providers mean utility token issuers, issuers of asset-referenced tokens and stablecoins, providers of trading venues, and wallet services.</p><p>The aim behind introducing the regulations is to safeguard investor assets, maintain stability in the system, and allow the sector to become more attractive for its trustworthiness and innovation.</p> A Brief History of the EU Cryptocurrency Regulations <p>The attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies do not start with the introduction of MiCA. While the EU presented the MiCA proposal in September 2020, regulatory attempts toward crypto have been prevalent since&nbsp;2013.</p>  2013: The first official statements and analysis on virtual currencies came from the European Banking Authority.  2014: The EBA identified more than seventy risks arising from virtual currencies for all possible sorts of market participants. The EBA also suggested measures to deal with governance, capital requirements, and segregation of client accounts.  2016: The European Central Bank analyzed virtual currency schemes and acknowledged the potential advantages of virtual currencies despite an overall negative assessment.  2017: The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued a report on Distributed Ledger Technology and its application to Securities markets.  Early 2018: The European Parliament commissioned two reports. One was on virtual currencies and Central banks’ monetary policy. The second was on the fight against the illicit use of cryptocurrencies.  Late 2018: The Financial Stability Board released a paper on the crypto assets market and its financial stability implications.  2019: The International Monetary Fund singled out supervisory and regulatory elements to assist policymakers.  2020: It was only on 24th September that the European Commission introduced the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) proposal as part of a larger digital finance&nbsp;package.  2021: On 24th November 2021, the council adopted its negotiating mandate on&nbsp;MiCA.  2022: On 31st March, the tripartite co-legislative discussions started. The discussions ended with a provisional agreement struck on June 30th,&nbsp;2022.  2024: By July 2024, stablecoin-related provisions will come into&nbsp;effect.  2025: By this year, the remaining provisions of MiCA, other than those related to the issuance of asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens, are anticipated to come into&nbsp;effect.  <p>The rules discussed in this article are seen as the formal adoption of the regulation.</p> What led to These new Regulations? <p>The need for crypto regulations, chronicled in the timeline above, has always been there in the Europe market. Yet, a few incidents in the global crypto market made it all the more necessary and relevant.</p><p>One of the most prominent of these incidents was the collapse of FTX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Not only did it impact the European crypto market, but it also sent shockwaves at a global level as the founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s fortune depleted from nearly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/18/how-did-crypto-firm-ftx-collapse">US$16 bn to zero</a> within&nbsp;days.</p><p>Another incident that made people aware of the potential risks of volatility in the crypto market was the collapse of stablecoin Terra. Within a week in 2022, the stablecoin Terra and its sister token Luna collapsed, wiping out as high as nearly half a trillion USD from the crypto&nbsp;markets.</p> The New Regulations Details <p>One has to remember that nearly all of these funds lost in the incidents cited above were customer assets, either in the form of investments or deposits. In a bid to prevent such losses, the new rules hold crypto-asset service providers liable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p> Crypto Exchange Liable for Customer&nbsp;Losses <p>The rules want the issuers of asset-referenced tokens to have an adequate custody policy for their reserve assets to prevent loss and preserve the value of the&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The crypto-asset service providers should also be held liable for losses incurred from incidents relating to Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Such incidents might include cyber attacks, theft, or malfunctions.</p><p>Service providers, issuers of asset-referenced tokens, and e-money tokens will also be held liable for the information they have offered in a crypto-asset white&nbsp;paper.</p> In Focus: Traceability of Crypto Assets and Crypto Consumer Protection <p>Apart from holding exchanges liable for customer losses, other key components of the regulation deal with the traceability of crypto assets, consumer protection, etc. For instance, the rules want to ensure that crypto assets stay traceable.</p><p>The council also wants its rules to create adequate arrangements for “enhanced consumer protection” and “safeguards against market manipulation and financial crime.”</p><p>The EU also wants crypto providers to share their energy consumption details. Moreover, all providers will need to have a license to issue, trade, and safeguard crypto assets, tokenized assets, and stablecoins.</p> Crypto Licensing and Non-compliance Penalties <p>Crypto service providers operating without a license will have to go through inclusion in an ESMA (European Securities and Market Authority) public registry. In this registry, these unlicensed providers will document their non-compliance.</p> Implications for Exchanges <p>The most radical step is that exchanges will be held liable for losing investors’ crypto assets. Also, in ensuring traceability, the exchanges need to ensure that they have a mechanism to trace crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>MiCA traceability requirement is not a new concept, however, as it is similar to how banks keep a trace of money transfers.</p><p>But it cannot be denied that traceability in crypto assets is a double-edged sword. While it enhances security and regulatory compliance, it also raises critical concerns about user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Although exchanges have no option but to implement traceability, as MiCA makes it mandatory, they must ensure meticulous data governance and robust encryption methods to protect user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Transparency about these practices is crucial, with users having the right to know what data is collected, its use, and protective measures in place. It is paramount to strike a balance between security, regulation, and privacy in this ever-evolving cryptocurrency space.</p><p>In case of suspicious transactions, exchanges should ensure they have appropriate blocking mechanisms in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Besides these, the exchanges will also have to declare their energy consumption details and apply for operating licenses.</p> Potential Crypto Exchange Challenges <p>Putting up a robust compliance process could always be challenging. The exchanges will have to ensure zero scopes of technological vulnerability. Additionally, they need to ensure that operations are at par with what has been committed in the whitepapers.</p> Compliance Strategies for Crypto Exchanges <p>To cope with several compliant requirements enforced under MiCA, exchanges have no options but to make operational adjustments. For instance, the rules necessitate enhanced monitoring of exchanges’ source and destination addresses.</p><p>Adhering to FATF regulations could no doubt contribute to a robust and streamlined compliance process. However, exchanges will require a Travel Rule Solution, such as Shyft Veriscope, to comply with the FATF Travel Rule requirements while protecting their customers’ user experience and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>More on Shyft Veriscope’s capabilities: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Shyft Veriscope — The Critical Infrastructure Underpinning FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> Implications for Customers <p>The rules do not apply to P2P transfers. However, transactions above 1,000 Euros from self-hosted wallets come under their purview as and when they connect to wallets hosted by crypto asset service providers.</p> Crypto Consumer Protection <p>Authorities insist that these rules seek to reduce opportunities for intrusion into the system. Hence, hacks, breaches, and data security concerns — all could be reduced if these sets of rules are properly followed.</p> Impact on Crypto Consumer Confidence and&nbsp;Behavior <p>Enhanced consumer protection and transparency in the system would increase the sector’s attractiveness. It will improve credibility and trust, potentially resulting in improved traction and adoption of crypto in the&nbsp;country.</p> Impact on the Global Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>Regulation of crypto asset exchanges would involve collecting and transferring data between different jurisdictions.</p><p>In many cases, one party would be a jurisdiction outside Europe. However, successfully completing the transaction would require exchanges in that jurisdiction to stay compliant with European regulations.</p> Global Influence of EU Crypto Regulations <p>With the EU getting its house in order, other parts of the world, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, will have to keep up with the EU regulations.</p><p>Other countries in the European region, such as Switzerland and the UK, known for their happening local crypto scene, will be impacted as well, despite not being a member of the 27-nation bloc.</p> Switzerland <p>In Switzerland’s case, given the intricate web of business relationships with the EU, Swiss crypto companies must check if MiCA or another EU rule, MiFID II, affects them, especially when dealing with certain tokens like securities.</p><p>Also, MiCA brings unique rules for “stablecoins,” requiring issuers to have an EU-based office and a special&nbsp;license.</p><p>These changes demand Swiss crypto businesses to quickly understand MiCA’s impact and determine which services they can offer from Switzerland to EU countries and what tokens need a special document, the “crypto asset whitepaper,” to be recognized in the&nbsp;EU.</p> The United&nbsp;Kingdom <p>The UK has decided on a phased regulatory approach. It might start with stablecoins and then continue with unbacked crypto assets. This strategy is set to interplay with the European Union’s Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Even though the UK is no longer an EU member, the ripple effects of MiCA regulations can’t be&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>With MiCA creating a unified framework for crypto assets across the EU, UK-based companies offering crypto services in the EU will need to adapt. Compliance with MiCA, regardless of the UK’s local regulations, will become essential for firms looking to operate within the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>On the flip side, the far-reaching and comprehensive nature of MiCA may influence the UK’s phased regulatory approach. It could also serve as a potential blueprint for UK regulators, particularly when moving towards unbacked crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Middle East &amp;&nbsp;Asia <p>The new framework could potentially reconfigure cross-border digital asset transactions involving EU, Middle East, and Asian entities. Given the substantial number of Asian and Middle Eastern businesses and individuals engaged in crypto-related activities within the EU, the MiCA regulations could potentially impact asset flows, particularly those dealing with certain crypto assets subject to more stringent MiCA requirements.</p><p>Moreover, the increased regulatory oversight under MiCA may instigate a realignment of crypto asset flows, potentially diverting some towards jurisdictions with less stringent regulations. Crypto businesses or investors looking for a more flexible regulatory environment might consider migrating their operations or investments to territories with more lax&nbsp;rules.</p><p>The Middle East and parts of Asia, which have been comparatively less stringent in their approach to crypto regulation, could become attractive destinations for such shifts. However, this could also lead to a double-edged sword scenario where the increase in crypto activities could prompt these regions to establish more robust regulatory frameworks, echoing the rigorous standards of the EU’s&nbsp;MiCA.</p> United States <p>Major US crypto businesses, like Genesis, Gemini, and Bittrex, have had legal troubles, making others in the industry worry about the future. Big player Coinbase is now asking for clear rules for crypto companies, pushing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to make a decision.</p><p>In contrast, the EU has been working hard to create rules that protect customers and promote new ideas in the crypto industry. Their rulebook, MiCA, provides clear instructions for companies working with crypto. This not only helps protect people using these services but also builds trust in crypto businesses. It even encourages more use of the technologies behind crypto, like blockchain.</p><p>Other countries, including the US, may look to MiCA as an example when making their rules. While the US is currently dealing with different rules from different bodies, it could learn from the EU’s clear and practical approach. It’s crucial for the US to find a balanced and flexible way to manage crypto, promoting new ideas while ensuring companies follow the&nbsp;rules.</p> The Potential Impact of MiCA Regulations on DeFi Protocols <p>The new MiCA regulations have sparked questions within the crypto community, particularly about their impact on DeFi protocols. The language of the regulations is complex, causing some debate about whether they even apply to DeFi. Some reports suggest they&nbsp;don’t.</p><p>Despite this, it’s wise for funds looking to invest in decentralized finance and DeFi protocols to prepare for compliance. Even if certain decentralized activities seem unaffected by the rules, the broad scope of the regulations could still touch various aspects of DeFi operations.</p> Frequently Asked Questions: Fast Check on Everything MiCA  Q1: What is the new MiCA regulation introduced by the&nbsp;EU? <p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is a new set of rules introduced by the European Union to regulate crypto assets, their issuers, and service providers. A vital component of this regulation is that it holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p> Q2: Why has the EU introduced this regulation now? <p>The introduction of this regulation comes in response to the growing prevalence and influence of cryptocurrencies within the European economy, as well as several high-profile incidents that have led to significant customer losses. The intent is to protect investors and provide a more stable and trustworthy framework for the operation of the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p> Q3: What are the implications of these regulations for crypto exchanges? <p>Crypto exchanges will now be held to higher standards of transparency, data security, and operational integrity. They will be directly accountable for any customer losses, which means they will need to ensure robust security measures and operational protocols are in&nbsp;place.</p> Q4: How will these regulations impact customers? <p>Customers stand to benefit from enhanced protection and greater reliability in the crypto sector. These regulations aim to reduce the risk of losses due to incidents like hacks, breaches, and data security concerns.</p> Q5: Do these regulations have any implications outside of the&nbsp;EU? <p>Yes, these regulations could potentially shape the global crypto industry. They could act as a blueprint for other significant players like the United States and the United Kingdom, stimulating broader acceptance of such&nbsp;rules.</p> Q6: What challenges can crypto exchanges expect as a result of these regulations? <p>Compliance with these regulations will be a significant challenge for crypto exchanges. They will need to ensure they have zero technological vulnerabilities and that their operations are in line with commitments made in their whitepapers. They will also need to apply for operating licenses and declare their energy consumption details.</p> Q7: How will these regulations impact the future of the crypto industry? <p>The regulations represent a significant step in the evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. By striking a balance between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation, these rules could shape the future trajectory of the crypto industry not just in the EU but worldwide.</p> Looking Ahead: The Future of EU and Global Crypto Regulation <p>As the landscape of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, the trajectory of these new regulations remains to be fully discerned. If judiciously implemented and navigated with an understanding of their subtleties, these rules could potentially set a regulatory precedent for the rest of the world to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>The task ahead for the EU is multifold: it must diligently safeguard investor interests and curb potential misuse of funds. At the same time, it carries the responsibility to ensure that regulatory frameworks do not stifle innovation but instead foster growth in this rapidly advancing, technology-driven field of cryptocurrencies. The delicate balance between regulation and innovation will define the future of the crypto industry not just in Europe but globally.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency-5c0778bb11c1">MiCA Paving the Way: From Liability to Transparency</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Protocol Engineer Philipp Krüger gave a presentation on WNFS, or Webnative File System, at IPFS Thing 2023 in Brussels, Belgium. In his presentation, he gave a comprehensive yet approachable breakdown of how we constructed our versioned and encrypted file system built on top of IPFS.</p><p>When Fission set out to create an encrypted file system that would respect user agency, it needed to meet three criteria: </p>  Users would be able to take their data with them anywhere and control who had access to it  It would be available both online and offline, ensuring access no matter the user's level of connectivity  It could be shared on different devices and types of apps (for example, you could share your data on a music app on your mobile phone and a photo app on your desktop)  <p>Developers are used to running a server to hold user data when publishing an app online. During the prototyping process, dummy data is often stored in the browser. We realized that if we made the browser capable of running production data, it would ensure the data was local-first and private (because the data would never have to leave the device itself).</p> Our Frenemy, The Browser <p>So we began working with the browser to make this a reality. The first step was working with the WebCrypto API, which makes non-extractable key pairs possible. In addition, we wanted to ensure revocability, so we created asymmetric key pairs per app/device. </p> Access Control <p>Once decrypted, data is readable in the hostile browser environment. Therefore, we needed to give not just access control but fine-grained access control. We go by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">Principle of Least Authority (POLA)</a> to ensure the user only shares what they want to share.</p><p>To do this, we encrypt all of the files. However, all those keys can be difficult to manage, so we use the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-the-skip-ratchet/">skip ratchet</a> (our CTO Brooklyn's invention!) to organize them. This also gives us temporal and snapshot access control. </p>Source: Philipp KrügerSource: Philipp Krüger Data Persistence and Key Recovery <p>The browser may delete local storage, so data persistence and key recovery are two important considerations. </p><p>We use IPFS to persist encrypted data outside of the browser. IPFS also has a garbage collection feature, so to be absolutely sure that data is not deleted, the user may want to store their data on a machine they keep online (i.e., their own personal node) or utilize a pinning service. Fission does not run a pinning service, but we currently persist all user file systems for free.</p><p>Key recovery can be handled by linking a device with more reliable permanent storage for your secret keys (this can be done using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper/blob/5c1fba894a9fe51811e47865ed62d26e989a0807/accounts/login/awake.md#L4">AWAKE</a> protocol). Another option is to download a recovery kit from the dashboard app (or, in the future, from any app that supports something like it).</p> Concurrent Writes <p>A file system should have concurrent writes so editing can occur offline and multiple authorized users can edit without issue. We achieve this using a cryptographic tree structure (cryptree) that gives every file and folder a unique key. This enables offline access control while keeping the data encrypted and portable. </p><p>But what if two valid writes need to be consolidated? How do we determine which is the "correct one"? WNFS will merge them both by creating a directory that has both changes while also linking back to the previous data (using CRDTs) so nothing gets deleted. Then we leave it up to each app developer to determine how they want to query the history in the API and figure out how to do app-specific merges.</p>Source: Philipp Krüger Privacy &amp; Security <p>Previously we explained that it is important for users to have fine-grained access control because it supports user agency and resolves the issue of decrypted data in the browser. </p><p>When the user does share data with someone else, whether it's an individual or an app, this action should reveal as little metadata as possible. That's why we verify valid writes without read access (using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>), scramble the file hierarchy, create a flat namespace (using the CRDT structure), and split files into chunks so no one can distinguish file size.</p> Getting Started <p>The Rust 🦀 implementation of WNFS (<a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/rs-wnfs">rs-wnfs</a>) is available now.</p><p>You can also join our <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg">working group</a> and attend the monthly community calls or view the <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmaps/issues/2?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmaps%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">project's roadmap</a> to track our progress, get involved, and learn about upcoming features.</p>

               <p>Consumer trends and why fashion industries are changing their brand position</p>
<p>There’s been a huge shift in the way consumers demand Transparency when it comes to ethical sourced and sustainable fashion. It’s fascinating to see that more people are paving the way to more openness and demanding more eco-friendly manufactured clothing. Fast and wasteful fashion is no more! </p>
<p>When increasingly more people are changing the way they consume and behave, the fashion industry has to advance as well. Therefore we see a shift in how production is changing back to locally produced goods, true sustainability, more focus on fairly paid workers and distributed companies. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
          <p>The devastating impact on our environment </p>
<p>The use of toxic dyes, pesticides, the tremendous waste of natural resources, farming, harvesting, processing, manufacturing and the transportation for mass production all over the world is really having a devastating impact. The extravagant usage and waste of water that is needed for production is completely irresponsible.</p>
<p>The UNISOT SaaS solution can therefore be used to prove and provide honest information, that guarantees that the company is preventing waste and unethical practices, thus enabling customers to make even more sustainable and environmentally friendly choices.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                         <p>Smart Digital Twins in Blockchain, Web3 and Federated Learning in Fashion </p>
<p>Due to the intrinsic nature of public blockchain technology supply chains will become more transparent. This brings about a whole new level of incentives for companies and how they will do business.</p>
<p>With public blockchain technology we can create a link between the physical object and a digital one: a smart digital twin is created. This link is used to create a Digital Product Passport to state the origin of the actual product; blocking any attempts of counterfeit or diversion. Each action in the supply chain is recorded and due to the distributed nature of public blockchain technology no stored data can be altered, destroyed or diverted. Furthermore, UNISOT’s Smart Digital Twins functionality enables full product life cycle history feedback.</p>
<p>All kinds of exciting technologies are slipping into fashion industry, and garment companies are progressively changing into tech companies. &nbsp;UNISOT applications combined with IoT technologies, Web3 and Federated Learning can make a big change in how the Fashion Industry goes forward – in real time – for each node in the supply chain.</p>
 Let´s change the fashion industry together

Key points: 
<br> 
<br> 
  
  Most fentanyl trafficked into the United States is manufactured using precursors imported from Chinese suppliers.<br><br>  
  Elliptic researchers received offers from more than 90 China-based companies to supply fentanyl precursors, 90% of which accepted cryptocurrency payments. Many mentioned that they have shipped the same chemicals to Mexico.<br><br>  
  Many of these businesses were also willing to supply fentanyl itself, despite this being banned in China since 2019.<br><br>  
  Elliptic’s blockchain analysis shows that the cryptocurrency wallets used by these companies have received thousands of payments, totaling just over $27 million, and that the number of transactions has increased by 450% year-on-year. $27 million would purchase enough precursor to produce fentanyl pills with a street value of approximately $54 billion.<br><br>  
  Analysis of blockchain transactions also shows that a known fentanyl trafficker paid tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin to one of these suppliers.&nbsp;<br><br>  
  
Fentanyl overdoses are now the leading cause of death for those aged 18-45 in the United States. Cheaper to produce than heroin and 50 times more potent, this synthetic opioid has fueled an epidemic over the past decade, as well as becoming a huge source of profits for international drug cartels. 
<br> 
<p><br>For many years, China was the main source of illicit fentanyl. But in 2019 following intense diplomatic pressure from the US, the Chinese government regulated the drug – effectively banning its export.</p> 
<p>However, far from stemming the tide, illicit fentanyl imports into the US have soared. That’s because Mexican drug cartels have stepped in to fill the void and seize the market – manufacturing their own fentanyl using precursors (chemical ingredients) imported from China.&nbsp;<br><br>The US government has placed increasing emphasis on disrupting the financial activity of fentanyl traffickers and their supply networks. In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strengthened-approach-to-crack-down-on-illicit-fentanyl-supply-chains/">fact sheet</a> published on April 11th, the White House indicated that it intends to “expand its efforts to disrupt the illicit financial activities that fund these criminals by increasing accountability measures, including financial sanctions”.&nbsp;<br><br>Three days later, on April 14th, the US Department of the Treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1413">sanctioned</a> several individuals and businesses in China for supplying precursor chemicals to drug cartels in Mexico for the production of fentanyl intended for the US market. The sanctions also listed cryptocurrency wallets used by these businesses to receive payments.&nbsp;<br><br>The Elliptic research team identified more than 90 China-based chemical companies that were willing to supply fentanyl precursors, and that are offering cryptocurrency as a payment method.</p> 
<p>Our researchers received offers to supply large quantities of one particular fentanyl precursor. This chemical is not used in the manufacture of any other products, and is a controlled substance in most countries. However, it remains unregulated in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>GDPR and VASPs: Lessons Learned from Meta’s Historic Fine&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of the recent historic 1.2 billion euro fine levied against Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) worldwide should take heed. The unprecedented penalty, the highest ever under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), sends a strong message about the EU’s commitment to data protection and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Facebook’s Record Fine Sends a Strong Signal to VASPs: EU Regulations and Compliance are Crucial</p></blockquote><p>Reason Behind Facebook’s Fine&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta’s predicament stemmed from its systemic transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. on the basis of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) since 16 July 2020. The GDPR requires an adequate level of protection for data transferred outside the EU, and Meta’s data handling practices were deemed non-compliant, leading to the severe fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key Aspects of GDPR&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GDPR is a comprehensive legislation aimed at protecting the data and privacy of EU citizens. Key principles that organizations should adhere to include:&nbsp;</p>



  Data Minimization: Processing only the necessary amount of data for a specific purpose.&nbsp; 



 Purpose Limitation: Ensuring that data is only used for a clearly stated and legitimate purpose.&nbsp; 



 Accuracy: Maintaining up-to-date and correct data, and promptly correcting or deleting any inaccuracies.&nbsp; 
   Storage Limitation: Storing data for no longer than necessary and in a way that permits identification of data subjects.&nbsp; 
 <p>Beyond MiCA: Other Regulatory Considerations for VASPs&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the recent MiCA regulation is an important consideration for VASPs planning to operate in the EU, it isn’t the only regulatory framework they need to abide by. GDPR compliance is equally crucial, and overlooking this can lead to serious penalties, as seen in Meta’s case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GDPR Essentials for VASPs&nbsp;</p>



<p>To stay compliant with GDPR, VASPs should:&nbsp;</p>



  Understand and apply GDPR principles in their data handling practices.&nbsp; 



 Keep track of where and how they store and transfer data.&nbsp; 



 Implement security measures to protect data.&nbsp; 
   Be transparent with users about data collection, use, and storage.&nbsp; 



 Choosing the Right Partners for GDPR Compliance&nbsp; 
 <p>A critical part of maintaining GDPR compliance is choosing the right partners. When it comes to data protection and storage, partnering with companies that understand the complexities of GDPR and have a robust data security infrastructure is essential. Coinfirm, an EU-based firm, ticks all these boxes. Coinfirm’s servers are located within the EU, ensuring GDPR compliance and providing VASPs with peace of mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinfirm, Your Partner in Compliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The substantial fine against Meta serves as a warning signal to VASPs: data protection isn’t just a legal requirement, it’s an integral part of responsible business practices. While the regulatory landscape may seem daunting, Coinfirm is here to help. As a GDPR-compliant partner, Coinfirm is not only equipped to provide clear, actionable<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>analytics services, but also to guide VASPs through the complexities of operating within the EU. With Coinfirm, VASPs can confidently navigate the intricacies of GDPR, safeguarding their operations while respecting user privacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p>Whether or not you know the term, you know the experience of using a Progressive Web App (PWA): it’s the slick experience that enables you to install a web experience to your native device and enjoy the speed of use of a website with the tight system integration of a native app. They allow for experiences like recreating <a href="https://app.starbucks.com/">Starbucks’ native app in web</a>, or for creating a <a href="https://www.tigren.com/blog/uber-pwa">highly 2G-optmized experience</a> like what Uber created for some of their customers. PWAs take advantage of native features such as on-device storage, push notifications, and even windowing without requiring the overhead of a native app and the ability to install them without going through an app store. </p><p>In the same way that HTML5 and PWAs changed the way users expected to consume their apps through the minor addition of manifest, an even larger shift has arrived in the form of Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs), which combine PWAs with Web5. While PWAs redefined the relationship between the client and server by enabling richer on-device experiences through native integrations, DWAs are going to completely redefine data storage for apps resulting in a seismic shift in user privacy, ease-of-use, and data portability.</p> What changes in a DWA? <p>The basic client-server model that PWAs use is and has been the presumed standard for decades now. Users expect to open up their PWA, a client, that routinely makes API calls to a 3rd party service, the server, where all their data is stored and the business logic of the app lives. For example, a basic ToDo app PDA would provide you a UI to interface with all your action items by calling the API service that accesses those items; fundamentally the data and API layers live outside of the user’s control and ownership.</p><p>In DWAs, users own their own data and, as a result, their apps no longer need an API service because apps connect directly to the data source. This shift leads to virtually no UI/UX change, but triggers a radical change in app architecture because developers are now directly interfacing with a user’s data store instead of with app-owned server storage via API. </p><p>In DWAs, app data is stored in <a>Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)</a>, which are user-owned and redundant data stores capable of transmitting data that provide strong promises of privacy and guaranteed ownership. DWNs can be permissioned publicly or privately related to the querying decentralized identifier (DID) using <a>permissions</a> and<a> protocols</a> to allow select access to all the data stored in them. </p><p>Going back to our ToDo app example, a user would be able to store all of their todo items and app data on their own DWN rather than on a specific 3rd party’s servers, and all the app would do is focus on creating a presentation layer and additional features around the app’s concept. </p> Upgrading to DWAs <p>If you want to migrate a PWA to a DWA, the only thing you’ll need to do is make sure that whatever data you were originally storing remotely and transmitting via API calls is now stored on the user’s DWN and is accessed <a>using CRUD operations</a> on the user’s DWN. For example, your ToDo app may have previously made an API call to write a new item to your list, but now you’d replace that API call with:</p>   <code>// Write a plain text record to the in-memory DWN<br><br>const myRecord = await web5.dwn.records.create(myDid.id, {<br> author: myDid.id,<br> data: todoItem,<br> message: {<br>     dataFormat: 'text/plain',<br> },<br>});<br></code>     <p>You might expect this section on how to migrate your PWA to a DWA to drag on, but that’s really it! Regardless of your front-end frameworks, you can easily turn your app into a DWA using our <a>web5.js library </a>with minimal code changes. So long as your application treats the user’s DWN as its data storage and allows the user to own their own data, your PWA is now a DWA.</p> Benefits of a DWA <p>Even though replacing all your API calls with DWA calls may be relatively easy work, convincing your users to get on board with Web5 and DWNs may be a challenge. So what’s in it for you and them when you build a DWA?</p>  User ownership of data - users don’t have to worry about a server outage or be fearful of a company shutting down and losing all their data.  Data portability - because users are storing their own data in PWAs, they no longer need to be tied to a single service. Imagine, for example, a world with a decentralized Spotify and Tidal. If a Spotify user were to decide to leave the platform and migrate to Tidal, they’d own all their own playlist data and could therefore then give playlist access to Tidal so that all their data migrates seamlessly.   Reduced operational overhead - you no longer need to maintain a massive array of databases, clusters, and other infrastructure to host your simple PWA. Instead, a user can visit your DWA, plug in their DWN, and get to work.   What’s Next? <p>If you’d like to try upgrading your PWA to a DWA or building your own from the ground-up, you can use our <a>web5.js library</a> to interface with DWNs and DIDs. Additionally, you can find support on your developer journey by <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">joining our Discord</a> channel or by <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js">engaging in our GitHub page</a>.</p>

This detailed information can help lenders calculate income faster and more precisely to improve loan quality, simplify the mortgage process and, most importantly, expand access to credit.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Over the last year, we’ve consistently rolled out innovations to ensure our digital tools are improving speed and efficiency, reducing risk and, ultimately, helping us serve our mission by reaching more qualified borrowers. Today’s innovation further automates income assessment by using historical direct deposit pay patterns and current gross income from recent paystubs, which can help more families achieve homeownership.”</p>
Kevin Kauffman, Single-Family Vice President of Seller Engagement at Freddie Mac.</blockquote>



<p>This new AIM capability will be available to Freddie&nbsp;Mac-approved Sellers using Loan Product Advisor beginning June 7, 2023. Finicity, a Mastercard Company, is the initial service provider supporting Freddie Mac’s AIM for income using direct deposits plus paystub.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 9th May to 21st&nbsp;May <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap, your biweekly dose of crypto regulatory news from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Crypto regulatory developments are often a rollercoaster ride filled with unexpected twists and turns, as we saw during and the last two weeks were no exception.</p><p>The EU cleared the path with the unanimous approval of the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), marking a significant stride in cryptocurrency regulations. Meanwhile, South Korea has been emboldened to take decisive actions amidst political scandals, stepping up their crypto regulation game.</p><p>In the United States, the landscape continues to evolve, shaped by rigorous debates over the clarity of digital asset rules and who holds the reins over “stablecoins.”</p><p>So without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Crypto Regulation Rundown: The Balance Between Safety and Innovation Across EU, US, and South&nbsp;Korea <p>The European Union (EU) is making major strides, unanimously approving a new law known as the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). With MiCA, the EU aims to offer clear guidelines for people in the crypto market, providing a safety net for everyone involved.</p><p>But it’s not all rosy. The demands from crypto wallet providers and exchanges are high and might put a damper on new and creative&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Meanwhile, over in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking heat. The issue? They aren’t being clear about their digital asset rules. Leading the protest is the United States Chamber of Commerce and Coinbase, a giant in the crypto world. They worry that this ambiguity could hurt the digital economy and hinder its&nbsp;growth.</p><p>On the other side of the globe, South Korea is taking decisive action. Prompted by some scandals involving cryptocurrencies, they’ve put their stamp of approval on a new crypto regulation bill. This sudden move showcases the urgency for a legal framework around digital asset trading. The heart of this bill is about making things clearer and more responsible in South Korea’s expanding crypto&nbsp;scene.</p><p>Back to the United States, a fascinating debate unfolds around “stablecoins.” The bone of contention here is who should be in control: the states or the federal government? Both sides have distinct views, but there’s a shared understanding that stablecoins are part of our future. And most agree that the U.S. should make the rules so businesses don’t move&nbsp;away.</p><p>Across the globe, the chorus is growing for clear, easy-to-follow rules in the world of cryptocurrency. We need protections for those in the digital asset market, but it’s also vital to encourage fresh ideas and industry growth. How well these new rules can strike this balance will be the key to their&nbsp;success.</p> Decoding the EU’s New Crypto Rules: Mica’s Impact and&nbsp;Insights <p>The European Union (EU) has taken a significant step towards comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation with the unanimous approval of the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation.</p><p>This development comes after the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, comprised of finance ministers from all EU member states, voted in favor of the MiCA bill and amendments to related regulations and directives.</p><p>Earlier in April, the European Parliament endorsed an unprecedented set of regulations for the crypto industry, adding weight to the MiCA legislation.</p><p>With an overwhelming majority of the members voting in favor, this initiative’s primary aim is to protect consumers from potential risks linked with crypto assets and ensure providers can be held accountable for any loss of investors’ assets. This regulatory effort signifies an important shift in the EU’s approach to crypto asset management and the broader financial industry’s future.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/InbarPreiss/status/1658453533463592962?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>In line with the MiCA approval, the European Parliament greenlighted two additional pieces of legislation, further contributing to the detailed regulatory framework. These supplementary rules aim to regulate the information accompanying fund transfers and certain crypto assets, emphasizing transparency and accountability across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>One key provision of the MiCA regulation is that crypto platforms are now obliged to provide clear and comprehensive information regarding the risks associated with their services.</p><p>Though this is a win for consumers’ trust, the stringent licensing prerequisites for crypto wallet providers and exchanges could impact the pace of innovation and competition.</p><p>Another impactful aspect is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to hold substantial reserves. This protective measure can safeguard the market from potential shocks but also introduces a cap on the daily transactions of larger stablecoins, which could influence their&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The overall picture painted by these legislative measures is of a cautious yet forward-thinking EU seeking a balanced approach to harnessing the benefits of crypto assets while mitigating associated risks.</p> South Korea Takes Lead in Cryptocurrency Regulations Amid&nbsp;Scandal <p>South Korea’s National Policy Committee took a bold step forward by approving a landmark cryptocurrency regulation bill, the first of its kind in the nation’s&nbsp;history.</p><p>This action is a direct response to a controversy involving a high-profile opposition lawmaker, who has been accused of heavy cryptocurrency speculation. Now consolidated from 19 similar drafts, the bill is headed for the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, where it will face a thorough&nbsp;review.</p><p>According to legislators, this bill aims to protect digital asset investors, thwart unfair cryptocurrency trading, and establish a reliable framework for trading stablecoins. And in a significant move, it empowers the Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s premier financial regulator, to oversee cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Although the current bill is primarily centered around investor protection and fair trade, a separate bill focused on the intricacies of initial coin offerings, public disclosures, and market regulations is still under committee review.</p><p>Fueling the swift bipartisan support for the cryptocurrency regulation bill is the scandal involving Representative Kim Nam-kuk, who allegedly dabbled in sizeable speculative investments in various cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The disclosure of his extensive digital asset holdings has sparked a call for increased transparency, compelling both political parties to draft legislation that mandates lawmakers and public officials to disclose their cryptocurrency assets.</p><p>This shift in policy brings South Korea closer to the regulatory standards of the US and EU, where comparable disclosure laws were established in 2018 and 2020, respectively.</p><p>The legislation will undoubtedly profoundly impact the South Korean cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering a host of benefits and presenting certain challenges. Investors stand to gain from improved protection measures, thus fostering a safer environment in the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>The law also takes aim at unfair trading practices and establishes a robust structure for trading stablecoins, which could increase public confidence in and participation in the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>However, stricter regulatory oversight may hinder the pace of innovation and deter potential new entrants to the crypto market. On top of that, the new legislation also could infringe on the privacy of lawmakers and public officials who will be obligated to disclose their crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-the-regulated-road-ahead">The Shyft Perspective — Hong Kong’s New Crypto Climate: the Regulated Road&nbsp;Ahead</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1658156397253603334?s=20">Why Shyft&nbsp;Network?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1658850243381796868?s=20">What is Shyft&nbsp;Network?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1659578665284321280?s=20">Key Elements of Shyft&nbsp;Network</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Ping Identity is excited to see our customers, partners, and other IAM leaders at <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/events/identiverse.html">Identiverse 2023</a> in Las Vegas from May 26th to June 2nd.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>So, what does the Entertainment Capital of the World and Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) have in common? Las Vegas casinos and CIAM programs both aim to balance security and convenience by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Delivering delightful customer experiences while managing risk</p>
 
 <p>Verifying the identity of customers and authorizing transactions</p>
 
 <p>Profiling and progressively getting to know customers to understand preferences, connect them to services they desire, and provide benefits</p>
 
 <p>Guiding customers on a journey from unknown to loyal</p>
 
 <p>Evaluating behavior to separate the bad actors from the good</p>
 
 <p>Protecting against fraud, counterfeiting, and impersonation</p>
 
 <p>Supporting omnichannel experiences across physical locations (casinos) and digital properties (gambling apps)</p>
 
 <p>Ensuring resiliency across operations</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's digital-first world, we must strongly identify, authenticate, and authorize users in order to boost security and protect our customers. This is true whether you’re an online business or a casino on the strip. Hackers and fraudsters, like casino cheaters, are constantly changing tactics to steal money. We must aggressively and purposefully consider new solutions and different approaches to stay one step ahead and prevent fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To combat threats, more companies are offering multi-factor authentication (MFA) options to safeguard users. And their customers are noticing! Surveys indicate consumers put more trust in brands that offer additional security measures. To meet this expectation, businesses should build consumer adaptive MFA into digital services and leverage it as an eventual springboard to passwordless. Or, if possible, companies should leapfrog right to passwordless for new and existing customers. We need to use tools like MFA to slow down suspicious users when risk is high and, conversely, speed up trusted customers when risk is low, striking the elusive balance between security and convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term "playing with house money" basically means gambling without risk of loss. This is not the case with most digital relationships today. Casinos employ experts to&nbsp; simultaneously profile and surveil their customers to separate good actors from suspected bad actors. Similarly, the latest threat detection tools can evaluate risk signals in real time throughout the user session to determine trust and ensure valid users can transact quickly and easily. That way, your business won’t have to gamble on possible fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the threats that Vegas casinos face are as vast and varied as the digital threats facing businesses today. We all must focus on securing people, businesses, and transactions without sacrificing experience to grow loyalty and revenue. It’s the only way to give our customers extraordinary experiences that keep them coming back for more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his keynote speech on the opening day of Identiverse titled <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361523/">Identity Under Attack</a>, Andre Durand, Ping’s Founder &amp; CEO, will discuss how AI is changing cybersecurity. We also invite you to join us at the Founders Party at On the Record inside of Park MGM on June 1st from 7:00–11:00 PM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, don’t miss an opportunity to give back at Identiverse with our latest Ping4Good initiative! Summer may have just started, but local charities are gearing up to support families in need by providing them with classroom materials. That’s why Ping Identity is partnering with A Precious Child to provide 3rd-5th grade students school supplies, and all attendees at Identiverse can help! Just stop by the Ping Identity Booth (Booth 1303) to build a bag for kids in need.</p>

<p>At GlobaliD, we’ve been on a mission from day one to provide every individual with a digital identity that they own and control. Last year, we took that one step further, giving users the ability to own and control their money with the <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/launchpad-the-all-new-globalid-wallet-768cd26357c0">release of our non-custodial wallet</a>.</p><p>It’s also why, today, we’re announcing that we’re transitioning to the Universal Namespace. This will allow users to own and control a unique name associated with their digital identity through an independent third-party namespace rather than one managed by GlobaliD.</p><p>A namespace is simply a set of unique names that are tied to different types of things so they can be easily identified. In the context of the internet, the Domain Name System or DNS namespace tied domain names to relevant IP addresses so that people could easily find the websites they were looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>The concept of a namespace is key to the mainstreaming of digital <br>identity — just as it was for the mainstreaming of the internet. The early internet was a fragmented mess. The only way to find anything was through hard-to-memorize IP addresses. With the arrival of DNS, we could now visit wikipedia.com rather than 80.190.205.15.</p><p>In a sense, the DNS namespace made the internet more&nbsp;human.</p><p>The same goes for digital identity, which is even more complex than simply visiting a website. Someone you want to interact with may have many public keys, URLs, or platform accounts you need to keep track of. Now, all you need is their unique&nbsp;name.</p><p>At GlobaliD, we’ve been thinking deeply about namespaces over the last few years — we <a href="https://medium.com/@_globalid/globalid-white-paper-the-namespace-for-identity-6b755afbe42f">published our first white paper on the subject</a> in the beginning of 2019. As an early mover in the digital identity space, we’ve often had to come up with original concepts and terms in order to help develop and push the industry&nbsp;forward.</p><p>That’s also been the case when it came to a namespace for identity. As such, we originally built a namespace in-house. But the long term vision was always for the namespace to be managed independently outside of GlobaliD. That’s something we laid out in our white paper. Ultimately, we believe the namespace should be a public&nbsp;good.</p><p>We now have the opportunity to make that vision a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>For GlobaliD, this is a big step toward interoperability with other digital identity platforms. For instance, GlobaliD may support additional namespaces in the future, giving users a choice over their service provider. Regardless of which namespace you choose, your unique name will always be attached to a verifiable credential that you&nbsp;control.</p><p>In all, this is an incredibly exciting evolution for GlobaliD’s digital identity offering.</p><p>The transition will require one additional step for you, the user, but we truly believe that the end destination — where individuals control their name, their identity, and their money — is worth the&nbsp;effort.</p><p>The simplest way for this transition to work is for existing users to re-onboard with GlobaliD and claim a new name through the Universal Namespace.</p><p>This transition does mean that users will lose their existing identity history on the platform once they re-onboard with a new name. That includes things like chat history, vouches, and verifications.</p><p>This wasn’t an easy decision to make and we’re incredibly empathetic to our early adopters, but ultimately, it became clear that this was the best path forward, one most aligned with our values and&nbsp;vision.</p><p>For GlobaliD, this clean slate is also an opportunity for us to provide major upgrades to our messaging and wallet platforms as well as a bevy of new features that will arrive with our next generation digital identity platforms, which will be released in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>In the meantime, users will still be able to access their wallets via their private key, but they will no longer be able to access it through the&nbsp;app.</p><p>For now, you can head over to the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> (/uns) to reserve your unique name. Make sure you sign in with the same phone number you’ll use with GlobaliD so that we can link your name to your GlobaliD identity.</p><p>You should also keep an eye out for notifications from the current GlobaliD app that will include prompts and instructions which will help you throughout the re-onboarding process.</p><p>In all, we’ve got plenty in store for all of you in&nbsp;2023.</p> Q&amp;A   Will I be able to keep any part of my current digital identity?<br>No, you will lose access to all of the data that was associated with your old name including chat history, groups you joined, and funds in your wallet. However, you can transfer funds out of your wallet now before the transition takes place, or you can use your keys to move your entire wallet to another non-custodial client. If you are locked out of your wallet before you have a chance to migrate it, you can reach out to our support team for help exporting your non-custodial wallet recovery&nbsp;key.  Will I be able to keep my old username?<br>No. The Universal Namespace (UNS) is a new service which will manage GlobaliD names moving forward. All existing users of GlobaliD will re-onboard with UNS by claiming a name on this separate, independent namespace. Because UNS has been managed independently of GlobaliD, some names have already been reserved and owners of GlobaliD names may not have their names available on UNS. If your old name is available in UNS, then you can claim it and re-onboard using that&nbsp;name.  Will the Universal Namespace reserve my existing name?<br>No. You need to reserve your new name on your own. You will be able to do this within the updated GlobaliD app upon release, but you do not have to wait. You can go ahead and reserve your new name now by visiting the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> website.  What if I have money or assets in my GlobaliD Wallet?<br>You will need to transfer funds from your current GlobaliD Wallet to a new wallet by May 30, 2023 in order to maintain access to your money. Alternatively, you can export your wallet recovery phrase to host your wallet with another app. A new wallet tied to your username will be made available to you upon release of the updated GlobaliD&nbsp;app.  What is the Universal Namespace?<br>The Universal Namespace (UNS) is a discoverability platform that enables people to securely connect their online accounts and data with a unique name. With UNS, users can determine how they are found online by building a public profile that connects all of their digital identities to one universal name they own and control — making it easier for them to be discovered across different ecosystems. UNS is managed independently of GlobaliD and provides name services to multiple providers, in addition to GlobaliD. You can obtain a name by signing up with your phone number on the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace website</a>.  Can I export any of my data before it is deleted?<br>Yes. If you are locked out of your wallet before you have a chance to migrate it, you can reach out to our <a href="mailto:support@global.id">support team</a> for help exporting your non-custodial wallet recovery key. Otherwise, go to your Wallet tab and tap on the key icon in the upper right-hand corner to get your wallet recovery phrase. You can also contact our support team if you would like us to export your chat history. All other data such as your credentials, verifications, and public bio information will be&nbsp;lost.  What is the deadline to reserve my new username and transfer funds from my wallet?<br>We will release the updated GlobaliD app within the next few weeks and notify you when it is available so that you can re-onboard. However, you do not have to wait for this release in order to claim your new name. You can go ahead and reserve your new name now by visiting the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> website. You can also go ahead and transfer the funds from your current GlobaliD Wallet to a new wallet in order to maintain access to your&nbsp;money.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/introducing-the-universal-namespace-3bbe51b2701c">Introducing the Universal Namespace</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
