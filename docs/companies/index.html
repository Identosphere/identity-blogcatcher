MetaMUI is the world’s first identity-based blockchain that enables true Peer-to-Peer transactions without any intermediaries and executes more than millions of transactions per second for international money transfers, cross-border and micro-payments.</p><p>In the interview, Phantom pointed out the problems of what current existing public blockchains are facing, and how to solve those problems using MetaMUI Blockchain. Also he explained recent Yidindji Government CBDC deployment story which is the first Central Bank Digital Currency issued by CBDC platform.</p><p>Please click the link below if you want to learn more about MetaMUI Blockchain and how it will eventually change the current financial infrastructure.</p> Interview Link: <br><a href="https://futureoffinance.biz/2022/02/01/a-blockchain-protocol-fit-for-the-age-of-cbdcs-the-internet-of-things-and-the-metaverse/">https://futureoffinance.biz/2022/02/01/a-blockchain-protocol-fit-for-the-age-of-cbdcs-the-internet-of-things-and-the-metaverse/</a>  About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism(CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

 Wormhole Portal, a DeFi&nbsp;bridge between Solana and other blockchains, has been exploited – with 120,000 Ethereum (ETH) worth around $325 million stolen. This makes it the fourth largest crypto theft of all time, and the second biggest from a DeFi service.

<p><a href="https://truststamp.ai/">Trust Stamp</a>’s management team is on a visit to New York City to ring the opening bell of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The event is being arranged to commemorate Trust Stamp’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-and-identity-specialist-trust-stamp-makes-nasdaq-debut/">recent listing on the exchange</a>, which occurred on January 31.</p>



  



<p>The bell ringing ceremony, meanwhile, took place at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, February 2. Trust Stamp was previously listed on the OTCQX exchange before making the jump to the Nasdaq, and has also been listed on the Euronext Growth market for traders in Europe.</p>



<p>“We are honored to have been invited to ring the Nasdaq opening bell, as our listing on Nasdaq represents a major milestone for the company following a year of transformation,” said Trust Stamp CEO Gareth Genner. “I would like to thank all or our employees, shareholders and key stakeholders who&nbsp;have&nbsp;contributed to our success and made this&nbsp;event&nbsp;possible.&nbsp;Our goal is to provide&nbsp;technologies that protect personal data, empower individuals and promote inclusion within the new digital landscape.&nbsp;We are more encouraged&nbsp;than ever&nbsp;by the outlook for the business and look forward to driving significant shareholder value in the years ahead.”</p>



<p>The news builds on Trust Stamp’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trust-stamp-reports-strong-growth-2021-011101/">strong 2021 performance</a>. The company’s customer count went up 50 percent over the course of the year, and it supplemented that with $12.84 million in equity funding. Trust Stamp has now raised a total of $30 million, beginning with a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trust-stamp-completes-6-5-million-series-a-crowdfunding-campaign-090103/">$6.5 million Series A crowdfunding campaign</a> back in 2020.</p>



<p>Trust Stamp is best known for its digital identity verification <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/directid-streamlines-onboarding-process-banks-trust-stamp-biometrics-110904/">and remote onboarding technology</a>. The company’s solution uses document recognition to confirm the authenticity of an identity document, and then uses facial recognition to match that document to a selfie of its owner. The <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/maxine-most-warns-about-rough-waters-ahead-surging-idv-marketplace-111903/">demand for such technology has increased</a> dramatically as the remote ecosystem has evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-warns-about-escalating-cost-aml-non-compliance-financial-industry-060203/">financial institution</a> has turned to <a href="https://www.jumio.com/">Jumio</a> for remote onboarding and identity verification. The company’s latest customer is the <a href="https://www.nationwide.co.uk/">Nationwide Building Society</a>, which is based in the United Kingdom.</p>



  



<p>Thanks to the new partnership, Nationwide has been able to integrate Jumio’s API into its own online account opening workflows. In doing so, it has boosted its conversion rates by delivering a smoother onboarding experience for end users. Jumio’s solution uses AI and machine learning to automate key Know Your Customer procedures, with a system that combines face and document recognition to match a selfie to the image on a photo ID.</p>



<p>From there, Nationwide can make a decision about each customer knowing that the information they have presented is accurate. Jumio confirms that a document is authentic, and can even extract details like date of birth from government IDs to determine the ages of people opening youth accounts. The solution also uses <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-iproov-liveness-detection-040807/">iProov’s liveness detection tech</a> to make sure that the document holder is present for the interaction.</p>



<p>Jumio’s API will flag documents and users if it detects signs of potential fraud. According to Nationwide, the enhanced identity verification process will eliminate the need to visit a local bank branch when opening a new account.</p>



<p>“With Jumio we’re able to provide an end-to-end digital process for the majority of our customers,” said Nationwide delivery lead Carlo Mascia. “The time it takes to open an account has been dramatically reduced, but the customer experience is the greatest win.”</p>



<p>“By using Jumio’s AI-powered solutions, Nationwide is able to provide a seamless digital onboarding experience to customers of all ages,” added Jumio EMEA VP Mark Reeves.</p>



<p>Nationwide recently started issuing <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/idemia-provides-recycled-pvc-cards-nationwide-building-society-110604/">bank cards made with recycled PVC</a> materials from IDEMIA. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-completes-4stop-acquisition-011906/">Jumio acquired 4Stop</a> earlier this year, and has previously provided <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/uk-banking-startup-opts-for-jumio-biometric-onboarding-tech-90251/">identity verification services for Lanistar</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cimb-bank-philippines-to-deploy-selfie-authentication-courtesy-of-jumio-902044/">CIMB Bank Philippines</a>.</p>

<p>The police force of one of Canada’s most prominent cities has deployed facial recognition technology from <a href="https://www.nec.com/">NEC</a> to aid in its criminal investigations.</p>



<p>Edmonton Police Service officials disclosed their use of the technology this week, but emphasized that the deployment is the result of years of preparation. The service is using NeoFace Reveal to scan the faces of individual suspects from surveillance images and compare them against mugshot databases held by the EPS and the Calgary Police Service. (Edmonton is the capital city of the province of Alberta, while Calgary is Alberta’s most populous city and a prominent cultural center.)</p>



<p>In announcing the deployment, EPS officials placed a strong emphasis on the various constraints and safeguards concerning how the facial recognition technology will be used. The technology will not be applied to live feeds, only to photographic and video evidence, and only to identify suspects and potential leads in specific criminal investigations. Only the members of a specialized investigative team will have access to the technology, and their activities using the NeoFace platform can be audited by supervisors.</p>



<p>EPS officials also noted that they have submitted a privacy impact assessment to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta – a voluntary step that is not legally required of them. (The Office has not yet responded to the assessment.)</p>



<p>The EPS’s effort to highlight its safeguards and its attention to privacy are perhaps best understood in the context of the revelations about Clearview AI. Its internet-trawling facial recognition platform has been pitched to a wide range of police agencies and other organizations, and a recent report brought scrutiny to Toronto’s police service with its revelation that Toronto police had <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/toronto-police-used-clearview-active-investigations-without-permission-010706/">trialed Clearview AI’s software</a>.</p>



<p>The Clearview uproar prompted the Ottawa police service to reveal <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-ottawa-police-share-more-details-about-facial-recognition-trial-022606/">its own trial</a> of facial recognition technology in early 2020, though in that case the technology in question was NeoFace Reveal and, as in the Edmonton deployment, it was used only to search for matches against a mugshot database.</p>



<p>Having underlined its safeguards, the EPS was also keen to note that NEC’s facial recognition technology was already delivering results, having officially been in use for about a month. EPS Research and Development Division superintendent Devin Laforce said that NeoFace Reveal searches helped to identify three suspects in an assualt case, and led to leads in a homicide investigation, adding that the Service is “confident that this facial recognition tool will keep our communities safe and secure” by delivering a unique form of assistance in criminal investigations.</p>

<p>Facial recognition specialist <a href="https://www.corsight.ai/">Corsight AI</a> revealed to potential investors that it has been working on a system that would build a model of a face based on DNA data, according to a report from MIT Technology Review in partnership with the research group IPVM.</p>



<p>The system, aptly named “DNA to Face”, was detailed in a presentation at the Imperial Capital Investors Conference in December. Framed as part of Corsight’s product road map, the system would theoretically enable law enforcement officials to run facial recognition searches on a model constructed from DNA evidence, among other potential applications.</p>



<p>The claim to have such a technological capability would be a bold one, and Corsight is not ready to make it publicly. Responding to an email inquiry from MIT Technology Review, Corsight CEO Robert Watts said, “We are not engaging with the press at the moment as the details of what we are doing are company confidential.”</p>



<p>There is hardly a precedent for what Corsight appears to be aiming to achieve with its DNA to Face solution. MIT Technology Review notes that a Silicon Valley startup called Human Longevity prompted expressions of doubt from academics when it claimed to be able to use DNA to predict faces in 2017, and a DNA informatics company called Parabon NanoLabs uses DNA to help draft face renderings, but advises against their use with facial recognition systems.</p>



<p>However far Corsight AI may be from achieving its goal with respect to DNA to Face, the revelation of its efforts offers the latest indication of Corsight’s focus on the law enforcement and military sectors. The company was recently cited as a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/corsights-facial-recognition-tech-could-appear-police-body-cameras-israel-012603/">biometric technology partner</a> by the owner of Yozmot, an Iraeli company that won a contract to outfit Israeli police and soldiers with face-scanning body cameras.</p>



<p>That project is likely to draw criticism from privacy and civil rights advocates, as would the DNA to Face solution if it is ultimately realized and deployed. But Corsight AI has also demonstrated some concern about ethical issues as a biometrics vendor, having emphasized its success in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/corsight-shows-significant-bias-reduction-latest-nist-test-121703/">reducing the demographic bias</a> of its facial recognition technology in recent NIST testing, with Watts asserting at the time that the company’s mission “is to be the most ethical, accurate, fast performing and privacy-focused facial recognition solutions provider on the market.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.iproov.com/">iProov</a> has patented new document verification technique that will help businesses prevent the use of forgeries online. The technology described in the patent will be deployed as part of the company’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-iproov-liveness-detection-040807/">Genuine Presence Assurance platform</a>, and marketed to clients that are searching for a more robust remote identity verification offering.</p>



  



<p>In practice, the new patent focuses exclusively on the document verification stage of the authentication process, and not on facial liveness detection. The <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iproov-update-tracks-surging-demand-for-online-identity-verification-712162/">latest generation of identity verification solutions</a> ask users to take selfie and a photo of an identity document, and then use face and document recognition to confirm the authenticity of both. iProov’s solution displays a box on the screen that someone is using to take a photo. That makes it easier to capture an image of an ID card, since people can adjust the focus to make sure the document fits inside the frame.</p>



<p>iProov’s solution will also start analyzing document details as soon as the user starts moving the camera to line up their photo. The newly patented system looks for signs of tampering on the surface of the document, and checks to make sure that the document contains an original photograph and a proper hologram pattern.</p>



<p>The solution can run on any device with a camera and a suitable light source. iProov believes that its intuitive offering will make the document capture process more accessible and more user-friendly, since people will know what they need to do without any written instructions.</p>



<p>“This new technology will save the user awkwardly moving a license or ID around in front of a camera, while providing a safer, faster and cheaper alternative to time-consuming video calls with agents,” said iProov CEO Andrew Bud. “Our unique technology relies upon simple, inclusive movement that harnesses a distinctive combination of distance and light.”</p>



<p>This is iProov’s ninth US patent. The development of the technology in it was partially funded by Innovate UK. iProov itself recently brought in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iproov-gets-70m-vc-investment-from-silicon-valleys-sumeru-501061/">$70 million in venture capital funding</a>. However, the company is currently facing a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-sues-iproov-over-alleged-biometric-technology-patent-infringement-501051/">patent infringement lawsuit from FaceTec</a>, which alleges that iProov copied liveness technology used in FaceTec’s Spoof Bounty Program.</p>

<p>A new player is entering the increasingly competitive authentication market. <a href="https://passage.id/">Passage</a> is a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-promotes-passwordless-authentication-with-user-experience-guidelines-062403/">passwordless authentication</a> specialist that seeks to take advantage of the biometric hardware that now comes standard on many smartphones, and it is now emerging from stealth mode to make the beta version of its platform available to interested developers.</p>



  



<p>Passage has also raised $4 million in funding to support those efforts. The round was led by LiveOak Venture Partners, with additional input from Next Coast Ventures, Tau Ventures, and Secure Octane, in addition to several angel investors.</p>



<p>According to Passage, its solution will make it easier for businesses to integrate passwordless authentication into their customer-facing workflows. The platform allows people to use device biometrics to log into mobile applications, or to log into sites through a web browser. The biometric authentication process can be carried out with Face ID or Touch ID, Windows Hello, or with some other built-in biometric scanner.</p>



<p>Passage’s offering delivers two-factor authentication, since it performs the biometric match and verifies the device that is used to complete the scan to confirm possession. The company itself does not store any biometric data to help preserve user privacy.</p>



<p>“There’s often a tradeoff between security and user experience, but Passage offers a unique combination of both with low implementation complexity,” said Passage Co-Founder and CEO&nbsp;Cole Hecht. “This financing will allow us to introduce Passage to more developers, and deliver more ‘ah-ha’ moments when people sign up for websites with Face ID, Touch ID, or Windows Hello for the first time.”</p>



<p>Passage believes that its solution will eliminate <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/many-organizations-not-prepared-phishing-ransomware-attacks-report-071204/">phishing and account takeover attacks</a>, while simultaneously mitigating administrative costs for businesses that will no longer need to store passwords or deal with reset requests. The streamlined authentication process is also expected to deliver a better user experience, which in turn reduces customer abandonment rates. The Passage solution is based on the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/w3c-fido-webauthn-official-web-standard-503045/">FIDO Alliance’s WebAuthn standard</a>.</p>

  <p>Take a look in your physical wallet.&nbsp;Maybe you have some credit cards and probably identification of some kind.&nbsp;Do you have a roadside assistance card, perchance? The cards we carry and present every single day feel different than many common digital credentials (such as federated credentials) that identify us and communicate our attributes online, but that gap is narrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the identity ecosystem looks at emerging paradigms for trust and individual agency in our online interactions, we see use cases where the federated identity model we know so well in the real world might work to provide more digital autonomy and control.&nbsp;We call this model the “presentation model” because an end user collects and controls the presentation of their credential when and where they choose.&nbsp;The presentation model does not replace online federated models, but instead, each model can be used where most valuable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part one of our series introduced our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/06/microsofts-5-guiding-principles-for-decentralized-identities/">5 guiding principles for decentralized identities.</a>&nbsp;In this and subsequential blogs, we will continue to dive deeper into the technical basics of decentralized identity. Read on for part two of this five-part series on decentralized identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part I:&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://aka.ms/identityprinciples">The Five Guiding Principles</a></p>
<p>Part II: &nbsp;The Direct Presentation model &lt;--&nbsp;You are here</p>
<p>Part III: The Basics of Decentralized Identity</p>
<p>Part IV: Deep Dive: Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>Part V:&nbsp; Deep Dive: Anchored Decentralized Identifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we use identity-related credentials in the real world, they often have different properties than digital credentials. There are two separate ceremonies in most cases: issuance and presentation.&nbsp; If you have spent any time at a department of motor vehicles or a passport office, you’ve seen what an issuance ceremony can be – it is usually an intensive process, but the tradeoff is that once you have a credential like a driver’s license or passport, you can use that credential for multiple purposes, at multiple places, over a long period of time. You, the “holder” of the credential, can choose to present your credential as a (mostly) voluntary exchange, in which the verifier of your credential can grant you access to some kind of resource - for example, they might allow you into a nightclub, or allow you to check out a library book.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s use a concrete real-world scenario: roadside assistance. Many of us are members of automotive clubs which advertise national and international coverage in the case of vehicle mishaps. After a sign-up song and dance and giving them my annual fee, they issue me a card I stuff into my wallet and forget about. Until one fateful night when my car breaks down in a location I am unfamiliar with. In this case, a miraculous thing happens – I can pull my auto club card from my wallet, and present that card to a garage that has never heard of me before, and a tow truck will arrive to help me. This issue-then-present credentialling model that has long powered the physical world is ready for adoption in the digital world too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technical name for the model at work here is called the Direct Presentation model. A credential is issued, and then held for a long period of time with intermittent voluntary presentations to many different verifiers. To put that back into our example, my auto club issues me a card, which I hold in my wallet for years (maybe decades!), and I might choose to show that card to a garage when I need a tow, or possibly to a store to get a discount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s switch gears (see what I did there?) to look at the digital world as you use it today. Rather than giving me a card I can store in my wallet, websites (and other services) create a user account. My resource access is tied to this account, and I must prove I own the account by authenticating to the website. After I have authenticated, there is a limited amount of time where the website “knows” who I am and can vouch on my behalf to applications and to other domains, introducing me to resources while sharing data about me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process of an authoritative Identity Provider who redirects me to resources and introduces me as a valid account within their domain with certain attributes and entitlements is called the Federated Presentation model. Going back to my night on the highway, instead of presenting my road service card to the garage, I’d have to borrow their point of sale (POS) terminal to authenticate to the auto club website, then be redirected to the garage website - with my card information included in the redirect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these models got me my tow truck. They both have important qualities, and there are a number of use cases where either could do the job. But each has a few use cases where they can really shine. In the case of federated presentation, enterprise scenarios such as single sign-on (SSO) provide a compelling combination of convenience and security. Likewise, the digital version of the direct presentation model has great applications - where users benefit from increased agency in their dealings with businesses, governments, and even each other. We’ll cover the key qualities of the direct presentation model in the rest of this blog, and then in our next blog, we can talk through what high level architectural requirements we foresee. Remember, my car has broken down, I’m in a remote and unfamiliar place, and I need to leverage the roadside assistance that I have purchased in advance to get service from a garage that I have never previously done business with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Common qualities of the Direct Presentation model (Real-world and digital) 
<p>My choice of when and what gets presented</p>
<p>As I sit in my broken-down car, I have options. I might have roadside assistance coverage from multiple providers. I might even have a coupon for a free tow I picked up from the roadside diner or prefer to use a credit card. If I do, I can debate which offers the best deal, and present what works for me. This sounds like a simple thing, but it is tougher to do in the federated model because I can’t look through my wallet to remember which clubs I’m a member of or what coupons I’ve squirreled away. Instead, the garage would have to try to help me remember which auto clubs I might be affiliated with by showing me logos until I see one I recognize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything goes through me</p>
<p>When I interact with the garage, I’m the person presenting my credential and I’m the person getting a receipt back. No real-time interaction is needed with the auto club, which is lucky because it’s the middle of the night. But I am aware of the interactions in real time, and if I want to, I can compare my receipts from all the breakdowns my car has had, see trends in what kinds of transactions I’ve been a part of, and even find places where I’ve been overcharged or where the promises of the transaction haven’t materialized. This is because I was an agent in the direct presentation. In a federated model, the logs of what data was passed about me are likely available but I would have to collect those logs from many different places – if they’re made available to me - to see the full picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Present it anywhere</p>
<p>Imagine the case where every garage had to have a separate contract with every regional auto club whose members might want to use their services. The overhead of such a system would be high. Instead, the garages and regional clubs all agree to abide by a common association’s trust framework that establishes the rules and practices that everyone must follow. In the direct presentation model, standards help establish the rules which allow easy establishment of associations, and there’s a potential for direct presentation to make it easier to set up common trust frameworks. This is what allows me to present my membership card from Alberta on a dark highway in North Dakota – where both I and the driver can be confident in the transaction. If everyone uses a common presentation model, it opens the doors to make it easier for trust frameworks to be formed and governed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unique properties of the Digital Direct Presentation model 
<p>There are few things that couldn’t work for me as I sit in my broken-down car with a physical auto club card, but that could work if I were using a digital credential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selective disclosure</p>
<p>When I hand my auto club card to the tow truck operator on the dark highway, I cannot prevent that person from reading everything printed on that card. If the card were to show my home address, the truck driver would know where I lived. But with a digital credential, I can choose what to release (and what not to) during presentation – in this example, I can simply release the fact that I qualify for a tow, and nothing else. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wallet has a brain</p>
<p>Another unique quality of a digital direct presentation is that because software can help, my wallet has a brain and can be a trusted advisor. As I sit in my car, shivering, I might make a bad choice about which garage to call. A digital wallet might cross-reference my choice in garages with the Better Business Bureau and suggest I choose a business with a rating higher than one star, saving me from a bad experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 But what IS the digital version of Direct Presentation? 
<p>There are several important initiatives already underway that qualify as direct presentation – including mobile Driver’s License projects based on the ISO 18013 specification, as well as various ePassport initiatives. Vaccine passports are another case where the direct presentation model is emerging, with initiatives such as <a href="https://vci.org/">VCI</a> and <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass (GHP)</a> gaining traction.&nbsp; In the identity world, we at Microsoft see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> specification as a Data format with long-term potential to let the industry move towards multi-purpose direct presentation. We hope to see some of the models converge over time as they mature, and we’ll deep dive on each of these options over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Federated Presentation and Direct Presentation are complimentary 
<p>You might be wondering: do we see the direct presentation model replacing federated models? No. We believe that federated and direct presentation models will co-exist, and that each model lends itself to solving different problems. Federated presentation is a modern workhorse when it comes to use cases like enterprise single sign-on, and there will continue to be many places where involving the user in a presentation ceremony will never make sense. The good news is that we have specifications that can help federated and direct models to co-exist, and we are working in the <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, and other standards bodies to find an interoperable balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want a sneak peek, check out Kristina Yasuda and Torsten Lodderstedt at the recent OAuth Security Workshop, talking about some of their work that leverages the&nbsp;Self-Issued Identity Provider section of the OpenID Connect specification. This work truly bridges the worlds of Direct and Federated Presentation models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 But wait, what does this have to do with Decentralization? 
<p>If you’ve noticed that we’re not talking a lot about decentralized tech here, don’t be shocked. Microsoft sees unique and differentiated value in how decentralized technology can fulfill many of the criteria listed above, and we’re excited to dig deeper into what decentralized technology can deliver in later posts! But our goals center on both human and business outcomes. As such, we can and will use decentralized technology where it’s needed and useful, and we’ll do our best to discuss with the community the trade-offs and advantages in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next? 
<p>Now that we have a foundational understanding of the Direct Presentation model and its place in the digital world, our next installment will discuss how we build a reference architecture that could deliver on our principles using the Direct Presentation model. We’ll start with a high-level architecture and slowly drill into the various parts of that architecture, describing the standards at play and how we can see those standards pushing us closer to the 5 guiding principles. There are quite a lot of standards – we’ve constructed a <a href="http://linktr.ee/decentralizedidentity">handy linktree</a> to let you easily index into the various specifications we are participating in and/or implementing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is going to be fun!</p>

<p>The fourth quarter of 2021 rounded out a year of volatility and growth <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/31/volatility-ruled-crypto-markets-in-2021-from-69k-bitcoin-to-elon-musks-dogecoin-to-the-moooonn/">across the cryptocurrency sector</a> and cemented the end of a year when <a href="https://twitter.com/reesew/status/1433524984723349507?lang=en">pop culture</a> became aware of NFTs. Governments responded to the rise of digital currency too: <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/12/09/bitcoin-miners-hashrate-record-activity-china-crypto-crackdown-kazakhstan/">Miners relocated</a> after China cracked down on cryptocurrency mining and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) provided <a href="https://t.co/t77D51EpO6">more definition</a> around rules under development. This new guidance <a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1453917982892036101">falls in line</a> with the role Civic is assuming for permissioned DeFi environments.</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>At Civic, our Q4 2022 was all about building trust and safety within the broader blockchain ecosystem. In October, we announced our new <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">Developer Hub</a> and <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-pass-integration-guide/">Civic Pass integration guides</a>. Civic Pass is our identity layer that allows for permissioned dApp platforms for web3, whether they are DEXs, an NFT mints or marketplaces, metaverses or otherwise.</p>



<p>Headed into the Solana Breakpoint conference, we announced a new suite of tools for creators, including <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/introducing-new-tools-for-creators-to-build-trusted-communities/">free bot prevention</a> using Civic Pass technology. While at Breakpoint, Civic and Identity.com created some beautiful <a href="https://twitter.com/identity/status/1460753722552688642">Identity.com Tech Showcase videos</a>; I took to the stage for a panel about <a href="https://youtu.be/0ZimB8y8HYc">building cross-chain</a>; and we hosted a Twitter Spaces event with our new partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1457771416409886721">Snowcrash Labs</a>, a premier NFT marketplace, launching Q1 2022. We made a concerted effort to embed our technology further within the Solana ecosystem by strengthening partnerships while we were there, and we’ve seen dividends across a short timespan from these efforts.</p>



<p>To close out November, Civic and Identity.com sponsored the <a href="https://twitter.com/redacted_j/status/1465364695766949888">Solana Labs Miami Hacker House</a>. During that time, our on-site crew worked together tirelessly with the Metaplex team to <a href="https://twitter.com/juamps/status/1471546856203116547">integrate bot prevention</a> from Civic Pass with Candy Machine. And, our head of product joined other NFT luminaries for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrr9DJIJuBs">panel discussion at DCentral Con about identity</a>.</p>



<p>We wrapped up December by <a href="https://allart.medium.com/announcing-all-art-ido-and-nft-drop-a92554e66962">partnering with ALL.ART</a>, which owns SolSea, to provide KYC and KYB services for their end-of-year IDO. We also announced a partnership with <a href="https://blog.magiceden.io/p/magic-eden-open-listing-nft-marketplace?">Magic Eden for trust and safety services</a>. To close out the month, we partnered with SolSea on the first-ever NFT drop for a US federal campaign, which benefited <a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1471553890893975552">Shr</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1471553890893975552">i</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hartcb/status/1471553890893975552">na Kurani for Congress</a>.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>In the fourth quarter, Civic accumulated a total online readership of more than 73M. Though many of our partnership announcements were made via Twitter this quarter, we did make a <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/introducing-new-tools-for-creators-to-build-trusted-communities/">new product announcement</a> during Solana Breakpoint in November with our new suite of NFT creator tools. The announcement made headlines in <a href="https://decrypt.co/85492/combat-solana-bot-problem-civic-unveils-digital-id-nfts">Decrypt</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/civic-launches-free-tool-to-combat-nft-hungry-bots-on-solana">CoinTelegraph</a>, <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2021/11/08/civic-launches-ignite-pass-tool-to-eliminate-bots-in-nft-mints-and-drops/">Invezz</a> and <a href="https://www.cointrust.com/market-news/civic-launches-free-tool-for-bot-free-nft-minting-and-dropping">Cryptopian</a>.</p>



<p>And, we made great strides in compliance-related thought leadership as FATF made announcements and the DeFi space continued to grow. Our head of risk and compliance, Chris Harding, made appearances on a panel for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmUjvkPYXNs">LA Blockchain Summit</a>, at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KIhF6M3uO8">Reimagine conference</a> and on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/71VDJTahPBq4m5wfRx5Sxi">CryptoNews podcast</a>. He also penned <a href="https://thedefiant.io/crypto-regulation-defi-adoption/">an op-ed for The Defiant</a> about regulation in crypto, and interviewed with both <a href="https://www.gokhshteinmedia.com/article/where-the-worlds-of-blockchain-and-identity-verification-intersect">Gokhshtein Media</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/crypto-security-2022-prepare-for-more-defi-hacks-exchange-outages-noob-mistakes.htm">Crypto News</a>.</p>



<p>Coming Soon</p>



<p>What a ride 2021 was! We’re poised for further growth in 2022, and we’re also pruning some programs to keep up with the growth, including our Verified by Civic Pass program, which we recently closed. During Q1, expect to see more partnership announcements as we continue building out the DeFi side of our business. In fact, in Q1 2022 we’ve already integrated Civic Pass with KYB for a new partner that is attracting institutional investors, Credix. We’ve also partnered with Liquid Meta to <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/liquid-meta-partners-with-civic-technologies-to-bring-capital-liquidity-to-permissioned-dapps/">bring capital liquidity to permissioned dApps</a>. And, we’ll be adding features to our NFT products as we continue to respond to dynamic community needs.&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

 As you probably know, Anonyome Labs has created two popular products based on personas or digital identities we call&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=what+is+a+sudo">Sudos</a>: 



<p></p>



  A persona-based application (<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;consumer app)&nbsp;  A persona-based services platform (<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>), for enterprise developers to include persona-based services into their consumer products (MySudo also uses this).&nbsp;  



<p>Having multiple personas (digital identities or Sudos) means the user can compartmentalize (silo) their daily activities and gain greater&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;protection. (Read our popular deep dives on&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;as a data privacy protection strategy, why&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/why-data-privacy-experts-urge-businesses-to-proactively-protect-customer-data/">data privacy matters</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">what consumers want</a>.)</p>



<p>To give you some insight into the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">innovation and expertise</a>&nbsp;we bring to persona-based products, here are 17 of the patents filed during the creation of MySudo and Sudo Platform.</p>



 Persona System 



<p></p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Masking a Real User Controlling Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9372987, June 20, 2016 (Issued)</p>



<p>This patent outlines the design of a persona application and persona services that allow a user to create personas for their own use and where only they know the identity and can operate the personas that they own. The persona services do not have the information to relate users to personas.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Administering Proxy Identities, Patent #: US10356052, July 16, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This patent outlines the design for the persona services. Each user can have multiple personas, each persona fitted with identity attributes such as phone number, email address, virtual payments information, contacts, and avatar, and with capabilities such as communications, browsing, anonymous payments, and reputation. The persona services also allow for a marketplace of personas so that personas can be bought and sold between users.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Building, Extending and Managing Interactions Between Digital Identities and Digital Identity Applications, Patent #: US10931650, February 23, 2021 (Issued)</p>



<p>This is a more detailed examination of the design of the persona applications and persona services, including verifying the distribution of applications built from the persona services.</p>



 Persona Anonymity with Recourse 



<p></p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Enabling Owner Authorized Monitored Stewardship Over Protected Data in Computing Devices, Patent #: US10963582, March 30, 2021 (Issued)</p>



<p>This is a design for an anonymity with recourse system that allows a user to maintain complete anonymity, possession of cryptographic keys, possession of encrypted communication and so on up to the point where a legal process allows uncovering of that data. The blockchain-based system records the implementation of the process steps so that any collusion or misbehavior by participants can be uncovered.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Managing Digital Identities and Controlling Their Correlation to Legal Identities, Patent #: US11159578, October 26, 2021 (Issued)</p>



<p>This builds on the generic anonymity with recourse system in the above patent to focus on the use of personas for anonymity and how under legal due process the identity of the user can be uncovered. Again, a blockchain-based system ensures that any misbehavior is uncovered.</p>



<p>Persona Usage with Decentralized Identities</p>



<p>Digital Wallet for Digital Identities and Interactions with a Digital Identity Services Platform, US16/821,181, March 17, 2020 (Filed)</p>



<p>This patent outlines the design of how to enhance personas with decentralized identity such that each persona can access a full range of compartmentalized decentralized identity services, such as DIDComm encrypted messaging, verifiable credentials (request, hold, present), passwordless login and so on. Each persona has a decentralized identity wallet holding encryption keys, DIDs, verifiable credentials and other information specifically for that persona.&nbsp;</p>



 Persona Reputation 



<p></p>



<p>A Decentralized Reputation Service for Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9703986, July 11, 2017 (Issued)</p>



<p>This defines a system and method to calculate ongoing persona reputation. It also uses a block chain as an immutable store of the reputation calculation.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Establishing Trust of Anonymous Identities, Patent #: US11177937, November 16, 2021 (Issued)</p>



<p>This disclosure is an extension to the reputation design outlined above. This disclosure presents a method whereby a reputation score can be calculated for anonymous online users (personas) by analyzing their public activities performed in online settings, analytics gathering, and/or other disclosed or discoverable data points. Inputs to the reputation score may come from the ratings or reviews submitted by other parties of verified transactions where an online user has participated, such as purchases, rentals, enrolments etc.&nbsp;</p>



 Persona-Based Anonymous Payments 



<p></p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Processing Virtual Credit Cards for Digital Identities, US 16/985,962, August 14, 2020 (Filed)</p>



<p>This patent outlines a design for allowing anonymous payments by providing personas each with virtual payment cards. The system outlines how these cards are created, managed and closed.</p>



 Persona-Based Browsing 



<p></p>



<p>A Persona-Based Privacy Browser, US16/877,976, May 19, 2020 (Filed)</p>



<p>This describes the design of a persona-based browser application system that allows for improved anonymization and compartmentalization of persona browsing by allowing the creation of an individual browser configuration/instance for each persona.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Persona Based Isolation Browsing, August 15, 2019 (Filed)</p>



<p>This patent extends the persona-based privacy browser application design above by allowing the creation of an individual isolation browser configuration/instance for each persona.</p>



 Persona-Based Email 



<p></p>



<p>Email Application for Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9729519, August 8, 2017 (Issued)</p>



<p>This outlines the design for an email system for users with multiple personas. This provides compartmentalized email for each persona. The email communication is encrypted between personas.</p>



<p>Method and System for Automating Secure Email for Multiple Personas, Patent #: US10382211, August 13, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This patent extends the above patent to describe the design of a standards-based S/MIME persona-based email system to allow encrypted persona-to-persona email, or encrypted persona-to-third party S/MIME email.</p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Managing Digital Identities, Patent #: US10511493, December 17, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This extends the above patents to specifically describe the management of multiple email accounts for each persona. These are machine-generated random email accounts such that a single persona could have an account for each service that the persona interacts with, giving the user very fine-grained control of email accounts for each persona.</p>



 Persona-Based VPN 



<p></p>



<p>Method and System for Providing Persona Masking in a Computer Network, Patent #: US10320753, June 11, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This describes the design of a persona-based VPN system that allows for improved anonymization and compartmentalization of persona traffic by allowing the creation of a VPN configuration for each persona.</p>



 Persona-Based Telephony 



<p></p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Supporting Telephonic Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9374689, June 20, 2016 (Issued)</p>



<p>This outlines the design for a telephony application system for users with multiple personas. The telephony communication provides both SMS/MMS and voice calling, with each persona having one or more telephony numbers. This provides compartmentalized telephony for each persona.</p>



 Persona Protection 



<p></p>



<p>Apparatus and Method for Identifying and Warning of Synthetic Identity Behavior that Reduces User Privacy, Patent #: US10178106, January 8, 2019 (Issued)</p>



<p>This patent defines methods for protection from unwittingly disclosing the relationship between a persona identity and user identity, or between persona identities. The aim is to keep strong compartmentalization and to not reduce user privacy.</p>

  Module Federation allows loading Micro Frontends at runtime. Common dependencies like Angular or the Auth0 library can be shared and hence don't need to be loaded several times. This is also the key for sharing data like the current user or global filters.

				  The power of decentralized identity is that it decentralizes governance—enabling flexible solutions within a privacy and security-driven framework.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:trevor@indicio.tech">Trevor Butterworth</a></p>
<p>The past year has seen decentralized identity emerge from its “talk” phase and into its market phase. At the same time, the market is increasingly aware of the need for decentralized identity solutions to manage &nbsp;immediate problems, like the privacy and security challenges in banking and finance, &nbsp;the how to share and verify personal health data in hospitality and travel, and the need for constant, frictionless authentication in zero trust security applications.</p>
<p>But there is also the growing realization that decentralized identity is the way to manage verification and security in decentralized finance, Web3, and the metaverse, while allowing each to maintain its underlying decentralized integrity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable, secure, and interoperable identities will be critical to controlling the “Internet of Everything,” otherwise known as the spatial web, where an ever-expanding range of cameras and sensors using hyperspatial markup language will allow digital objects to engage with non-digital objects. It’s not just the drone that will have a verifiable identity; the parcel it carries will have one too.</p>
<p>All of this makes 2022 the year of the decentralized identity solutions, a chance for this long-evolving and much-talked about technology to show how it can solve the verification problems inherent in Web 2.0 and create trust in Web 3.0. Now is the time for these solutions to articulate how they will save money, make money, and mitigate risk. To do that, obviously, we need products and services; less obviously, we need to understand that the role of governance is to serve the solution and the customer.</p>
<blockquote>
 Enterprises want to buy solutions that solve problems, not engage in philosophies that make deployment feel like climbing a mountain of documentation 
</blockquote>
<p>Given decentralized identity’s long gestation, it is inevitable that a lot of talk accumulated into governance documents and governance frameworks. Every new technology needs to be talked into existence while the engineers catch up: We have to talk about something to figure out how to build the solution; we have to talk about problems and pain points, standards and protocols and technical requirements. </p>
<p>But there comes a point when all this talk must recede into the background documentation. Right now, it can often seem that governance frameworks are the solutions and the technology is incidental or worse, inadequate.</p>
<p>This is a problem, and it is compounded by a miasma of confusing &nbsp;terminology, sequential processes, and technology and governance “stacks.” These &nbsp;are difficult to process into a simple “aha” if you are among the uninitiated — which is most of the potential market for this technology. Decentralized identity has not yet found its equivalent to the “1,000 songs in your pocket,” what-it-all-means message that successfully launched Apple’s iPod. That kind of messaging is critical, and governance frameworks do not, frankly, speak with that clarity and compulsion.</p>
<p>This is not to say that we don’t appreciate the importance of shared standards, clear technical requirements, and best practices: we do; but they are not the solution—no more than governance is for cloud services. They serve the solution &nbsp;and the solution serves the customer’s needs. </p>
<p>It is time for solutions to take the spotlight.</p>
<blockquote>
 Governance should be flexible, pragmatic — and decentralized 
</blockquote>
<p>You may have noticed that this article has, so far, avoided mentioning “self-sovereign identity” or SSI. SSI is what the identity community originally called decentralized identity—and still largely does. But it can be a problematic term for some audiences because it can be read as saying that in decentralized identity there is no such thing as society, there are just &nbsp;“selves”— self-sovereign identities that are all co-equal.</p>
<p>While a foundational principle of self-sovereign identity is that individuals should be in control of their own data and identity, the reality is that there are other kinds of sovereign entities besides individuals: nations, institutions, membership organizations, companies, each of which carries its own governance history and culture and which imposes rules on its subjects and negotiates and interoperates with other sovereign entities.</p>
<p>If any of these entities chooses to adopt decentralized identity, it is making a clear commitment to a privacy-preserving, secure technology, simply because that’s the technology’s function and not just a feature. But it is also going to deploy the technology in a way that accords with the goals of its existing governance because that is what sovereign entities do. </p>
<p>Some of these deployments are going to be <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/4/247949/2021-Perkins-Coie-LLP-Health-Passport-White-Paper.pdf">less than fully self-sovereign</a>, and we must recognize that governance frameworks for decentralized identity are going to be negotiations with existing governance requirements; there needs to be flexibility.</p>
<p>This is the reason why we advocate “machine-readable governance” as an architectural solution.</p>
 
 First, machine-readable governance simplifies how decentralized identity works: The user software handles the rules for information flows and authentication, which are established and published by the entities with authority for governing the use case. 
 Second, this architecture makes these rules transparent. 
 Third, and critically, it enables these rules to function offline through caching, which, when you think about it, is an essential feature in any digital identity verification system; trust can’t be dependent on a Wi-Fi signal. 
 
<p>But there’s a broader value here too. The architecture of machine-readable governance architecture enables nations, institutions, and people to set up and participate in systems that directly address their problems without having to transfer power to unnecessary intermediaries; power, instead, remains with the existing governing bodies. </p>
<p>This, we believe, makes the system more trustworthy, as we don’t need another layer of bureaucracy to ensure that we can trust the third-party trust registry from enacting tolls, excluding participants, or exercising monopolistic power.</p>
<p>We also believe it is a mistake to think that governments are going to show up and submit to governance institutions and frameworks that are not of their making or under their control. Similarly, any decentralized identity solution that posits, “first, we create a league of nations,” isn’t just doomed, it actively dissuades people from taking the technology seriously because it makes unrealistic government participation a prerequisite for the technology.</p>
<blockquote>
 Futureware is a vampire that will suck the life out of opportunity 
</blockquote>
<p>No matter how well-meaning, governance recommendations that require implementing technology or standards that aren’t presently available — and may not be available for months or years — are acts of marketing self-sabotage. There must be a path to immediate implementation. It is vitally important that this path does not foreclose better solutions in the future, but there must be a path.</p>
<p>We understand the fear of institutionalizing the wrong software solution and then being stuck with applying band-aids for years. This is, after all, what landed us with the problem decentralized identity is designed to solve — the internet’s missing identity layer for people. But the benefit of open-source software development is that it promises continuous improvement.</p>
<p>If we deliver a good open-source solution today — in the face of many terrible centralized and federated alternatives — it will keep evolving as technology improves.</p>
<blockquote>
 &nbsp;Ockam’s Decentralized Razor 
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, for all those in the decentralized identity field, we should remember the value of parsimony, famously attributed to themedieval philosopher William of Ockham: Do not multiply entities beyond necessity. In other words, don’t create rules and processes and bureaucracies without established and compelling reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>The aim of decentralized identity governance should be the greatest number of applications from the smallest number of rules and in the shortest possible number of pages. Confusion and complexity will block adoption. </p>
<p>Consider what scientists discovered about effective communication to policymakers: If you can’t explain the science in a half page, chances are you’ll lose the attention of those with the power to implement change.</p>

  Holochain: a marlinspike to undo the knots

<p>In response to many questions about Holochain’s fitness for Web3, and in the face of growing criticisms of Web3, my colleagues and I share why we think Holochain is capable of building Web3. Not Web3 as it exists today — centralised, expensive, and finance-oriented — but a truly people-powered web built with distributed ledger tech that isn’t blockchain-based.</p><p>What are people saying about Web3? Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1473165434518224896">can’t seem to find evidence of it</a>. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey says it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098">not what it appears to be</a>. But I think the <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">sharpest critique</a> comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/moxie">Moxie Marlinspike</a>. As co-creator of the Signal protocol that protects the privacy of <a href="https://www.signal.org/">most</a> <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">of</a> our <a href="https://matrix.org/">online</a> <a href="https://messages.google.com/">conversations</a>, he knows something about cryptography, but he isn’t too excited about ‘crypto’.</p><p>Moxie’s definition of Web3 is simple: it’s the class of technologies that wants to offer the features of Web2 — services that let us easily connect, create, interact — with the decentralised freedom that we enjoyed with Web1.</p><p>To most people, Web3 means blockchain. Moxie exposes some fairly serious challenges that blockchain faces — not just its ability to handle real-world applications, but also whether people even care about the problems it’s trying to solve.</p><p>When my colleagues and I read the article, we got excited. Moxie seemed to be making the <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae">same</a> <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/perspectives-on-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies-7ef391605bd1">diagnoses</a> <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/cryptocurrencies-are-dead-d4223154d783">we’ve</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/#back-story-agent-centric-data-enables-collaboration">made</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">for</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/satoshi-nakamoto-and-the-fate-of-our-planet-2/">years</a>. We also realised — hey, Holochain addresses a lot of the problems he’s talking about! I’d like this article to be an invitation to a larger conversation both with him and the broader ‘Web3 world’.</p> A short history of tangled webs <p>True to the original spirit of the internet, Web1 was all about decentralisation. Its big innovation was the hyperlink, allowing any author to connect their work to someone else’s without permission. And because anyone could create web pages and run a server (if they had the technical skills), anyone could be a publisher.</p><p>Slowly and then suddenly, everyone wanted to join the web party — but not everybody had the technical skills. So Web2 built big servers and easy-to-use software, then invited the whole world. It spread out a generous banquet, offering the power to create not just documents and links but conversations, calendars, photos, videos, music, lists, diagrams, and more. And by getting us all together in the same room, it really did become a party — an explosion in our capacity to connect and interact with each other.</p><p>However, we know how the story has unfolded since then. Web2 looked like a good idea at the time, but it’s turned out to have a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/opinion/facebook-privacy.html">dark side</a>. We appear to have become ‘<a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/">the</a> <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/">product</a>’, as they say, not the authors of our own lives as we’d thought.</p><p>The centralisation that enabled the capture of our online lives is inherent in the design of HTTP, the protocol that powers the web. Over the years, more and more people have called for a re-decentralisation — a new web, a ‘Web3’ that avoids the mistakes of the original web by design.</p><p>Why do we need to reimagine the web? If the first web was already decentralised, why can’t we just go back to it? Moxie argues that the reason is simple: “people don’t want to run their own servers, and never will.”</p><p>Is this true? The 3000+ HoloPort owners worldwide would seem to disagree. But I think Moxie is really saying that people just want to get down to the business of doing what they want to do, not managing a bunch of tech. For most of us, the computer is just a tool, not a hobby.</p> Real reasons people don’t want to go back to Web1 and run their own servers   Setup cost: You need a domain name and a stable IP address, which are either complicated or expensive.  Technical burden: Generally, server management is extremely complicated, and getting more so every day.  Security issues: Running web server and application software can expose your machine and network to security vulnerabilities.  Fragility: You’re the sole authority for your little piece of the web, so you bear the consequences if your server suddenly gets popular — or goes offline.  Isolation: Your server is just that — yours, and yours only. The power of Web2 is that it brings everybody together in a shared space. Does anybody want to give that up?  <p>Blockchain simply doesn’t have an answer to most of these challenges. And it doesn’t need to — blockchain wasn’t designed to be the basis for Web3. It was designed to record events, particularly changes of ownership on a bunch of crypto tokens.</p><p>At best, problem #3 (security issues) is solved by the fact that blockchains ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandbox</a>’ their running code. Problems #4 (fragility) and #5 (isolation) are irrelevant, but only because everybody has to store everybody else’s stuff anyway. Here we see a new problem — “everybody else’s stuff” is a lot of stuff, so it becomes <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html">too costly</a> for all but the biggest players to run their own blockchain server.</p><p>Sounds like centralisation all over again. And Moxie describes how that’s playing out in reality — centralised, unaccountable gateways are now our windows into the supposedly decentralised ledger.</p><p>On top of that, the high operating cost puts a price tag on every online activity, which means that most Web3 applications justify the cost by being financially-oriented — currency trading, investment derivatives, property speculation, gambling, and ‘play-to-earn’ games. Moxie suggests that this is why the world is actually so excited about Web3. It’s about the money, not the decentralisation.</p> Holochain is fit for the real Web3 <p>What if you could get the benefits of decentralisation for free while you used your normal, everyday apps and services? Well, Holochain can help — it neatly addresses all five barriers to running your own server. Here’s how.</p>  Setup cost: In a Holochain app people connect securely, privately, and directly to each other’s computers, either via public IP addresses or through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT">relay</a> service. Holochain creates an ‘overlay’ on top of the underlying network, making fixed IP addresses and domain names unimportant.  Technical burden: You don’t need to care or even know you’re running a personal ‘server’. It’s just a background process that’s built into the app, running on your computer with no configuration required. Really, it’s easy to set up, and it’ll get even easier in the future — you should <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/">give it a try</a>!  Security issues: Holochain has a strictly defined network protocol that validates every interaction with your peers. It also sandboxes the back-end of every application, preventing it from gaining direct access to your filesystem and network.  Fragility: You’re responsible for the original copy of your data, along with a small slice of everyone else’s data — and only for the applications you use. If you go offline, other people serve your data for you. Everyone shares the load evenly — with a Twitter-like app, we predict that you’d only accumulate 20 MB of data per year, equivalent to three photos or five seconds of video.  Isolation: Holochain is intended to deliver apps with the decentralisation of Web1 and the connectedness of Web2. Each application has its own shared database that every participant can read from and write to. In other words, you and your peers are each other’s ‘Web2’ — not an organisation that sees you as the product.  <p>There are still a couple centralisation points — the aforementioned proxy relay and a service called a ‘bootstrap’ are both hosted on remote servers. But they are about as irrelevant as Signal’s own servers are — they’re just places for peers to find each other and pass encrypted messages back and forth. Besides, you can always run your own, and you <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/683">don’t even need them</a> if you and your peers are in the same local network.</p> Shared protocols, evolution, and innovation <p>There’s one more downside of running your own web server: it’s hard to get everyone speaking the same ‘language’. It wasn’t such a big deal back in the Web1 days when the only language was ‘documents and links’. But as we started using the web for mass-scale, real-time interaction, it became important. We needed to make sure we were all speaking the same ‘tasks and meeting invites’ language as our colleagues, the same ‘posts and likes’ language as our friends and relatives, the same ‘money transfers’ language as the stores we shopped at.</p><p>Web2 platforms give us these shared languages — let’s call them ‘application protocols’ — as well as a central place to route every interaction through. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">Attempts</a> to decentralise this have only been moderately successful.</p><p>Moxie argues that protocols evolve slowly, while platforms evolve quickly. That’s because a platform can make decisions without waiting for a whole crowd of others to reach consensus. But here’s the thing — some protocols don’t need to evolve quickly. As long as a ‘base protocol’ is versatile enough to let people create and express things in an unlimited range of fit-for-purpose application protocols, it can be as stale and boring as it likes. And it’s precisely the decentralisation, versatility, and stability of these base protocols — HTTP, email, and yes, Bitcoin and Ethereum — that allow platforms to innovate so quickly on top of them.</p><p>It’s true, though, that an application’s evolution can slow down if you try to decentralise it. So what will it take to enjoy the benefit of rapid innovation while maintaining healthy decentralisation?</p>  Users must be able to painlessly upgrade to a new application protocol across the entire network when they need to.  Users must have choice over the versions of the application protocols they use — in other words, a group must be empowered to make its own governance decisions.  <p>Holochain does all that! Its base protocol is versatile enough to build any sort of interactions people want to do online: social media, team productivity, currencies, carbon credits, micro energy grids, and so on. These are regular, real-world applications, not just applications that “[move] all aspects of life into an instrumented economy” as Moxie describes it. For these application protocols, we’ll soon be adding the ability for users to automatically download and activate an update — no manual steps needed.</p><p>Additionally, in contrast to Web2, where everyone is forced into the same experience, a Holochain application can give groups a choice about whether to accept protocol changes, while also being able to keep all their existing data. For instance, if a chat app releases an upgrade, one team in a company can upgrade because they want the new features, while another team in the same company can stay on the old version because they prefer the UI. They run the app; it’s their choice.</p> Empowering everyone <p>That only leaves one problem: how can we, as users of an app, be part of the design of the apps we use? How do we choose the rules that govern our interactions, gain a stake in the design of the protocols our apps speak? Moxie suggests that this might be the thing worth working on if we want to change our relationship to technology.</p><p>We see a lot of promise in ideas like <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/">end-user programming</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/01/07/what-is-low-code-development/?sh=76ddde41496d">low-code development</a>. Done right, they will empower people to create their own apps.</p><p>We also see an <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/reusable-modules/introduction/motivation/">encouraging trend</a> in the Holochain development community. Small, composable components are being developed, with the intention that beginning developers can reuse them easily without having to become experts in Holochain application design.</p><p>And projects like Neighbourhoods’ <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/low-code-marketplace.html">low code marketplace</a> are another important step in that direction. It aims to offer a place where developers can offer generic, customisable parts that users can connect like Lego blocks into applications that suit their needs, without requiring any programming knowledge at all.</p><p>Finally, the developers behind <a href="https://youtu.be/6ZiUekVAg3A">Generative Objects</a>, a low-code development tool, are working on adding Holochain support so that people can create their own applications from scratch, again without a line of code.</p><p>But we believe that digital tools are useful for more than just everyday apps, as important as they are. Traditional modes of governance are <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/the-future-of-governance-is-not-governments-9c894e17b1cd">failing us left and right</a>. We intend to help spark a Precambrian explosion of innovation in collective governance patterns. This requires an upgrade of humanity’s ability to create, express, and practice those patterns together. And we think that a software toolkit like <a href="https://holochain.org/">Holochain</a> will be a crucial part of making that happen.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Phillip Messerschmidt</a></p><p>As advisors, we at KuppingerCole Analysts have regular contact with our customers. The topics discussed range from strategic directions to operational challenges in different IT security and IAM topics. We often encounter similar, ambitious questions and challenges - an example from the Zero Trust environment: How can we implement Zero Trust? What do we need to do in order to have implemented the Zero Trust initiative to a large extent by the end of the year? This attitude is not limited to Zero Trust, but can be found in almost all subject areas.</p>
<p>Even if the ambitions behind it are respectable, it is nevertheless always equally concerning how often buzzwords are chased without understanding their substance and creating the appropriate basis. Let's stay with some Zero Trust examples: Does device management exist? Are all identities that want access known and recorded? How is the zoning of the networks done? It is not uncommon to get questioning faces in reaction to these questions.<br><br></p>
<p>The realization of trend themes often requires operational excellence</p>
<p>In the resulting discussion of the experiences listed above, it often turns out that the customer has not yet dealt with the topic well enough. In fact, this is not a problem, because it is our task to sensitize our customers accordingly and to provide them with the necessary knowledge. Nevertheless, organizational, functional, and technical weaknesses are uncovered in this process. Customers have discussions with us about Cloud Identity and Access Management with third party involvement, but they have not yet managed to execute an end-to-end joiner-mover-leaver-process for internal employees without any media discontinuity and without manual activities. Another example is application onboarding, which is often planned without a list of all applications and their responsibilities. Such circumstances make it not only significantly more difficult but also more dangerous, as sensitive information can be exposed. Therefore, the realization of trend topics often requires that companies have operational excellence or at least a high level of maturity in the corresponding areas.<br><br></p>
<p>Automation is the operationalization of formulated structures and rules.</p>
<p>When designing their IT landscape, many companies claim to be individual and special. However, this attitude does not stand in the way of successful automation to increase overall efficiency. Regardless of the degree of individuality of a company, decisions are always made according to certain rules and contexts in both manual and technology supported implementations. As soon as a context can be captured by a rule, it can be operationalized and automated. Technically, nothing stands in the way of such automation!<br><br></p>
<p>Use case: Policy based access control (PBAC)</p>
<p>A classic example of automation in the IAM environment, is the move to Policy Based Access Control (PBAC). Historically, many applications that were previously hosted on-premises were managed locally by an administrator. This type of access management is typically very costly, difficult to keep track of, and prone to error or manipulation. In line with the complexity and workload, departments were also made accountable and empowered to manage themselves via a Role based access control (RBAC) approach. The delegation relieved the administrators, but only shifted the workload and further increased the complexity. To relieve complexity, attribute-based access control (ABAC) is used to assign access rights based on functional decisions, which are based on attributes of identities, in an automated way. This is the first step towards automation!</p>
<p>Rapid digitalization has made it increasingly easy for companies to obtain more information and data about users. User Behavior Analytics (UBA) are capturing more and more processable context about users that can be used in automation. Location and time of a login, device of access, destination of the request can all be captured, processed, interpreted and used to make an informed and rule-based decision. If this decision is mapped technically, a policy is created to control access (PBAC). Operationalizing and organizing these policies not only dramatically increases efficiency, transparency and agility, but also sustainably reduces costs and risks.<br><br></p>
<p>Identity &amp; Process Automation: Where and How to Find Efficiencies?</p>
<p>If we return to the initial question, the answer is relatively simple and yet difficult to grasp: Automation potential can be found everywhere!</p>
<p>The challenge is often to identify and formulate the implicitly applicable rules that may already exist and have applied for a long time. The actual automation of a formulated rule is then usually the smaller step.</p>

  <p>11ty is a fantastic tool for quickly creating static sites using a variety of templating languages. 11ty makes designing and developing static sites simple. It supports HTML, Markdown, JavaScript, Nunjucks, Handlebars, and many other template styles, along with built-in support for layouts, pagination, and slugify. 11ty aims to compete against other frameworks such as Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, Gatsby, and Nuxt. The framework is indeed as simple and powerful as its creators claim.</p>

<p>This tutorial will teach how to secure your 11ty site using Okta. 11ty will produce static pages, which means you won’t have the luxury of servers and states to help manage your authentication. But Okta still has a solution for this. To authenticate users, you will use the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget/">Okta Sign-In Widget</a>. Then you will store the <code>id token</code> returned from the Okta authentication server. You can then use that <code>id token</code> to query Okta’s servers for many operations, including <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#introspect">verifying if the token is valid</a> or obtaining user information.</p>

   <a>Start your 11ty website</a> 
   <a>Learn more about working with 11ty</a> 
 

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js 10 or newer</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
 

 Create your Okta application 

<p>Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/vue/create-okta-application/">Create a Vue App</a> for more information.</p>



 Create your 11ty site 

<p>If you wish to follow along using the completed project you can <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-website-eleventy-example">check out the GitHub repository here</a>.</p>

<p>The first step is to create your 11ty site. Create your project directory.</p>

   <code>mkdir okta-website-eleventy-example
cd okta-website-eleventy-example
</code>   

<p>Next, create your node application and install 11ty.</p>

   <code>npm init -y
npm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy@1.0.0
</code>   

<p>At this point, your 11ty site is ready to run. You can test it out by adding a new page.</p>

   <code>echo '&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;' &gt; index.html
</code>   

<p>Enter the following command to start 11ty:</p>

   <code>npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
</code>   

<p>By default, 11ty will attempt to use port <code>8080</code> on localhost, so navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and you can see your Hello World page.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you are using Windows, you will need to open the index file you just created and resave it with <code>UTF-8</code> encoding, as 11ty uses <code>UTF-16 LE</code> by default.</p>

 Add a couple of static pages 

<p>Now you can add some content to your site. Your site will consist of the following pages:</p>

 
   An index page to greet users (<code>index.html</code>) 
   A login page (<code>login.html</code>) 
   A readme to demonstrate the usage of markdown (<code>README.md</code>) 
   A page that is under authentication (<code>protected.html</code>) 
 

<p>First, open the <code>index.html</code> file you just created and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js
---

&lt;div class="row align-items-md-stretch"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
        &lt;div class="h-100 p-5 text-white bg-secondary rounded-3"&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Using Okta with 11ty&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A small tutorial on writing static sites with 
                &lt;a class="text-dark" href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank"&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt;, 
                secured by &lt;a class="text-dark" href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;
                written by &lt;a class="text-dark" href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nik Fisher.&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;a class="btn btn-outline-light" role="button" href="Login"&gt;Login Now&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a class="btn btn-light" role="button" href="README"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>You will notice the <code>layout</code> variable at the top of the file. You have not added this file to your project yet and will need to do that. But you can assign the layout page to this file, so you don’t have to add it later.</p>

<p>Next, create a file for <code>login.html</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js
---

&lt;div id="okta-login-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  oktaSignIn.authClient.token.getUserInfo().then(function(user) {
    window.location='/protected';
  },function(error) {
    oktaSignIn.showSignInToGetTokens({
      el: '#okta-login-container'
    }).then(function(tokens) {
      oktaSignIn.authClient.tokenManager.setTokens(tokens);
      oktaSignIn.remove();
      window.location='/protected';
    }).catch(function(err) {
      console.error(err);
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>The only HTML in this page here is a <code>div</code> with <code>id="okta-login-container"</code>. You call the <code>OktaSignIn</code> features and display the login screen to the user with the JavaScript code on this page. Okta will create the login form and handle the actual authentication. All you need to do is call the <code>showSignInToGetTokens</code> method and handle the promise to set the token using the <code>tokenManager</code>. Once you have done that, you will redirect the user to the <code>protected</code> page.</p>

<p>You can add the <code>protected.html</code> page now. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>---
layout: _layout_authenticated.11ty.js
---

&lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    function loadPage(){
        //replace with API call 
        document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = "&lt;h2&gt;Congrats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h5&gt;You've reached a protected page&lt;/h5&gt;"
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>Since you haven’t seen the <code>_layout_authenticated.11ty.js</code> page yet, this will need some explanation. After verifying that the user has authenticated, the <code>loadPage</code> function is called by the layout.</p>

<p>There’s a comment to replace the code here with an API call. You can add an API call to verify the ID token on the server-side before displaying any content to the user.</p>

<p>Finally, add a page for <code>README.md</code> and add the following markdown to it.</p>

   <code>---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js
---

# Okta Eleventy website example

This repository shows you how to use Okta on a static site built with 11ty.

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js 10 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)
</code>   

<p>The <code>README.md</code>you’ve just added is a truncated version of the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-website-eleventy-example/blob/master/README.md">README file</a> that you can see in the GitHub repository for this project.</p>

 Add layout pages 

<p>It’s now time to add the layout pages for your static files. 11ty enables you to write layouts in several templating languages. For this project, you will use the stock <code>11ty.js</code> format. Create a new folder called <code>_includes</code> using the command <code>mkdir _includes</code>.</p>

<p>Add a file called <code>_layout_base.11ty.js</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>exports.data = {

};

exports.render = function (data) {
  return `&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
        integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
        integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p"
        crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/5.14.1/js/okta-sign-in.min.js"
        type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;link href="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/5.14.1/css/okta-sign-in.min.css" type="text/css"
        rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;${data.title}&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        const oktaSignIn=new OktaSignIn({
            baseUrl: "https://{{yourOktaDomain}}",
            redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8080/callback',
            clientId: "{{yourClientId}}",
            authParams: {
                issuer: "https://{{yourOktaDomain}}/oauth2/default"
            }
        });     
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        ${data.content}
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;`;
};
</code>   

<p>Be sure to replace the placeholder variables with your actual Okta information.</p>

<p>This file will be the base layout for all of your pages.  It loads <code>bootstrap</code> into all of your pages and also initializes the <code>OktaSignIn</code> widget on each page.  In this way, you can access it in the JavaScript of your file no matter where you are.</p>

<p>Next, add a file for <code>_layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js</code> and then add the following code.</p>

   <code>exports.data = {
  title: "11ty And Okta",
  layout:  "_layout_base.11ty.js"
};

exports.render = function (data) {
  return `
     &lt;header class="d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center justify-content-md-between py-3 mb-4 border-bottom"&gt;
      &lt;a href="/" class="d-flex align-items-center col-md-3 mb-2 mb-md-0 text-dark text-decoration-none"&gt;
       Home
      &lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;div class="col-md-3 text-end"&gt;
        &lt;button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary me-2"&gt;&lt;a href="Login"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;

    ${data.content}
        
        `;
};
</code>   

<p>This file extends the base layout you created by creating a header with a <code>Home</code> button and a <code>Login</code> button that will direct the user to the <code>Login</code> page with your Okta sign-in widget.</p>

<p>Finally, add a new file called <code>_layout_authenticated.11ty.js</code>. Then, add the following code.</p>

   <code>exports.data = {
title: "11ty And Okta",
layout: "_layout_base.11ty.js",
};

exports.render = function (data) {
return `

&lt;header
    class="d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center justify-content-md-between py-3 mb-4 border-bottom"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/" class="d-flex align-items-center col-md-3 mb-2 mb-md-0 text-dark text-decoration-none"&gt;
        Home
    &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;div class="col-md-3 text-end"&gt;
        &lt;button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary me-2" onclick='logout()'&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

${data.content}

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    function logout() {
        oktaSignIn.authClient.signOut();
        location.reload();
    }

    if(!oktaSignIn?.authClient?.token) {
        window.location='/Login';
    }

    oktaSignIn.authClient.token.getUserInfo().then(function(user) {
        if(loadPage) {
            loadPage();
        }
    }).catch(function(e) {
        console.log(e);
        window.location='/Login'
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
`;
};
</code>   

<p>Again, this file will extend the base layout, while adding some additional functionality to each page that uses this layout. When the page loads, it will attempt to contact the Okta authorization server for information about the user with the ID token stored in the browser. If the contact request is successful, it will call the <code>loadPage</code> function implemented in those pages. Otherwise, the code redirects the user to the <code>Login</code> page. This page also contains a header with a <code>Logout</code> button and a method for <code>logout</code> that uses the sign-in widget to log the user out.</p>

 Start your 11ty website 

<p>If you are still running the site, then 11ty will have hot reloaded the site, and you should see the home page. If not, run the following command:</p>

   <code>npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
</code>   

<p>The command will build your templates into static pages and then serve the site on <code>localhost:8080</code>. Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to see the home page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click the login button to see the Okta Sign-In Widget in action. You can log in with your Okta credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If everything goes well, you should see the protected page.</p>

 Count Calories Better, Diet Healthier — Guide Of All What You Need To&nbsp;Know  The Dos and Don’ts of Counting&nbsp;Calories  Do: <p>When it comes to counting calories, there are a few dos that will help you stay on track and achieve your weight loss&nbsp;goals.</p>  Use a <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator/">diet calories calculator</a> app or website to track your intake. This will ensure accuracy and make it easier to stay on&nbsp;track.  Read the nutrition labels of all foods you eat. This will help you know how many calories are in each&nbsp;serving.  Create a calorie budget for yourself, and try to stick to it. This will help you lose weight gradually and&nbsp;safely.  Do make sure to include all foods and beverages in your calorie count. This includes those pesky little extras like condiments and sugar-free beverages.  Do be honest with yourself about how many calories you need to lose weight. If you want to lose 1–2 pounds per week, then aim to consume 500–1000 fewer calories than you burn each&nbsp;day.  Do adjust your calorie intake as needed. If you hit a plateau or if you start gaining weight, then adjust your calorie intake accordingly. A good rule of thumb is to reduce your intake by 100–200 calories per day until you start seeing results&nbsp;again.  Do focus on healthy foods that are low in calories but high in nutrients. This will help ensure that you are getting the most out of your diet while still losing weight. Some great options include vegetables, fruits, lean protein, and whole&nbsp;grains.”  <p>Check also: <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/benefits-of-red-beans/">Red bean&nbsp;benefits</a></p> Don’t: <p>If you’re trying to lose weight, counting calories is a great way to do it. But there are a few things you should avoid if you want to see results. Here are four don’ts of counting calories:</p>  Count calories without also considering other factors such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat. All of these nutrients play important roles in your health and should be taken into account when counting calories.  Skip meals or go too long between meals. This can cause you to become ravenous and overeat later&nbsp;on.  Obsess over every little calorie that you consume. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and obsessing over every calorie will only lead to stress and unhealthy eating&nbsp;habits.  Don’t forget about fiber. Fiber is another important nutrient, and it’s especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough fiber each day to help keep you full and support your weight loss&nbsp;goals  Don’t forget about carbs. Carbs are also an important part of a healthy diet, and they’re especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough carbs each day to help burn fat and fuel your workouts.  Don’t forget about protein. Protein is an important part of a healthy diet, and it’s especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough protein each day to help burn fat and build&nbsp;muscle.  Don’t overdo it. It’s important not to eat too few calories, as this can actually slow down your metabolism and make it more difficult to lose weight. Try to find the right balance for you, and don’t cut more than 500–750 calories per&nbsp;day.   The Pros and Cons of Calorie&nbsp;Counting <p>Calorie counting is a popular way to keep track of the number of calories you eat each&nbsp;day.</p><p>This can be an effective way to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. However, there are some pros and cons to calorie counting. The Pros of Calorie&nbsp;Counting</p>  You are in control of your food choices. When you are calorie counting, you are able to choose the foods that fit within your daily calorie budget. This can help you make healthier food choices and avoid unhealthy foods.  <p>2. It is an easy way to track progress. By keeping track of the number of calories you consume each day, you can see how your diet changes over time. This can be helpful in monitoring your progress and seeing if your current diet is working for&nbsp;you.</p><p>3. It helps you become more aware of portion sizes. Often when we don’t count calories, we tend to underestimate how much we are actually eating. Calorie counting can help teach you about proper portion sizes and how much food constitutes a serving&nbsp;size.</p><p>4. It may increase your metabolism&nbsp;. Some research has shown that people who calorie count may have a higher metabolic rate than those who do not count calories&nbsp;. This could lead to more successful weight loss in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>The Cons of Calorie&nbsp;Counting</p><p>1&nbsp;. It can be time consuming&nbsp;. Keeping track of every calorie that goes into your mouth can be a tedious process&nbsp;.</p><p>2&nbsp;. You may become obsessed with numbers&nbsp;. Focusing too much on numbers can lead to eating disorders and unhealthy relationships with food&nbsp;.</p><p>3&nbsp;. You might develop restrictive eating habits&nbsp;. Restricting yourself from certain foods can cause negative thoughts about food and body image&nbsp;issues</p> How to make Calorie counting effective   Make sure you’re accurately counting your calories. A lot of people make mistakes when counting, either by underestimating or overestimating the number of calories in their food. Use a calorie tracking app or website to get an accurate estimate of the calories in your&nbsp;meals.  <p>2. Don’t obsess over every little thing. If you eat a cookie or have a slice of pizza, don’t worry — just adjust your calorie intake for the rest of the day to make up for it. Trying to be perfect can be counterproductive and lead to feelings of guilt and frustration.</p><p>3. Find a method that works for you. Some people prefer to track their calories manually, while others find it more helpful to use an app or online calculator. Figure out what works best for you and stick with&nbsp;it.</p><p>4. Be patient. Losing weight takes time, so don’t expect results overnight. Stick with it for several weeks before deciding if calorie counting is right for&nbsp;you.</p><p>5. Make a list of foods that you enjoy and that are healthy. This will help you stay on track with your diet and make it more enjoyable.</p><p>6. Try to stick to healthy, nutrient-rich foods as much as possible. This will help you meet your nutritional needs while keeping your calorie intake in&nbsp;check.</p><p>7. Avoid processed foods whenever possible. These tend to be high in unhealthy fats, sugars and sodium, which can sabotage your weight loss&nbsp;efforts.</p><p>8. Drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks. Water is essential for good health and helps keep you feeling full throughout the day. Sugary drinks are packed with empty calories and can quickly derail your diet&nbsp;plans.</p> conclusion <p>We do Counting Calories for three purposes:</p><p>If you’re trying to lose&nbsp;weight:</p><p>Counting calories is a great way to help achieve your goals. There are many online tools and apps that can help with&nbsp;this.</p><p>Second, make sure you’re burning more calories than you’re eating. This can be done through exercise and physical activity.</p><p>Finally, give yourself time. It may take a while for your body to adjust to your new calorie intake, so be patient and keep up with your healthy&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Check also: <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/best-parsley-tea-brands/">Best parsley tea&nbsp;bags</a></p><p>If you are looking to gain&nbsp;weight:</p><p>You need to consume more calories than you burn. The average person needs around 2,000–2,500 calories per day to maintain their weight, so if you want to gain weight, you’ll need to eat more than&nbsp;that.</p><p>It’s best to spread your extra calories throughout the day, with three main meals and a couple of snacks in between. You can use a calorie calculator to help you determine how many calories you should be eating each&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are looking to maintain&nbsp;weight:</p><p>By simply eat as much as you&nbsp;burn.</p>

<p>Amid intense media scrutiny, the Treasury Department is reconsidering its use of <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/irs-makes-id-me-mandatory-people-accessing-online-accounts-011802/">ID.me’s biometric technology</a> to verify the identities of individuals filing their taxes online.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-28/treasury-weighing-id-me-alternatives-over-privacy-concerns">Bloomberg</a>, the agency and the IRS, its largest bureau, are now looking for alternatives to ID.me, in the wake of criticism over plans to make ID.me’s selfie-based onboarding system the only means of identity verification for online tax filing.</p>



<p>For its part, ID.me has sought to take <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/id-me-confirms-technology-partnerships-with-paravision-iproov-012708/">a transparent stance</a> about its technology and how it works, explaining in a blog post last week that Paravision provides its facial recognition technology for one-to-one matching, and that iProov provides liveness detection technology to help thwart presentation attacks. ID.me uses Amazon’s Rekognition platform, meanwhile, for one-to-many matching.</p>



<p>The company’s use of Rekognition is drawing particular concern from some advocacy groups, due to research efforts that have uncovered <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aclu-amazons-rekognition-907273/">disparities in its performance</a> between racial groups, which could have discriminatory outcomes in large-scale deployments. ID.me uses Rekognition to check for matches between a given end user and its internal database of all users, in order to ensure the the individual is not attempting to fraudulently make claims under multiple profiles.</p>



<p>For end user authentication, ID.me looks to Paravision’s technology, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/paravision-takes-top-spot-latest-nist-evaluation-012502/">which performed exceptionally well in testing with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>, both in terms of high accuracy and low demographic bias.</p>



<p>In a letter to the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, a researcher who had previously examined Rekognition’s demographic bias problem warned against putting “all Americans at the mercy of unverified and under-scrutinized algorithms, from a field whose algorithms are already known to have biased properties.”</p>



<p>While the Treasury Department is ostensibly looking for an alternative remote onboarding solution, a spokesperson suggested that it has little choice but to rely on third party vendors due to a “lack of funding for IRS modernization.” A lack of resources has also been cited as a major hindrance in the IRS’s efforts to pursue tax fraud more generally. President Biden pledged to increase IRS funding by $80 billion in his Build Back Better plan, which the Congressional Budget Office has estimated would <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-estimates-120-billion-irs-funding-boost">generate $200 billion</a> in additional revenue over the next decade.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.authenticid.com/">AuthenticID</a> is celebrating its most successful year in company history. The digital identity specialist’s year-over-year revenue went up 186 percent in 2021, making AuthenticID the latest technology provider to benefit from the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/maxine-most-warns-about-rough-waters-ahead-surging-idv-marketplace-111903/">growing demand for automated and remote identity solutions</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



  



<p>Moving forward, AuthenticID will try to scale its operations to capitalize on that success. The company supplemented its strong revenue with $100 million in investment funding in 2021, and used that money to double its employee headcount over the course of the year. AuthenticID is also preparing to open new corporate headquarters in Kirkland, Washington.</p>



<p>AuthenticID is best known for its fully automated identity verification offering, which uses document recognition to confirm the authenticity of an ID document, and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/archive/sionic-mobile-apps-get-biometric-security-from-authenticid-2274/">face recognition to match that document to its holder</a>. The solution can run on a modern smartphone, and can scale to provide coverage for organizations of any size.</p>



<p>According to AuthenticID, the organizations that do opt to use its solution can minimize costs and customer abandonment while simultaneously preventing fraud. The company is planning to expand its portfolio in the next few years, and will dedicate some of its recent financial windfall to the research and development of new identity products.</p>



<p>“2021 has been an incredible year for AuthenticID thanks to our dedicated team, wonderful clients and strategic partners who have been instrumental in building our momentum,” said AuthenticID CEO Jeff Jani. “There is a constant demand for accurate identity proofing across company use cases. From compliance and new regulations to the desire to streamline and simplify user experiences, we see our market opportunity widening more than anticipated.”</p>



<p>MarketsandMarkets recently predicted that the identity verification market would climb to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/marketsandmarkets-anticipates-18-6-billion-identity-verification-market-121303/">$18.6 billion in 2026</a>. Goode Intelligence, meanwhile, has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/remote-identity-verification-market-goode-intelligence-710143/">placed it at $17.2 billion</a> in the same forecast period.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.necam.com/">NEC Corporation of America</a> has signed on as a diamond sponsor of the <a href="https://www.infragardnational.org/">InfraGard National Members Alliance</a>. InfraGard is a law enforcement-oriented non-profit organization that is affiliated with the FBI, and will specifically be working with NEC to help combat human trafficking in the United States.</p>



  



<p>As a diamond sponsor, NEC will provide InfraGard with financial backing, and supply technological expertise and resources that could lead to the development of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/us-mexican-authorities-track-human-trafficking-facial-recognition-506215/">new anti-trafficking solutions</a>. The two parties did not disclose the full scope of that commitment, though they did indicate that some of the resources would go toward educational efforts to raise awareness about human trafficking and effective prevention strategies.</p>



<p>According to InfraGard, human trafficking occurs whenever someone is forced or coerced to provide some kind of labor, or to engage in a commercial sex act. The vast majority (95 percent) of the human trafficking cases on the FBI’s docket deal with some form of sex trafficking, while the remaining five percent involve some other kind of forced work. The FBI had more than 1,700 outstanding trafficking cases as of early January.</p>



<p>“Law enforcement and the private sector must work together to raise awareness about the atrocities being committed in cities and neighborhoods across America,” said InfraGard President Maureen O’Connell. “By shining a light on human trafficking, we can take this crime out of the shadows and protect the most vulnerable.”</p>



<p>“Our investment will support key programs that eradicate human trafficking, foster information-sharing between the public and private sectors, and strengthen community resilience,” added NEC America President and CEO Mark Ikeno. “Through this partnership we will utilize our technology and assets to advance the shared goal of ensuring the safety and security of all Americans.”</p>



<p>InfraGard Chair Emeritus&nbsp;Kathleen Kiernan signed on as the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/federal-law-enforcement-veteran-named-president-of-nec-national-security-systems-709291/">new President of NEC National Security Systems</a> in September. NEC Corporation of America has also been targeting the law enforcement sector after the hiring of Mike Lesko as <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nec-aims-to-enhance-public-safety-position-with-new-executive-appointment-703252/">Senior Director of Government Technology &amp; Services</a> back in March. InfraGard and NEC made the announcement as part of National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, which took place in January.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/">Innovatrics</a> is helping Guinea’s national police force carry out its digital transformation. To that end, Innovatrics has supplied the country’s police with an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-offers-forensics-fraud-prevention-release-abis-7/">Automated Biometric Identification System</a> (ABIS) to speed up fingerprint capture and identification.</p>



  



<p>The new <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-adds-tattoo-recognition-tool-law-enforcement-abis-112205/">Innovatrics ABIS</a> will replace a legacy identification system that relied on manual fingerprint comparison. Under that system, fingerprint matches could only be performed in the capital city of Conakry, where members of a trained task force would personally analyze and catalog fingerprints for the entire country. Matching a print in that environment could take hours, and limited the pool of officers who were available to do the job.</p>



<p>The Innovatrics ABIS, on the other hand, can be used by virtually any member of the force in any police station in Guinea, and can generate a match in a matter of seconds. Fingerprints are now stored in a central database, and any new prints are automatically run through that database to search for potential matches that could resolve outstanding cases. Officers can also annotate prints and look at partial prints and potential matches side-by-side.</p>



<p>New prints are captured and registered with dedicated fingerprint scanners. Innovatrics has already outfitted Guinea’s police with fingerprint and palm print recognition capabilities in the first phase of the deployment, and provided the force with technology to help them digitize their paper files. In the second phase, Innovatrics will supplement that with facial recognition technology, and deliver a remote system that allows the police to access the central identification database while they are in the field.</p>



<p>“This system allows us to make police work extremely more efficient,” said National Police General Director Abdoul Malick Kone. “The accuracy of biometrics allows us to prevent judicial errors and will greatly help us in administering justice.”</p>



<p>Innovatrics will be training officers to teach them how to use the ABIS system, after having previously provided Guinea’s Electoral Commission with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-provides-biometric-election-registry-guinea-040605/">biometric voter registration tech</a> to facilitate fair elections. In September, the company released a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-unveils-multimodal-abis-enrollment-app-093003/">new ABIS enrollment app</a> that enables biometric capture on Windows and Android devices.</p>

<p>Buying a home in today’s market is challenging from start to finish for many consumers. Reduced supply, increased demand and competitive bidding wars riddle the path to homeownership. The struggle doesn’t end there, according to recent homebuyers who responded to Finicity’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">2021 Mortgage Survey</a>, which is available now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many are still struggling with the decades-old headache of collecting mountains of paper documentation for underwriting. This antiquated holdover from a bygone era continues to add unnecessary stress and anxiety to processing, underwriting and closing a mortgage.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of what borrowers are going through in this white-hot market, Finicity surveyed over 1,000 consumers who have purchased or refinanced a home in the last year and compiled the insights into <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">High Demand, Higher Hurdles in the Mortgage Market</a>, which details these pain points and provides a window into how the mortgage lending industry can evolve to meet the shifting needs of today’s homebuyers and refinancers.</p>
 Big Opportunities for Change in the Mortgage Process 
<p>Many consumers approach their home purchase with excitement and, understandably, a bit of trepidation. But while today’s homebuyer grits their way through a challenging shopping and bidding environment, any excitement can quickly turn to angst when they are met with a cumbersome and laborious mortgage loan process.</p>
<p>Refining the mortgage process means identifying and removing pain points for homebuyers. Our survey uncovered that 89% of borrowers believe the loan application experience was as stressful if not more than the home buying experience itself. Eliminating friction during the mortgage process is a critical step in building loyalty and meeting the expectations of today’s homebuyer.</p>
<p>Many homebuyers were surprised to learn that physical documents still make up a large portion of mortgage documentation. Seventy-two percent of respondents were surprised or very surprised at the volume of paper that’s still used during the mortgage process.&nbsp;</p>
 Going Digital Means Reduced Stress 
<p>The majority of today’s homebuyers are accustomed to navigating life digitally, and the mortgage experience should align with this.</p>
<p>Only 12% of respondents indicated that they were uncomfortable permissioning their personal financial data to a lender. Meeting consumers where they feel most comfortable helps save them time and reduces unnecessary stress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Borrowers who used digital verifications were less likely to say the loan process was the most stressful part of buying or refinancing a home, and 83% of respondents using digital verifications said their loan processing time was shorter than expected or met their expectations.</p>
 Embracing Change 
<p>For many industries, the COVID-19 pandemic has been the catalyst to transition to digital solutions. While the mortgage industry has started down this path as well, there is still work to be done. Reducing friction through digitization of manual loan documentation and minimizing the document-chasing between lender and borrower is a key component of this transformation.</p>
<p>Consumer-permissioned data delivered through our open banking platform allows for digital verifications throughout the mortgage process, significantly reducing the time it takes to close. In today’s mortgage landscape, this can mean the difference between consumers stepping into their dream home after a quick, seamless loan process, or losing out to a buyer who is using digital lending for a quick close.</p>
<p>The complete findings are now available in Finicity’s most recent mortgage survey, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">High Demand, Higher Hurdles in the Mortgage Market</a>.</p>

 GiD Report#197 — How Solana makes web3&nbsp;possible <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-196-how-crypto-is-changing-the-central-banks-72586652b6d2">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  How Solana makes web3&nbsp;possible  Tweet of the week — It’s time to&nbsp;build  The U.S. approach to regulations and innovation in a&nbsp;nutshell  The IRS learns that people care about their identity frameworks — a&nbsp;lot  Stuff happens   1. How Solana makes web3&nbsp;possible Anatoly Yakovenko, Photo:&nbsp;Solana<p>The arrival of the SMTP protocol in 1981 — based on a proposal by Jon Postel — allowed people to directly communicate with each other via email. Later, the invention of Tim Berners-Lee’s world wide web in 1989 and corresponding protocol HTTP allowed people to access websites through a&nbsp;browser.</p><p>These developments from the early internet allowed people to easily share information.</p><p>Satoshi’s 2009 white paper on Bitcoin took that one step further — describing an elegant system combining cryptography, consensus mechanisms, and networked computers that would enable people to directly exchange value online without an intermediary for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>The next breakthrough would come in 2015 — the year Ethereum went live. Building on Satoshi’s core concepts, Vitalik Buterin conceived a system that enabled decentralized computation. Smart contracts are essentially programs or applications that run directly on the blockchain.</p><p>That framework would set the stage for use cases such as NFTs and DeFi, which came of age last&nbsp;year.</p><p>This concept of decentralized computation would plant the seeds for&nbsp;web3.</p><p>What if we could build an entire generation of decentralized applications on the blockchain?</p><p>Pioneers in the space immediately ran into roadblocks.</p><p>When Alameda Research and FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried assessed Ethereum as a platform for building a global, decentralized exchange, it was a nonstarter.</p><p>SBF — as he’s often referred to — earned his stripes at Jane Street Capital, one of the most storied prop shops on Wall Street. As such, the bar for their decentralized exchange was high. Coming from a world where high-frequency trading is the norm, your trades have to move as fast as information flows. Cost is also a major concern as fees directly eat away at your trading model. Scalability is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>In other words, Ethereum’s technology was too slow and too expensive.</p><p>That’s where Solana came&nbsp;in.</p><p>As Peter Thiel described in his book, Zero to One, you’re not moving the needle unless your offering is an order of magnitude better than what came&nbsp;before.</p><p>A host of so-called “Ethereum Killers” had been floating around that were potentially better than Ethereum but objectively, not that much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Released in 2019, Solana was different. Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko would incorporate learnings from his time as an engineer at Qualcomm working on cell networks into his development of the Solana blockchain.</p><p>The result is a blockchain that can process 50,000 transactions per second (tps) compared to Ethereum’s 15 tps for a fee that’s fractions of a penny. Given the massive growth in Ethereum’s ecosystem in recent years, computation fees can cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars during peak usage — something anyone who’s tried to mint a popular NFT drop on Ethereum intimately understands.</p><p>For SBF, Solana was fertile ground for developing his vision around decentralized finance.</p><p>Here’s Sam <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/yahoo-finance-live-nov-09-144954467.html">speaking at Yahoo Finance and Decrypt’s Crypto Goes Mainstream back in November</a>:</p><blockquote>“Solana is one of the few currently existing public blockchains that has a really plausible road map to scale millions of transactions per second at, you know, fractions of a penny per transaction, which is a scale that you need for&nbsp;this.”</blockquote><blockquote>“That is not where a lot of other blockchains have been focusing, including ethereum.”</blockquote><p>For the industry at large, Solana’s throughput and cost profile has taken decentralized computing from zero to one, paving a path forward where web3 is a legitimate reality.</p><p>Naturally, developers have followed suit — including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who announced last fall that he would <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/reddit-cofounder-ohanian-invests-100-million-social-media-solana-blockchain-2021-11">invest $100 million in decentralized social media projects built on&nbsp;Solana</a>:</p><p>Today, much of the NFT and DeFi ecosystem lives on Ethereum, but what we’re seeing in the market is the product of the last few&nbsp;years.</p><p>If Github commits are any indication, much of the next generation stuff — what will emerge in the market in this next cycle — will likely live on&nbsp;Solana.</p><p>The rise of Solana’s futures and derivatives markets also suggests growing institutional participation:</p><p>Solana is not without its issues. With development only starting in 2017, the network is still going through growing pains given its explosive growth.</p><p>In a rocky start to the year, the blockchain <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/01/25/solana-founder-anatoly-yakovenko-crypto-crash-blockchain-instability/">suffered 6 outages in January alone</a>. There’s clearly plenty more work to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Competition is also heating up as other next generation chains vy for market share including Avalanche, which offers its own scalability promises.</p><p>For end users, that can only be a good&nbsp;thing.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about Solana, you can check out this <a href="https://twoprime.io/is-solana-the-next-institutional-crypto-investment/">report published last week by Two Prime</a> (via /gregkidd).</p><p>It’s where we got these nifty charts&nbsp;from.</p><p>You can also check out <a href="https://youtu.be/wx6ZvC91n4Y">Greg’s conversation with Anatoly from our YouTube channel here</a>.

Tweet of the week — It’s time to&nbsp;build <p>The stock market — with crypto in tow — is having a rocky start to 2022, apparently the worst&nbsp;ever.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/stock-market-2022-worst-start-year-ever-73c15533-b443-4290-8693-c215df7a44ab.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>State of play: As of the end of trading yesterday — the 16th session of the year — 2022 is now, officially, the worst-ever start in the history of the S&amp;P 500, according to data from Ned Davis Research, a stock market research&nbsp;shop.</blockquote><p>The silver lining? Market downturns can be the best time to build — without the frothy distractions of all the hype and conference parties. (Solana began development during the last crypto winter in&nbsp;2017.)</p><p>And as SBF suggests, <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1485839809683800065">in a tweet responding Solana’s outages</a>, there’s still plenty of building required:</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/defi-shakeout-seen-as-liquidations-lead-to-crypto-user-exodus">DeFi Shakeout Seen as Liquidations Lead to Crypto User&nbsp;Exodus</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/ftxus-8b-valuation-f0352455-ddb9-4dbe-bced-b64a0ade8645.html">FTX US raises at an $8 billion valuation.</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/TravisXRP">/TravisXRP</a> — <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-may-allow-crypto-mining-and-gold-backed-stablecoins-lawmaker-says/">Russia May Allow Crypto Mining and Gold-Backed Stablecoins, Lawmaker Says — Regulation Bitcoin&nbsp;News</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bitcoin-is-failing-its-original-mandate-that-doesnt-mean-its-worthless">Bitcoin Is Failing Its Original Mandate.

The U.S.’s regulatory dilemma <p>First, here’s what happened — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-26/crypto-lending-firms-celsius-network-gemini-face-sec-scrutiny">Bloomberg</a>:</p><blockquote>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing cryptocurrency firms Celsius Network, Voyager Digital Ltd. and Gemini Trust Co. as part of a broad inquiry into companies that pay interest on virtual token deposits, according to people familiar with the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><blockquote>The SEC enforcement review focuses on whether the companies’ offerings should be registered as securities with the watchdog, said the people, who weren’t authorized to speak publicly. The firms are able to pay customers rates higher than most bank savings accounts by lending out their digital coins to other investors, a practice that the SEC and states including New Jersey and Texas have said raises concerns about investor protection.</blockquote><p>Here’s also what happened — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-27/you-get-the-crypto-rules-you-want">Matt&nbsp;Levine</a>:</p><blockquote>The other story is about&nbsp;… well, see, there’s a billion-dollar Ponzicoin called Wonderland, 1 which as of about 11 a.m. today was advertising an annual percentage yield on staked deposits of EIGHTY-THREE THOUSAND, SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY-SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT (83,687.5%), and it is in the news today because one of the pseudonymous people running its treasury is allegedly a famous convicted serial scammer who previously co-founded Quadriga CX, which was the biggest Canadian crypto exchange before it collapsed in an exit scam in which the other co-founder apparently stole most of the money and may or may not have faked his&nbsp;death.</blockquote><p>And here’s Matt Levine aptly summarizing the current state of affairs when it comes to crypto regulation in the U.S. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-27/you-get-the-crypto-rules-you-want">his Money Stuff newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Man, come on. Read that sentence. If you were an SEC enforcement lawyer and you had the choice of (1) calling up the “revolution needs rules” guys to tell them that under SEC precedents interest-bearing crypto accounts paying 8.05% have to be registered as securities or (2) looking into the very popular billion-dollar Ponzicoin run by an exit scammer that is offering an 83,000% APY to U.S. investors&nbsp;… just&nbsp;… what are we doing&nbsp;here?</blockquote><blockquote>What is the difference between Gemini and Wonderland? I think two critical differences are:</blockquote>  Wonderland is hilariously riskier and less compliant than Gemini in every&nbsp;respect.  Gemini answers the phone when the SEC&nbsp;calls.  <blockquote>There is a certain drunk-under-the-lamppost element to current U.S. crypto regulation. If you incorporate a company in the U.S. and walk into the SEC’s office and ask “hey what are we allowed to do,” the answer is “almost nothing.” If you just launch the wildest thing in the world pseudonymously, call it “decentralized,” and advertise eye-popping investment returns to U.S. investors, then, I mean, I don’t want to give you legal advice, but look&nbsp;around.</blockquote><p>As Matt points out, it’s also why Facebook/Meta’s crypto project failed to&nbsp;launch:</p><blockquote>Or we talked yesterday about stablecoins. Specifically we talked about the fact that Facebook Inc. (now Meta Platforms Inc.) announced in 2019 with enormous fanfare that it was going to launch a stablecoin and work closely with all of the relevant regulators blah blah blah, and it went to the Federal Reserve and said “what do we need to do to launch a stablecoin,” and the Fed said “you must bring me the egg of a dragon and the tears of a unicorn,” and now the Facebook stablecoin is shutting down. One of the largest companies in the world devoted millions of dollars to figuring out how to launch a stablecoin and concluded that it was impossible. It is demonstrably not impossible! Tether did it! Tether has a hugely successful stablecoin! Tether does not care at all about working closely with all of the relevant regulators!

They’ve also become increasingly cognizant of and educated on what’s at stake with the ever-expanding digitization of their lives, accelerated by the pandemic.</p><p>And so what the IRS likely expected to be a lowkey update regarding new digital identity requirements has boiled over into a firestorm of controversy.</p><p>It started with <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/irs-will-soon-require-selfies-for-online-access/">a blog post by Brian&nbsp;Krebs</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-be2ba817-5ac9-4f10-a17b-53c32dc21747.html">a quick overview from&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The IRS’ move to require some taxpayers to use facial recognition to identify themselves is reigniting a debate over how the government should use such technology.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Critics warn that, without sufficient guardrails, information collected by one agency for a seemingly benign purpose could easily be re-used in other&nbsp;ways.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: The IRS will soon require taxpayers to provide a third-party company — ID.me — with a combination of documents and a video selfie to verify their identity before undertaking certain online interactions with the&nbsp;agency.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>What they’re saying: “This announcement signals one of the largest expansions of facial recognition technology in the U.S. and there is no question that it will harm peoples’ privacy,” says Caitlin Seeley George, campaign director at Fight For the&nbsp;Future.</blockquote>  “This will essentially create a new, massive database for law enforcement to use to track people without their knowledge,” Seeley George&nbsp;said.  ID.me’s terms of service, she notes, give the company the right to share peoples’ data with police, government and “select partners.”  <p>And the latest — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-a1ca9ca9-57da-4a9a-aa1f-cd601dd0b8ae.htm">Axios</a>,&nbsp;again:</p><p>A growing number of civil rights groups are calling on the IRS to sever ties with ID.me over concerns about the company’s face recognition technology as well as its lack of transparency.</p><blockquote>Driving the news: A coalition of groups, including Fight For the Future, the Algorithmic Justice League and EPIC, have launched Dumpid.me, an online petition urging individuals to indicate their opposition to the agency using the private company’s video selfie-based technology to verify identity.</blockquote>  Meanwhile, as Bloomberg reported on Friday, the IRS is weighing alternatives to ID.me. “Treasury and the IRS are constantly in search of ways to improve taxpayers experience, and are looking into alternatives to ID.me,” the agency confirmed in a statement to&nbsp;Axios.  <blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Catch-up quick: The IRS plans to require taxpayers who want to do certain online transactions to use ID.me’s video selfie-based authentication system.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote>  Those concerns were exacerbated after revelations that ID.me compares selfies to a database of those who have previously used its service, despite previously denying using so-called one-to-many face recognition.  In an interview with Axios, [ID.me] CEO Blake Hall <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/26544683.7501/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tL2lkbWUtY2VvLWFwb2xvZ2l6ZXMtbWlzc3RhdGVtZW50cy1pcnMtZmFjaWFsLXJlY29nbml0aW9uLTg4Y2UyZWUyLTlhZTktNDI2Yy1iNjllLWMwYjQyYWQ4MmY2MS5odG1sP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zbG9naW4mc3RyZWFtPXRvcA/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcB91b404ff">apologized</a> for misleading the public, but defended the practice as an important step in fighting&nbsp;fraud.  <p>To be clear, we’re not taking shots at ID.me here — or any identity service provider at&nbsp;that.</p><p>The big takeaway here is that people are wisening up to their individual needs when it comes to their digital identity, their data, and their privacy.

				  The Indicio TestNet is a robust platform that’s free to use for developers, making it the best way to dive into the powerful technology behind decentralized identity.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>The Indicio Network contains three networks: a MainNet for hosting solutions, a DemoNet for demonstrating products, and a TestNet for development and experimentation. We’ve made the TestNet free for developers to use — making it ideal for exploring, building, testing, and demonstrating your ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the open-source technology of Hyperledger Indy, Ursa, and Aries, the Indicio TestNet has a stable 100% uptime, is monitored by professional staff, and offers limited technical support (for greater technical support we offer a range of highly competitive plans).</p>
<p>Why Indicio?</p>
<p>There are several decentralized networks that offer some form of testing network. But here’s why the Indicio TestNet is the best option:</p>
 
 It’s free: The Indicio TestNet is and always will be free to use.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
 
 It’s professionally staffed and monitored: We don’t rely on volunteers to keep our networks running — our networks are supported by engineers whose job is to ensure they are always stable and accessible.<br> 
 
<p></p>
 
 It’s stable: We understand the critical importance of network stability; the Indicio TestNet clocks at 100% uptime. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Tools are already set up for ease of use: We have a monitoring tool and a scanning tool already implemented; they can tell you which nodes are live and what has been recently written to the network at a glance. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Cross-network test ready: We see a future of interoperable credentials and networks. Our TestNet is ready to test your interoperability with other products from other networks. Issue and verify on multiple networks, explore the possibilities! 
 
<p></p>
 
 Straightforward governance: We believe in simple and streamlined governance with clear principles and rules. You’re here to build — not hear us philosophize! 
 
<p></p>
 
 Node Operator Program: For those that want to really dive into decentralized identity we offer the unique opportunity to host a node on the network. This will give you hands- on experience running part of the network as well as significantly more technical support. See the perks here: <a href="https://indicio.tech/node-operator-program/">https://indicio.tech/node-operator-program/</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
 
 Community resources: Because our network is based on open-source technology, we have a repository of additional resources we can point new users to for general information and assistance. This provides a more immediate place to seek help with your project in addition to the more hands on support offered by our technical team.&nbsp;

<p>While the ethos of cryptocurrency was partly driven by anonymity at its inception (see <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin White Paper</a>), mass adoption and subsequent fraudulent activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing conducted by both individuals and institutional investors forced legislators to fill the regulation void in cryptocurrency. Thus, cryptocurrency had to adapt to KYC regulations and implement such policies in order to screen properly their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance and Coinbase, both leaders in crypto trading worldwide now enforce strong KYC policies, in order to comply with main AML and KYC regulations. While registering in one of those platforms, a law-abiding cryptocurrency user is likely to provide a government-issued ID, comply to a photo identification through a selfie, as well as provide additional personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 However, some people are looking to beat KYC requirements for multiple reasons:&nbsp; 



<p>• Some users believe that identity verification goes against the ethos of cryptocurrency;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Other individuals may want to avoid sanctions, embargo, PEP or SDN lists screenings;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Illicit organizations looking to access crypto exchanges to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">launder money</a>;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Other users may just want to evade tax;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Finally, some of them are simply underage looking to trade cryptocurrencies although not legally allowed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the different reasons mentioned, some users may appeal to dubious methods in order to avoid <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC checks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>User behaviour to bypass KYC checks and identity verification may not only have serious consequences for crypto users, but rather also cause serious (regulatory) difficulties for crypto platform operators.&nbsp;</p>



 A strong regulatory risk in case of failing KYC procedures&nbsp; 



<p>While KYC processes prevent most users from signing in without proper screening, these restrictions created a business opportunity on black markets. Indeed, marketplaces on different dark webs (Tor network primarily) now offer vetted accounts on crypto exchanges and other payments services for a small amount of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For prices ranging from US $150 to $500, you can now buy an approved account on peer-to-peer trading platforms, professional crypto exchanges, or mainstream payment services. Those accounts are either provided with a fake name, address, and identification documents, or with genuine data obtained by any means.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an investigation from the specialized news outlet CoinDesk, sample accounts were purchased between US $170 and $250 and reviewed by a reporter. The accounts were on the exchanges Binance US, Coinbase Pro or Kraken, and payment services Cash App and Wirex. The analysis showed that most of them belonged to genuine United States and European Union citizens, and came along with instructions for VPN networks usage; however, it was also found that the credentials for email addresses were linked to the exchange account and Google Voice numbers. The latter appears to be a tool for fraudsters aiming to create fake accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They even adopted specific behavioral patterns, matching the geolocation of a victim, respecting transactions amounts, etc. Therefore, it is likely that a certain number of users are able to access crypto wallets on exchanges by using other individual’s accounts, thus evading KYC checks themselves. It must be taken into account that crypto exchange accounts are just a subset of the global black ID market. As reported by the <a href="https://resources.digitalshadows.com/whitepapers-and-reports/from-exposure-to-takeover">cyber consultancy firm Digital Shadows</a>, more than 15 billions of credentials would be for sale online, giving many opportunities for fraudsters to leverage data for illicit purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such activities may represent a major risk for cryptocurrency platforms and service providers, as regulators such as the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), already fined cryptocurrency exchanges like BitGo for apparent violations of multiple U.S. sanctions programs. Indeed, the platform had allowed – even though not knowingly – individuals from Syria, Iran, Sudan, Cuba and probably North Korea, to access and use its trading services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another platform exchange, BitPay, was forced to pay US$507,375 to settle its liability in a similar case. Finally, the crypto giant Coinbase may also face an investigation by OFAC, after having voluntarily disclosed alleged violations, in order to avoid major fines and sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, users who prefer to stay anonymous have other options such as peer-to-peer crypto marketplaces or Bitcoin ATMs, and do not always have to evade KYC checks. Indeed, peer-to-peer platforms enable transactions between private actors without having to disclose its identity. Thus, users would avoid to put themselves at risk, as their black market acquired account could be flagged by a platform as not genuine, consequently jeopardizing their assets.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC as a support for crypto market development&nbsp; 



<p>Although platforms are aware of black markets trading of verified accounts, it is possible to mitigate those risks by leveraging robust KYC processes. However, it must remain as simple as in any other financial services. In conjunction with threat intel teams deployed within major cryptocurrency companies, the robustness of KYC processes must be analysed and put to the test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although crypto enthusiasts might see KYC processes as a diminishing factor for adoption, Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as “CZ” declared to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-16/binance-ceo-cz-zhao-advocates-for-fundamental-crypto-rights">Bloomberg</a> that implementing such rules had only little impact on his business. In fact, CZ declared that only 3% of its customers were lost after improving its KYC robustness: “we have chosen to go with full compliance, full mandatory KYC for global users, for every feature. We feel that being compliant will allow more users to use us. Most people do feel more comfortable using a licensed exchange. Most people – 97 per cent of users – go through KYC. We lose only 3 per cent of users.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using a layered approach and combining different identification methods, KYC processes can be drastically improved. While a simple selfie is not cutting it anymore to keep fraudsters at bay, other means such as video identification, in addition to collecting official documents may provide a more solid KYC approach for crypto actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Straightforward and rapid, this procedure must also be painless for the user, crafted in a user-friendly environment, to keep the onboarding experience intact. Automated systems with fast response time, powered by artificial intelligence and combined with screening mechanisms and geolocation checks, provide an unparalleled solution to mitigate risks brought by fraudsters trying to circumvent KYC processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respecting these conventions will allow exchanges to participate in the democratization of cryptocurrencies and mass adoption by non-initiated, along with deterring fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 Cryptocurrency platforms must be aware of the risk of poor KYC mechanisms&nbsp; 



<p>KYC processes in crypto community are still fighting their way in, as adoption increases. Although it is possible to buy crypto without submitting to a KYC check, it is more complicated and a risky thing to do, conversely to using an exchange complying to KYC requirements. Regulations aside, KYC processes allow user confidence to grow, whether it is in the market, or in crypto exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an onboarding process, KYC can be transparent and painless without harming conversion rate, as many other fintechs and crypto exchanges have already proven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto actors evolving on the European market now have to comply with the European Union’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)</a>. For this reason, it may be the best time for these platforms to re-think and enhance KYC and AML procedures (see our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto KYC Page</a>), which will ultimately bring a benefit to both the users and the platform itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With more than three decades’ experience in the tech sector, most recently spent in the identity verification space, Doug has worked across a range of sectors including e-commerce and banking systems.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Doug said: “No matter what sector you are working in, as long as a business puts customers front and centre, then customer success should follow. Throughout my career, customers have always been at the forefront of my mind, and I look forward to bring that customer-first approach to IDnow.</p>
<p>“IDnow is already a European powerhouse in its field. Our next steps will be to expand beyond Europe and to build out our identity proofing platform with NFC-based identity methods and self-sovereign applications. It’s an incredibly exciting time to join IDnow as we continue to invest in growth and innovation.”</p>
<p>Co-founder and Chief Customer Officer at IDnow, Sebastian Bärhold, added: “We’re delighted that Doug has joined IDnow, bringing with him a wealth of knowledge around scaling international customer success and service organisations. I am sure that our customers and partners will benefit from his vast experience.</p>
<p>“This is an important time for us as a business and as we continue to grow, we must ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service. Doug’s focus on putting the customer first will ensure we deliver highly efficient and exemplary service levels to our customers. His deep experience will guide our customers as they embark on or continue their identity proofing journey.”</p>
<p>Doug’s appointment marks the start of a major recruitment drive in the UK as the firm looks to meet the growing demands of businesses, often in highly regulated industries, seeking highly secure ways to verify customer identities. This follows its news last year which highlighted an eightfold growth in the UK compared to 2020 as more companies look to switch to fully digital customer onboarding processes. </p>

Community Growth &amp;&nbsp;Bounty   This month, DuMont, an outstanding Harbinger from our English community, published <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/staking-vs-candidate-node-ownership-9191bfbd5661">Staking vs Candidate Node Ownership</a>, which outlined the Ontology staking strategy for community members in great detail. The article answered questions like “How to participate in Ontology staking”, “How to launch a candidate node”, and more. Community members have expressed that they benefited a lot from the&nbsp;article.  This month, Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to join an AMA held by <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481824177879273477?s=20">BingX</a>. He shared Ontology’s long-term efforts and future goals, with a focus on DID and data. He explained how users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence. Humpty also highlighted the Ontology 2022 Roadmap: From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not&nbsp;changed.  This month, the <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1484246853189193729?s=20">Ontology Community Call</a> on Discord and Telegram was held as usual, focusing on topics such as “EVM” and “Staking”. Ontology Harbinger Polaris, and Atherton Hoge discussed those issues with community members, sharing the latest development of Ontology EVM, the the upcoming Ontology EVM launch will help Ontology attract more decentralized applications, and be a key step to realize the rapid expansion of the Ontology ecosystem. About staking, they believed that it is necessary to pay more attention to the revenue distribution ratio of each&nbsp;node.  We held our Telegram Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about “ENS”, “DID” and more. The Ontology community believes that DID will be an indispensable foundation in Web3; by comprehensively deploying DID, Web3 will realize the protection of identity and privacy, and truly return data ownership to&nbsp;users.

He said that Virtual Machines (VMs) play a crucial role in both the aforementioned need for interoperability and in the expansion of applications built on Ontology. The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022, and aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform and to offer an inclusive experience to developers and&nbsp;users.  Moonstake published a series of articles to introduce their strategic partners. In the article <a href="https://moonstake.io/what-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-in-2022/">What You Need to Know about Ontology in 2022</a>, Moonstake elaborated on Ontology’s plans and goals for 2022, stating that they are proud to be strategic partners of Ontology.

   Spring Cloud Contract was created as a way to help test interconnected microservices. Generally speaking, there are two options when testing microservices: 1) you can deploy the entire mesh of services in your integration tests and test against that, or 2) you can mock each service in your integration tests. Both of these options have serious drawbacks.

Generally speaking, there are two options when testing microservices: 1) you can deploy the entire mesh of services in your integration tests and test against that, or 2) you can mock each service in your integration tests. Both of these options have serious drawbacks.</p>

<p>The first, deploying the entire mesh of microservices for testing, has the obvious drawback of being difficult, if not impossible, in many environments. It’s simply not always feasible to deploy a whole mesh of services just for integration testing. The second solution, writing separate mocks for each projects’ integration tests, has the problem of being potentially unreliable. This is because integration tests are written in a separate service from the code actually governing the function that the test is modeling, and as such, can easily drift away from the desired behavior.</p>

<p>Imagine a simple microservice with a producer and a consumer. When writing tests in the consumer project, you have to write mocks or stubs that model the behavior of the producer project. Conversely, when you write tests in the producer project, you have to write mocks or stubs that model the behavior of the consumer project. As such, multiple sets of related, redundant code have to be maintained in parallel in disconnected projects.</p>

<p>For every change made to the producer project, the developer needs to go to the consumer project – a totally separate code base – and make sure that the integration tests there reflect the new behavior producer. Keeping this up across a complex system with many different services, at best, requires a lot of discipline, and at worst, is unlikely. It’s very easy for integration tests to give a false sense of security and not actually reflect the reality of the service being tested.</p>

<p>What is needed is a way to ensure that the mocked (or stubbed) behavior of the test objects is connected to the actual behavior of the objects being modeled. Ideally, these mocked objects would be defined in the project they represent.</p>

<p>Spring Cloud Contract does exactly this. It provides a way of specifying specific behavior for a service – the “contract” – and testing for compliance with this contract within that project itself while allowing other projects to load these contracts as stubs that can be mocked for integration testing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A brief aside on “mocks” and “stubs”. “Mock” gets used in ways online that is somewhat generic, meaning any fake object used for testing, and this can get confusing when differentiating “mocks” from “stubs”. However, specifically, a “mock” is an object that tests for behavior by registering expected method calls before a test run. In contrast, a “stub” is a testable version of the object with callable methods that return pre-set values. Thus, a mock checks to see if the object being tested makes an expected sequence of calls to the object being mocked, and throws an error if the behavior deviates (that is, makes any unexpected calls). A stub does not do any testing itself, per se, but instead will return canned responses to pre-determined methods to allow tests to run. (Of course, a stub can throw an error if unexpected calls are made as well, so stubs do constrain behavior in that sense as well.)</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’re going to create a simple Spring Boot producer that serves hats and a Spring Boot consumer that presents hats to the user (really hat specification object instances). The consumer will retrieve the hats from the producer before presenting them. You will use Spring Cloud Contract to write a contract that describes what the producer service should return based on certain resource queries. Spring Cloud Contract will automatically generate integration tests from the producer contract, which will verify that the producer is behaving according to the specification of the contract. It will also generate stubs that can be imported into other projects to assist in integration testing. Next, on the consumer side, you will import these stubs into the consumer’s integration tests as a mocked object that can be used in testing the consumer. You will also see how Okta can be used as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to add security to the Spring Boot project.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<p>Before you get started, you’ll need to make sure you have a few tools installed.</p>

 
   
    <p>Okta CLI: The Okta CLI is an easy way to create projects that use Okta for security. Follow the installation instructions on the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI project website</a>. You should log in to your existing account or register for a new account using the CLI before continuing with the tutorial.</p>
   
   
    <p>Java 11: This project uses Java 11. OpenJDK 11 will work just as well. Installation instructions can be found on the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/">OpenJDK website</a>. OpenJDK can also be installed using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> is another excellent option for installing and managing Java versions.</p>
   
   
    <p>HTTPie: This is a powerful command-line HTTP request utility you’ll use to test both Spring Boot resource servers. Install it according to <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">the docs on their site</a>.</p>
   
 

 Bootstrap the producer project using Spring Initialzr 

<p>You’ll use the Spring Initializr project to bootstrap the Producer project. Open <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.6.3&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.example&amp;artifactId=producer&amp;name=producer&amp;description=Producer%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot%20Contract&amp;packageName=com.example.contract&amp;dependencies=web,cloud-contract-verifier,lombok">this link</a> to access the pre-configured starter project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You are creating a Java project – Java 11 – using Maven as the build system. The Spring Boot version was 2.6.3 when I wrote this tutorial. You are including three dependencies:</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html">Spring Web</a>: adds the basic HTTP/web capabilities to build a REST API. 
   <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-contract">Contract Verifier</a>: brings in Spring Cloud Contract project by enabling Consumer Drive Contracts and stub generation. 
   <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Lombok</a>: is a helper project that will generate some getters, setters, and constructors. 
 

<p>When you’re ready, click Generate and save the zip file in an appropriate parent directory. You’ll be making two Spring Boot projects (as mentioned, a producer and a consumer), so it probably makes sense to have a parent directory named something like <code>Spring Cloud Contract Tutorial</code> or <code>spring-cloud-contract-tutorial</code> (if you dislike spaces in directory names).</p>

<p>Unzip the file and open the directory in your favorite editor or IDE. (I’m an IDE/IntelliJ man myself – hopefully that’s not disappointing to y’all – because in the immortal words of Buckaroo Banzai “Life is too short for vim”.)</p>

<p>Let’s start by building the hat producer. Both the producer and consumer projects will be Spring Boot resource servers that use Spring MVC to implement a simple REST API.</p>

<p>Create a <code>Hat.java</code> file that is the data model for the hats the producer will serve.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/contract/Hat.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Hat {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private Long size;
    private String color;
}
</code>   

<p>The hat has four attributes, an <code>id</code> as well as <code>name</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>color</code>. Notice the two annotations. These are what Lombok helps us with. The <code>@Data</code> annotation generates getters and setters as well as a <code>toString()</code> and a constructor for all required arguments (<a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/Data">check out the docs</a>). The <code>@AllArgsConstructor</code> annotation generates a constructor for all fields in the class. I really like it because it de-clutters the data model classes and saves some time generating all of the ‘ceremony’ methods.</p>

<p>Next create a <code>HatService.java</code>. This is in lieu of using JPA and an actual database to persist the Hat object instances. It’s just for demonstration purposes and simply creates two hats –  a large, red sombrero and a smaller blue beanie – and serves them by ID.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/contract/HatService.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@Service
public class HatService {
    private final Map&lt;Long, Hat&gt; hatMap;
    public HatService() {
        hatMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        hatMap.put(1L, new Hat(1L, "Sombrero", 30L, "red"));
        hatMap.put(2L, new Hat(2L, "Beanie", 5L, "blue"));
    }
    Hat findHatById(Long id) {
        return hatMap.get(id);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Lastly, create a <code>HatController.java</code> that is what exposes your single resource endpoint.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/contract/HatController.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.server.ResponseStatusException;

@RestController
public class HatController {
    private final HatService hatService;

    public HatController(HatService hatService) {
        this.hatService = hatService;
    }

    @GetMapping("hat/{id}")
    public Hat findHatById(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
        Hat hat = hatService.findHatById(id);
        if (hat == null) {
            throw new ResponseStatusException(
                    HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, "Not Found"
            );
        }
        return hat;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The HatController uses Spring’s dependency injection to get the HatService as a bean. It then uses the service to lookup hats by ID and serve them to the consumer of the REST service endpoint at <code>/hat/{id}</code>.</p>

<p>You now have a working hat producer. Start the project with the following command:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Once the service has started, you can open a second terminal and use HTTPie to test it.</p>

   <code>http :8080/hat/1
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...
{
    "color": "red",
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sombrero",
    "size": 30
}
</code>   

 Create the producer contract 

<p>Next, you need to write the contracts that define the interservice agreement to govern the behavior of the producer. This is where Spring Cloud Contract comes in and things get interesting.</p>

<p>You’re going to create three contracts under <code>src/test/resources/contracts</code>. The contracts can be written in YAML or as a Groovy, Java, or Kotlin DSL script. In this tutorial I’ve chosen to go with the <a href="https://groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a>. These contracts could also be in a single file instead of separate files. See <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/docs/current/reference/html/project-features.html#contract-dsl-multiple">the docs</a>.</p>

<p>Create the first contract in your <code>src/test/resources</code> directory.</p>

<p><code>src/test/resources/contracts/find_hat_by_id.groovy</code></p>

   <code>package contracts

import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    description "should return hat by id=1"

    request {
        url "/hat/1"
        method GET()
    }

    response {
        status OK()
        headers {
            contentType applicationJson()
        }
        body (
                id: 1,
                name: "Test Hat 1",
                size: 10,
                color: "striped"
        )
    }

}
</code>   

<p>In the <code>request</code> block, this contract defines the request method at <code>GET</code> and the request URL as <code>/hat/1</code>. In the <code>response</code> block, this contract specifies that the status should be <code>OK</code>, the headers should be <code>applicationJson</code>, and the attributes of the red sombrero should be returned. This contract is pretty simple, but the DSL has a lot of power. <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/reference/html/project-features.html">Take a look at the docs</a> to dig deeper.</p>

<p>The second contract is similar, except for the blue beanie.</p>

<p><code>src/test/resources/contracts/find_hat_by_id2.groovy</code></p>

   <code>package contracts

import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    description "should return hat by id=2"

    request {
        url "/hat/2"
        method GET()
    }

    response {
        status OK()
        headers {
            contentType applicationJson()
        }
        body (
                id: 2,
                name: "Test Hat 2",
                size: 7,
                color: "green"
        )
    }

}
</code>   

<p>The last contract defines a 404 error message for hat ID 3.</p>

<p><code>src/test/resources/contracts/find_hat_by_id3.groovy</code></p>

   <code>package contracts

import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    description "should return 404 for hat id=3"

    request {
        url "/hat/3"
        method GET()
    }

    response {
        status 404
    }

}
</code>   

<p>For the integration tests generated from these contracts to work, you need to define a base class and add the base class to the <code>pom.xml</code>.</p>

<p>Create a <code>BaseClass.java</code> test class (notice that this is in <code>src/test</code> not <code>src/main</code>).</p>

<p><code>src/test/java/com/example/contract/BaseClass.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

import io.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.mockito.Mockito;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.MockBean;

@SpringBootTest(classes = ProducerApplication.class)
public abstract class BaseClass {

    @Autowired
    HatController hatController;

    @MockBean
    HatService hatService;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setup() {
        RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(hatController);
        Mockito.when(hatService.findHatById(1L))
                .thenReturn(new Hat(1L, "Test Hat 1", 10L, "striped"));
        Mockito.when(hatService.findHatById(2L))
                .thenReturn(new Hat(2L, "Test Hat 2", 7L, "green"));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the <code>pom.xml</code>, you need to define the configuration entry for the base test class. Add the following entry:</p>

   <code>&lt;baseClassForTests&gt;com.example.contract.BaseClass&lt;/baseClassForTests&gt;
</code>   

<p>… in the <code>&lt;configuration&gt;</code> block of the <code>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</code> plugin.</p>

   <code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                ...
                &lt;baseClassForTests&gt;com.example.contract.BaseClass&lt;/baseClassForTests&gt;
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;
</code>   

<p>You might notice that the stubbed service created in the base test class above is returning different hats than the hats served by the producer application itself. Don’t get confused. The contract and the base test class define testing behavior. The application is defining live, production behavior (of course, here it’s pretty simplistic and test-like since the implementation is really just for demonstration purposes). Thus integration tests will be expecting <code>/hat/1</code> to return <code>Test Hat 1</code> while, as you’ll see below, when you run the application, the same endpoint will return <code>Sombrero</code>.</p>

 Generate the stubs and test the producer 

<p>To generate the stubs and the integration tests for the contracts, run the following Maven command.</p>

   <code>./mvnw install
</code>   

<p>The most important thing this command does (in the context of this tutorial) is that it generates the stubs and installs them in the local <code>.m2</code> (Maven) repo. In a production scenario, you might want to install the stubs in a remote repository instead. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/docs/3.1.0/reference/html/">the Spring Cloud docs</a> to see how that is accomplished.</p>

<p>If you read through the console output, you’ll see a lot of information about the generated integration tests and the stubs. For example, look at the following lines.</p>

   <code>[INFO] --- spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin:3.1.0:generateTests (default-generateTests) @ producer ---
[INFO] Generating server tests source code for Spring Cloud Contract Verifier contract verification

[INFO] Generated 1 test classes.
</code>   

<p>These lines tell you that Spring found the contracts in the <code>src/test/resources/contracts</code> folder, used the base test class defined in the <code>pom.xml</code>, and generated integration tests based on the contracts.</p>

<p>If you look at the generated integration tests, they’ll look like the following. The Groovy DSL contract has been turned into testable assertions. This is where the producer contract is tested against the actual behavior of the producer.</p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

...

        // then:
            assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(404);
    }

}

</code>   

<p>You’ll also see lines like the following, showing that the producer stubs have been created from the contracts.</p>

   <code>[INFO] Converting from Spring Cloud Contract Verifier contracts to WireMock stubs mappings

</code>   

<p>And toward the end of the console output, you’ll see that the stubs jar has been installed in the local Maven repo along with the producer application jar and the POM.</p>

   <code>[INFO] Installing /home/andrewcarterhughes/Development/okta/2021/spring-cloud-contracts/QA1/producer/target/producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar to /home/andrewcarterhughes/.m2/repository/com/example/producer/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

</code>   

<p>These stubs are what you will, in a few minutes, import into the consumer application for integration testing. Notice how, because of the autogenerated integration testing, the behavior of the stubs is guaranteed to match the behavior tested and defined by the contract. This is awesome. However, bear in mind, “the devil is in the contract,” as they say.</p>

<p>This tool will only be as good as the quality of the contract (and thus the tests derived from the contract). It provides a lightweight way to test and link behavior between two services without having to link their code or maintain redundant, separate code bases (mocks and stubs vs the actual object). But still, you have to be intelligent about what you define in the contract and ensure that the contract reflects the required behavior of the service.</p>

<p>Start the service by running the following command.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>You should see console output that ends with something like the following.</p>

   <code>...

}
</code>   

   <code>http :8080/hat/3
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 404 
...
{
    "error": "Not Found",
    "path": "/hat/3",
    "status": 404,
    ...
}
</code>   

<p>Remember that here you are seeing the “live” data, not the test data that is defined in the base test class and the contracts. In production, this live data would likely be complex data structures residing in a database and would not be so easily generated as is being done in the <code>HatService</code> class.</p>

 Add identity with Okta 

<p>Now you are going to add Okta JSON Web Token (JWT) auth to the application. You should have already installed the CLI and signed up for a free Okta developer account. If you have not, please follow the installation instructions on the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI project website</a> and run <code>okta register</code>.</p>

<p>Add the dependency for Okta’s Spring Boot starter to the <code>pom.xml</code> file. This project adds the necessary dependencies to use Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">the project’s GitHub page</a> for more info.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependencies&gt;
    ...
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;2.1.4&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    ...
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>ProducerApplication.java</code> class to the following. This will configure the producer service to use JWT authentication and to authenticate all requests.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/contract/ProducerApplication.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.contract;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ProducerApplication {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication.run(ProducerApplication.class, args);
   }

   @EnableWebSecurity
   public class OAuth2ResourceServerSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

      @Override
      protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
         http.authorizeRequests()
             .anyRequest().authenticated()
             .and()
             .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
      }
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to add the Issuer URI to your <code>application.properties</code> file. You need to replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> in the line below with your Okta domain.</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=/oauth2/default
</code>   

<p>You can find your Okta URI by typing <code>okta login</code> from the command line. It should print out something like the following.</p>

   <code>Okta Org already configured: https://dev-123456.okta.com/
</code>   

<p>You can also find your Issuer URI by opening your Okta Admin Console and navigating to Security &gt; API and looking at the Issuer URI for the <code>default</code> authorization server.</p>

<p>Start the application (or, if it is still running, use <code>control-c</code> to stop it and restart it).</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

 Generate a JWT and test the secure app 

<p>To generate a valid JWT, you need to create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) application on Okta and use the OIDC Debugger application to request a JWT from the OIDC application.</p>

<p>Run  <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>An easy way to get an access token is to generate one using <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a>. First, you must configure your application on Okta to use OpenID Connect’s implicit flow.</p>

<p>Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your browser. Go to the Applications section and select the application you just created. Edit its General Settings and add Implicit (Hybrid) as an allowed grant type, with access token enabled. Then, make sure it has <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> in its Login redirect URIs. Click Save and copy the client ID for the next step.</p>

<p>Now, navigate to the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> website. Fill in your client ID, and use <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> for the Authorize URI. The <code>state</code> field must be filled but can contain any characters. Select token for the response type.</p>

<p>Once you have the token value, save it in a shell variable (in the terminal window where you are going to run the HTTPie command to test the authenticated application).</p>

   <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJDVkdzamc2MDBCNVFXR3VSdVRDckJuLVhLa2J...
</code>   

<p>Test the authenticated application using the token.</p>

   <code>http :8080/hat/1 "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

<p>Make sure you use double quotes in the command above, otherwise the variable will not be expanded.</p>

<p>You should get the first hat returned.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...
{
    "color": "red",
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sombrero",
    "size": 30
}
</code>   

<p>One of the benefits of the Spring Cloud Contract project is that the mocked and stubbed test objects bypass authentication. This is super helpful (as long as you are not testing application security, of course). You can run <code>./mvnw clean install</code> or <code>./mvnw test</code> and you will see that the integration tests still pass and that the stubs are still being generated and deployed.</p>

 Create the consumer application 

<p>The next step is to create the consumer application. This will simulate a public-facing service to retrieve hats from the producer and serve them to the clients. The key point in this tutorial is to see how the stubs generated from the producer project can be imported into the consumer project and used to verify application behavior.</p>

<p>Use the Spring Initializr to create the starter project by following <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.6.3&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.example&amp;artifactId=consumer&amp;name=consumer&amp;description=Producer%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot%20Contract&amp;packageName=com.example.consumer&amp;dependencies=web,cloud-contract-stub-runner,lombok">this link</a>.</p>

<p>The project is very similar to the producer project except that the included dependencies are different. Here you are including Spring Web and Contract Stub Runner (in place of the Contract Verifier).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unzip the project and open it in the IDE or editor of your choice.</p>

<p>Create a <code>Hat.java</code> class that will model the hat returned from the producer.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/consumer/Hat.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.consumer;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor // needed for Jackson serialization
public class Hat {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private Long size;
    private String color;
}
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>ConsumerApplication.java</code> class.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/consumer/ConsumerApplication.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.consumer;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder;
import org.springframework.http.HttpEntity;
import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;
import org.springframework.http.HttpMethod;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestHeader;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ConsumerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ConsumerApplication.class, args);
    }

    @RestController
    public class HatConsumerResource {

        @Value( "${producer.port}" )
        private Integer producerPort;

        private final RestTemplate restTemplate;

        HatConsumerResource(RestTemplateBuilder restTemplateBuilder) {
            this.restTemplate = restTemplateBuilder.build();
        }

        @RequestMapping("/wearhat/{hatId}")
        String getMessage(@PathVariable("hatId") Long personId, @RequestHeader("authorization") String authorizationHeader) {

            HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
            headers.set("Authorization", authorizationHeader);
            HttpEntity&lt;Void&gt; requestEntity = new HttpEntity&lt;&gt;(headers);

            ResponseEntity&lt;Hat&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange("http://localhost:"+producerPort+"/hat/{hatId}", HttpMethod.GET, requestEntity, Hat.class, personId);
            Hat hat = response.getBody();

            return "Enjoy your new " + hat.getName();
        }

    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a line to the <code>application.properties</code> file to change the application port from the default, 8080, to 8081 so that it does not conflict with the producer application. You’re also going to specify the producer port in the properties file so that the integration tests can use a different port for the mocked service. (You’ll see why in a bit.)</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>

   <code>server.port=8081
producer.port=8080
</code>   

<p>This is a very simple consumer service. It makes a request to the producer for a hat by ID, simply passing along the <code>Authorization</code> header. The project could be made more realistic by adding security to the consumer as well. (The process would be exactly as described above for the producer.) And in a live scenario, this service would probably be pulling data from multiple other services and performing some sort of business logic before returning a value. However, here, the goal here is to demonstrate the stubs and integration testing, so I’m keeping the consumer itself as basic as possible.</p>

<p>Make sure your producer application is still running. In a new shell, run the consumer application.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Once the application is running, you can use the access token you created earlier to make a request on the consumer (which will pass along the request to the secured producer).</p>

   <code>http :8081/wearhat/1 "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

<p>You should see the following.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...

Enjoy your new Sombrero
</code>   

 Import the producer stubs into the consumer project and create integration tests 

<p>Now, the exciting part. You’re going to import the stubs generated from the producer project into the consumer project and use them for integration tests.</p>

<p>First, create an <code>application.properties</code> file in the <code>src/test/resources</code> folder. Notice that you are changing the <code>producer.port</code> to <code>8100</code>. This is the port on which the stubbed producer will run. It’s helpful if this is different than the actual port on which the producer runs.</p>

<p><code>src/test/resources/application.properties</code></p>

   <code>server.port=8081
producer.port=8100
</code>   

<p>Create your first test file called <code>ContractIntegrationTest.java</code>.</p>

<p><code>src/test/java/com/example/consumer/ContractIntegrationTest.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.consumer;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.spring.AutoConfigureStubRunner;
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.spring.StubRunnerProperties;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.client.HttpClientErrorException;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:producer:+:stubs:8100"}, stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
public class ContractIntegrationTest {

    @Test
    public void get_hat1() {
        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
        ResponseEntity&lt;Hat&gt; responseEntity = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://localhost:8100/hat/1", Hat.class);
        assertThat(responseEntity.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);
        Hat hat = responseEntity.getBody();
        assertThat(hat.getId()).isEqualTo(1);
        assertThat(hat.getName()).isEqualTo("Test Hat 1");
        assertThat(hat.getSize()).isEqualTo(10);
        assertThat(hat.getColor()).isEqualTo("striped");
    }

    @Test
    public void get_hat2() {
        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
        ResponseEntity&lt;Hat&gt; responseEntity = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://localhost:8100/hat/2", Hat.class);
        assertThat(responseEntity.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);
        Hat hat = responseEntity.getBody();
        assertThat(hat.getId()).isEqualTo(2);
        assertThat(hat.getName()).isEqualTo("Test Hat 2");
        assertThat(hat.getSize()).isEqualTo(7);
        assertThat(hat.getColor()).isEqualTo("green");
    }

    @Test
    public void get_hat3() {
        try {
            RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
            ResponseEntity&lt;Hat&gt; responseEntity = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://localhost:8100/hat/3", Hat.class);
        }
        catch (HttpClientErrorException ex) {
            assertThat(ex.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The producer stubs are imported with this line:</p>

   <code>@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:producer:+:stubs:8100"}, stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
</code>   

<p>You’re specifying the <code>com.example:producer</code> project, with the latest version, the stubs (not the jar), and telling the stub runner to start the stubbed service on port <code>8100</code>. Putting the stub runner in <code>LOCAL</code> mode means that it will look in the local Maven repo instead of looking online, which can be configured using the <code>REMOTE</code> value here. With that single annotation, Spring will create a service on port <code>8100</code> based on the stubs and generated from the contracts in the producer project.</p>

<p>You also define three tests that match the expected behavior defined in the contracts.</p>

<p>Next, create a more realistic integration test on the consumer in a new file, <code>ConsumerIntegrationTest.java</code>.</p>

<p><code>src/test/java/com/example/consumer/ConsumerIntegrationTest.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.consumer;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.AutoConfigureMockMvc;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.spring.AutoConfigureStubRunner;
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.spring.StubRunnerProperties;
import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.containsString;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.get;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultHandlers.print;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.content;
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.status;

@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:producer:+:stubs:8100"}, stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
public class ConsumerIntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @Test
    public void shouldReturnDefaultMessage() throws Exception {
        this.mockMvc.perform(
                get("/wearhat/1").header("authorization", "dummyvalue"))
                .andDo(print())
                .andExpect(status().isOk())
                .andExpect(content().string(containsString("Enjoy your new Test Hat 1")));
    }

}
</code>   

<p>This is why you specified the producer port in the <code>application.properties</code> file. By using different ports in <code>src/test/java</code> and <code>src/main/java</code> you are able to direct the tests to the stubbed producer, which allows you to create a true integration test. In the test above, the mocked consumer calls the stubbed producer and returns the result, which is checked against the expected value. Otherwise, when you ran the test above, it would try and call the producer on port <code>8080</code>, which would call the actual producer running on that port.</p>

<p>You can run these tests in your IDE or from the command line with <code>./mvnw test</code>. All tests should pass.</p>

 What Is Really Matters to Make Diet Calories Calculators Work <p>To use a <a href="https://bit.ly/3HgH1uz">calories calculator</a>, you need to know how many calories you need per day and how many calories are in the food you’re&nbsp;eating.</p><p>While it’s important to know how many calories are in the food you’re eating, it’s even more important to make healthy choices when it comes to what you’re eating. A calories calculator can be a helpful tool, but it’s not everything. Here we will cover what really&nbsp;matters.</p> How many calories do I need each&nbsp;day? <p>This is a difficult question to answer without knowing more about your lifestyle and activity&nbsp;level.</p><p>The recommended calorie intake for the average, sedentary person is about 1200–2000 per day. If you are moderately active, you may need closer to 2000–2500 per&nbsp;day.</p><p>And if you are very active, you may need upwards of 2500–3000 or more. To calculate your specific calorie needs, use an online calculator or speak with a registered dietitian. Also we are going to cover the topic in&nbsp;depth.</p><p>In general, your daily caloric intake should include: 45–65% carbohydrates, 20–35% protein, and 10–30%&nbsp;fat.</p> What are macros and why do they&nbsp;matter? <p>Macronutrients are the three main nutrients that our body needs in order to function: carbohydrates, protein, and&nbsp;fat.</p><p>Each of these nutrients play different roles in our health and metabolism, so it’s important to make sure we are getting enough of all of them. Tracking your macros can be a helpful way to make sure you’re hitting your nutrient goals for the&nbsp;day.</p><p>There are many online calculators and apps that can help you track your macros. A good starting point is calculating what percentage of each nutrient you should aim for each day (see question #1). From there, you can adjust as needed depending on your specific goals and preferences.</p> (USDA) guidelines: <p>Calorie and macronutrient guidelines can be helpful in determining how many of each nutrient to eat each day. However, it is important to remember that everyone’s body is different and what works for one person may not work for another. It is also important to listen to your own body and make adjustments as needed. A good place to start when calculating calorie and macronutrient intake is to use the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines. The USDA recommends that adult women consume 2,000 calories per day, adult men consume 2,500 calories per day, and children between the ages of 4 and 8 years consume 1,400–1,600 calories per day. Regarding macronutrients, the USDA recommends that 45–65% of daily caloric intake come from carbohydrates, 20–35% from protein, and 10–35% from&nbsp;fat.</p> Formulas diet calories calculator uses (exposing the back end&nbsp;algos) <p>The Harris Benedict&nbsp;formula:</p><p>The Harris Benedict Formula is a mathematical equation that calculates someone’s basal metabolic rate&nbsp;(BMR).</p><p>This is the number of calories a person needs to consume each day to maintain their current weight.

<p>There are a few problems with online calorie calculators. First, they can be inaccurate. Second, they can be difficult to use. And third, they can be expensive.</p><p>If you don’t get enough calories, your body will start breaking down muscle tissue to use as&nbsp;energy.</p><p>This can lead to a loss of muscle mass, which can make it harder to stay active and healthy. Additionally, if you don’t eat enough calories, you may not have enough energy to do the things you enjoy or to work hard at your&nbsp;job.</p> Where did the humble calorie come&nbsp;from: <p>The calorie is a unit of energy that was first defined by the French scientist Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree&nbsp;Celsius.</p><p>The calorie calculator can help you determine how many calories you should eat each day to reach your weight loss goals. It takes into account your basal metabolic rate (the number of calories your body burns at rest), as well as the number of calories you burn through physical activity. If you use application doing so then be sure that you are getting right information about your calorie&nbsp;needs.</p> How do you figure out how much calorie you need per&nbsp;day <p>To figure out <a href="https://bit.ly/3AKhFmi">how many calories you need per day</a>, you’ll need to first calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its current weight at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>You can use an online BMR calculator to estimate this number. Once you have your BMR, you’ll need to multiply it by an activity&nbsp;factor.</p><p>This number accounts for the amount of activity you do on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>If you’re sedentary, use a multiplier of 1.2; if you’re moderately active, use 1.3–1.4; if you’re very active, use 1.5–1.7; and if you’re extremely active, use 1.8 or&nbsp;higher.</p><p>Now add in any extra calories you burn from exercise or other activities throughout the day. The resulting number is your approximate calorie intake for the&nbsp;day.</p><p>Basal metabolic rate:</p><p>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its basic functions while you are at rest. This includes functions like breathing, circulating blood and keeping your heart&nbsp;beating.</p><p>How to Calculate Your Basal Metabolic Rate:</p><p>To calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR), you’ll need to know your weight, height, and&nbsp;age.</p><p>You can use this online <a href="https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html">BMR calculator</a> to do the math for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Once you have your BMR, you can use that number to help you determine how many calories you need each day to maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To lose weight, you’ll need to eat fewer calories than your BMR; to gain weight, you’ll need to eat&nbsp;more.</p><p>Remember that these are general guidelines, and everyone’s needs vary. If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, for example, you’ll likely need more than 2,000 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you’re very active, you may need even more. Talk with a healthcare professional if you’re unsure about how many calories you should be&nbsp;eating.</p> How to Use the Diet Calories Calculator <p>The <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator">diet calories calculator</a> is a handy tool for figuring out how many calories you need to eat each day in order to lose weight or maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To use the calculator, simply enter your sex, weight, height, and age into the corresponding fields.</p><p>The calculator will then provide you with your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories you need to maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To lose weight, you’ll need to consume fewer than this number of calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>To maintain your current weight, you’ll need to consume the same number of calories as your&nbsp;BMR.</p> General Tips: <p>The number of calories in food is determined by the amount of energy that the food provides.</p><p>When you eat, your body breaks down the food into tiny pieces that it can use for energy. This process is called digestion.</p><p>The number of calories in a particular type of food is determined by how many nutrients it contains and how easily your body can digest it. Some foods are high in calories because they contain a lot of nutrients, such as protein, fat, or carbohydrates.</p><p>Other foods are high in calories because they are not very nutritious and are easy to digest, such as candy or processed snacks. If you eat something and then poop it out, the number of calories in that food would not be counted. However, if you ate something and it was absorbed into your body and used for energy, then the number of calories in that food would be&nbsp;counted.</p><p>If you throw up do you still count the calories?</p><p>Yes, you still count the calories! Throwing up does not get rid of the calories you consumed.</p><p>In fact, it can actually make you gain weight because you might eat more later to try to make up for what you threw&nbsp;up.</p><p>How many calories you need to eat to gain&nbsp;weight</p><p>How many calories you need to eat to gain weight depends on your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and how much you want to&nbsp;weigh.</p><p>To find out your BMR, use this calculator: <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/.">www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/.</a></p><p>Once you know your BMR, multiply it by the amount of activity you do in a day. If you are sedentary, multiply by 1.2. If you are lightly active, multiply by 1.375. If you are moderately active, multiply by 1.55. If you are very active, multiply by 1.725. And if you are extremely active, multiply by 1.9. This will give you the number of calories you need to eat each day to maintain your current weight (not including exercise).</p><p>To gain weight, add 500–1000 calories per day to this number (again not including exercise).</p><p>So if your BMR is 2000 and you are moderately active, you would need to eat 2500–3000 calories per day to gain&nbsp;weight.</p><p>How many calories should i eat for breakfast</p><p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the number of calories you need for breakfast will vary depending on your age, sex, activity level, and&nbsp;weight.</p><p>However, a good rule of thumb is to aim for around 400–600 calories for breakfast. This should provide enough energy to start your day without leaving you feeling too full or sluggish.</p><p>Some healthy breakfast options that are within this calorie range include: oatmeal with honey and banana; eggs with whole grain toast; yogurt with fruit and granola; a smoothie made with protein powder, almond milk, and frozen&nbsp;fruit.</p><p>How many calories do i need to maintain my&nbsp;weight</p><p>Maintaining weight is all about balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories you&nbsp;burn.</p><p>To maintain your weight, you need to eat the same number of calories that your body burns each day. This means that if you eat more than your body burns, you will gain weight; and if you eat less than your body burns, you will lose weight. There is no single magic number for how many calories everyone needs to maintain their&nbsp;weight.</p><p>It depends on factors such as age, sex, activity level, and muscle mass. However, general guidelines suggest that women need around 1,500–2,000 calories per day to maintain their weight, while men need around 2,000–2,500 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are trying to maintain your current weight, aim to consume the same number of calories each day. To do this, keep track of the foods you eat and make sure that your calorie intake stays within your recommended range. You can use a calorie calculator or app to help monitor your intake, or simply keep a food journal to track what you ate throughout the&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are looking to gain or lose weight, it’s important to adjust your caloric intake accordingly. For example, if you want to lose 1–2 pounds per week, aim to consume 500–1,000 fewer calories than your body needs each day. Conversely, if you want to gain 1–2 pounds per week, aim to consume 500–1,000 more calories than your body needs each&nbsp;day.</p> Conclusion <p>One of the most important aspects of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is controlling your calorie intake. It can be tricky, because you want to make sure you’re eating enough to fuel your body, but not so much that you’re packing on the&nbsp;pounds.</p><p>Luckily, there are plenty of ways to do this. One key is to make sure you’re eating nutrient-rich foods. These are foods that provide your body with the vitamins and minerals it needs to function properly. They’ll also help keep you feeling full longer, so you won’t be as tempted to snack between meals. Some good options include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources like chicken or&nbsp;fish.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is portion size. When dining out, for example, order an appetizer instead of an entree, or split a main course with a friend. At home, use smaller plates and measuring spoons to help control your portions. Finally, it’s important to get regular exercise.</p><p>This doesn’t mean hours at the gym every day; even moderate activity like walking or biking can help burn calories and keep your metabolism going strong. Just be sure to stick to a routine that works for you and fits into your schedule.</p>

Let’s go through Cory’s critique, and then present some answers to his questions.</p><p><a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/the-inevitability-of-trusted-third-parties-a51cbcffc4e2">The Inevitability of Trusted Third Parties</a></p><p>In one section of “The inevitability of trusted third parties” Cory Doctorow quotes extensively from one of my comments on the Well’s <a href="https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/516/State-of-the-World-2022-page01.html">State of the World 2022</a>.

It also<br>covers the CO2 emissions of the NFT issuing process.  Clause 20 has the arbitration machinery.  We've worked fairly closely with the UK government on arbitration<br>rules for blockchain asset disputes.  <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/new-dispute-rules-envisage-direct-to-blockchain-enforcement-arbitral-decisions">https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/new-dispute-rules-envisage-direct-to-<br>blockchain-enforcement-arbitral-decisions</a>  The rules themselves are here:<br><a href="https://35z8e83m1ih83drye280o9d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lawtech_DDRR_Final.pdf">https://35z8e83m1ih83drye280o9d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021<br>/04/Lawtech_DDRR_Final.pdf</a>  We get a name check on page 4.  So what's being built out here is a very tightly bound legal<br>framework for buying and selling physical goods, with suites of<br>Ricardian contracts creating legally-enforceable claims about what<br>the goods are **DRAWN ON THIRD PARTIES**. Those third parties do not<br>benefit from the sale of the goods themselves, they make a living<br>providing legal warranties on the goods - they're essentially third<br>party inspectors with no economic interest in the situation other<br>than by selling insurance on the fact that something (for example)<br>contains no slave labour. <p>Cory then continues:</p><blockquote>But the more I think about this smart contract, the fewer reasons I can find for it to be a smart contract instead of just, you know, a contract.</blockquote><blockquote>As Vinay Gupta — the creator of this system and someone I have a lot of respect for — says, right there in the text, the entire system relies on third party arbiters to make sure that the parties involved don’t rip each other off, that no one uses slave labor, that the carbon is all offset through various schemes and so&nbsp;on.</blockquote><blockquote>The point is, all of that could be a deception. The only reason to trust it is that you trust the auditors who have signed the&nbsp;scheme.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t mean to pooh-pooh the role of auditors here. Auditors are great. In fact, we’re in the middle of several kinds of serious economic crises because <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/04/aaronsw/#crooked-ref">we allowed auditors to become an oligopoly of hopelessly conflicted megafirms</a>, and they are <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/01/fallout-carillion-collapse-hits-kpmg.html">cheating like crazy</a>, and so much of the world is broken as a&nbsp;result.</blockquote><blockquote>We know that the big auditing firms are riddled with fraud. We know that <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/17/do-well-do-good-do-nothing/#greenwashing">carbon offsets</a> are among <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/26/aggregate-demand/#murder-offsets">the most fraudulent</a> instruments that companies make.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t get how blockchain fixes any of&nbsp;this.</blockquote> How blockchain fixes some of&nbsp;this <p>So let’s talk about how blockchain improves the situation: not a blanket fix, but an economically-efficient risk reduction across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>Alan Turing named the Oracle Problem in 1937, and people have been wrestling with it in the Ethereum space since the early days of the platform.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@DelphiSystems/the-oracle-problem-856ccbdbd14f">The Oracle Problem</a></p><p>The state of the art in Ethereum Oracles is pretty sophisticated and pretty successful.</p><p><a href="https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-blockchain-oracle-problem/">What Is the Blockchain Oracle Problem? Why Can't Blockchains Solve It?</a></p><p>Part of the reason the Oracle Problem is hard in blockchain is the old computer security adage, “things are weakest at the&nbsp;joints”.</p><p>The pathway by which information from the physical world comes into the blockchain smart contract is a potentially-weak joint between physical world systems and ultra-reliable blockchain systems. The blockchain systems are almost transcendentally reliable: this is why the strain concentrates on the Oracles, and on key management (we’ll come back to key management below). The computer does not break, but you can get at their&nbsp;inputs.</p> Blockchain reliability is not a magical&nbsp;process <p>The blockchain systems are theoretically reliable because of massive redundancy. It’s a bit like flight computers, where there are five independent systems.</p><p><a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2020/04/06/airbus-flight-control-system-single-points-of-failure/">Five Where Only One is Needed: How Airbus Avoids Single Points of Failure - Right Attitudes</a></p><p>All of the flight computers have to agree for it not to be A&nbsp;Problem.</p><p>In the blockchain space there are thousands of computers forming the consensus on the current state of the system. This is very inefficient, but it is very effective. Given inputs will produce the same outputs very, very reliably.</p><p>This redundancy method produces insulation from the statistical problems of the real world. This is a very important point. A non-redundant system can get hit by a cosmic ray or a stray particle produced by normal radioactive decay. It can go down from a power outage and go offline. Non-redundant systems are flakey. There is no cure for this. Redundant systems are inefficient. There is no cure for this either. This is the&nbsp;law.</p><p>The massively redundant blockchain systems are decoupled from the randomness of life to form a statistical approximation of a perfect system. You can program the Ethereum metacomputer — a virtual machine made of thousands of regular computers in a redundant array — as if it was perfect. You can just totally ignore how the physical world works when programming this virtual machine: does not get hacked, does not have physical hardware problems.</p><p>Any individual node in the metacomputer which develops issues drops out of the consensus. The tens of thousands of remaining machines go on. As a programmer, the massive redundancy means you completely stop worrying about hardware problems or failovers. There is no “error handling.” Nothing ever&nbsp;crashes.</p><p>It just&nbsp;works.</p><p>There is a downside to this redundancy. The archaic Bitcoin proof of work mechanism would cost about $750,000,000 to carbon offset every year, if we even thought CO2 offsetting worked. There’s good redundancy and bad redundancy. It’s unfeasibly expensive to do this the wrong way. But the Avalanche system runs on less than 500 tons of CO2 a year, it’s hundreds of times faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum, and it’s been available for a&nbsp;year.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1456329570295193601">@el33th4xor</a></p></blockquote><p>So massive redundancy is one half of what produces the effective decoupling of the blockchain from physical reality: the system is so redundant that there can be chaos in the physical world and the blockchain soldiers right on. It is not efficient (yet — we’ll cover proof of stake systems below) but it is&nbsp;elegant.</p><p>Now let’s look at the other half of what separates the blockchain from physical&nbsp;reality.</p><p>The other half of the decoupling of the blockchain from physical reality is True Names. You can download the Metamask wallet, create a key pair, and proceed to perform transactions on the blockchain without ever giving anybody any additional information about you at all: you’re an unaccountable ghost. Your legal identity is not tied to your&nbsp;actions.</p><p>This kind of power was a Cypherpunk dream for decades. <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-86207-7">Vernor Vinge’s True Names</a> explores the boundary between the cryptographic metaverse and the physical world in minute detail. It is a massively important formative work. In that world, nobody can bind your metaverse avatar to your physical body: the system protects your privacy. But if the link is made, and your True Name is cracked, you can be shut down — or even killed — in the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>In the blockchain environment, nobody has to know your True Name. This turns out to be a lot more of a mixed blessing than it was in SF&nbsp;novels.</p><p>Of course, in practice, the True Name protection on the blockchain is weak for three&nbsp;reasons:</p>  If the actions you take benefit you in the real world (“I mail ordered this book”) then you are bound to your name and address for delivery. If you cash out money you want to spend, you’re tied by banking. If you rent an apartment, you’re tied to the&nbsp;address.  Funding a cryptocurrency wallet through crypto exchanges requires KYC/AML/CTF checks, just like regular banking or even more strict. This enables a “follow the money” approach to de-anonymizing people who later receive those funds, even if those people believe themselves to be anonymous. The crypto cash is tied to your real identity from the get&nbsp;go.  You’re still going to have to pay&nbsp;taxes.  <p>So while the blockchain space is in some abstract sense perfectly private and perfectly reliable, things are weakest at the joints. The on-ramps and off-ramps are parts of the real world, they’re tied to physical reality and KYC/AML/CTF regulations. Furthermore, when a user wants blockchain software to act on their behalf in ways which touch the real world, the blockchain’s security model breaks: the system acting as an extension of your will is no longer just the massively redundant blockchain. Now it’s a bunch of messy, regulated, human or Web2 systems. You and your software agents are no longer entirely anonymous because the real world requires named actors with&nbsp;KYC.</p><p>Any system connected to the real world is going to have some of the problems of the real world connected to it too. That’s just&nbsp;life.</p><p>Of course, there is the key management problem, and the software reliability problem. If you lose your key, or more likely somebody hacks the device on which you store your key, your blockchain identity and all its assets now belong to someone else. <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/">Hardware wallets help a lot</a>, but no system is&nbsp;perfect.</p><p>And if the software you write and upload to the chain — the smart contracts — have a bug? God help&nbsp;you.</p><p>It’s a machine, and it’s utterly unforgiving. It’s more like programming aeroplane avionics systems or satellites than web pages. Here be&nbsp;dragons!</p> The best of both worlds: Oracles that&nbsp;work <p>So we’ve looked at the problems of connecting blockchain systems to the real world: reliability and anonymity break down, and the core benefits of the blockchain are&nbsp;diluted.</p><p>But there are pragmatic systems that find advantages in connecting the blockchain and the real world. I’ll briefly cover two: Chainlink (a big Web3 project of some note), and Mattereum (my own company, as described in the Well State of the World quote&nbsp;above.)</p> Chainlink <p>Consider the Chainlink oracle&nbsp;system.</p><p><a href="https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles">What Is an Oracle in Blockchain? " Explained | Chainlink</a></p><p>A dazzling array of partner organizations with access to high quality data about things like weather conditions, stock prices and plane departures use a cryptographic and financial architecture to publish their data into the blockchain. They’re standing on their reputations: if they input bad data, they’re going to pay. There are complex “staking” arrangements coming this year which further automate this access to&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://chainlinktoday.com/staking-is-coming-to-the-chainlink-network-in-2022/">Staking Is Coming To The Chainlink Network In 2022</a></p><p>So that’s the True Names side of the bridge: in the Chainlink system, people publishing data are identified by their True Name. Only worthy partners are&nbsp;allowed.</p><p>The security side is more complex: Trusted Computing infrastructure signs transactions, multiple data feeds are integrated into an oracle feed, no data is single-pathed. It’s not quite the fully redundant system of the blockchain, but it’s a lot of cryptographic hardware and a lot of data source diversity. Not quite the same statistical guarantees as the blockchain itself makes, but a lot better than you would get with a conventional API-based price feed or other&nbsp;oracle.</p><p>It’s a bridge: not as squishy and unreliable as real-world APIs are, with lots of single points of failure that hackers could attack. But not as utterly, relentlessly infallible as the Ethereum metacomputer. Better than what we have now: Chainlink manages the Oracle Problem well enough to produce a highly functional system, without some kind of Science Fiction fix. It’s just a lot of hard work and good engineering by teams of smart people over years, building the most fraud-resistant and functional thing they&nbsp;can.</p><p>Actual Machines, not Fucking Magic, <a href="https://fritzfreiheit.com/wiki/AM/FM">as they&nbsp;say</a>.</p><p>So that’s one end of the pragmatic solutions to the Oracle Problem in the blockchain space: highly automated systems for doing things like price feeds using trusted computing hardware to guarantee data integrity.</p> Mattereum <p>Now let’s look at my own company, <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a>.</p><p>Mattereum operates all the way at the other end of the automation landscape: we rely on domain specialists such as curators, art historians and collectors to evaluate physical items. These physical items are being sold as&nbsp;NFTs!</p><p>The model&nbsp;is:</p>  An issuer puts the physical item in a vault with a set of third party evaluations provided by those&nbsp;experts  The issuer then publishes an NFT which gives the owner of the NFT the right to the item in the vault, akin to a coat check, but&nbsp;secure  The NFT owner can cash in the NFT for the item in the&nbsp;vault.  <p>It’s a system for doing real world trade in valuable things with a huge reduction in the risk of fraud: better expert opinions than one would usually get, and intermediate owners (e.g. dealers, auctioneers) are never touching the physical item. It stays securely in the&nbsp;vault.</p><p>We’ve worked on quite a few assets already, such as a selection of <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/third-millennia-collection-1">props and memorabilia</a> owned by legendary actor William Shatner, a <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/2">350,000 year-old hand axe</a>, and a <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/7">signed first edition</a> by Gonzo icon Hunter S. Thompson.</p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4aD73411CeC7D05c2EA1a17B4597E76/7">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4aD73411CeC7D05c2EA1a17B4597E76/7</a><p>These <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.hunter.s.thompson.17082021/#01_Identity">physical asset evaluations</a> are performed by curators with relevant domain expertise and presented as legal warranty contracts — <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.hunter.s.thompson.17082021/01_Identity/assets/out/certification-contract.html">pen and ink type legalese </a>— bound into the blockchain using a legal/technical construct called a Ricardian Contract. Not a lot of people seem to have heard of Ricardian Contracts these days: they were widely understood 5 years ago, but the number of people in the blockchain space has grown by something like 10000x since then and the Old Wisdom has become&nbsp;diluted.</p><p>Invented in the 1990s by Ian Grigg for managing a physical gold reserve with a cryptocurrency system, the Ricardian Contract is the key to understanding the new blockchain ecosystems.</p><p><a href="https://101blockchains.com/ricardian-contracts/">What are Ricardian Contracts? A Comprehensive Guide</a></p><p>Ricardian contracts are paper contracts, which use international arbitration law to appoint technically sophisticated arbitrators to manage cases involving a hybrid legal/technical system. Those arbitration laws carry hundreds of billions a year of settlements, so they’re well used and well understood and stable: <a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/english">the system has run since&nbsp;1958</a>.</p><p>Using those systems to make legalese contracts signed and paid on the blockchain arbitrable in the real world by real courts is the Ricardian Contract breakthrough. It’s another bridge: an extremely robust legal framework for getting enforceable legal rulings in complex areas like maritime law or civil engineering, carefully paired up to blockchain smart contracts.</p><p>What does the blockchain bring to the table in this instance? Well, the payments are taken on chain, using digital signatures, which are <a href="https://rightsignature.com/legality/electronic-signature-laws.html">universally accepted as legal signatures</a> these days. Actual statute legislates that in almost all countries. Those statues in each country are one part of the bridge, built out 20 years ago for general purpose use of digital signatures. But what this means is we have an instant and immediate settlement: the warranties on the physical object, and the ownership transfer, happen in a single atomic moment with the technical, legal, and financial transaction perfectly coordinated because they are the same transaction.</p><p>Remember I said “things are weakest at the joints” — well, in this case, there are no&nbsp;joints.</p><p>The legal, technical and financial transaction are a single transaction, there’s no way to wind up with a thing half-insured or stuck in an indeterminate state waiting for more paperwork. It’s a “performative speech act.” You say “make it so” and it is&nbsp;so!</p><p>That will stand up in court in 160+ countries because of the arbitration framework described above. It’s not an end-run around “the system” — it is an extension of “the system.” It’s a bridge! The legal system and the blockchain system can, with due care, work as one&nbsp;system.</p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0</a><p>In the beginning, Cory asked “why isn’t this just a contract?”</p><p>The answer is “it is a contract, but it’s a contract embedded in a Ricardian context — one half in the world of automated smart contracts, and the other half in the world of&nbsp;courts.”</p><p>If you do it right, when you put legal contracts on to the blockchain, you get the best of both worlds, and that’s what we&nbsp;did.</p> Some examples of our&nbsp;work. <p>A gold mood ring, one of the first issued, recently sold as an NFT for $65,000.<br><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/">https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/</a><br><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-mood-ring---a-cultural-icon-re-emerges-as-smart-wearable-nfts-301414759.html">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-mood-ring---a-cultural-icon-re-emerges-as-smart-wearable-nfts-301414759.html</a></p><p>An original Andy Warhol print of Alexander the Great<br><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1E65Ad4fB60844925Ed95Dec8460d8DE807B2BC4/0</a><br><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/">https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/</a></p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/">https://passport.mattereum.com/goldmoodstonering.1975/</a> About Mattereum <p>London-based Mattereum was established in 2017 by a trans-disciplinary team with a track record in designing and launching nation state-level infrastructure and headed by former Ethereum release coordinator Vinay Gupta.

			 Tokeny’s 2022 Roadmap: Enhancing the Liquidity of Tokenized Assets 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in Jan 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Welcome to our monthly Product Focus newsletter, designed to keep you informed about our product developments at Tokeny. As this is the first newsletter of this year, we thought it would be good to introduce you to our product development priorities for 2022. These are:</p>
 🔰 Security and scalability 
<p>As a technology company, providing secure solutions to our customers and their end-users is fundamental, so security will remain our top priority. This year, we plan to pass more audits, certifications and cybersecurity tests than ever before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the tokenization market evolves, we will make our solutions more resilient and scalable to ensure that the upcoming mass adoption of tokenization will be seamless for asset issuers simply by integrating our solutions into their existing systems with APIs and SDKs. For this, we plan to improve our monitoring tools and release an improved customizable blockchain indexer.</p>
 🤩 Enhanced UX for issuers and investors 
<p>New features will be added for issuers to further reduce their administrative and compliance costs via more automated and guided processes. However, the main innovations will concern the token holder side. As our customers are scaling their operations and proposing more tokenized securities to their investors, our team will release a unified, multi-token, enriched Investor Portal this year.</p>
 🌊 Liquidity enabler&nbsp; 
<p>We always considered blockchain networks as shared infrastructure. This year, we will take our solutions to another level on this infrastructure by offering asset issuers tools and networks to easily connect liquidity providers and gradually create a robust and compliant distribution ecosystem for security tokens.</p>
 🆔 Making DeFi acceptable to institutions and regulators&nbsp; 
<p>The DeFi space is full of opportunities, but a lack of compliance prevents institutions from injecting large amounts of capital into the space or involving tokenized securities. More than ever, we are convinced that onchain identities are the solution. Therefore, we will launch developer tools to easily create compliant DeFi protocols where only eligible actors can participate. As we believe that this will be the first year of the “Permissioned DeFi” wave, these tools will allow DeFi project teams to quickly catch up with the trend.</p>
<p>The year ahead promises to be exciting, as we will provide our customers and partners with more powerful tools to enhance asset liquidity and accelerate institutional adoption.</p>

<p>IMF Pressures El Salvador on Legal Tender Status of Bitcoin<br><br>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has issued a public rebuke of El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The IMF, which serves as a major source of credit for developing countries, has asserted that the volatility in the virtual asset market – along with the potential for the facilitation of illicit activity – makes Bitcoin unsuitable for use as legal tender. Perhaps more importantly, the lender has stated that, should El Salvador continue down the path of accepting Bitcoin as legal tender, it may be deemed ineligible for receipt of credit in the future. This is particularly concerning as El Salvador has recently sought $1.3 billion in funding from the IMF.<br><br>The organization’s primary concerns appear to be related to “financial stability, financial integrity and consumer protection”. Though it has also noted that issues related to debt issuance may arise, as bonds issued by the country would implicitly be backed by Bitcoin as well as dollars. This could have a negative impact on El Salvador’s Article IV evaluation, which is the process by which “an IMF team of economists visit a country to assess economic and financial developments and discuss the country's economic and financial policies with government and central bank officials”. The results of the Article IV exam are reported to the IMF’s Board of Directors, and may have a direct impact on a given country’s ability to work with the financial institution on an ongoing basis.<br><br>While Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has been a staunch advocate for Bitcoin’s promise as legal tender, the process of adoption has not been without controversy domestically. In September 2021, protestors vandalized several of the Chivo ATMs used to convert dollars to Bitcoin and marched in opposition to the policy mandating virtual asset adoption by merchants and vendors. Nonetheless, in the intervening months, the Salvadoran populace has been widely accepting of Bitcoin, and over three million wallets have been opened since the policy took effect. More Salvadorans now have Bitcoin wallets than traditional bank accounts, and dollar inflows to BTC have far outpaced outflows, as citizens have embraced the fast and efficient transactions allowed for on the Bitcoin Lightning Network.<br><br>The IMF’s call is certainly concerning to those who would support broader adoption of Bitcoin and other virtual assets globally, though it also represents a unique and meaningful opportunity for engagement. By partnering with the IMF to develop a legal tender policy framework suitable to both parties, El Salvador may potentially help to set ground-breaking precedent concerning the supranational regulatory integration of fiat and digital currencies. In this moment, it’s imperative that the parties work together, to further the mission of financial inclusion and technological innovation, while maintaining the credit support structures that are vital to the success of developing countries across the world.</p>

 Start with a simple Java application 
 
 
<p>To test out these options, you will, of course, need a Java web application. If you already have one handy, skip this step!</p>
 
 
<p>Bootstrap a new application using the <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.example&amp;artifactId=demo&amp;name=demo&amp;description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&amp;packageName=com.example.demo&amp;dependencies=web,devtools">Spring Initializer</a>. Clicking on that link will automatically add the <code>web</code> and <code>devtools</code> dependencies.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Download the project using the Generate button.</p>
 
 
<p>Extract the zip file.</p>
 
 
<p>Open the project with your favorite IDE.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The last thing to do is to add a basic <code>RestController</code> in <code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/HelloController.java</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Yes, this is another Hello World...";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! Start the application either from your IDE or by running <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Now access this boring, non-secure application in your browser at`\http://localhost:8080/`.</p>
 
 
 
 
 HTTPS using an internet proxy 
 
 
<p>One of the quickest ways to get a local application running with TLS is to use an internet proxy like ngrok.
<a href="https://ngrok.com/download">Download and install ngrok</a> and then start up the service using:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ngrok http 8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will expose your local service running port <code>8080</code> over the internet on a generated URL such as <code>https://abcd-11-22-33-44.ngrok.io</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>If you don’t want to install ngrok, you could use <a href="https://localhost.run/">localhost.run</a>, which works using SSH port forwarding. Try it out with:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 nokey@localhost.run</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Similar to ngrok, a temporary URL will be generated. For example, <code>https://152ccb7ac9369e.lhr.life</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The goal of these tools is to provide a publicly available URL for your local development, which is perfect if you want to share something via the internet. If you don’t want to share, it’s best not to expose your development machine to any potential attackers online. The following two options avoid this issue.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a certificate authority with mkcert 
 
 
<p>The next two options use a tool called <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert"><code>mkcert</code></a>, which sets up a locally trusted certificate authority (CA), installed into the trust stores on your computer. Any certificates issued by this CA will be trusted by the client of your choice (Chrome, Firefox, curl, etc.).</p>
 
 
<p>On macOS, you can install <code>mkcert</code> with Homebrew; for other operating systems you can find instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation"><code>mkcert</code> docs</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>brew install mkcert nss
# nss is only needed if you are using Firefox</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create and install the certificate authority:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkcert -install</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>Created a new local CA 💥
Sudo password:
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ⚡️
The local CA is now installed in Java's trust store! ☕️</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>If you are on macOS and using <a href="https://httpie.io/">HTTPie</a>, you will need to add the CA to <a href="https://github.com/httpie/httpie/issues/480">HTTPie manually</a>:<br></p>
 
 
 
 <code>cat "$(mkcert --CAROOT)/rootCA.pem" &gt;&gt; \
$(brew --prefix)/Cellar/httpie/*/libexec/lib/python*/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem</code> 
 
 



 
 
<p>That was mostly painless, now let’s secure the application you just created!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Reverse proxy with Nginx 
 
 
<p>Many production applications terminate TLS using a reverse proxy like Nginx. This can also be an excellent option for local development and has the added advantage of working with any web application framework.</p>
 
 
<p>To run Nginx, I’ll use the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx">official Nginx Docker image</a>. To keep things organized, create a new directory to hold the configuration:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir localhost-tls
cd localhost-tls</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, use <code>mkcert</code> to generate the certificates Nginx will use.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir devcerts
mkcert -key-file devcerts/key.pem -cert-file devcerts/cert.pem localhost</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command generates a private key and certificate in the new <code>devcerts</code> directory for the host, <code>localhost</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Create an <code>nginx-default.conf.template</code> configuration file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    rewrite ^/(.*)$ https://$host$request_uri? permanent; (1)
}

server {
  server_name _;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:${TARGET_PORT}; (2)

    (3)
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host:443;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port 443;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
  }

  listen 443 ssl;
  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/cert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/key.pem;
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Redirect all http requests to https.


2
Windows and Mac hosts run Docker in a VM, the hostname <code>host.docker.internal</code> is used to point back to the "host" OS and the port.


3
Set the proxy headers, so the downstream app will know what URL the client is using.


 
 
 
 
 Tie it all together with Docker 
 
<p>Now that you have your Java application, the certificates, and the Nginx configuration ready to go, the only thing left is to start it up!</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>docker run</code> to start Nginx with the above files as volumes that configure the service.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/nginx-default.conf.template:/etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template \ (1)
    -v $(pwd)/devcerts:/etc/nginx/certs \ (2)
    -p 443:443 \
    -p 80:80 \
    --env TARGET_PORT=8080 \ (3)
    nginx</code> 
 
 
 


1
The Nginx configuration file template.


2
The path to the certificates.


3
The port where your application is running on <code>localhost</code>.


 
 
 
 






You can codify this solution using a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/mkcert-nginx-example/blob/main/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml file</a> if you prefer!



 
 
<p>Test it out! Open up your browser to <code>https://localhost/</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Configure Spring Boot to use HTTPS 
 
 
<p>The previous options used a separate service to handle TLS; this time, I’ll configure Spring Boot’s embedded Tomcat server to terminate TLS directly.</p>
 
 
<p>Generate another set of certificates with <code>mkcert</code>. This time set the output format to <code>pkcs12</code>, which is a format the Java KeyStore understands.</p>
 
 
 
 <code># create the directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/spring-boot

# generate a certificate in pkcs12 format
mkcert -pkcs12 -p12-file ~/.config/spring-boot/local-tls.p12 localhost</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a properties file <code>~/.config/spring-boot/spring-boot-devtools.properties</code> containing the server port and newly generated keystore location.</p>
 
 
 
 <code># Set the port
server.port=8443

# configure the key store path
server.ssl.key-store=${user.home}/.config/spring-boot/local-tls.p12</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now restart your Spring Boot application, and open your browser to <code>https://localhost:8443</code> to access your newly secured application!</p>
 
 






 
<p>I didn’t need to make any changes to my application because it’s using <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html">Spring Boot DevTools</a>, which automatically includes the above properties file. If you are not using DevTools, you can mimic this behavior by setting an environment variable before starting your application:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>SPRING_CONFIG_IMPORT='${user.home}/.config/spring-boot/spring-boot-devtools.properties'</code> 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Bonus: Use a different hostname 
 
 
<p>The above examples use <code>localhost</code>, which works, but you might want to use a different hostname. One easy way to do this is to add a hostname alias to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 local.example" &gt;&gt; /etc/hosts'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In the above examples, when generating certificates with <code>mkcert</code>, replace <code>localhost</code> with your domain name. Here’s an example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkcert -key-file devcerts/key.pem -cert-file devcerts/cert.pem local.example</code> 
 
 
 






Use a domain name that you own or that is NOT in the official <a href="https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">top-level domain list</a> to ensure there are no conflicting or hijacked DNS entries.



 
 
 
 
 Potential problems using HTTPS for local development 
 
 
<p>It’s not all sunshine and roses. If you are a developer that works on multiple applications there are a few things to watch out for.
Your browser may automatically switch to HTTPS if you are switching between applications that run on HTTP and HTTPS prototypes, especially if one of your applications sets the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HTST) headers</a>. If you run into this type of problem you can clear the <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/getting-started-guide/internet-and-networking/clearing-a-web-browsers-ssl-state">SSL State</a> and/or <a href="https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/clear-hsts-settings-chrome-firefox/">HSTS settings</a> in your browser.</p>
 
 






Use a different hostname for each application you are working on to avoid browser caching.



 
 
 
 
 Learn more about building secure Java applications 
 
 
<p>This post has demonstrated three options for running applications locally using TLS/HTTPS. Each option has its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Using an Internet proxy exposes your application to the world; however, this could be what you want if you are testing <a>web hooks</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Running a reverse proxy will work for any application, but it’s one more service to manage (…​and remember to start 😉 ).</p>
 
 
<p>Running directly in the Spring Boot application, just works™️ once it’s set up. However, it cannot use the default HTTPS port (<code>443</code>) without some other workaround, like (<a href="https://mcaikovski.blogspot.com/2018/01/forwarding-ports-80-to-8080-or-443-to.html">iptables</a>, <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/112795/how-to-run-a-server-on-port-80-as-a-normal-user-on-linux#answer-112805">authbind</a>, <a href="https://techblog.jeppson.org/2017/12/make-java-run-privileged-ports-centos-7/">setcap</a>, etc.).</p>

				  Indicio is proud to have been named by <a href="https://www.vcnet.nyc/">New York VC Network</a> in their recently compiled list of the most exciting early-stage teams that they’ll be following closely this year!   
			  
				
				
				 <p>This exclusive list is made up of recently founded companies that are now raising their Seed or Series A and have applied to the VC matching program in the past six months. Based on the space the teams are working in, they are divided into 5 categories:&nbsp; HealthTech, Fintech, B2B Solutions, Consumer Tech, and Top Scorers in ESG.</p>
<p>The New York VC Network Rating Committee consists of current and former VCs, angel investors, exited entrepreneurs, and Fortune 500 employees in M&amp;A roles. The rating for companies is primarily based on two criteria. The first is the team’s past track record, mostly relying on founder profiles, past achievements, and their ability to gather a talented team around them. The second is the company’s current traction/scalability, based on the chosen market, current traction, and ability to scale.</p>
<p>The focus here was not on raised capital, but for insight these companies had already raised $3.4M on average (the median being $1.4M) and continued to receive more after applying.&nbsp; More information on the full list, including companies, full company profiles, and contact information are available in the <a href="https://www.vcnet.nyc/nyc-top-50/top-jan-2022">full announcement from New York VC Network.</a></p>

<p>Moving past the login box using Verifiable Credentials</p><p>Visit any traditional website today and you’ll likely be confronted with a barrage of obstacles. The first thing will be those annoying cookie pop ups pushing you to consent to the countless number of 3rd parties that will track your visit. This information is peddled on exchanges around the world. Get past that, and you will eventually be pushed to share your email address or phone number, and create yet another password. All making you a likely target for phishing attacks and putting your personal data at risk of being included in the <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/96667-the-top-data-breaches-of-2021">1,291 data breaches </a>affecting <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/10/06/data-breach-2021-2020-total-hacks/">nearly 281.5 million people</a> in 2021. This approach is not going to last.</p><p>Web 3 has brought a new way to engage with websites, and dare I say, it is almost magical. No cookies, no username, no password, no sharing personal information. I can browse freely and pseudo-anonymously without having to worry about the cookies and terms I was forced to accept. When I want to transact, I connect to a website with a “wallet”. The wallet (e.g, <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>) is a browser extension or mobile app that holds a unique pseudonymous identifier, such as my Ethererum address. When I click “Connect”, my wallet proves to the website that I control the private keys associated with that address. All my data stays with me, on my device. This puts me, the user in control. </p><p>The wallet replaces the username, the password, the cookie and requires no personal data to be shared. This is great for website owners as well because they no longer need to store sensitive data about their users. No surprise then that MetaMask, for example, claims to be “trusted by <a href="https://decrypt.co/86263/ethereum-wallet-metamask-reports-21-million-users">21 million users</a> worldwide”. The Web3 community is also exploring using other identifiers like NFTs and Ethereum Name Service (<a href="https://ens.domains/">ENS</a>) that can be associated with a wallet.</p><p>The Role of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials</p><p><br>But if we do not share any personal data, how do we complete web transactions that require age verification or affordability criteria(e.g. loans). How could users prove that they meet those eligibility or qualification criteria without breaking the Web3 model or privacy and convenience?</p><p>This is where the W3C standards on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralised Identifiers </a>(DIDs)and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials </a>(VCs) come into play. DIDs and VCs are a new type of unique identifier with linked verifiable information that can be controlled solely by the user. DID-based representations for Ethereum Accounts and ENS names have been <a href="https://medium.com/uport/ens-names-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids-724f0c317e4b">already defined</a>, and with zero transaction costs, users can easily create their own DIDs. They will then be able to prove control over their DID, enable trusted third parties to “issue” cryptographically signed verifiable credentials (e.g. I am over 21) linked to the user’s DID, and allow websites to “verify” a user meets any eligibility (e.g. age verification) and/or qualification criteria (e.g. affordability checks) whilst preserving the user’s privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, these verifications can be done using selective disclosure (e.g. to prove your age, you need only disclose your date of birth versus showing your entire drivers’ license), predicates( e.g. instead of sharing your full date of birth, you can simply prove you are over 21), and zero knowledge proofs (e.g prove that I am a European citizen without sharing my passport details), using “<a href="https://blog.dock.io/anonymous-credentials/">anonymous credentials</a>”. This makes it possible for users to not have to compromise on neither the user experience nor on their anonymity within the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>Get Started with Dock</p><p>To find out more about how to implement DIDs, Verifiable Credentials and Anonymous Credentials in practice, have a look at <a href="https://console.api.dock.io/">Dock’s platform</a> or reach out to <a href="https://www.dock.io/contact">Dock directly</a>.</p><p>About Dock:</p><p>Dock is a platform designed to provide a simple solution for businesses and developers to build, manage and present digital credentials that are instantly verifiable using blockchain technology. With a standalone blockchain and seamless adoption and interoperability, Dock is part of a movement to solve universal problems with existing data and how it is captured, shared and controlled.</p>

			  Mihalis Plelis is a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p></p>
 Who are you? 
<p>I am Mihalis, Senior Software Developer at Tokeny. I graduated from the Technological Educational Institute of Crete as a software engineer. I live in Crete and I like to work remotely.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After working for two big companies and a startup in the past, I wanted a change. After I started looking for a new challenge in my career, my ex-colleague <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-talent-story-of-jose/">José</a> who works for Tokeny referred me to the team, and this is how our journey started.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny is something different. Right from the start, I was given the best welcome to date, better than any company that I have worked for in the past. We have a lot of freedom in our work, and we are free to do things the way we prefer. The team is really friendly, helpful and committed, which allows us to do things efficiently. The level of programming in our team is very high, allowing me to become a better developer and learn new things every day.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I like exploring new things, that’s why I like traveling. I’ve been to many European countries so far and I hope to continue traveling and exploring the world, experiencing new cultures and lifestyles. Also, I like to taste new kinds of food as this combines well with traveling around the world.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Being happy, like everyone else’s, I suppose. I try to have a balanced life, free of stress, close to nature and away from the noise of the big cities. I also hope I can contribute to making this world a better place via my work.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would want everyone to have equal opportunities in personal and professional life. In addition, I would try to reduce pollution so that the next generation will have a quality place to live.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Basics first&nbsp;</p>



<p>The basics sound simple, and yet are so significant. Make sure your devices are secure: your computers, smartphones, and tablets. By that we mean, check if you have a comprehensive data security policy. That includes antivirus software, firewalls, and data recovery. To protect data in transit, all connections to your system should be on a secure platform. Emails should be encrypted, and remote desktops should be accessed via a VPN (virtual private network). At the end of the day, preventing security breaches is far less costly than curing it if it happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Enforce password management&nbsp;</p>



<p>Did you know that weak or stolen passwords account for as much as 80% of attacks? Ensuring that you have strong passwords in force can help lower the chance of those attacks. Today there are password manager applications in use that allow you to generate strong passwords and store them securely, like LastPast. The best password is one that you can remember, but one that will be hard for other people, even malicious programs, to guess. An abbreviated sentence or passphrase is often better than a single word with numbers and symbols inserted. If possible, you can also add 2-factor authentication on most software platforms. Needless to say, everything you would do to protect your computer should be done on your mobile devices also. Update your software whenever possible, use strong passcodes, turn off Bluetooth when not in use, and verify legitimacy before you download anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. Educate yourself&nbsp;</p>



<p>Education is everything, and when considering that human errors and negligence are the major causes of data breaches, it becomes even more important. Keep up to date with the latest security best practices and do your research on how to prevent cybersecurity threats such as malware or phishing scams – it might pay off in the end! In general, it is good to follow the Better safe than sorry guideline. As multiple studies have shown time and again, many data breaches could have been prevented if we had taken better care earlier on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. Finding a good connection&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever we go online in a public place, e.g. by using a public WIFI connection, we have no direct control over its security. Before providing information, such as your bank account number, be sure that you are using a secure WIFI network – or wait for a better time. Using a secure VPN connection further enables you to have a safe connection between device and Internet server: one that no one can monitor or access the data you are exchanging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. Be sceptical&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you receive a link that looks strange from a trusted friend or family member, better contact them to ask if the link you’ve received was sent on purpose. Viruses and other forms of malware often spread because of phishing or social engineering, meaning you click on a link from someone you know. This is when you are tricked into revealing personal or sensitive information for fraudulent purposes. Spam emails, ‘free’ offers, or online quizzes all use these tactics to entice you to click on dangerous links or give up your personal information. Always be wary of offers that sound too good to be true or ask for too much information. Again: better safe than sorry!&nbsp;</p>

“None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.”- Johann Wolfgang von&nbsp;Goethe<p>Payment processing is an extremely complex system that involves several intermediaries; it isn’t as easy as sending monetary value from the consumer to the merchant. Let’s make an easy to understand example of such a notion. An office worker pays by credit card after eating at a franchise restaurant. It is evident that the transaction occurred between two people, the office worker and the restaurant owner, however many intermediaries are involved with one payment. These intermediaries can cause inefficiencies and additional costs for the business owner. This complexity is one of the focal components on why many businesses charge an additional processing fee when paying with a credit card as opposed to a cash transaction. Countless intermediaries and contracts form the basis of even the smallest of payments; at your local 711 or deli, an innocuous three dollar transaction can turn into a convoluted process where multiple systems must become involved. This creates a problem for the small business&nbsp;owner.</p><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic specifically, small businesses in particular have seen the degradation of their businesses. This is due to a number of reasons which include shutdowns, a slowdown in economic expenditures and now, a looming supply crisis and payment processing only adds to these multiple nuisances. Many contract structures that provide convenience and risk management to the business owner in return conceive of a high commission burden to that specific small business owner. This is a fundamental flaw in the payment processing paradigm. Naturally, it is evident that the burden of this fee must be borne by the individual franchisees and the consumer. An easy and innovative payment service must be the answer, and one is on the horizon,&nbsp;GemPay.</p><p>Ask yourself this question, and answer it honestly, has fintech and big tech platforms enhanced the monetary performance of your business, or retracted upon it and left it in economic stagnation? It is an honest question that every small business owner should be asking. At the end of 2021, the fee for small merchants with annual sales of 300 million won ($250,000 USD) or less was only&nbsp;.08% for credit cards. However the percentage for Naver Pay is 2.2% (order management) and 2.0% for Kakao Pay (online), higher than the majority of card processing companies. It has been analyzed that the approximate fee is 2–3 times higher. It has become difficult to simply compare fee rates because of the broad range of services that credit card companies and simple payment operators provide. Of course, it is true that it is difficult for everyone to know transparently about the standards and specific details of processing fees. But we must ask ourselves about the fundamental maxim of big tech service companies, whose sole purpose is for-profit business. Are big tech service companies competing to provide quality services for their customers rather than financial companies that are subject to stricter audit and regulatory restrictions? Even so, it will be just a temporary marketing to dominate the market and that creates a major&nbsp;dilemma.</p><p>The fact that the development of technology has made it possible for consumers to easily consume is certainly a benefit of fintech technology; resulting from this, more people and business entities experience convenience and versatility. ‘Easier’, ‘faster’ and ‘kinder’ have become essential features of all services as technological innovation has increased astronomically over the last two decades. However, for sellers, this means higher fees and more platform dependencies which perpetuates the ability for payment processing platforms to price gouge processing fees because of the “leverage of reliancy.” We are not just satisfied with the simplicity of the service, but can actually increase the benefits that we can receive from the huge platform created with data and aggregation. This is where GemPay comes into play, developed by Blocko&nbsp;XYZ.</p><p>Blocko XYZ is an incredibly forward thinking company that creates blockchain solutions for enterprises of all sizes. GemPay is a convenient solution to the major processing fee dilemma that small business owners face. Bitcoin and blockchain technology are great solutions to these problems, but they have unfortunate dilemmas as well which include scalability, high transaction fees, exploits, slow transaction times and bottlenecks. After consistent deliberation and study of the mechanics of blockchain technology, Blocko was able to collect the following three notions to successfully integrate and amalgamate into GemPay. Beginning with the first pillar, the philosophy entailed is this “accept the notion of eliminating payment intermediaries and borrow the concept of point discounts to increase discounts instead of fees!” The second pillar highlighted is “let’s become the subject of the service by transparently sharing the transaction process, such as payment details and discount rates, and allowing users to exercise their own choice in operation!” And lastly, the third pillar is thus “keep the value 1:1 with the legal currency, so let’s focus on the points that can be easily paid rather than the investment purpose!”</p><p>The first pillar highlights the ethos of decentralized blockchain technology, comparing it to its non-traditional notions in accordance with the existing financial system. The core principle of blockchain is decentralization. Through blockchains the fee dilemma can be resolved by excluding electronic payment agencies (in essence, removing the oligopolist middle-men such as Payment Gate PG) and value added networks that are interconnected in the payment process. In English, buyers and sellers are directly connected through a peer-to-peer paradigm without the necessity of third parties, which results in virtually zero commission costs. Because GemPay is a blockchain based payment system, a “double discount” is possible.</p><p>The second ethos of GemPay revolves around the notion of preventing a second merge point which allows for the service to operate transparently with blockchain technology. Anonymity and paradoxically, transparency are the quintessential components of blockchain technology, and these can be utilized in an open payment system. At the time of payment, the user can clearly and easily check through the app how much discount the business received, unlike other payment methods, and that this amount of discount is possible only with the GemPay application. Instead of “you were charged x amount of won, please pay’, we become smart users by becoming the subject of payment data from consumers who used to make payments passively. This is one of the focal components of why GemPay is a practical solution in payment processing.</p><p>The third ethos of GemPay revolves around the controversy surrounding the coin price volatility. A justifiable question that small business owners ask themselves when utilizing blockchain and cryptocurrencies is “why would I accept such a volatile currency, I could make the transaction now and the value of the transaction can drop 20% in one minute”, which is a completely understandable sentiment. Afterall, a business must protect its profit and revenue streams. Blocko has conceived of an idea that will end this notion. Blocko will create AergoGem tokens on itself-developed AERGO mainnet to ensure 1:1 value exchange with fiat currency, and will initially focus on exchange with the KRW pair. Users can use the Gem charged through the GemPay app as in original currency and Gem can then be recharged with AERGO tokens, and you can also link third-party points with GemPay to exchange each point of the Gem. To conclude with a simple summary, GemPay allows for a high discount rate through its “double discount”, it enables transparency and independence through blockchain technology, and easy payments with gems that maintain 1:1 value with legal currency.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency involves substantial risk, do not invest more than you can afford to lose!

  <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is one of the most exciting and underestimated software technologies invented in recent times. It’s a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine that aims to execute at native speeds with a memory-safe and secure sandbox. Wasm is portable, cross-platform, and language-agnostic—designed as a compilation target for languages. Though originally part of the open web platform, it has found use cases beyond the web. WebAssembly is now used in browsers, Node.js, Deno, Kubernetes, and IoT platforms.</p>

<p>You can learn more about WebAssembly at <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly.org</a>.</p>

 WebAssembly on Kubernetes 

<p>Though initially designed for <a href="https://www.w3.org/wasm/">the web</a>, WebAssembly proved to be an ideal format for writing platform and language-agnostic applications. You may be aware of something similar in the container world—Docker containers. People, including Docker co-founder Solomon Hykes, recognized the similarity and acknowledged that WebAssembly is even more efficient since it’s fast, portable, and secure, running at native speeds. This means that you can use WebAssembly alongside containers as workloads on Kubernetes. Another WebAssembly initiative known as <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a> along with the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> project make this possible.</p>

 <blockquote><p>If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to created Docker. That's how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link. Let's hope WASI is up to the task! <a href="https://t.co/wnXQg4kwa4">https://t.co/wnXQg4kwa4</a></p>— Solomon Hykes (@solomonstre) <a href="https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/1111004913222324225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2019</a></blockquote>

 

<p>WebAssembly on Kubernetes is relatively new and has some rough edges at the moment, but it’s already proving to be revolutionary. Wasm workloads can be extremely fast as they can execute faster than a container takes to start. The workloads are sandboxed and hence much more secure than containers; they are way smaller in size due to the binary format than containers.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about WASI, check out <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/">the original announcement from Mozilla</a>.</p>

 Why Rust? 

<p>I previously wrote a blog post about <a href="https://deepu.tech/my-second-impression-of-rust/">why Rust is a great language for the future</a>, Tl;Dr; Rust is secure and fast without the compromises of most modern languages, and Rust has the <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/">best ecosystem and tooling</a> for WebAssembly. So Rust + Wasm makes it super secure and fast.</p>

 Enter Krustlet 

<p><a href="https://krustlet.dev/">Krustlet</a> is a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/">Kubelet</a> written in Rust for WebAssembly workloads (written in any language). It listens for new pods assignments based on <code>tolerations</code> specified on the manifest and runs them. Since the default Kubernetes nodes cannot run Wasm workloads natively, you need a Kubelet that can, and this is where Krustlet comes in.</p>

 Run WebAssembly workloads on Kubernetes with Krustlet 

<p>Today, you will use Krustlet to run a Wasm workload written in Rust on Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker</a> 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a> 
   <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation">kind</a> or another local kubernetes distribution 
   <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">Rust toolkit</a> (Includes rustup, rustc, and cargo) 
 

 Preparing the cluster 

<p>First, you need to prepare a cluster and install Krustlet on the cluster to run WebAssembly on it. I’m using <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">kind</a> to run a local Kubernetes cluster; you can also use <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/howto/krustlet-on-minikube/">MiniKube</a>, <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/howto/krustlet-on-microk8s/">MicroK8s</a>, or <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/intro/quickstart/">another Kubernetes distribution</a>.</p>

<p>The first step is to create a cluster with the below command:</p>

   <code>kind create cluster
</code>   

<p>Now you need to bootstrap Krustlet. For this, you will need <code>kubectl</code> installed and a kubeconfig that has access to create <code>Secrets</code> in the <code>kube-system</code> namespace and can approve <code>CertificateSigningRequests</code>. You can use these <a href="https://github.com/krustlet/krustlet/tree/main/scripts">handy scripts</a> from Krustlet to download and run the appropriate setup script for your OS:</p>

   <code># Setup for Linux/macOS
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krustlet/krustlet/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | /bin/bash
</code>   

<p>Now you can install and run Krustlet.</p>

<p>Download a binary release from the <a href="https://github.com/krustlet/krustlet/releases">release page</a> and run it. Download the appropriate version for your OS.</p>

   <code># Download for Linux
curl -O https://krustlet.blob.core.windows.net/releases/krustlet-v1.0.0-alpha.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf krustlet-v1.0.0-alpha.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
# Install for Linux
KUBECONFIG=~/.krustlet/config/kubeconfig \
  ./krustlet-wasi \
  --node-ip=172.17.0.1 \
  --node-name=krustlet \
  --bootstrap-file=${HOME}/.krustlet/config/bootstrap.conf
</code>   

<p>Note: If you use Docker for Mac, the node-ip will be different. Follow <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/howto/krustlet-on-kind/#special-note-docker-desktop-for-mac">the instructions from the Krustlet docs</a> to figure out the IP. If you get the error <code>krustlet-wasi cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified</code>, you can allow it with the allow anyway button found at System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General on macOS.</p>

<p>You should see a prompt to manually approve TLS certs since the serving certs Krustlet uses must be manually approved. Open a new terminal and run the below command. The hostname will be shown in the prompt from the Krustlet server.</p>

   <code>kubectl certificate approve &lt;hostname&gt;-tls
</code>   

<p>This will be required only for the first time when you start the Krustlet. Keep the Krustlet server running. You might see some errors being logged, but let’s ignore it for now as Krustlet is still in beta, and there are some rough edges.</p>

<p>Let’s see if the node is available. Run <code>kubectl get nodes</code>, and you should see something like this:</p>

   <code>kubectl get nodes -o wide
# Output
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION         INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE       KERNEL-VERSION            CONTAINER-RUNTIME
kind-control-plane   Ready    control-plane,master   16m   v1.21.1         172.21.0.2    &lt;none&gt;        Ubuntu 21.04   5.15.12-200.fc35.x86_64   containerd://1.5.2
krustlet             Ready    &lt;none&gt;                 12m   1.0.0-alpha.1   172.17.0.1    &lt;none&gt;        &lt;unknown&gt;      &lt;unknown&gt;                 mvp
</code>   

<p>Now let’s test if the Krustlet is working as expected by applying the Wasm workload below. As you can see, we have <code>tolerations</code> defined so that this will not be scheduled on normal nodes.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hello-wasm
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hello-wasm
    image: webassembly.azurecr.io/hello-wasm:v1
  tolerations:
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: kubernetes.io/arch
    operator: Equal
    value: wasm32-wasi   # or wasm32-wasmcloud according to module target arch
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: kubernetes.io/arch
    operator: Equal
    value: wasm32-wasi
EOF
</code>   

<p>Once applied, run <code>kubectl get pods</code> as shown below, and you should see the pod running on the Krustlet node.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=krustlet
# Output
NAME                    READY   STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
hello-wasm              0/1     ExitCode:0   0          71m
</code>   

<p>Don’t worry about the status. It’s <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72020">normal</a> for a workload that terminates normally to have <code>ExitCode:0</code>. Let’s check the logs for the pod by running <code>kubectl logs</code>.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs hello-wasm
# Output
Hello, World!
</code>   

<p>You have successfully set up a Kubelet that can run Wasm workloads on your cluster.</p>

 Setting up Rust for WebAssembly 

<p>Now let us prepare an environment for WebAssembly with Rust. Make sure you are using a stable Rust version and not a nightly release.</p>

<p>First, you need to add <code>wasm32-wasi</code> target for Rust so that you can compile Rust apps to WebAssembly. Run the below command:</p>

   <code>rustup target add wasm32-wasi
</code>   

<p>Now you can create a new Rust application with Cargo.</p>

   <code>cargo new --bin rust-wasm
</code>   

<p>Open the created <code>rust-wasm</code> folder in your favorite IDE. I use Visual Studio Code with the fantastic <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb">CodeLLDB</a> plugins to develop in Rust.</p>

 Create the WebAssembly workload 

<p>Let’s write a small service that will print random cat facts on the console. For this, you could use a free public <a href="https://catfact.ninja/fact">API that provides random cat facts</a>.</p>

<p>Edit <code>cargo.toml</code> and add the following dependencies:</p>

   <code>[dependencies]
wasi-experimental-http = "0.7"
http = "0.2.5"
serde_json = "1.0.74"
env_logger = "0.9"
log = "0.4"
</code>   

<p>Then edit <code>src/main.rs</code> and add the following code:</p>

   <code>use http;
use serde_json::Value;
use std::{str, thread, time};

fn main() {
    env_logger::init();
    let url = "https://catfact.ninja/fact".to_string();
    loop {
        let req = http::request::Builder::new()
            .method(http::Method::GET)
            .uri(&amp;url)
            .header("Content-Type", "text/plain");
        let req = req.body(None).unwrap();

        log::debug!("Request: {:?}", req);

        // send request using the experimental bindings for http on wasi
        let mut res = wasi_experimental_http::request(req).expect("cannot make request");

        let response_body = res.body_read_all().unwrap();
        let response_text = str::from_utf8(&amp;response_body).unwrap().to_string();
        let headers = res.headers_get_all().unwrap();

        log::debug!("{}", res.status_code);
        log::debug!("Response: {:?} {:?}", headers, response_text);

        // parse the response to json
        let cat_fact: Value = serde_json::from_str(&amp;response_text).unwrap();

        log::info!("Cat Fact: {}", cat_fact["fact"].as_str().unwrap());

        thread::sleep(time::Duration::new(60, 0));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The code is simple. It makes a GET request to the API and parses and prints the response every 60 seconds. Now you can build this into a Wasm binary using this Cargo command:</p>

   <code>cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi
</code>   

<p>That’s it. You have successfully created a WebAssembly binary using Rust.</p>

 Run the workload locally (optional) 

<p>Let’s run the workload locally using <a href="https://wasmtime.dev">Wasmtime</a>, a small JIT-style runtime for Wasm and WASI. Since Wasmtime doesn’t support networking out of the box, we need to use the <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http#testing-using-the-wasmtime-http-binary">wrapper</a> provided by <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http">wasi-experimental-http</a>. You can build it from source using the below command.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http.git
# Build for your platform
cargo build
# move to any location that is added to your PATH variable
mv ./target/debug/wasmtime-http ~/bin/wasmtime-http
</code>   

<p>Now run the below command from the <code>rust-wasm</code> project folder:</p>

   <code>wasmtime-http target/wasm32-wasi/release/rust-wasm.wasm -a https://catfact.ninja/fact -e RUST_LOG=info
</code>   

 Run the workload in Kubernetes 

<p>Before you can run the workload in Kubernetes, you need to push the binary to a registry that supports OCI artifacts. OCI-compliant registries can be used for any OCI artifact, including Docker images, Wasm binaries, and so on. Docker Hub currently does not support OCI artifacts; hence you can use another registry like <a href="https://github.com/features/packages">GitHub Package Registry</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry">Google Artifact Registry</a>. I’ll be using GitHub Package Registry as it’s the simplest to get started, and most of you might already have a GitHub account.</p>

<p>First, you need to log in to GitHub Package Registry using <code>docker login</code>. Create a <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">personal access token on GitHub</a> with the <code>write:packages</code> scope and use that to log in to the registry.</p>

   <code>export CR_PAT=&lt;your-token&gt;
echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u &lt;Your GitHub username&gt; --password-stdin
</code>   

<p>Now you need to push your Wasm binary as an OCI artifact; for this, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/engineerd/wasm-to-oci/releases">wasm-to-oci</a> CLI. Use the below command to install it on your machine. Download the appropriate version for your OS.</p>

   <code># Install for Linux
curl -LO https://github.com/engineerd/wasm-to-oci/releases/download/v0.1.2/linux-amd64-wasm-to-oci
# move to any location that is added to your PATH variable
mv linux-amd64-wasm-to-oci ~/bin/wasm-to-oci
</code>   

<p>Now you can push the binary you built earlier to the GitHub Package Registry. Run the below command from the <code>rust-wasm</code> folder.</p>

   <code>wasm-to-oci push target/wasm32-wasi/release/rust-wasm.wasm ghcr.io/&lt;your GitHub user&gt;/rust-wasm:latest
</code>   

<p>You should see a successful message. Now check the GitHub Packages page on your profile, and you should see the artifact listed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>By default, the artifact would be private, but you need to make it public so that you can access it from the Krustlet cluster. Click the package name and click the Package settings button, scroll down, click Change visibility, and change to public.</p>

<p>You can check this by pulling the artifact using the below command:</p>

   <code>wasm-to-oci pull ghcr.io/&lt;your GitHub user&gt;/rust-wasm:latest
</code>   

<p>Yay! You have successfully pushed your first Wasm artifact to an OCI registry. Now let’s deploy this to the Kubernetes cluster you created earlier.</p>

<p>Create a YAML file, let’s say <code>k8s.yaml</code>, with the following contents:</p>

   <code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: rust-wasi-example
  labels:
    app: rust-wasi-example
  annotations:
    alpha.wasi.krustlet.dev/allowed-domains: '["https://catfact.ninja/fact"]'
    alpha.wasi.krustlet.dev/max-concurrent-requests: "42"
spec:
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  containers:
    - image: ghcr.io/&lt;your GitHub user&gt;/rust-wasm:latest
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      name: rust-wasi-example
      env:
        - name: RUST_LOG
          value: info
        - name: RUST_BACKTRACE
          value: "1"
  tolerations:
    - key: "node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable"
      operator: "Exists"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
    - key: "kubernetes.io/arch"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "wasm32-wasi"
      effect: "NoExecute"
    - key: "kubernetes.io/arch"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "wasm32-wasi"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
</code>   

<p>Note: Remember to replace <code>&lt;your GitHub user&gt;</code> with your own GitHub username.</p>

<p>The <code>annotations</code> and <code>tolerations</code> are significant. The annotations are used to allow external network calls from the krustlet, and the tolerations limit the pod to only schedule/run on Wasm nodes. We are also passing some environment variables that the application will use.</p>

<p>Now apply the manifest using the below command and check the pod status.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f k8s.yaml

kubectl get pods -o wide
# Output
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP       NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
rust-wasi-example   1/1     Running   0          6m50s   &lt;none&gt;   krustlet   &lt;none&gt;           &lt;none&gt;
</code>   

<p>You should see the Wasm workload running successfully on the Krustlet node. Let’s check the logs.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs rust-wasi-example
# Output
[2022-01-16T11:42:20Z INFO  rust_wasm] Cat Fact: Polydactyl cats (a cat with 1-2 extra toes on their paws) have this as a result of a genetic mutation. These cats are also referred to as 'Hemingway cats' because writer Ernest Hemingway reportedly owned dozens of them at his home in Key West, Florida.
[2022-01-16T11:43:21Z INFO  rust_wasm] Cat Fact: The way you treat a kitten in the early stages of its life will render its personality traits later in life.
</code>   

<p>Awesome. You have successfully created a Wasm workload using Rust and deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster without using containers.
If you’d like to take a look at this solution in full, check out the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-rust-webassembly-k8s-example">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

 So, are we ready to replace containers with WebAssembly? 

<p>WebAssembly on Kubernetes is not yet production-ready as a lot of the supporting ecosystem is still experimental, and WASI itself is still maturing. <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/towards-sockets-networking-wasi/">Networking is not yet stable</a> and the library ecosystem is only just coming along. Krustlet is also still in beta, and there is no straightforward way to run networking workloads, especially servers on it. <a href="https://wasmedge.org/">WasmEdge</a> is a more mature alternative solution for networking workloads, but it’s much more involved to set up and run than Krustlet on Kubernetes. <a href="https://wasmcloud.dev/">WasmCloud</a> is another project to keep an eye on. So, for the time being, Krustlet is suitable for running workloads for jobs and use cases involving cluster monitoring and so on. These are areas where you could use the extra performance anyway.</p>

<p>So, while Wasm on Kubernetes is exciting, and containerless on Kubernetes is definitely on the horizon. containerized applications are still the way to go for production use. This is especially true for networking workloads like microservices and web applications. But, given how fast the ecosystem is evolving, especially in the Rust + Wasm + WASI space, soon I expect we will be able to use Wasm workloads on Kubernetes for production.</p>

 🌎⚠️🔒 VaultAlert.net — Always know your crypto assets are&nbsp;safe  <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert.net</a> is a brand new service for the Verus ecosystem. Every user who set up the secure VerusID Vault can now check its status from anywhere in the&nbsp;world.  VerusID Vault: A secure place for your crypto&nbsp;assets <p>Vault is part of the <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">VerusID self-sovereign identity protocol</a>, built within the Verus multichain blockchain protocol. One of many VerusID features is that it functions as a human-readable cryptocurrency address. You can store $VRSC on your VerusID and lock them with Vault. In the future tokens and other bridged crypto-assets can also be stored and locked on a&nbsp;VerusID.</p><p>A locked VerusID can not spend, which means assets can not leave your VerusID. Even if someone has the private keys. It’s a revolutionary novel technology that will help many people from getting their crypto assets stolen. It can also be used for inheritance, trusts or vesting&nbsp;periods.</p><p>$VRSC that is locked with Vault can still stake. You can create a setup for yourself in which you won’t have to worry about your $VRSC being&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>In combination with other VerusIDs functioning as revocation and recovery authorities you can be a self-sovereign superpower. Having peace of mind and full control over your crypto assets is an incredibly powerful thing to&nbsp;have.</p> Revocation and Recovery Authorities <p>What if the private key of your VerusID is exposed? Maybe through your own fault, or a hacker that tries to steal your crypto assets. You don’t want anyone to be able to run away with your hard-earned assets. You’d want to be able to revoke access to that VerusID, so no one can do anything with the assets that are on it. And after that, you’d want to completely recover those assets into your own control. <a href="https://www.vaultalert.net/intro#RevocationAuthority">Read more here on how the revocation and recovery authorities function.</a></p> TimeLock &amp; DelayLock <p>Vault has two different options to lock your assets, TimeLock and DelayLock. You can only choose one option to lock the Vault. And the only way to circumvent a locked Vault is through revoking and recovering the&nbsp;VerusID.</p>  With TimeLock you determine how long you want the Vault to be locked. After the determined period is over the assets can be spent again. The maximum amount of time the Vault can be locked is 21&nbsp;years.  With DelayLock you determine a cooldown period. You lock the Vault and have to request an unlock. After requesting the unlock you have to wait for the determined cooldown period before the assets can be spent&nbsp;again.   VaultAlert.net <p>So how does it work? You can search for any VerusID on <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert.net</a> and it shows you all you need to know about the Vault status and&nbsp;more.</p>  LOCKED: the Vault is locked and funds can not be&nbsp;spent  UNLOCK SOON: the Vault is locked but gets unlocked within a time period of 30&nbsp;days.  NO LOCK: Vault is not active and thus funds can be&nbsp;spent.  DelayLock or&nbsp;TimeLock  Primary address: The primary address is the owner of the VerusID, as it contains the private key. It can contain more than one&nbsp;VerusID.  Identity address (also called i-address): The identity address is, next to the name, the identifier of the&nbsp;VerusID.  Revocation and recovery VerusID authorities   🌎⚠️🔒 <a href="https://www.vaultalert.net/Steal%20my%20VRSC@">Check out VaultAlert.net yourself with this example&nbsp;VerusID.</a>  Be a self-sovereign superpower <p>If you want to be at the forefront of Verus’ cutting edge technology then you should not waste any time and get yourself a VerusID for a small fee (which goes to the miners and stakers of the network). <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Download Verus Desktop</a>, or <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">join our Discord to engage with the worldwide community</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/%EF%B8%8F-vaultalert-net-always-know-your-crypto-assets-are-safe-a20b4d537c61">🌎⚠️🔒 VaultAlert.net — Always know your crypto assets are safe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Banking at the speed of now requires financial institutions to process payments quickly and maintain compliance. Today, open banking lets Financial Institutions (FIs), payment platforms and fintechs deliver payment services with the speed and ease that consumers now demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But many organizations still rely on outdated methods to process payments, forcing consumers to wait. They could and should be supporting lightning-fast, real-time payments, recurring payments, refunds and disbursements. Practices like micro-deposits and pre-notifications for account opening and funding or payment processing jam up the experience. Delays around bank account details and balance verification don’t help, either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stakes are high. According to one <a href="https://www.onespan.com/resources/cornerstone-digital-identity-verification-report">industry report</a>, twice as many consumers walk away when faced with <a href="https://www.onespan.com/resources/cornerstone-digital-identity-verification-report">slower methods</a>. “The abandonment rate for FIs that do not require micro-deposits for ACH funding is 13%–in contrast to 27% for those that do.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dissatisfied customers can overwhelm customer support channels when these methods fail. Even worse, scammers love to exploit these older practices to gain rogue access to accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter: Finicity, a Mastercard company<a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our open banking platform meets the needs of digital consumers and the digital payment ecosystem by enabling clients to verify the essential account details, owners, and balances that are needed to transfer, get paid or set up an account with confidence.</p>
<p>Digital payments just make sense. One <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">study</a> shares that close to three-quarters of consumers have or would connect their bank accounts for digital payments. In another <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2016/what-suppliers-want-checks-cards-and-ach-preferences/">survey from PYMNTS</a> of supply-side organizations, the majority (63%) said they prefer being paid electronically, specifically via ACH. Just one-quarter wanted to get paid by paper check.</p>
<p>Read more: Learn how to harness the power of open banking for secure, rapid, delivery of consumer payments –<a href="https://www.finicity.com/payment-open-banking-effect/"> Download our free eBook now!</a></p>
<p>Our platform relies on open banking innovations to support a wide range of digital payment experiences for FIs and consumers. A few popular use cases include:</p>
 
 Secure account opening and funding&nbsp; 
 Mortgage and consumer loan repayment/servicing 
 P2P money transfers 
 Direct ACH payments (P2M) 
 Funding digital wallets 
 Government disbursements 
 Recurring, account-based bill payments&nbsp; 
 Buy-Now-Pay-Later and installment-style credit 
 
 Move Money With Confidence 
<p>We designed our platform behind a driving principle: Pay Confidently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means reliably fast data and superior, API-based connections with leading financial institutions. We layered in added intelligence and deep learning which can help to mitigate fraud while reducing payment failure and pesky NSF fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each year, more of the world’s leading banks, fintechs, and payment platform providers deliver faster, more secure consumer payments with the power of open banking.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing how you’ll use open banking capabilities to exceed your customers’ expectations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously…<br><br>Staking rewards were allocated each era, but these rewards needed to be triggered in order to payout. This manual step required validators or stakers to initiate the rewards payout for each validator in each era. As soon as a validator or staker requests a payout for an era, all the stakers for that validator would receive the rewards into their accounts. </p><p>After liaising with our community and taking into account the feedback, we’ve made some changes to this process. Dock has now enabled these payments to take place automatically. </p><p>The New Process</p><p>Validators and stakers will no longer have to manually request a rewards payout. The payout will occur automatically after each era. Now validators can continue to produce blocks and validate blocks made by other validators without worrying about claiming the rewards after each era. Rewards will be paid to the winning validators and their stakers accounts after each era, automatically. </p><p>The automatic staking process also saves validators the cost of running the transactions to issue the payouts for each era. This cost will be covered by the Dock Association moving forward with funds from the Dock Treasury.</p><p>The only time the rewards payout after each era will not be automatic is when the validators commission is over 5%. If the validators commission is set to over 5%, the manual process as mentioned above will come into play. Only when the rewards payout is triggered, will the payout be made.</p><p>Start staking today and get the rewards paid to your account automatically.

<p>We had a busy fourth quarter 2021 at Northern Block working on NB Orbit, our suite of self-sovereign identity products.</p>
<p>We feel quite fortunate to be on the forefront of bringing SSI closer to mass adoption. We’re working alongside great partners and customers who have the same goal. Everything we build is to further this mission.</p>
<p>Through the NB Orbit Platform, organizations can deploy digital credentialing ecosystems, become credential issuers, accept digital credentials within workflows and use a variety of digital wallets and agents to connect and exchange credentials.</p>
<p>Note: throughout this post, when we refer to the NB Orbit Platform, we’re talking about our enterprise products (e.g., Issuer, Verifier), which you can read more about towards the end of this post</p>
<p>In this post we’ll cover some of the major items we worked on during Q4 2021 within our suite of products.</p>
 <br>
1&nbsp; B2B Interactions &amp; Credential Exchanges 
<p>Legal entities are required to be holders of credentials, just like people. We started seeing more demand for organization credentials (e.g., audit results, financial proofs, ESG credentials), so we wanted to provide a way for our customers to easily manage them through a user interface.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
We built in features on the NB Orbit Platform where a person acting on behalf of their organization can view their organization’s credentials, and interact on behalf of it with offers and proof requests. The features include:</p>
 
 Accepting connection invitations from other Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Accepting credential offers from connected Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Displaying the list of credentials stored in the cloud wallet with pagination or card layout 
 Receiving proof requests from connected Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Displaying received proof requests with pagination 
 Displaying the list of credentials available for requested proof 
 Attribute selection option while generating the proof 
 
 <br>
2&nbsp; Verified Business – Enhancements 
<p></p>
<p>With increasing compliance and AML requirements, the veracity and source of company data have become a central point in combating money laundering and other frauds. We started seeing an increasing demand from clients to validate legal entity data at source.</p>
<p>Onboarding in a self-sovereign manner to digital trust ecosystems is different than in federated models. When network operators manage a trust network and an entity connects into the network and begins transacting, it’s important to first ensure that it’s&nbsp; a verified entity, and that the claims the entity makes about itself are verified using a trusted source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enables the NB Orbit Platform to create ecosystems for trusted entities to conduct business and daily operations.</p>
 <br>
3&nbsp; Support for Multiple Verifiable Data Registries 
<p>Our customers do not want to have multiple wallets to hold their credentials. Instead they prefer to have one wallet and connect with multiple verifiable data registries from this one wallet to receive verifiable credential offers and provide proofs.</p>
<p>Therefore we added the option to select from multiple Indy-based networks on the mobile device so that it can function with other networks.</p>
<p>See below how our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a> was used to show network interoperability with the BCovrin Indy Network:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
4&nbsp; Customized Wallet Branding 
<p>Many of our customers have their existing branding that they wish to leverage for their customers, employees or vendors.</p>
<p>To enable them to provide a customized user experience to their end users, we wanted to ensure&nbsp; the process of white labeling our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet </a>was quick and easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now offer two ways to get a customized branded wallet:&nbsp;</p>
 
 We work with you to collect information we need for whitelabelling such as colour guides, assets, texts, and languages (more on the multi language support below). 
 We can provide you with a base Figma file&nbsp; and once your designs are finalized, we will quickly implement them. 
 
<p>Once assets are collected, it’s a fairly automated process from then on to have a build ready for private or public distribution via mobile app stores.</p>
<p>Below is a customer of ours, <a href="http://thrivacy.io/">Thrivacy</a>, who we worked with to quickly launch of their SSI&nbsp;Mobile Wallet &amp; Enterprise Issuer/Verifier product suite.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
5&nbsp; Multi Language Support 
<p>We now offer language selection in our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>. Being a Canadian company, it’s very important that we can offer multilingual options to Canadian citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now support two languages: English and French. We will be expanding to offer other languages based on our roadmap and needs from our partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re looking for other languages or simply to modify certain existing text copy for your branded app, the process is now extremely simple thanks to the good work put in by our wallet team to make the code modular and scalable.</p>
 6&nbsp; Verified Person – Enhancements 
<p>We use ID Proofing within our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a> for use cases where a high-level of assurance on the person is needed from a Government-issued ID perspective.</p>
<p>We added assurance to our Verified Person by including more checks and controls over the digitization process.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
7&nbsp; Digitize Any Document 
<p>There exists lots of authentic and valuable data/documents that aren’t digitally available today. Therefore, rather than waiting for various industries (source data owners/issuers) to go fully digital, we’ve decided there is a continuous need for digitization – turning physical or digital documents into machine readable data. The value of digitizing them is massive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We implemented a powerful AI-based document parser in our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>&nbsp;to support the digitization of any document with a standard structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use an AI-based algorithm that can be trained to support any structured documents.</p>
<p>The use case here is to provide attested documents without going to the attestor physically (e.g., lawyer or notary’s office). We digitized a manual process which takes a ton of time, causes friction/effort and has a cost.. With our document parser, the attestors can instead issue digital credentials remotely. Rather than a stamped seal on a document, attestors can use the NB Orbit Platform to issue cryptographic digital signatures.<br>
</p>
<p>The other value we see is that this process doesn’t have to be repeated over and over again, as verifiable credentials are reusable, once again saving cost and time.</p>
 <br>
8&nbsp; Proof Requests – Enhancements 
<p>With use cases that enable the supply of many verifiable credentials with the same schemas, it’s important that the holder can pick and choose the right verifiable credential during a proof request.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you purchased a microwave from Walmart and it’s broken – you may want to return it – and you’ll need to show your receipt credential. Or perhaps you are looking to get insurance coverage for your microwave – you will need to prove the item and purchase information to the insurer. In both of these scenarios, when the verifier asks for a proof request, you need to show your microwave credential from Walmart (issuer), rather than other credentials you have with the same schema.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We built this functionality into our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>&nbsp;to allow holders to do just that. We also worked on updates in our Mobile SDK to enable this.</p>
<p>We see this whole process as becoming more intelligent with time as smart agents become able to pull out most relevant credentials based on context, while learning over time.</p>
 <br>
9&nbsp; P2P Messaging Between Agents – Enhancements 
<p>From Kaliya’s post on <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">Understanding DIDComm</a>:</p>
<p>“If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (DID) are: they are “identifiers” or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented.”</p>
<p>Continued: “DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another. It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities, which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is, barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that DID.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIDComm messaging is such a powerful mechanism to achieve security, privacy, decentralization, and transport independence. Most messaging software today is routed through centralized servers. Although different encryption methods are used by them, there’s still an entity between yourself and the other entity you’re communicating with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wanted to give more flexibility to the multitude of use cases we are seeing by enabling chat to happen over DIDComm, independent of what role and system you’re using in the SSI trust triangle. We built in a web interface on the Enterprise Platform where organizations can now directly chat with their employees, customers, vendors, partners, etc.</p>
<p>We now support chat across these types of relationships:</p>

 10&nbsp; NB Orbit Mobile Wallet Demonstrates AIP 1.0 Compliance 
<p>As Canadian and European governments prepare to issue digital identities to their citizens (e.g., passports, driver’s licences, health cards), ensuring ownership, control and interoperability of data is paramount.</p>
<p>Northern Block has committed itself to compliance with open source projects which lead to the interoperability of verifiable credentials. In November 2021, we worked with the Digital Identity Laboratory of Canada to have them evaluate conformance of our wallet technology to the Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Profile.</p>
<p>The IDLab team conducted the testing of the NB Orbit mobile wallet on both iOS and Android devices, running testing within the IDLab’s technology environment.</p>

11&nbsp; General Platform Operation Enhancements 
<p>Lastly, in Q4 2021 we also continued enhancing general functionalities, infrastructure and security features of our product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recap on our NB Orbit suite of products:</p>
 
 NB Orbit Digital Wallets – store personal credentials using our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>. Store organization-related credentials in our Organizational Cloud Wallet. Maintain high-levels of assurance around identities through integrated ID proofing solutions. 
 NB Orbit Issuer – a Hyperledger Aries cloud agent and controller that can create and issue verifiable credentials.&nbsp; It can create invitations to holders to connect and to track the status of connection invites and credential offers.&nbsp; The issuer has a web interface to provide users with the controls for handling connections and credential issuances.&nbsp; 
 NB Orbit Trust Registry – a server application used to provision new issuer and verifiers.&nbsp; It handles the process to invite, authorize and orchestrate the cloud containers for each issuer and verifier on the platform. 
 NB Orbit Verifier – a Hyperledger Aries cloud agent and controller that can create proof templates and initiate proof requests. It can create invitations to holders to connect and to track the status of connection invites and proof requests. The verifier has a web interface to provide users with the controls to handle connections and credential verifications. 
 NB Orbit Verifiable Data Registry – a Hyperledger Indy network running four nodes.&nbsp; It is used to hold credential schemas and definitions as well as the DID Documents for the public DIDs of the issuers and verifiers.&nbsp; The DID Documents contain information such as the public key and endpoints of the issuers and verifiers.&nbsp; No data pertaining to the holders is ever stored in this network. Alongside this, we also run a revocation registry – a cryptographic tails files store that provides credentials issued based on a credential definition to be revoked.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 NB Orbit Mediator – a store and forward system that provides the mobile wallets with a static endpoint. Mobile devices are not guaranteed to be available online when a cloud agent needs to communicate with them.&nbsp; The mediator acts as an answering machine for the mobile wallet and will forward on the encrypted messages it has received when the mobile device is back online.

<p>I hope this summary was helpful for everyone who’s reading.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we’ll aim to keep you updated every few months.</p>
<p>Now, back to building!</p>

 The Sovereign Yidindji Government (SYG) has issued and deployed the Sovereign Yidindji Dollar successfully using MetaMUI Identity-based Blockchain Sovereign Yidindji has successfully issued their own Central Bank Digital Currency(CBDC) <br>“Sovereign Yidindji Dollar” on top of MetaMUI Blockchain<p>After more than half a year of intense collaboration between Sovereign Yidindji Government(SYG) and MetaMUI, the team had successfully issued a fully functioning Central Bank Digital Currency using the revolutionary technology of MetaMUI, the world’s first Identity-based Blockchain.</p><p>While hundreds of CBCD projects are cropping up around the world, most projects are still at the research or Proof of Concept stage. Only a few, such as ‘Sand Dollar’ in the Bahamas, and ‘e-Naira’ in Nigeria, have launched CBCD so far. Yidinji Dollar has four distinctive features which differentiate it from&nbsp;others.</p><p>● Yidindji Dollar is the first Central Bank Digital Currency issued by the “CBDC Issuance Platform.”<br>● Yidindji Dollar was issued only in digital currency without any paper bills.<br>● A new payment system connected with MetaMUI’s SSID system is used in all retail stores and government offices. Payment can be processed without using the dedicated network, there is no transaction fee, sales settlement is done immediately, and cross-border payment can be made without using Visa or Mastercard.<br>● It is a convertible currency whose collateral assets are gold and silver and other minerals and natural resources such as green and blue carbon. Money issuance, backed by a digital certificate, is also backed with collateral assets. Convertible currencies ended in 1971 when President Nixon stopped the exchange between the dollar and gold. It is the first convertible currency since Nixon and the first digital currency.</p><p>MetaMUI is the first identity-based token blockchain that combines the concept of self-sovereign identity and decentralized blockchain. Self-sovereign identity is a decentralized identity that protects users’ privacy. It avoids the problem of centralized censorship and the abuse of private information. The Sovereign Yidindji Government has already built the national identity system utilizing MetaMUI’s technology. Therefore every Yidjindji citizen, Yidindji company, and Yidindji organization can create their own digital identity, own various digital assets, and make payment with Yidindji&nbsp;Dollar.</p><p>“Yidindji is the first nation to choose MetaMUI’s CBDC platform. MetaMUI platform allows any country to publish the state-of-the-art CBDC within a few days at a fraction of the cost. MetaMUI platform also provides a single integrated solution for national identity, e-Government, peer-to-peer payment, digital certificates, and cross-border payment.” said Phantom Seokgu Yun, CEO of&nbsp;MetaMUI.</p><p>“The benefits of central bank digital currencies are profound, and it is only a matter of time before they are implemented by countries around the world,” said Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute. “But they need to be done right to safeguard citizen privacy and to interoperate around the world. I am delighted to see this technology used to build a more sustainable future for the people of the Sovereign Yidindji Government in Australia.”</p><p>Loretta Joseph, an advisor of MetMUI, who connected with the Sovereign Yidindji Government, said, “I am very excited for the oldest civilization to adapt to the 21st century by embracing technology and change for a more inclusive and better&nbsp;world”.</p><p>The Sovereign Yidindji Government is an Aboriginal Australian micronation, and its territory is home to some of the world’s most pristine rainforests. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>“‘Gayaburra galin nyundu’ With the blessing of Yeshua Hamashiach, the Yidindji nation is becoming a fully digitized nation, thanks to MetaMUI revolutionary technology we made a leapfrog towards the future. The Yidindji reserve currency will stabilise and add security, it will also ensure credibility to the global economy and financial system. Yidindji’s participation not only makes sense being logical, but it is also inevitable. The world is now ready for the indigenous peoples to underwrite a new future.” said Gudju-Gudju Gimuybara, Chief Minister of&nbsp;SYG.</p> About Yidindji <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qjX1OysGbk4">Yidindji people</a> are a rainforest-based society with several clan groups in the area described as far north Queensland on the Australian continent. The Yidindji territory is home to some of the world’s most pristine rainforests and is an essential gateway to the great barrier reef. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the planet. In 2014, history was made on September 20 as the official government of the Yidindji nation came into life with the launch of its coat of arms. Since then, the SYG, as it is known, has created several departments, and its parliament continues to pass laws for the peace, order, and good governance of the Yidindji territory. SYG has 17 ministers and 22 ministries and plans to be the first government to become entirely digitized in its venture towards e-governance.</p> About MetaMUI <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-W5nwN9dMU">MetaMUI</a> is the first identity-based token blockchain. The design approach of MetaMUI is opposite to most cryptocurrencies and other anonymous token blockchains. In contrast, most token technologies follow the anonymous token design of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc. MetaMUI chose to redesign the blockchain structure based on identity entirely. The main reason for this is to satisfy the regulatory framework of current financial systems such as FATF’s travel&nbsp;rule.</p><p>[SOVEREIGN WALLET NETWORK ‘SWN’] is the genius behind the development of the MetaMUI identity-based blockchain. The Sovereign Wallet Network (SWN) has redesigned the blockchain and developed the MetaMUI blockchain. We are proud to provide the state-of-the-art 4th generation blockchain with a mainnet launched on January 3, 2021. The Sovereign Wallet is located in six (6) different countries globally, with headquarters in Singapore and offices in Korea, Sweden, the United States, India, and Uzbekistan. The MetaMUI blockchain is paving the way towards building the Internet of Sovereign Digital Currencies (IoSDC). The company’s website at MetaMUI-SovereignWallet contains additional information.</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Have you entered a password somewhere today? Do you wonder why you’re still having to do that? Did entering that password give you a feeling of digital safety? Did it make your consumer experience more enjoyable?</p>
<p>Cybersecurity and identity management experts have been proclaiming the benefits of and absolute necessity of Multifactor Authentication (MFA) and risk-adaptive authentication for years now.&nbsp; MFA is the leading concept for implementing strong authentication, which is defined as the combination of two or more of the following: something you know, something you have, or something you are. Indeed, you won’t hear anyone in the field deny that MFA and risk-adaptive authentication are two of the best ways to reduce cybercrime and fraud, particularly account takeover (ATO) fraud. But we enter passwords every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every. Single. Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn’t improve security, and it doesn’t make for a pleasant user experience. So why are we still doing it?&nbsp;</p>
 
 Security and user satisfaction are just not high enough priorities in some organizations yet&nbsp; 
 
<p>That’s it, there’s no need for a second bullet point. Here are some common retorts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Security and user satisfaction are important to our org, but we don’t have the budget.” Find the budget. Authentication system and service upgrades are not as expensive as you may think. The offset against potential fraud risks, especially in certain sectors, can be demonstrated to pay for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We haven’t had any security incidents tied to password breaches.”&nbsp; Are you sure? Even if that’s true, it’s only a matter of time before it does happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re a small business, the big cybercriminals aren’t targeting us.” The days when big global brands and big banks were exclusively targeted are gone. If your organization has something of value or processes transactions of any kind, then it is likely already on the radar of cybercriminals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have legacy Line of Business (LOB) applications that don’t interoperate with identity and authentication standards.”&nbsp; Admittedly, this is a tougher issue. Most IAM and IDaaS authentication services allow for customization to address compatibility for older applications. It’s probably harder to integrate old apps, but not impossible. Moreover, legacy LOB apps often reside on unsupported operating systems which are more vulnerable to exploits. A project to upgrade authentication may have additional security benefits if legacy apps on out-of-service OSes can be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Users are used to entering passwords.” That may be true, but it doesn’t mean we like doing it. Many of us know that passwords are weak security. It makes us wonder what else you’re doing wrong. When security conscious users enter passwords into websites or mobile apps, we doubt that those organizations are committed to the security of our information and finances. Repeated entering of passwords leads to reduced trust in the organization asking for passwords. Erosion of trust leads to diminishing customer loyalty, lost business, and shrinking revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insecurity leads to doubt, doubt leads to mistrust, and mistrust leads to the dark downside of lost business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of us have been waiting for years for the promise of passwordless authentication. IAM vendors typically define passwordless as removing password databases from centralized systems, thereby improving security by reducing the likelihood of password breaches. Mobile phone-based biometrics and FIDO are good examples of passwordless authentication. It’s important to note that although password databases may be omitted in passwordless authentication systems, users may still have to enter passwords or PINs occasionally, but those factors are evaluated locally on the users’ devices.&nbsp; We have, however, fortunately observed that the number of completely passwordless solutions in the market is increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, thanks to many excellent authentication solutions and services available in the market, it’s never been easier for organizations that still use traditional passwords with centralized databases to move away from them. For more information on authentication solutions, see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research?q=authentication&amp;f=&amp;ref=eic22blogjohn" title="KuppingerCole Research">KuppingerCole Research</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can’t get to fully passwordless, we’ll settle for password-fewer. Password authentication can be augmented by risk analysis. Many sites that still appear to use passwords are actually doing sophisticated examination of many attributes in the background. This is what social media, some big retailers, and other forward-looking organizations are doing. Their users have passwords “on file” but rarely have to use them because of the advanced risk analysis that going on behind the scenes. Examples of contextual information considered includes device intelligence, IP address (history and reputation), browser attributes, geo-location of request, time/day, etc. All these data points can be compared at transaction time to a per-user historical baseline. In cases like this, the password is the fallback. If the risk analysis concludes that the request context is within acceptable parameters, the user doesn’t get prompted to re-enter a password, get an email/SMS OTP, etc. It’s smooth surfing. Only if the risk analysis shows a significant deviation would the user be asked to explicitly demonstrate they are who they say they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unobtrusive nature of risk-adaptive / password-fewer authentication is a win-win for those who deploy it: they reduce their own risks of loss from fraud while providing a better experience for their customers. Happy customers mean repeat business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of all, MFA and risk-adaptive authentication can go hand-in-hand. Risk-adaptive authentication systems can leverage MFA methods for those cases where they do sense something is amiss in the request context and need to re-authenticate or step-up authentication for certain types of transactions. Mobile push notifications, mobile biometrics, and FIDO authenticators improve usability and security concomitantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than continuing to wait on the organizations we interact with to update their authentication systems, how do we move forward?&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ask. Use available contact methods such as emailing support or chat options. At least requests are registered. Honestly this method has not met with much success.&nbsp; 
 Ask more formally. Contact CISOs of organizations that use weak authentication and respectfully request that they implement MFA and risk-based authentication to reduce their risk and protect your information and assets better. Consider having an attorney send a letter on your behalf. If the organization in question does not have a CISO, find contacts for their legal counsel, CIO, CTO, or another high-level position that has the power to make positive changes.&nbsp; 
 Look for more secure alternatives in the marketplace. If you feel that your info and assets are not being properly protected by the service providers you are currently doing business with, then look for those that do offer the kind of security that you need.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It’s time for consumers to make their concerns and desires for a more secure ecommerce ecosystem known. Join us at EIC in Berlin in May for a vibrant discussion on the latest authentication technologies and how implementing them can protect organizations, consumers, and improve business.&nbsp;</p>

 Highlights <p>In the face of the upcoming Metaverse revolution, DID has demonstrated its powerful utility: it will serve as the entrance to the Metaverse and carry the user’s trusted identity and privacy data. Therefore, we need mature DID technology for the underlying infrastructure. Ontology has been working in the DID industry for several years and has gradually reached different partnerships around the world. At the same time, ONTO, a DID-based gateway for a seamless Web3 experience, will continue to expand its multi-chain asset and dApp support, to promote the development of the Metaverse.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet. Developers are welcome to conduct various tests. Related documents can be obtained at the <a href="https://docs.ont.io/">Ontology Developer Center</a>.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the ONT and ONG decimals and we are 86% done with&nbsp;testing.

Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1484246853189193729?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “how to make the blockchain acceptable”. The Ontology community believed that in order to be accepted by the mainstream, it is necessary to guide the positive development of the blockchain industry and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent incidents. A reputation system based on DID will be one of the solutions. When everyone’s reputation is linked to their behavior, and data cannot be tampered with, people need to carefully maintain their reputation.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about why Ontology chose to set up an office in Berlin, Germany, and its positive impact. By opening the new office in Berlin, Ontology is excited to contribute to the continent’s ongoing efforts to create a more secure web. Benny also shared the upcoming Valentine’s Day event, community members said that they will definitely participate in this romantic and meaningful event.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.

It has redefined how technology should function and what it means to create value and utility. As the world continues to teeter on the brink of chaos because of the uneven distribution of resources and center-oriented control, Web3 technologies provide a way out.&nbsp;”</p><p>In the end, there will not be a single blockchain, but rather a collection of different chains, each with their own characteristics, benefits, and subcultures. Whilst there will be competition, there is also tremendous opportunity for collaboration for the benefit of the overall ecosystem and user experience. Ontology will continue to optimize deeper product integrations across different blockchains. With a focus on DID and data, users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and welcome to a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity in this new year, 2022. And we have, after some time, again, our friends of the Open Identity Exchange. And today, our guest is Nick Mothershaw. He is the Chief Identity Strategist at the Open Identity Exchange, a community for all those involved in the identity sector to connect and collaborate.</p>
<p>Nick has expert knowledge of Identity and Fraud techniques, solutions and standards across a wide variety of different sectors and jurisdictions. Nick was previously Director of Identity and Fraud at Experian, where he was responsible for the development of Experian’s fraud and identity solutions for both the public and private sectors. Nick led Experian’s development, launch and operation of a full “Identity as a Service” solution, which was the first live example of a digital identity being seamlessly interoperable across public and private sector.</p>
<p>Hello, Nick.</p>
<p>Nick Mothershaw: Hello, Oscar. Hello.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s great having you, Nick.</p>
<p>Nick: It’s a pleasure to be here. And yeah, Happy New Year to you and all your listeners, very exciting to be at the start of 2022, which I think it’s going to be an amazing and transformational year for digital identity. So this is a really timely conversation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And I know you have new things to tell us. So yeah, Nick, let’s talk about digital identity. But I’d like to start hearing a bit more about yourself, so please tell us about your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, it’s been a long journey now. So I was originally involved in, I guess, in identity when I worked with law enforcement, providing crime management and intelligence management systems. And after that, we started looking at biometrics. So around the year 2000, we were using biometrics to help identify criminals from group photographs and also using facial mapping to look at, where we used to use these E-FITs, these faces that were being drawn by computer that were put out on things like crime watch programmes, so we’re using facial biometrics to match those two databases of known and suspected criminals. And that was way back in 2000.</p>
<p>So from there, I moved to look more in detail at fraud and around identity fraud, specifically, and how can identity fraud be detected and prevented. So using algorithms, anomaly detection, graph-based analysis to bind identity fraud in the finance ecosystem initially, and then into insurance and telcos.</p>
<p>And the flip side of that is, of course, identity. So if you strongly identify the individual, the risk of fraud is reduced. So this fraud and identity became two sides of the same coin. And as we put our business, Experian, around fraud and identity, we both evolved the fraud solutions to be more and more sophisticated, but also involved the identity side of the coin, to leverage data that can prove to the individual’s identity to scan documents, to bring those together into complete Identity-as-a-Service management.</p>
<p>So around 2015, we built an Identity-as-a-Service platform. And that enabled us to identify end users both of Experian systems and, in the UK, Gov.Uk Verify users. So we were able to take users through a proofing process using data, using passports and driving licenses, using – getting payments into open banking, with PINs on. And that enabled us to strongly proof an individual.</p>
<p>And alongside that we ran all the fraud controls we created as well. So we mitigated against identity fraud to create a really strongly trusted ID. There was a reusable ID, and users could use the identity to both log on to Experian’s credit management systems, credit reference systems and also in the UK, log onto government systems through the Gov.UK Verify framework. So we were the only identity provider who did that – had both a public-private interoperable login for users, which meant I only had to have one password, only one set of credentials, to access multiple different services at a high level of trust. So we’re really proud that we built that and that was delivered into UK Verify.</p>
<p>As part of that, I got involved in the Open Identity Exchange. So I was Vice Chair for a while and then became Chair. And then just over two years ago now, I decided I wanted to spend all of my time driving forward this vision of digital identity so that we could all have a digital ID that is trusted, that is accepted ubiquitously and our lives, our digital lives are made so much easier because our trusted information is available, it’s controlled by us, and is shareable by us to those who need to understand who we are and what we’re eligible to do for different use cases, different services all over the world. I really strongly believe in that vision and joined OIX as Chief Identity Strategist, so just over two years ago now to help OIX, as a members’ body, to help its members collectively pursue and achieve that vision.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, fantastic experience you had in Experian. That sounds quite exciting what you were doing there. And also, now I can hear your motivation to work here in OIX. Excellent.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned earlier, we had before, around a bit more than two years ago, we had in this podcast show and at that time, it was <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/don-thibeau-openid-foundation/" title="Don Thibeau">Don Thibeau</a> representing the OIX. And he was talking about the need for a global approach to identity. And he also has mentioned a little bit of that. But something that came to, I think everybody who is involved in the digital identity space in the last months has been the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/global-assured-identity-network-gain-elizabeth-garber/" title="GAIN">GAIN</a> white paper. And we know that both OIX and I think also yourself have been involved in that. So could you tell us a bit about that? What is the OIX’s role within GAIN?</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, absolutely. So GAIN, Global Assured Identity Network, was a white paper that was released back in September, and was created over the summer. In the end, over 150 different authors put their name to that paper. And the vision was that – lots of people shared the vision, I’ve just articulated. This vision that an identity can be used in an interoperable way and that will work internationally. So 150 plus people, all sharing that vision, put their name to that paper.</p>
<p>The paper was collectively created; fortunately a few people held the pen, not 150, or else it would never have come. We’d never have got anything coherent out. We mostly created a collective paper that had the backing of 154 people, I think it was in the end, they all shared that same vision. And that vision is that an ID can be accepted anywhere around the globe. And that’s a massively ambitious statement. And to do that, the GAIN term was coined, the Global Assured Identity Network. To make that possible, there needs to be some kind of network on a global basis and that that work enables trust, to the number of different elements of GAIN.</p>
<p>So we released the paper, and then five organisations have kind of rallied around that vision, taking different parts and delivering it. So firstly, on the technical side, the Open Identity Foundation, the foundation is looking at OK, how do that vision achieve technically? How can we communicate trust from one domain to another, from one framework to another, from one country to another? And they’re looking at the different technical rails of how that makes possible.</p>
<p>OIX is looking at the legal, the operational, the governance elements that would sit above that technical layer. And arguably, and my other colleagues sometimes say that this is true, that’s the harder bit. So we can communicate some information about an individual. But what does that information mean? And I’ll come back to that in a minute. And that’s one of the key challenges OIX is looking at.</p>
<p>The other organisations involved in it are <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/">GLEIF</a>, Global Legal Entity Identity Foundation. So wherever we’ve got a legal actor in here, an organisation, GLEIF have a role to play in identifying who that organisation is, both in terms of parties providing information, but also consuming information and being the identity asserters themselves where it’s an organisational ID.</p>
<p>For the Cloud Signature Consortium, because this links closely into digital signing, digital signatures. And once we know who the user is, we want to legally enter into a relationship with them in many use cases.</p>
<p>And then the International Institute of Finance is looking at how, across the finance community, how can that community both be involved as consumers of identities – because finance is a key area we need to prove who you are – but also providers of identities. In many countries already in the Nordics, in Canada, we’ve got banks playing the role of identity providers, and that’s likely to happen in a lot of other countries. So IIF are playing that dual role of representing identity consuming community and providing community.</p>
<p>So these five organisations have now come together to drive GAIN forward. And so OIX’s focus area is the, as we term it, the trust framework element. So let’s imagine that I can communicate information about an individual. So that individual has a Belgian ID, for instance. And they’re trying to assert their identity in Indonesia. So I can tell that the relying party in Indonesia, who the person is. I can give them the name, the address, the date of birth, the national ID number, maybe, to identify who they are, which is relevant in Belgium, that means nothing in Indonesia. I can tell who the identity provider is that has provided that information. I tell them the standard to which that identity was proofed, which might be eIDAS substantial, for instance. And I can tell them the framework that it was done in – so it was done in eIDAS. So I can give a lot and I can communicate all of that information pretty simply in a technical package of data.</p>
<p>But the key question is what does all that mean? So can this relying party, let’s say it’s a bank in Indonesia, trust a Belgian ID? The Belgian ID is issued under this thing called eIDAS and has a level of assurance ‘substantial’. What does that mean? And how does that map into any Indonesian trust framework and rules that that relying party is subject to? How does it map into any finance rules they have that’s replicable for anti-money laundering?</p>
<p>So, they can only accept that ID if they know a lot more about the framework that is behind the information. And that’s OIX’s role to work out how do we explain the information about each framework? And how do we assess framework and interoperability, because what we’re really looking at there is the Belgian ID is operating under a framework. There’s a framework in Indonesia that dictates how ID needs to be assessed, managed, scored, levels of assurance, assessments in Indonesia. Are those two things compatible? So can that Indonesian relying party accept a Belgian-issued identity?</p>
<p>To do that, we think we need some kind of global interoperability framework. So we can take those two different frameworks in two different jurisdictions, and assess where they align, where they differ. And where they do differ, work out what those differences are, and work out how those differences can be mitigated. And is that by further alignment, by step up, by legal agreements? And to do that, we think we need a global interoperability framework, a meta framework, a framework of frameworks to compare frameworks to.</p>
<p>So, one of the things we’re going to be working on in our new global interoperability Working Group, which is kicking off on the 31st of January, is exploring precisely that question, how do we get two frameworks to interoperate? And that leaves the question of how do we get many frameworks to interoperate, which is why we think we need this global interoperability, this meta framework that sits across the top to make this happen.</p>
<p>And on top of that, we’ll be exploring how might that be governed? So how might that be done in a way that is independent, a lot of these frameworks will be government-driven, so enables government-to-government frameworks to communicate and strike agreements internationally with each other, without having to have lots of bilateral agreements from government to government, because that will take forever. That would be like doing trade agreements with every single country bilaterally, that doesn’t work. People do trade agreements in blocks, we need to leap beyond that to that entity to do identity trust agreements on a global basis. Let’s get this right, first time around.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see. So, a very good example you gave with two quite distant countries, Belgium and Indonesia, for example. And I get the idea that in different jurisdictions there are trust frameworks, but what is needed, the missing piece, is that global interoperable trust framework, and that is the – that is a piece that your team at the OIX is working right now. And both as part of the GAIN, the implementation of GAIN, but also I think this global interoperable trust framework is meant to be used also anywhere it can be used, correct?</p>
<p>Nick: Oh, absolutely. Yes, yes. So this is so – we already have a framework, which is intended as a global guide to frameworks at the moment. So you can come along to the OIX website, www.oix – sorry, <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">http://www.openidentityexchange[in full].com</a>. And on there is our <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/guide-trust-frameworks-interoperability">guide to trust frameworks</a>. And that details the contents of a trust framework, and it’s already there as a guide for those who need to understand what a trust framework is, what should be in it, and how to create it. So we already have that, so that’s been published a couple of years. That builds on the work we’ve done over the last 10 years around defining what a trust framework is. So that’s out there. We’re about to update that with the 2022 version, which I’ll talk about in a moment.</p>
<p>So the work we’re doing with GAIN is really taking that framework model we’ve got, and then using that to reason about how frameworks can interoperate. And from that, we expect to distil that there are key elements of a framework that are required for interoperability. And that’s where the term global interoperability framework is starting to come from. A lot of the things in our guide, they’re all important. But when you ask the interoperability question across frameworks, some are more important than others. And that’s the work we’re about to do with the GAIN initiative, to make that assessment. Whatever conclusions we reach there, again, conclusions are done where the Open Identity Exchange will be publishing our findings in an open way. And that framework would be able to be used by GAIN and the others looking to achieve the same objectives.</p>
<p>Our framework, though, our new framework that’s coming out, the trust framework 2022 is a massive evolution from the one that was previously published. One of the things we’ve done is taking a look at the way the markets moved over the past, I mean five years really, but in particular, since COVID, and that has emphasised the need for user-centric identity. We’ve seen a lot of self-sovereign based identities, verifiable credentials being used now to communicate the COVID certificates. We’ve seen the emergence of mobile driving licenses as a particular credential, digitised credential that can be gained by the user and put in a wallet and shared with others.</p>
<p>So we’ve moved our framework on to make sure it’s fully embracing of user-centric, self-sovereign identity. And we’ve changed some of the terminology. So we’ve moved to use, heavily use the term ‘credential’. So we talked about digitised credentials and derived credentials, that the digital identity, which could be a wallet, helps the user manage, gather, and manage those credentials and share them with others. So we’ve kind of taken a bit of a shift in our positioning and philosophy but we are remaining technology agnostic in that shift that we’ve made.</p>
<p>The other thing that we have really baked into that new version of the framework is that we see a digital identity is going to be useful for the user. If we just simply collect a set of digitised real-world credentials in a digital wallet- So if I end up with a wallet on my phone that’s got my passport and my driving license in it and my COVID certificate, that’s digitised some real-world credentials, documents, and given me them in an electronic form. That’s a great step forward.</p>
<p>But what the digital identity needs to do is really help the user in that process of both gathering that information, and more importantly, collating it to present to relying parties in a way that meets the rules of the relying party. So what you’ll see in our new trust framework, when it comes out, is an emphasis on a digital identity being able to understand the rules of the relying parties, the organisations that need to consume identity, and eligibility information, because we classed something like COVID information as eligibility information, and the digital identity can take those rules, and then work out, does the user have what they need to meet those rules?</p>
<p>So if it’s a question about, is the user COVID safe? What does COVID safe mean in this context? What is that question that’s being asked? Because COVID safe, COVID secure means different things, depending on who’s asking the question. If it’s a government wanting to let you into the country, versus a bar wanting to admit you to have some drinks, it’s a very different question. And everybody’s rules are different.</p>
<p>So the digital identity’s got to help the user through that process. It’s got to accept the request from the airline that saying, “Well, if you’re going to board me, you’ve got to be COVID safe. These are the rules. This is what I mean, by COVID safe. I mean, you’ve got to have a vaccine. And the vaccine has got to be one of these types. And you’ve got to have had a complete course of two vaccines. And it’s got to have been done with the last 14 days. And I mean, you’ve got to have a test. And that test has got to be completed in the last 24 hours. And it’s of this type, and it’s from one of these certified providers.”</p>
<p>So all of those rules, complex rules, the digital identity needs to help the user through. It needs to be intelligent, so that it can accept the request from the relying party, it can work out, well, yeah, the user’s have got the vaccine they need, that’s great. But they haven’t got the test that they need. So they need to go and get a test. So where can they go and get that test – it needs to help them through that process. It’s got to be intelligent. So you’ll start to hear us talking a lot about intelligent digital identity. And that that is going to be key to digital identity being a success.</p>
<p>Oscar: What is that intelligence – where it relies, in the application? Or…</p>
<p>Nick: So, from the user’s perspective, it needs to look to them as though it’s simply their digital identity is doing this for them. Technically, where does that sit? There are a number of options. So, if I’ve got a digital identity that’s cloud-based, or wallet-based, as part of the provision of that digital identity in the cloud, or in the wallet, that intelligence can be built in. So we’re talking there about an intelligent wallet, or an intelligent digital identity, where it has a rules engine in it.</p>
<p>So within our framework now, we’ve made it that a rules engine being present, that can interpret the rules and can work out how to answer the questions. And that can either be embedded in the wallet, or we’re talking about concepts of a rules agent. So where you can have a wallet, which is the thing that collects the information and collects derived information, and a rules agent who does the intelligent bit. So it’s the rules agent who takes the rules around being COVID safe, understands those, works out what credentials the user’s already got, helps the user get the ones that haven’t, and then derives the COVID safe status as a derived credential, enables the wallet to pass that on to the relying party.</p>
<p>So we see it’s very much as either it can all be in one intelligent digital identity, or it can be in a digital identity leveraging intelligent rules agents to achieve that goal. And again, the new framework paints both of those options as being completely valid.</p>
<p>Oscar: And all this is defined in the trust framework. That sounds powerful, I would say.</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, we tried to make it as consumable as possible. So, at OIX, we’ve got the section on the guide, and we break the framework guide down into sections so it’s more easily consumable. So there’s a guide in there, really to what is a digital ID and how does it manage these credentials and gather them? How does it derive credentials like COVID safe from core credentials, like vaccines and tests? And then we dive into rules around things like identity assurance. Again, what are the rules around determining a level of assurance for an individual if that is required.</p>
<p>And most frameworks work on some kind of level of assurance, you’ve got low, substantial, high. In eIDAS, you’ve got low, medium, high. In the UK, you’ve got IALs and NIST… So when you get to that level of trust, and you’ve got a pre canned definitions of levels of trust, it gets quite complicated. So it’s really, there’s a whole section on that around identity assurance and how that is achieved.</p>
<p>Below the guide itself are more detailed guides. So we have a separate guide on identity assurance and authentication. We have separate guides on trust marks and how you mark, create and market a trust mark. We have guides on principles just to think, few things you should think about when creating principles. We’ve got another new guide coming out in February on everything that happens when something goes wrong. So from Help Desk to compensation, how should a digital identity ecosystem deal with those unhappy paths, and make sure all users have a good experience despite difficulties they may encounter?</p>
<p>And we also have a guide to fraud controls as well, which enables people creating identity ecosystems to understand. Unfortunately, digital identity will be targeted by fraudsters. It will become a honeypot, we’ve got to build the right flow controls at day one. So the overarching guide is really- there’s 25 different elements of the trust framework, what we’re doing is drilling into those 25 elements with more guides. There won’t be 25 of them, because we drill into several elements at once in a single guide. But we’re probably about halfway through in writing a full guide to digital identity. But the framework itself is complete and contains everything you need to do to create successful and trusted digital identities.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, it sounds very powerful as I said. And if I may, what is the ultimate name, the official name of this new trust framework?</p>
<p>Nick: The official name is OIX Trust Framework 2022. It’s the year, is the new version. So it will be launched on I’d say February the 3rd, we are planning a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/oix-2022-trust-framework-launch-tickets-245784777887">launch event</a>. So for those of you who are OIX members, or if you sort of follow on the OIX website, there’ll be a launch event coming up early next week for you to come along and hear more about what’s in that framework and why we’ve done it and the intent behind making sure we’ve got intelligent digital IDs, not just collections of stuff in a wallet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, I’m asking because people can easily find it. And also, to dig a bit more on the details of the actual work you’re doing. So, who it’s being created for, who should read this, this work that you are going to release?</p>
<p>Nick: So, it’s aimed at multiple audiences. And we also just announced from it, other information that is relevant to relying parties. So the overarching framework guide itself – if you were to want to write a framework from scratch, it contains everything you need to enable you to do that, and to understand what needs to be in a trust framework. There’s no other global guide that does that, that tells you what is a trust framework and what’s in it and how should it be governed? So that enables those creating trust frameworks to create them and evolve them. And you know, we’re hoping with the new version is people who’ve already got trust frameworks will look at the new version and say, “Yeah, we need to evolve our existing framework to move towards this provision of intelligent digital ID.”</p>
<p>And it enables those creating self-sovereign identities to understand how that identity would fit into a trust framework. And we are talking with the Trust Over IP Foundation about a partnership where the work they do and the work OIX do is more closely aligned. So hopefully more on that as we move further into 2022. It’s designed to explain trust frameworks to identity providers who might need to go and get certified and approved into a trust framework. And we distil from it a version that enables relying parties, organisations who consume trust frameworks, to also understand what a digital identity is.</p>
<p>However, they need a simpler view of the world. They’re interested in the bits that are relevant to them. So we have a separate guide called <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/networks/87/item.html?id=503">Getting Ready for Digital ID</a> that positions what a digital ID is, why it should be intelligent, and what a framework does, in the context of a relying party that was launched back in October, and it’s available on the website now. So it’s designed to kind of multi– I mean their readership isn’t designed for its end users, really, but it’s relevant to the rest of the ID ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. That concept that you mentioned the intelligent ID that definitely intrigued me. I have to go and read that part at least and to know more. Sounds really powerful.</p>
<p>Nick: And what we’re going to use it for now. And this has always been our vision, is going back to what we’re doing on GAIN around global interoperability. So, having written it, brought it up to date, republished it, it now gives us the framework to start assessing global interoperability, and there’s already a section in it which talks about key elements for global interoperability. And we’re going to build out from that section and drill into the items we’ve highlighted in there to work out how do we create a framework that specifically enables interoperability. So enables us to do that and do that in a way that the terminology is consistent.</p>
<p>We’ve got a published benchmark to work from, because everyone’s– as frameworks have been written over the last, I guess, 10 years, OIX is proud to have influenced how a lot of them have been written, but it’s been evolutionary. So they’re all slightly different. And they’re all slightly different terms and structured things in slightly different ways. If we’re going to compare them and make them interoperable, we need something that’s standard to do that. And then so we would use the trust framework 2022 as that start point.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Makes a lot of sense. Anything else about this trust framework that you would like to share that we have not covered?</p>
<p>Nick: I think there’s a couple of things that we’re throwing out that are new. So, they move through the term credential. It does talk about these two things, digitise credentials and derived credentials. And that’s quite new. We’ve done a lot of work on this, a lot of thinking about what will those two terms mean.</p>
<p>So a digitised credential, we mean a digital version of a real-world thing like passport or driving license, a COVID vaccine, an education certificate. So these are the things that the self-sovereign world has been digitising, and is digitising. So they become part of a digital identity available in a wallet.</p>
<p>We’ve then got the term derived credential. And what that means – if we take digitised credentials, and then we derive other things from them. That might be simply deriving the person’s over 18. But we’re positioning that as a new credential that’s been derived from those other credentials. You might be determining that a person is COVID safe, which was the example earlier. We might be determining a level of assurance for the individual. So is this person eIDAS substantial? And we also position that as a derived credential, because it’s– you need to know what credentials it came from, when it was made, or what evidence was behind it, and how long it lasts. So if you have a person that’s over 18, they’re always over 18. So that’s the long-lasting derived credential. If you work out someone’s COVID safe, they probably are for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Yeah.</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, work at a level of assurance it probably lasts months, or until something occurs that says its unsafe. So we thought it was important to have this separate type of credential, the derived credential, and it’s that those derived credentials are often the things that the relying parties need. If we’re going to do data minimisation, it’s the derived credential that data minimises the digitised credentials as they’re passed on to the relying party. So this construct digitised and derived credentials is quite key.</p>
<p>And the other thing to bring out that we’ve got is a new view on principles. So we’ve always had a user-centric view on principles in the framework. We talk about the four C’s are important for consumers, and we framed principles in terms that consumers would understand. And that’s always been really useful. But it didn’t map to more traditional principles that trust frameworks are built on. So we now got that mapping, we’ve got a set of traditional principles like data minimisation, privacy, security, and a set of user articulations on those principles around things like convenience, control, that enable a user view of the world and a ID ecosystem security, ethical view of the world to be mapped together to make sure actually, those principles are fulfilling user needs. So that’s an expanded section in the document that we’ve got at the moment.</p>
<p>We’ve also done quite a lot of work on roles. So we recognise the separate role of identity proofing provider, it’s just a specialist form of rules agent as we’ve created that in the trust framework. So all of that’s in there, as explained in the new framework. What we haven’t put in, or did debate quite a bit was the difference between centralised, decentralised and where federated fits. So we’ll be doing a subsequent piece of work in the trust framework working group to help explain those different terms of positioning to the market.</p>
<p>A lot of the questions I get from members, particularly new members are, what’s the difference between centralised, decentralised, distributed, and is federated the same as centralised? And it’s not. So we’ve done quite a bit of work on that already. It’s not ready for release just yet. But later in the year, we’ll be coming out with some views on, and hopefully clarity on, some of those terms to help the industry- to remove some industry confusion, because there’s quite a lot in the area at the moment.</p>
<p>Everything we do is members-driven, member-driven, so the need for clarity there is something our members are saying “Yeah, can you please sort this out and tell us properly what does distributed versus decentralised mean? Are they the same thing or different?” So that’s something we’re working on at the moment. So that’s something to watch out for. And you know, if you want to get involved in OIX, you can play a part in a definition of those, as well as the other things we’re working on around global interoperability. And we have a whole host of other working groups we’re just kicking off or continuing into 2022.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, this Trust Framework 2022 sounds super interesting. We’ll be following for sure. One more question for you, Nick. For all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Nick: So if you’re a business leader who is a consumer of an identity, a relying party, so if you, today, you run your own identity ecosystem to ID your customers, and are looking at moving to digital identity, then I would encourage you to start seriously thinking about getting ready for that now. Our getting ready paper is designed to help you understand what digital identity is all about, the benefits you’ll get as a business and what you should be looking for. And what you should be looking for is identity that comes from a trust framework, so that it has all the right rules, procedures, etc., around it that you can trust.</p>
<p>So a key thing we want at OIX is to try to help get that market going and help people understand what digital identity is. So if you’re a business leader in the relying party, please do have a look at that document and it’ll tell you a lot more about digital identity and what you should be looking for.</p>
<p>If you’re a business leader in the identity community, then start thinking intelligence. How can you install products that work for the user, not just user-centric, but the work for the user, help the user, assist the user? Because if we’re going to be successful, we’ve got to do that for the user, and got to make this easy. Because we know when things work for users they get adopted, when they work for the relying party, or they work for the ID provider or they work academically, they work from a security point of view. If they don’t work for the user, that’s all pretty academic. Make this work for the user to make it successful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, I couldn’t agree more. And well, thanks a lot for this very interesting conversation and guiding us through the Trust Framework 2022, please let us know how people can follow the conversation with you or learn more about what OIX is doing.</p>
<p>Nick: Absolutely. So we’ve got the launch of that is on the third of February. So please look out for that on the OIX website. So the OIX website is <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">www.openidentityexchange.org</a>. So please come along to that. There you can find the guides, there you can find the information about becoming a member if you’re not already a member, and information about the working groups we are looking at the moment, which I say include global interoperability, we’re taking a fresh look at fraud, we’re looking at can we get relying party adoption moving more quickly? So there’s a whole host of things we’re looking at in 2022, which I’m sure would be of interest. So reach out to me directly so it’s nick.mothershaw@openidentityexchange.org.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Well, thanks a lot again, Nick, and all the best.</p>
<p>Nick: Thank you Oscar. It’s pleasure to talk to you today. And yeah, really excited about what 2022 is going to bring. Thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you. Bye-bye.</p>

<p>Introduction: NFTs On AERGO: Tapping Into A Multi-Billion Dollar&nbsp;Industry</p>NFTs Have Sold For Millions Of Dollars And Provide Artists With Outlets For Exposure, Networking And Monetary Valuation On Their&nbsp;Art<p>AERGO has been consistent in developments, whether it be surrounding technological innovations, partnerships and NFT development on the platform. Blocko XYZ, AERGO’s technology partner, has successfully incubated a project known as CCCV, a blockchain identity management platform that has enabled the utilization and creation of NFT’s within the AERGO ecosystem, specifically highlighted by major events within South Korea over the past year. As NFT’s are linked to their designated artists through unique serial numbers, CCCV amalgamates this notion with its unique blockchain identity management service that enables individuals to manage multiple accounts and identities based on NFT technology. NFT technology, as we have seen, is still in its infancy, but is garnering major traction from major media outlets, conglomerates and monetary payment entities throughout the world; AERGO and Blocko XYZ realized this notion, and CCCV has perpetuated the utilization and creation of NFTs on the AERGO platform through a variety of ways. As NFT’s garner mainstream attention, it is important to highlight the work AERGO has been doing to assist in that ethos of NFT expansion.</p><p>CCCV Sales: Adding AERGO As A Payment For&nbsp;NFT’s</p>Within CCCV, You Can Pay For NFTs With The AERGO Token, Alongside Ethereum<p>Utility is the calling-card of a projects longevity; hype may impact price extensively, but hype is a short-term trend, and as one hype-trend begins, it fades just as quickly. Utility is the vitality of a project, whether the market dictates it or not. CCCV has enabled the AERGO token to garner utility in regards to payment options for NFT’s, as NFT sales grow, specifically in South Korea, the use-case of AERGO and it’s utilization by NFT artists will inevitably grow with the tide as well. Although there are many different NFT marketplaces that exist within the realm of blockchain technology, it is far and few between where a mid-cap project garners partnerships with major media outlets that enable NFT exhibitions throughout South Korea. It is incumbent to mention the multitudes of offline NFT enthusiasts that have contributed to NFT exhibitions in South Korea, most notably, the offline NFT exhibition with one of the largest broadcasters in Korea MBC, which held the exhibition in an NFT based format. Provided under this paragraph are pictures from that very exhibition! It is far and few between where even some of the largest NFT marketplaces are able to garner the attention of massive media companies, but CCCV, the incubation project of Blocko XYZ, AERGO’s technology partner, has done just&nbsp;that.</p><p>The Korean President Election: NFT’s Of The Nominees On&nbsp;AERGO?</p>Coindesk Korea Has Recently Shared An Article Highlighting NFT Innovation From&nbsp;CCCV<p>CCCV has recently partnered with MaskDAO, an autonomous NFT marketplace, which, in partnership with CCCV, aims to create pre-election voting polls through NFT’s for each presidential nominee in South Korea. With electioneering, fraudulent ballots and human malevolence, NFT’s have garnered a major utility when it comes to the democratization of choosing incumbents for nations, CCCV and MaskDAO emphasize that idealism through conceiving of a pre-election poll through the utilization of NFTs. Through CCCV and MaskDAO, users can “pre-vote” in advance for their presidential nominee through NFTs. The lack of participation in elections conveys a serious problem for republicanism throughout the globe and South Korea isn’t clear from this threat. MaskDAO and CCCV created this initiative to incentivized users to participate in the voting process through a familiarized setting with a robust technology: NFTs. Through this tournament, statistics can be created and analyzed surrounding who will be the next president of South Korea; prediction isn’t necessarily fact, but, this can assist the voting process by understanding voting trends among a populace through the immutable innovation of NFTs. This initiative is extremely forward thinking and amalgamates a multi-billion dollar industry with elections, which need less tampering, as we have seen with numerous elections throughout the world; AERGO and Blocko understand such an ideal, of their own volitions.</p><p>A Comparision: Upbit And Bithumb NFT Marketplaces Versus&nbsp;AERGO</p>Utility Is A Broad Spectrum When It Comes To NFT’s, However, These Exchanges Perpetuate NFT Enthusiasm For Crypto Veterans, Not Every Day&nbsp;Artists<p>It is evident that Bithumb and Upbit are some of the largest exchanges in the world for digital asset exchanges; this will also hold true with their NFT marketplaces as well. Unfortunately, these exchanges have created a concept of exclusivity among crypto and NFT veterans where only those who’re tech savvy with blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges can participate within these marketplaces. This notion can only go so far surrounding the perpetuation of NFT maturation. AERGO and CCCV have conceived of a paradigm for NFT artists and non-NFT artists alike that enables everyday mainstream people to involve themselves with NFTs through offline brick and mortar art exhibitions throughout South Korea. Inclusivity and the introduction of this technology to the people is an important ethos for the maturity of this market, and AERGO and Blocko clearly understand that notion in its entirety.</p><p>AERGO NFT’s Go Mainstream: CCCV And Maekyung Media&nbsp;Group</p>Founded In 1966, Maekyung Media Group’s Is One Of The Largest Mainstream Media Companies In South&nbsp;Korea<p>Blocko XYZ’s MOU with Maekyung Media Group cannot be overstated, this is a massive feat for a blockchain company to partner with a half-century old media company, and one of the largest mainstream media agencies in South Korea. Did you know that Maekyung Media Group, according to the World Economic Forum “operates a newspaper, a broadcasting network, a weekly and monthly magazine, and an electronic newspaper. It published a Korean-language business newspaper with a circulation of approximately 1.2 million; its television broadcast reaches 15 million users per-day.” <a href="https://www.weforum.org/organizations/maekyung-media-group">https://www.weforum.org/organizations/maekyung-media-group</a> Yes, the article highlights 15 million users per-day, that is the entire population of many small-mid size nations throughout the world, and Blocko XYZ has signed an MOU with this&nbsp;company.</p><p>On the 24th, Blocko XYZ signed an MOU with Maeil Economic Research Institute for blockchain NFT business cooperation, propelling NFT’s into the mainstream eye within South Korea. Through this mutual understanding, Blocko will assist in NFT technical support to the Maeil Economic Research Institute and the two companies plan to participate in multiple NFT related projects together. This synergistic relationships enables AERGO to conceive of connections with mainstream media outlets for future prospects surrounding NFT exhibitions, projects and collectibles exclusive to the AERGO platform, providing a unique value proposition for the network. Mainstream validity is what will drive the adoption of networks as the maturation of blockchain continues; NFT’s are no exception to such a clause and AERGO is solidifying its base within that paradigm.</p><p>Conclusion: Setting The Stage For NFT Adoption: AERGO And&nbsp;Blocko</p>Without Mainstream Validation, This Market Will Never Mature, NFTs&nbsp;Included<p>It’s far and few between where a mid-cap project has such connections with mainstream media outlets and governmental entities. AERGO stands out in this crowd through its technology partner, Blocko XYZ which has solidified an MOU with one of South Korea’s largest broadcasting agencies: this is no easy feat. In order for NFT’s to become more than just a trend, mainstream adoption must foster this industry and perpetuate its expansion. Through initiatives such as this, conceived of by Blocko XYZ, there is hope that NFT’s are more than just a trend. This is through AERGO’s and Blocko’s own volitions and ambition.</p><p>Disclaimer: NFT’s and cryptocurrency investing involves substantial risk, I am not responsible for your trades, do not invest more than you can afford to&nbsp;lose!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/of-aergos-volition-mainstream-partnerships-the-nft-af7dd0d91598">Of AERGO’s Volition: Mainstream Partnerships: The NFT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#196 — How crypto is changing central&nbsp;banks <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-195-can-you-trust-your-million-dollar-nft-3c578fd8707">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The Fed finally publishes its paper on&nbsp;CBDCs  The web3 wars&nbsp;continue  Tweet of the week — IG NFT&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. Better late than&nbsp;never The Federal&nbsp;Reserve<p>There are already <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">23 countries already experimenting with CBDCs or central bank digital currencies</a> — 9 of which have already officially launched, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2021/11/15/na111621-five-observations-on-nigerias-central-bank-digital-currency">including Nigeria</a>. In China, WeChat <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/chinas-digital-currency-comes-to-tencents-wechat-in-expansion-push.html">recently integrated the country’s CBDC</a> bringing it to its billion plus user&nbsp;base.</p><p>Notably lagging is the U.S. When you’re the world’s reserve currency, there’s that much more at&nbsp;stake.</p><p>But last week, the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm">finally published (after much delay) its paper</a> weighing the upside and potential challenges of introducing a digital dollar backed by the central&nbsp;bank.</p><p>On the positives, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/business/fed-digital-currency.html">from the NYTimes&nbsp;report</a>:</p><blockquote>Such a currency “could provide a safe, digital payment option for households and businesses as the payments system continues to evolve, and may result in faster payment options between countries,” the Fed release accompanying the discussion paper&nbsp;stated.</blockquote><p>Cross-border payments are particularly slow and expensive, relying on the correspondent banking&nbsp;system.</p><p>On to the challenges, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/business/fed-digital-currency.html">from the same&nbsp;report</a>:</p><blockquote>But the paper also noted that a central bank digital currency would raise policy questions, including about its effect on the financial sector, the cost and availability of credit, the safety and stability of the financial system and the efficacy of monetary&nbsp;policy.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Commercial banks, for their part, <a href="https://bpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Central-Bank-Digital-Currencies-Costs-Benefits-and-Major-Implications-for-the-U.S.-Economic-System.pdf">have been worried</a> that the creation of a central bank digital currency and Fed accounts could take away their deposit base and upend their business model. The paper probably does not address all their concerns, but may serve to calm worries that consumers could fully leapfrog the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</blockquote><p>It’s a particular challenge for an institution that has historically preferred a hands off and decentralized approach — outside of extraordinary circumstances. The average person often considers money creation the responsibility of the Fed, but that job is actually outsourced to banks through fractional reserve lending. By loaning out money they don’t have, banks create more money. (How the Fed sets interest rates impacts all of this, but you get my&nbsp;point.)</p><p>For the Fed, decentralization of money creation makes a lot of sense. Banks are better positioned to manage the risks of their customers and communities.</p><p>The same has been true of the digital dollar. Today, most of my dollars exist in digital form, managed by my bank’s centralized ledger.</p><p>Introducing its own CBDC flips that historical framework on its head with the Federal Reserve stepping in to take a far more outsized role in how money works today. Doing so without rocking the boat too much will be a top priority.</p><p>It’s also why the Fed was crystal clear in its paper that it had no plans to offer consumer accounts at the central bank, which would further step on banks’ toes. The NYTimes&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>The Fed paper also seemed to slam the door on several possibilities — including the idea that a central bank digital currency could be created alongside consumer bank accounts at the Fed, <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SIL20449.pdf">something Democrats</a> and proponents of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-issued-digital-dollar-could-print-money-for-the-people-174238842.html?guce_referrer=ahr0chm6ly93d3cuz29vz2xllmnvbs8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=aqaaabobubllw2plqobfnniatsw134z-654qygpll_odvlpdcnuofr4czpxjkfgb-w4b_-dfvcxxi9nlcmguzokco42iddyrqvych9vlc4fees61ebjkkgr_lysa-4rzafzdc1ci9-0xdtnaumzmjro32yh17l7xtbnh0dbckatcdoej">broader financial inclusion</a> have at times suggested.</blockquote><p>But as the Fed itself argues, the rise of crypto is already disrupting the system whether or not central banks decide to participate. Change is inevitable and it will be up to banks whether or not they sink or swim given the choices now available to consumers.</p><p>In that sense, crypto has always been a forcing function for innovation within a historically slow moving industry — just as platforms like PayPal, Venmo, and Square likely sped up the adoption of solutions like Zelle, which allowed customers to easily send money to each other (even across different bank ledgers).</p><p>Here’s the&nbsp;Fed:</p><blockquote>“A C.B.D.C. could spur innovation by banks and other actors and would be a safer deposit substitute than many other products, including stablecoins and other types of nonbank money,” the paper said. “These forms of nonbank money could cause a shift in deposits away from banks even without a C.B.D.C.”</blockquote><p>And just like that, the Federal Reserve has officially started the conversation.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/business/fed-digital-currency.html">Fed opens debate over a U.S. central bank digital currency with long-awaited report.</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/the-federal-reserve-is-open-to-creating-a-digital-dollar-5f332697-b3f5-4e59-b542-ab1f5ca79d3b.html">The Federal Reserve is open to creating a digital&nbsp;dollar</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/ceo-of-financial-services-giant-charles-schwab-calls-cryptocurrencies-hard-to-ignore/">CEO of Financial Services Giant Charles Schwab Calls Cryptocurrencies ‘Hard to Ignore’ — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/TravisXRP">/TravisXRP</a> — <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220120a.htm">Federal Reserve Board releases discussion paper that examines pros and cons of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency&nbsp;(CBDC)</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-13/paypal-sued-for-freezing-customer-accounts-without-explanation">PayPal Sued for Freezing Customer Accounts Without Explanation</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/proposed-russian-crypto-ban-may-push-miners-west/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Proposed Russian Crypto Ban May Push Miners West — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/yuan-s-popularity-for-global-payments-hits-highest-in-six-years">Yuan’s Popularity for Global Payments Hits Highest in Six&nbsp;Years</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/TravisXRP">/TravisXRP </a>— <a href="https://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/financial-markets/Why-Decentralised-Finance-DeFi-Matters-and-the-Policy-Implications.pdf">OECD: Why Decentralized Finance Matters and the Policy Implications</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chinas-tech-crackdown-geopolitics-us">China’s Tech Crackdown Is a Geopolitical Play</a>   2. The web3 wars&nbsp;continue <p>Speaking of ongoing conversations, the promises of web3 continue to command vigorous&nbsp;debate.</p><p>Let’s start with a disclaimer: When it comes to human problems, technology is never the solution; it’s always just a&nbsp;tool.</p><p>And as a tool, it’s always a double-edged sword.</p><p>The arrival of Spotify meant that anyone could call themselves a published musician. The reality is that a handful of global stars (along with Spotify) rake in the majority of revenues.</p><p>(Notably, this is also the case for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncsNZacfla0&amp;t=3s">tennis</a> and golf players. The point being — this isn’t a technology problem.)</p><p>Zooming out, you can see how this applies to the greater internet. The Worldwide Web promised to democratize information — and it did. Today’s web2 version of that same internet grapples with complex social and economic issues around misinformation/fake news, deplatforming, and Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>Early in the hype cycle, new technological frameworks promise to solve human problems. But reality is a bit more complicated.</p><p>Now that web3’s 2021 honeymoon period is over, a vibrant conversation is emerging around those very complications — ignited by <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098">that juicy tweet from&nbsp;Jack</a>.</p><p>That conversation is only just beginning, but this week, we have <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/">a post from NYU professor Scott Galloway’s No Mercy No Malice newsletter</a> (via /gregkidd).</p><p>And Scott pulls no&nbsp;punches:</p><blockquote>Preaching liberation while sequestering into gated communities is endemic to tech. The “personal” computer was going to free us from the grip of IBM’s dominance in mainframes, but it fell under the even greater control of Microsoft. Apple claimed to be a revolutionary fighting Big Brother, but it erected the greatest tollbooth for creativity in history (the App Store). “Information wants to be free” was the rallying cry of earlier web company managements trying to convince fawning, idiotic content companies to exchange their content for pennies on the&nbsp;dollar.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Web3 has different-colored hair, but the same DNA as earlier web paradigms, which decentralized services at an unprecedented scale to centralize wealth and influence at an unprecedented scale. Ninety-three percent of intentions and two thirds of decisions are influenced by two firms. Is that a good thing? Pro tip: Ask someone with teen girls. So far, web3 is&nbsp;web2.01.</blockquote><p>So is web3 the solution? No.</p><p>Is it a powerful&nbsp;tool?</p><p>Certainly.</p><p>Much like the conversation around a Federal Reserve backed CBDC, it’s a question of centralization versus decentralization and there’s still plenty to be hashed&nbsp;out.</p><p>Further reading:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/">Web3 | No Mercy / No&nbsp;Malice</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd </a>— <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/moxie-has-moxie-975189">Moxie has&nbsp;Moxie</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — Moxie Marlinspike: <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">My first impressions of&nbsp;web3</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/business/dealbook/web3-venture-capital-andreessen.html">Tales From Crypto: A Billionaire Meme Feud Threatens Industry&nbsp;Unity</a>  Matt Levine — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">Web3 Takes Trust&nbsp;Too</a>  <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-web3-debate">The Web3&nbsp;Debate</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-11/signal-founder-marlinspike-gives-web3-nfts-an-emperor-s-new-clothes-moment">Web3 Just Had Its Emperor’s-New-Clothes Moment</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-19/washing-web3">Wash Your Meebits in&nbsp;Web3</a>   3.

<p>Il progetto consiste in una iniziativa sociale itinerante che ha come obiettivo principale l’attivazione facilitata e gratuita dell’identità digitale per cittadini, nell’ottica di orientare nella dimensione digitale coloro che ne potrebbero rimanere esclusi.</p>



<p>A seguito della pandemia globale che ha avuto inizio nel febbraio 2020, la necessità di utilizzare gli strumenti digitali per sopperire all’impossibilità di svolgere le più comuni operazioni amministrative o di interfaccia con la PA, ha fatto salire vertiginosamente il bisogno da parte di cittadini e imprese di dotarsi di mezzi quali ad esempio SPID; molti cittadini però corrono il rischio di essere tagliati fuori dal mondo del digitale, poiché l’accesso a queste risorse prevede un livello minimo di conoscenza della tecnologia e dei device non sempre posseduto da tutti.</p>



<p>Con il proposito di non lasciare nessuno indietro, è nata l’associazione di promozione sociale MigliorAttivaMente, che persegue lo scopo di favorire la “salita a bordo” del cittadino nella dimensione digitale del Paese, così da fruire telematicamente, senza sprecare tempo e risorse, dei servizi offerti da aziende e pubblica amministrazione; questa idea è nata durante la pandemia, mentre l’associazione ha preso vita nel 2021, ha già all’attivo numerose iniziative di interesse sociale e si appresta a compiere ulteriori importanti passi.</p>



<p>Il progetto “SPID in ogni dove” è un’importante iniziativa che ha l’obiettivo di dotare gli utenti meno avvezzi alla tecnologia della propria identità digitale, il tutto si svolgerà durante le tappe di un tour che vedrà coinvolta InfoCert come provider per l’attivazione facilitata e gratuita del servizio, il tutto avverrà grazie all’impegno degli InfoCert partners, InfoAss, Studio Eureka, TeamService, e Unappa che si adopereranno materialmente mettendo a disposizione i referenti che avranno il compito di attivare le identità digitali, &nbsp;MigliorAttivaMente invece si occuperà di coordinare le tappe del tour e far sì che quanti più utenti in difficoltà possano avere l’opportunità di accedere al servizio.</p>



<p>Al momento sono state scelte le città che saranno tappa del tour (Roma, Milano, Napoli, Palermo, Verona, Brescia, Reggio Emilia, Perugia, Rimini, Salerno, Monza, Tento, Pescara, Cagliari), il tour avrà inizio nella primavera 2022 e MigliorAttivaMente ha già iniziato ad ingaggiare i volontari dedicati al servizio di accettazione del cittadino, InfoCert, attraverso i propri partner, metterà a disposizione l’addetto al riconoscimento e ovviamente il servizio SPID; le location per ogni città sono ancora in fase di selezione, verranno comunicate tramite i canali di InfoCert e MigliorAttivaMente non appena ufficializzate.</p>

<p>TORONTO,&nbsp; January 25, 2022 – <a href="https://liquidmeta.io/">Liquid Meta Capital Holdings Ltd.</a> (the “Company” or “Liquid Meta”) (NEO:LIQD) a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure and technology company, today announced a partnership with Civic Technologies, Inc. (“Civic”), a leading innovator in blockchain-powered digital identity solutions. Together, the companies will bring trusted, secure permissioned identity services to DeFi and enable Liquid Meta to provide capital liquidity to permissioned dApps. This will promote the overall adoption of DeFi.</p>



<p>“Liquid Meta’s mission is to build a bridge between Traditional Finance and Decentralized Finance,” said Jonathan Wiesblatt, CEO. &nbsp;“Our partnership with Civic Technologies will provide us with the enhanced capabilities and tools needed to expand upon this mission and to create an environment for traditional institutional investors to access this nascent and emerging industry in a more secure and trusted capacity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The partnership is timely, given interest in DeFi from institutional investors. At its core, DeFi relies on permissionless access, but this principle often runs counter to the obligations of large capital investors that must know the counter-parties they are participating with in order to reduce counter-party risk. Permissioned access through the partnership will provide a gateway into DeFi for these investors. Liquid Meta is already providing liquidity to some of the most exciting Decentralized Applications and Exchanges in DeFi.</p>



<p>As the first publicly traded, pure-play liquidity mining operation in the world, Liquid Meta is building proprietary software and tools to access, automate and unlock tremendous growth within DeFi. The Company is focused on generating cash flow in the fast-growing DeFi segment of the blockchain industry.</p>



<p>“The team at Liquid Meta has a long history in the financial services industry, public capital markets and the crypto and technology industries. The leadership team is attuned to the operational rigor that institutional investors require in order to explore investments in new categories like DeFi,” said Chris Hart, CEO of Civic. “We can’t think of a better partner that’s more aligned with our mission to open the DeFi ecosystem to new investors through permissioned markets.”</p>



<p>Civic provides a KYC and KYB solution, through Civic Pass, that a dApp provider can use as an input to their compliance program. Liquid Meta will use Civic Pass to determine which participants meet a dApp’s rigorous standards for verification prior to allowing them the ability to trade. Civic Pass is seamlessly integrated into a dApp’s onboarding flow. Once an institutional investor has completed the Civic Pass screening process, the dApp will use the results of the screening to allow trading.</p>

   CLIs are great. I love the speed and productivity increases I get when using a CLI, but memorizing commands – especially when commands need arguments, options, flags, and so on – can be daunting. Luckily, there are tools available for CLI fans out there, and one tool I’ve been enjoying is Fig.

  <p>CLIs are great. I love the speed and productivity increases I get when using a CLI, but memorizing commands – especially when commands need arguments, options, flags, and so on – can be daunting. Luckily, there are tools available for CLI fans out there, and one tool I’ve been enjoying is <a href="https://fig.io/">Fig</a>.</p>

 Fig powers up your CLI productivity 

<p>Fig adds autocompletion to supported terminals, which makes using CLIs so much easier. Using Git? You’ll see a small window pop up with different commands and options.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s a cool way to reinforce remembering Git command-line operations. But most of us use Git on a daily basis, so we probably have a good command… of our Git commands. 😳 Hilarious pun aside, the branch names in the context menu are pretty darn helpful.</p>

 Boosting the power of Okta CLI 

<p>How about when it’s a CLI that you might not use daily? This is where the autocompletion shines and really helps you power up!</p>

<p>We’re pleased to announce that <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> autocompletion is available in Fig!  When you use a supported terminal, you’ll see hints to help you navigate through the commands and flags, so managing your Okta applications has never been easier.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The autocomplete context menu lists all the commands available and shows you which command requires an argument. The <code>okta start</code> command allows you to pass in a name, and you can see the optional argument at a glance.</p>

 Managing Okta apps 

<p>You may need to create Okta apps and get app configurations. When you need to create an Okta app, the Okta CLI helps you step through the process. However, if you are an Okta power user, you may be fine creating the Okta app in one shot by passing in the app settings. In this case, the Okta CLI autocomplete is pretty handy as it shows you all the options you can pass in!</p>

<p></p>

 Help is on the way! 

<p>Getting more detailed help information is easier too! The autocomplete context menu helps you navigate to the help output for a command. And yup, you can get help about the <code>help</code> command. Pretty meta, right?</p>

<p></p>

 Supported terminals for Okta CLI using Fig 

<p>Now that you’re excited, here’s the fine print. Fig currently only supports macOS. 😰  And only certain terminals and shells within macOS at that. Read <a href="https://fig.io/support/other/faq">Fig’s FAQ</a> for supported terminals and shells, as well as information for work support cross-platform and more terminal/shell integrations. Don’t forget to get on the waiting list for your OS or shell, or submit an issue so Fig knows how to prioritize future work.</p>

 Learn more 

<p>I hope this autocomplete feature helps you! I’d love to hear how you use Okta CLI and what tools you use to power up your terminal commands. We welcome issues and PRs in the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">okta-cli GitHub repo</a> too.</p>

<p>In a post-pandemic world, food is not just our biggest challenge, but also our biggest opportunity for sustainable change.</p><p>The ways that food is produced, distributed and consumed have major negative impacts on people and the planet. Food production is the largest human pressure on Earth, causing a mass extinction of species, and accounting for 23% of annual greenhouse emissions. Food is at the core of various social justice challenges such as working conditions, access to affordable good food, cultural diversity and burgeoning food-related health crises of both malnutrition and obesity. This means that many of the broader environmental and social challenges can be addressed if the way that food is produced and managed is transformed. As Johan Rockström, Director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in&nbsp;2016:</p><blockquote>If we get it right on food, we get it right for both people and&nbsp;planet.</blockquote><p>Food transformations will require a series of fast and slow transitions over the next decades. The world’s governments have agreed on the UN Global Goals for 2030. Here in Sweden the country plans to have net zero emissions by 2045. However, neither the world nor Sweden are on track to achieve these goals, and with every day that passes, impacts accumulate and the challenges grow.</p><p>Food is essential and a source of great pleasure. A shared meal can be a ritual or celebration, and a simple everyday pleasure. Food is a rich and meaningful expression of our shared cultural diversity, and the way we make, distribute, and enjoy it, speaks loudly as to what we stand for as a society. Food can be a generator of wealth, in numerous forms, and its cultivation can restore ecological functions. Given that food is the strongest connection humanity has with the biosphere, that most of our food systems are productive but unequal, and that food cultures can either be enriching or destructive, transforming our global food systems represent both a grand challenge and a grand opportunity. If we are able to make a just transition to food cultures that restore the biosphere rather than degrade it, we will not only improve the lives of the world’s people, and enhance the biosphere, but also learn how to become better stewards of the&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>Sweden and other Nordic countries are well-positioned to lead the way in the global transformations towards sustainable food systems. It shares many of the world’s problems, while beginning to take action to address them. Current diets in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Finland are unhealthy, carbon intensive, and harm terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, both in the Nordics and elsewhere. About half the population in Nordic countries is overweight or obese, food waste is a major problem, and meat consumption is well above amounts recommended for health or sustainability.</p><p>Sweden is also taking action to change its food system. The Nordic region has world-class dietary guidelines, strict agricultural regulations and emerging innovations to food challenges. In Sweden, diverse innovations are taking place in farming, marketing, logistics and retail. Similarly, many cities, municipalities, and national government are working to develop policy to improve the food system, for both health reasons and environmental objectives. Furthermore, there is widespread public discussion, led in particular by chefs, to build on the success of the New Nordic cuisine <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-healthy-sustainable-and-just-swedish-and-planetary-food-system-3354b72461cb#_msocom_1">[PO1]</a> to create a cuisine that is good for both people and the planet, exploring how to reverse these recent trends towards greater meat consumption and increased environmental damage. As Nordic populations diversify, the various cuisines in the region are enriched accordingly. This means Sweden has the potential to lead global food system transformations.</p><p>The unequal and often unplanned impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted many flaws and fractures in the fabric of everyday life, not least because it moves as a complex system, as opposed to respecting the way Sweden is organised within health, mobility, urbanism, security, governance and other sectors. We believe that the responses to COVID-19 on the Swedish food systems may reveal aspects of the resilience measures needed to meaningfully address the risks and opportunities facing Swedish food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While some of the rapid responses of food system actors to COVID-19 might accelerate a ‘just transition’ towards sustainable and resilient food systems, others may impede it. To better navigate towards sustainability, we want to understand how responses to COVID either built or eroded resilience within the Swedish food system resilience, and whether these responses enhances or reduced the transformative capacities of the Swedish food systems. Such understanding can help us better align existing and future research and innovation activities, in order to enable a ‘just transition’ of Sweden’s complex food systems; systems not defined by its territorial boundaries but the planetary flows that it is interlinked with.</p><p>Transformations require significant changes in multiple dimensions of society. These changes must take place at different levels in society, from practices and behaviours, to rules and regulations, to values (financial and non-financial), and world-views. Transformation involves changing the relationships among people, but also profoundly changing the relationships between people and nature. History shows us that crises can create openings for transformation. But while positive societal transformations may arise from crises, the consequences of crises are often not positive. The risk is that opportunities created by the crisis are missed and that crisis response — despite good intentions and innovation — fail to address accumulated problems, and restore a slightly improved or a damaged status-quo. Navigating crises requires understanding of capabilities and capacities that are needed and then developing and mobilizing those capabilities and capacities for&nbsp;change.</p><p>Our project aims to learn from the current COVID-19 crisis and support the enabling of capacities for transforming towards Swedish food systems that promote the health, equity and sustainability of people and the planet. The project will identify and map risks and opportunities emerging in the Swedish food systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic through a co-creative process with public, private and civic food system actors. This process will develop understanding and articulate alternative pathways for food system transformations. It will do this through a Rapid Transition Lab.</p> Rapid Transition Lab <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will identify opportunities and pathways for Swedish food system actors to engage in a rapid transition, in response to the COVID-19 crisis. It will assess different strategies within the Swedish food systems, and support the design of more transformative strategies, practices, and institutions. Vinnova, the Swedish government’s innovation agency who fund this work, plans to connect the learning to multiple related stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in&nbsp;Sweden.</p><p>The Rapid Transition lab will consist of a sensemaking and a futuring project and be structured around three overlapping phases: First, the project will build a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of and the responses to Covid-19 in the Swedish food systems. Second, based on these insights, existing food system scenarios, and through workshops engaging multiple stakeholders, the project will build transformative food system scenarios. In the third phase, the project will use these scenarios to identify strategies and pathways and possible portfolios of experiments for actors to contribute to the transformations of the Swedish food systems. These will be accomplished by developing a process of collective sense-making.</p>  Learning from the crisis to reframe food systems: By exploring the interconnected cascading risks and opportunities that have emerged from responses to COVID-19 and the 2018 drought in Sweden, in the context of Swedish food system transformations, we will create broader views of food systems and cultures.  Suggesting strategies to support the capacity building for transformations: Building exploratory scenarios, informed by the responses to the COVID-19 crises in the Swedish food systems, can reveal capacity-building strategies that might better enable transformations in the Swedish food systems. The scenarios, will build on previous and ongoing scenarios, to develop systemic, holistic and multidimensional scenarios that will be used to identify a portfolio of pathways and experiments.  Input into strategic policymaking and innovation practice: Key stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in Sweden, will be engaged to actively contribute and learn from these exploratory processes. The analysis of the crisis, and development of the scenarios should be relevant to these stakeholders.  <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will be linked to other ongoing transdisciplinary food system projects that Vinnova or the Stockholm Resilience Centre lead or are partners in. These include MISTRA Food Futures, Nordic Food Policy Lab, Sustainable Finance Lab, and NorthWestern Paths. The Rapid Transition lab will complement these projects by focusing on the responses to Covid 19 pandemic in the Swedish food systems and use these to build scenarios that in turn will be used to develop transformation strategies and identify capacities for&nbsp;change.</p> Further reading <p>More on Nordic food system transformations can be found in four policy briefs from the SRC, <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2020-11-24-nordic-countries-are-well-suited-to-collaborate-on-food-systems-transformation.html">https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2020-11-24-nordic-countries-are-well-suited-to-collaborate-on-food-systems-transformation.html</a></p><p>What can the COVID-19 pandemic teach us about resilient Nordic food systems? <a href="http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450471/FULLTEXT01.pdf">http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450471/FULLTEXT01.pdf</a></p> Who we&nbsp;are <p><a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/">Stockholm Resilience Centre </a>Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC) is an international research centre on resilience and sustainability science.

 US Federal Reserve Issues Paper on CBDCs  
<p>The Federal Reserve Board (The Fed) released a hotly-anticipated paper on Thursday January 20th, in which it discusses many of the potential risks and benefits of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) version of the dollar. Formal CBDC working groups have been developed in other countries including Australia and China. Though this represents the first major discussion of the issue by the Fed – the primary monetary authority and bank holding company regulator in the US.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a> calls itself the intuitive Vue framework. It aims to make a developer-friendly experience while not sacrificing performance or degrading the integrity of your architecture. It has been exciting to see the community and tooling around VueJS grow and evolve — there’s no better time to get started in this ecosystem than now.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will build a small web application that retrieves some posts from an API and displays them for authenticated users. For authentication, you will integrate Okta into your Nuxt application. Okta’s simple authentication system and the power of Nuxt means you can configure and set up your authentication in just a few moments.</p>

<p></p>

<p>What you’ll need</p>

 
   Your favorite IDE (I will be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>) 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer Account</a> 
   The <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> tool 
 

 Set up your Okta application 

<p>Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/vue/create-okta-application/">Create a Vue App</a> for more information.</p>



 Build your web application with Nuxt 

<p>If you wish to follow along using the completed project you can <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-vue-nuxt-example">check out the GitHub repository here</a>.</p>

<p>Nuxt provides a scaffolding tool called <code>create-nuxt-app</code> to make scaffolding your application easy. You can run the following command to create the application:</p>

   <code>npx create-nuxt-app okta-vue-nuxt-example
</code>   

<p>Usually, task runners have several options. There are some important options you should take a look at while using this task runner.</p>
 
   Programming language: JavaScript 
   Package manager: Npm 
   UI framework: Bootstrap Vue 
   Nuxt modules: Axios - Promise based HTTP client 
 

<p>We will use Axios to fetch data in our application. Next, you can select the linting tool of your choice and a testing framework.</p>

 
   Rendering mode: Universal (SSR / SSG) 
   Deployment target: Server (Node.js hosting) 
 

<p>You can use the following commands to enter the project directory and run the application.</p>

   <code>cd okta-vue-nuxt-example
npm run dev
</code>   

<p>If you open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser, you will see the default Nuxt page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Nuxt project layout is pretty straightforward. First you have a <code>.nuxt</code> folder where your compiled server code will end up. Next there is a <code>components</code> folder. You won’t use the folder in this tutorial, but breaking pages into components is common practice in larger projects. These components are then reusable in a number of pages. Next you will find a <code>pages</code> folder where your pages will go. Your routes will be inferred by Nuxt from these views. The <code>static</code> folder is where you can house css, images, or other static content to display. The store directory contains your <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/">Vuex</a> store files.</p>

<p>You will also add a <code>layouts</code> folder later.  As you might have guessed, this folder will contain layouts. There are several other directories that are configured out of the box for Nuxt, including middleware, modules, plugins, and dist.  These are out of scope for this article but it is important to know they exist.</p>

<p>Finally, you will need two packages from npm. The first is <code>@nuxtjs/dotenv</code> which is a nuxt-friendly implementation of dotenv. You will use this to store sensitive information that you don’t want to end up in your source control.</p>

<p>Finally you will need <code>@nuxt/auth-next</code> to control your authentication.</p>

   <code>npm i @nuxtjs/dotenv@1.4.1
npm i @nuxtjs/auth-next@5.0.0-1637333559.35dbd53
</code>   

<p>With your dependencies installed it’s time to start building your application. First, add a new file to your root directory and name it <code>.env</code>, then add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>OKTA_DOMAIN=https://{yourOktaDomain}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
</code>   

<p>Be sure to replace the placeholder variables with your actual Okta information.</p>

<p>Now open your <code>nuxt.config.js</code> file located in the root directory and replace its contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>export default {
  // Global page headers: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-head
  head: {
    title: "todolist-article",
    htmlAttrs: {
      lang: "en",
    },
    meta: [
      { charset: "utf-8" },
      { name: "viewport", content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1" },
      { hid: "description", name: "description", content: "" },
      { name: "format-detection", content: "telephone=no" },
    ],
    link: [{ rel: "icon", type: "image/x-icon", href: "/favicon.ico" }],
  },

  // Global CSS: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-css
  css: [],

  // Plugins to run before rendering page: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-plugins
  plugins: [],

  // Auto import components: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-components
  components: true,

  // Modules for dev and build (recommended): https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-modules
  buildModules: [],

  // Modules: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-modules
  modules: [
    // https://go.nuxtjs.dev/bootstrap
    "bootstrap-vue/nuxt",
    // Doc: https://axios.nuxtjs.org/usage
    "@nuxtjs/axios",
    "@nuxtjs/dotenv",
    "@nuxtjs/auth-next",
  ],

  /*
   ** Axios module configuration
   ** See https://axios.nuxtjs.org/options
   */
  axios: {},

  auth: {
    strategies: {
      okta: {
        scheme: "openIDConnect",
        endpoints: {
          configuration:  `${process.env.OKTA_DOMAIN}/oauth2/default/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`,
          logout: undefined,
        },
        clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
        grantType: "authorization_code",
        responseType: "code",
      },
    },
  },
  // Build Configuration: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-build
  build: {},
};
</code>   

<p>The first thing this file does is make use of dotenv. It registers the modules you added earlier through the task runner and via npm. Finally, it sets up the options for your OAuth configuration. Here is where you use the environment variables that you set up in your <code>.env</code> file.</p>

<p>You should note the line of code that reads <code>logout: undefined</code>. It is critical for logging the user out correctly, because Okta requires the <code>idToken</code> to be passed as a query parameter. However, <code>nuxt-auth</code> won’t include that parameter under the hood. The solution is to override the logout URL obtained from the configuration endpoint with <code>undefined</code> and manually log the user out in your page file. You will implement this shortly.</p>

<p>To use the OAuth configuration properly, Nuxt requires you to add a file to the <code>store</code> folder called <code>index.vue</code>. You can leave this file empty, but it must exist for Nuxt to use it. If you do not have a <code>store</code> folder, create one now and add a blank <code>index.vue</code> file to it.</p>

 Add your Nuxt pages 

<p>Now, you can start adding pages to your application. Nuxt builds your routes by looking in the <code>pages</code> folder. You can read more about Nuxt’s custom routing in their <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Before working on your pages you should set up your layout. Add a new folder called <code>layouts</code> to the project directory and add a file called <code>default.vue</code>.</p>

<p>This file, and all of the views in this project, will use the Vue template syntax. Vue templating is very similar to most other template syntaxes. It relies heavily on the <code>v-bind</code> HTML attribute to handle events or bind attribute values. You can handle events with the <code>v-on</code> syntax, which can be short handed to <code>@</code>, such as <code>@click="doSomething"</code>.  The <code>b-*</code> components are from the <code>Bootstrap Vue</code> library that should have been installed via the npx task runner.</p>

<p>The layout page will display the headers and footers and incorporate some branching logic to determine if a user should see a <code>login</code> or <code>logout</code> button. It also contains some common CSS and JavaScript that will be needed on each page that uses the layout. The <code>&lt;nuxt /&gt;</code> element on this page will act as a placeholder for the code on your page. Nuxt will render your page code in this section.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b-container&gt;
      &lt;b-navbar toggleable="lg" type="dark" variant="info"&gt;
        &lt;b-navbar-brand href="#"&gt;Posts&lt;/b-navbar-brand&gt;
        &lt;b-navbar-nav&gt;
          &lt;b-nav-item href="/dashboard"&gt; Dashboard &lt;/b-nav-item&gt;
        &lt;/b-navbar-nav&gt;

        &lt;b-navbar-nav v-if="loggedIn" class="ml-auto"&gt;
          &lt;b-button @click="logout" size="sm" class="my-2 my-sm-0" type="submit"
            &gt;Logout
          &lt;/b-button&gt;
        &lt;/b-navbar-nav&gt;

        &lt;b-navbar-nav v-else class="ml-auto"&gt;
          &lt;b-button @click="login" size="sm" class="my-2 my-sm-0" type="submit"
            &gt;Login
          &lt;/b-button&gt;
        &lt;/b-navbar-nav&gt;

      &lt;/b-navbar&gt;

      &lt;nuxt /&gt;

      &lt;footer id="sticky-footer" class="py-4 bg-dark text-white-50"&gt;
        &lt;div class="fluid-container footer"&gt;
          &lt;small&gt;Copyright &amp;copy;{{ year }} &lt;/small&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;

          A small app built with
          &lt;a href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="blank"&gt;Nuxt&lt;/a&gt;, Protected by
          &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="blank"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;, Written by
          &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com" target="blank"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a
          &gt;.
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/b-container&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      loggedIn: this.$auth.$state.loggedIn,
      year: new Date().getFullYear(),
    }
  },
  methods: {
    logout() {
      this.$auth.logout();
    },
    login() {
      this.$auth.loginWith('okta').then(result =&gt; window.location = "/Dashboard");
    }
  },
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
.fluid-container.footer &gt; *:last-child {
  margin-bottom: 0px;
  color: #fff;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>You will also need a basic landing page that isn’t under authentication. Your landing page will give some information about the application. It will also contain a redirect for authenticated users to route them to the <code>Dashboard</code> page.</p>

<p>Open the <code>index.vue</code> page in the <code>pages</code> directory and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="page-content"&gt;
    &lt;b-jumbotron
      style="margin-top: 5vh"
      header="Lets Get Some Posts"
      lead="A Simple App with Nuxt and Okta"
    &gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For more information visit their websites&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;b-button variant="primary" href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="blank"
        &gt;Nuxt&lt;/b-button
      &gt;
      &lt;b-button
        variant="outline-primary"
        href="https://www.okta.com/"
        target="blank"
        &gt;Okta&lt;/b-button
      &gt;
    &lt;/b-jumbotron&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  beforeMount() {
    if (this.$auth.$state.loggedIn) window.location = '/Dashboard'
  },
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, you can add the <code>Dashboard</code> page. This page makes use of the <code>data()</code> webhook to get some data from a server using Axios, which it then displays in a table. The <code>Dashboard</code> page also makes use of the <code>auth</code> middleware to enforce authentication on this page. When a user attempts to hit this page, they will be rerouted to your login page if they are not authenticated.</p>

<p>Add a new file to the <code>pages</code> folder and name it <code>dashboard.vue</code>. Copy the following code into your <code>dashboard.vue</code> file.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b-table :items="posts" :fields="fields"&gt; &lt;/b-table&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import Vue from 'vue'
export default Vue.extend({
  middleware: ['auth'],
  data() {
    return {
      fields: ['userId', 'title', 'body'],
      posts: [],
    }
  },
  async beforeMount() {
    this.$axios
      .$get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
      .then((res) =&gt; {
        this.posts = res
      })
      .catch((err) =&gt; {
        console.log(err)
      })
  },
})
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>Finally you will need to add the login page where Nuxt will route unauthenticated users. Add a new page to the <code>pages</code> folder named <code>login.vue</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="page-content" class="p-4"&gt;
    &lt;a class="btn btn-primary" @click="$auth.loginWith('okta')"&gt;Login with Okta &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;


&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  middleware: ['auth'],
  data() {
    return {}
  },
  beforeMount() {
    if (this.$auth.$state.loggedIn) window.location = '/Dashboard'
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

 Testing your Nuxt application 

<p>Now that your application is complete you can run <code>npm run dev</code> from your terminal and the application will build. You should see the home page first.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on Dashboard or Login and this should route you to the Okta login form. You can enter your Okta credentials here and you will be routed to the <code>Dashboard</code> page where you can view the posts.</p>

<p></p>

 Do more with Nuxt and Vue 

<p>With a little bit of code, you can combine Nuxt and Okta to make secure Vue SPAs or universal applications. You can find the source code for the example created in this tutorial <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-vue-nuxt-example">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, you learned how to use the <code>@nuxt/auth-next</code> package to secure your Nuxt application using Okta. You also learned how to create the application in Okta and configure the Vue app to use it. Finally, you learned how to use the <code>@nuxtjs/axios</code> package to pull data from a sample API.</p>

<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
<p>Stepan Gershuni is working towards making it easier for DAOs to onboard talent through Professional ID credentials. There is an oversupply of talent looking to join DAOs and Stepan is trying to help them manage their excess talent pools and onboard people faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 During this conversation, we discuss: 
 
 
 
 
 Where are the opportunities to apply SSI principles and frameworks towards DAOs? 
 
 
 How do you decentralize hiring, education, and the coordination of work. 
 
 
 Are .eth good or bad identifiers? Are .eth names and decentralized identifiers (DIDs) mutually exclusive? 
 
 
 How can the decentralized discovery of professional skills happen? 
 
 
 
 And more! 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related Content</p>
<p>DAOs will offer more interesting opportunities to workers to contribute towards meaningful work. And SSI will allow workers to build up a verifiable portfolio of knowledge and skillsets, which can be used to participate in more and more opportunities through DAOs.</p>

<p>People are happier when their work has meaning and when they can associate with peers who share similar beliefs and values. But in the face of new challenges stemming from the pandemic — everything from the shift to remote work to closures of schools and daycare centers — many people began to question the validity of their career as their identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Internet has provided us with many&nbsp;ways to discover and join likeminded communities that we can interact with. Take Reddit for example—there over one million subreddits that exist today with almost 48 million monthly active users (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/443332/reddit-monthly-visitors/">Statista</a>). You can find a niche community to join for almost any topic — and if you don’t find one you can create one yourself.</p>
<p>The web3 world takes this concept a bit further by adding economic incentives for community members to contribute. One of the earliest dreams for Ethereum was to enable “Decentralized Autonomous Organizations” (DAOs).</p>
<p>Because Ethereum enables anyone to write arbitrary rules in code, we can use those rules to design organizational or governance systems that allow groups of people to jointly make decisions through voting or other mechanisms.</p>
<p>While DAOs have existed on Ethereum since 2016, these early experiments were more science project-like rather than real product.</p>
<p>But the DAO ecosystem had a breakout moment in 2021. A simple but workable tech stack came together to enable existing DAOs to get things done, and new entrants pushed the boundaries of what a DAO can be and who can be a part of one.</p>
<p>I personally regained interest in DAOs in 2021 as I saw many opportunities to use self-sovereign identity (SSI) frameworks and principles towards unlocking further growth for decentralized systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sgershuni">Stepan Gershuni</a>&nbsp;and I started talking about the&nbsp;intersection of SSI and DAOs&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/economics-of-self-sovereign-identity/">Episode #9 — Economics of Self-Sovereign Identity and the Future of Cryptoeconomics</a>&nbsp;— and once again in&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/daos-and-ssi/">Episode #16 — How DAOs Benefit from Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>
<p>As 2021 was coming to a close, the number of unique monthly voters who participated in DAOs exploded. Today, there are hundreds of DAOs that see daily activity from members, pay members, build products, and vote on the use of shared funds. Collectively DAOs on Ethereum govern assets worth more than $16 billion.</p>
<p>One of the new DAOs that recently has caught my attention is the&nbsp;<a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name Service (ENS)</a>. In a nutshell, ENS is a name and lookup service built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows crypto users to translate their machine-readable addresses to human-readable addresses. Think of it as an&nbsp;identifier&nbsp;for public Ethereum addresses, aiming to make crypto more accessible. So rather than sending someone tokens by using their public key (e.g., 0x400668a22A85aac272608004130fp26E8e853eBD), I can use their nickname.eth address.</p>
<p>And if you use Twitter at all, you’ll probably also notice the trend where people in are placing their ‘.eth’ in their names. Again, to show allegiance/association to a community of people who share some similar values and beliefs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has seen breakout growth, growing to hundreds of thousands of users, hundreds of integrations, and a new DAO community treasury ($1.9B) to fund continued development of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I started questioning how&nbsp;.eth identifiers compared to decentralized identifiers (DIDs) — DIDs being the most critical element in achieving digital self-sovereignty (for those unfamiliar with SSI).</p>
<p>Although&nbsp;.eth names can enhance user experiences for crypto users, it doesn’t add any privacy benefits that DIDs do. If you broadcast your&nbsp;.eth address like Shaq did, then the whole world can view your financial transactions. That’s simply the open and transparent nature of permissionless public blockchains like Ethereum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There seems to be use cases for both types of identifiers (.eth names and DIDs) and they aren’t mutually exclusive from each other. However, I feel that at times the web3 space tries to apply blockchain to their use cases without understanding the core properties needed for their use case. For example using&nbsp;.eth names or NFTs as identifiers.</p>
<p>These are important conversation to keep having and I think the one here with Stepan starts to explain how different types of identifiers can not only co-exist, but reap value from each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The existing self-sovereign identity (SSI) frameworks are mature, more privacy-preserving and don’t force any specific technologies. For one, it they live on a specific blockchain. SSI gives people the properties of verifiability, control, portability, privacy and a slew of other ones that are important to achieve digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>I continue to strongly believe that the intersection of SSI and web3 will be extremely powerful and change the future of work.</p>
<p>DAOs will offer more interesting opportunities to workers to contribute towards meaningful work. And SSI will allow workers to build up a verifiable portfolio of knowledge and skillsets, which can be used to participate in more and more opportunities through DAOs.</p>
<p>There remains work to be done to bring SSI frameworks to the web3 space. There are some early stage projects like <a href="https://www.deepskills.io/">Deep Skills</a> attempting to do so. But as these become more mature and unlock supplies of verifiable data, people will have so much freedom and flexibility to work on passion projects.</p>
<p>To conclude this post, I want to share 5 ideas that this latest podcast conversation with Stepan has me thinking about:</p>
 
 Idea 1 — People are happier when their work has meaning and can associate with peers who share similar beliefs and values. DAOs provide opportunities to pick and choose your work communities. DAOs are open and transparent, making it easy to do your due diligence before joining one. It’s tough to truly know a corporation runs until you join it. 
 Idea 2— DAOs aren’t bound to geographical constraints or corporate policies. You can work on a DAO from anywhere in the world. You can also work on many DAOs from anywhere. 
 Idea 3— Contributing 5 hours per week of meaningful work will likely create more value than contributing 40 hours of non-meaningful work (e.g., one of the most meaningful contributors to Wikipedia does it as a side gig (<a href="https://northernvirginiamag.com/culture/culture-features/2021/11/24/steven-pruitt-wikipedia/">here</a>)) 
 Idea 4— DAOs can scale much quicker than corporations. There exists a lot of administrative overhead to onboard new talent to a corporation (e.g., register employee with government, set up payroll, etc.) — that overhead doesn’t exist in DAOs. 
 Idea 5— There is an oversupply of talent looking to join DAOs. There is an undersupply of talent available for almost every type of corporation. Corporations don’t have enough of a pipeline of talent, while DAOs are trying to figure out how to onboard the large available talent pools effectively.

<p>This week is a quiet one for news. But if you’re a developer; the following few changes are important ones!</p> holochain-conductor-api → holochain-client-js <p>After a discussion both inside the team and with key developer community members, the name of the JavaScript conductor client has been changed. Everyone feels this better reflects its purpose as a client library for the conductor admin and app APIs.</p><p>The GitHub repo can now be found at <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js</a>, and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/client">NPM package</a> is now called <code>@holochain/client</code>.</p><p>Of course, this is a breaking change, and you’ll need to update your <code>package.json</code> file in any project that uses this library.</p><p>If you’re a Rust front-end developer, there’s a package for you as well on <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust">GitHub</a>. If you’re working on a different front-end language and are building a conductor client library for it, we’d love to tell other developers about it!</p><p>Finally, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/happ-client-call-tutorial">hApp client call tutorial</a> has been updated to use the new NPM package name (and has been updated to work with Holochain 0.0.119 and newer too).</p> Holochain 0.0.123: unified zome calling <p>The only breaking change with this release is that <code>call_remote</code> has been merged into <code>call</code> in the host API, and the signature has changed (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1180">#1180</a>). If your hApp accesses the host API directly, you’ll need to refactor your code. If you use the HDK instead, the <code>call</code> function’s <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.119/hdk/p2p/fn.call.html">signature has changed</a> too. The <code>call_remote</code> function is still available and the signature hasn’t changed, but you will need to recompile your zome against HDK 0.0.119 if you use it.</p><p>A network-level bug has also been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1181">#1181</a>). Attempts to send validation receipts back to authors created an infinite loop; this was hanging the conductor on app startup.</p> Save the date: FOSDEM 2022 on 5–6 Feb <p>As <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fosdem-2022-is-coming-up/">mentioned</a> two Dev Pulses ago, we’re once again co-hosting the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/web3_infrastructure/">Web3 / DWeb / peer-to-peer computing room</a> at FOSDEM, Europe’s largest open-source conference. In addition to three sessions related to Holochain and two related to <a href="https://fluence.network/">Fluence</a>, our co-host, there are a lot of other exciting-looking projects on the schedule. I’ve had the pleasure of speaking to people involved with many of these projects over the past few years, and they’re all breaking ground in unique ways and contributing to the evolution of the decentralised web.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/developer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

After considering several existing bridging solutions, we have chosen to adopt the <a href="https://blog.celer.network/2021/12/13/say-no-to-vendor-lock-in-calling-for-an-open-canonical-token-bridge-standard/">Open Canonical Token Standard</a> to avoid binding ourselves to a singular bridging solution, allowing different bridges to concurrently serve the project. SAFLE holders can find a quick and easy tutorial for how to use cBridge for cross-chain transfers <a href="https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/tutorial/cross-chain-transfer">here</a>.</p><p>Enabling bridging of the SAFLE token is the first step in the aligned vision of Safle and Celer. With Celer’s generalized message passing SDK coming close to its release, the two teams will discuss more opportunities in offering SAFLE users access to a wide spectrum of DeFi scenarios on different chains with a unified user experience in the near&nbsp;future.</p><p>A setback only paves way for a comeback!

 New Value Flows: Impact modelling and Financing neighbourhood retrofit, v0.1 <p>This is part of <a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/TransCap-x-CivicValue-x-CommCap-WeekNotes-4e4acb5764af4e749d6463b097d3c0f4">a series of Weeknotes</a> as part of our TransCap x CivicValue x CommCap exploration. We have republished it here in our Provocations to spark a conversation on how we can rethink value flows in neighbourhood-level climate transitions.</p><p>Neighbourhoods are facing an imminent need to transition for climate change and deal with deep-seated issues of fuel poverty and other injustices. One of the most intractable challenges is the financial cost-benefit balance in undertaking a neighbourhood retrofit programme.</p><p>Under current conventional approaches, the comprehensive range of benefits and co-benefits projects generated are often unaccounted for, with the result being some projects being deemed (reductively) unviable investments, or worse, a liability. For example, as we have seen in our TreesAI project, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-1dd94e1cfedf">urban trees are often seen as costs to municipalities, rather than value-creating natural assets</a>, a logic that justifies trees being removed rather than nurtured.</p><p>Dark Matter Labs’ approach to the TransCap x CommCap project is based our working hypothesis, ‘Transitioning Together’, which aims to lay the framework of a system that puts streets and neighbourhoods in the driving seat of their climate transition, empowering residents to be able to sense-make, deliberate, implement, and access financing for their neighbourhood’s climate transition projects.</p><p>A fundamental part of our hypothesis is about rewiring value flows in order to make these community-driven climate transitions possible. This includes an alternative approach that attempts to account for a project’s benefits and co-benefits in a comprehensive, efficient and holistic way. This also includes wiring a project’s revenue and financing to its impact as a way of incentivising the maximisation of benefits.</p><p>While the community will be the primary beneficiary of climate transition, there will be other stakeholders/actors who too will co-benefit: such as public or philanthropic bodies who may have their liabilities reduced, nearby property-owners who may benefit from land value uplift, or local businesses that may benefit from revenue uplift. By putting in place mechanisms (e.g. <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2?gi=54aae78dd38b">Smart Covenants</a> or outcome-buying contracts / social impact bonds) to capture these co-benefits, we would provide a long-term revenue source that can shift the cost-benefit balance in favour of doing these necessary projects, and also provide a framework for stakeholders to invest in outcomes-based preventative measures to reduce their liabilities (such as investing in housing retrofit, rather than spending on healthcare system costs for dealing with the health consequences of substandard, unhealthy homes).</p>The Transitioning Together model so far: revenues from captured co-benefits replenish a city-wide evergreen fund that funds community-driven climate transition projects. Initial experiments in value modelling <p>As part of our work developing this model, Dark Matter Labs and Civic Square are engaging with the community of Link Road (in Edgbaston, Birmingham) as a pioneer community for this approach. Based on data from the tangible, real-world context of this neighbourhood in Birmingham, we have taken a first attempt at creating this value model that represents a climate transition project’s costs, comprehensive estimates of its various benefits and co-benefits, and also the potential for these co-benefits to be captured.</p><p>Some questions that are beginning to emerge from this work&nbsp;include:</p>  Is this model based on rewiring value flows and capturing co-benefits viable for funding community-driven climate transition projects?<br>In particular, we want to find out the approximate scale of the potential revenues that could derive from capturing co-benefits, and how they compare to the costs of a&nbsp;project.  Is it possible to quantify and model the comprehensive set of co-benefits being created by climate transition projects?<br>For each type of climate transition project, it is necessary to develop an understanding of the types and quantities of (co-)benefits being generated, from the perspectives of the resident, a co-beneficiary, and an investor — is there enough research to allow this to be estimated, and how can we avoid double-counting?  How can qualitative co-benefits be accounted for in the model?<br>While capturing co-benefits and outcomes requires some degree of quantification, how they are metricised and captured opens up a space for contestation. More critically, we are reflecting on how qualitative benefits can be factored into the&nbsp;model.  How do we model the value that is created beyond the projects themselves?<br>Value created by such an approach can exist beyond the projects themselves: for example, the capacity a community develops and experience they gain after successfully implementing their first project can unlock further, more ambitious projects — this has ‘sequential’ value. The coexistence of multiple projects in a neighbourhood can also create a ‘systemic’ value that is greater than the sum of its parts. How can we account for these in the&nbsp;model?  Finally, are there any ethical risks of financialisation civic or public value, including any perverse incentives created by doing so? This work also represents a transition from a model of centralised state taxation and spending, where the creation of civic value, captured or not, is considered part of the state’s remit. While this model has both its opportunities and risks, we must also consider the new set of opportunities and risks by taking a more decentralised approach to civic value creation.   Value modelling approach Diagram showing the components of the interactive value&nbsp;model.<p>The structure of our initial value model is set out in the diagram above: the model is designed to take several global inputs (e.g. assumptions on inflation, the investment horizon, base interest rate, etc.). The model also allows the selection of a portfolio of different types of civic assets and climate transition projects (e.g. home energy efficiency retrofit, urban agriculture, community-owned PV energy generation, etc.), and the scale of the project (e.g. number of homes retrofitted, m2 of gardens used for growing, m2 of PV panels, etc.). Based on these inputs, the model calculates for each civic asset/project:</p>  Costs: This calculates the upfront and ongoing costs of building and operating the project, based on fixed costs and costs that scale per unit of the&nbsp;asset.  Impacts/benefits generated: This calculates the impacts generated over a comprehensive set of factors quantified in their natural units (tonnes of carbon emissions prevented and/or sequestered, health outcomes improved through no. of avoided hospitalisations/deaths, no. of employment opportunities created, litres of stormwater retained, no. of households brought out of fuel poverty, etc.) The calculations use assumptions based on local statistics and review of academic literature, and is part of our ongoing work to refine and test these calculation methods through further research.  Revenues: This calculates the revenues generated over a comprehensive set of factors quantified in the local currency (GBP) — this includes direct revenues such as one-off or annual grants, but also potential revenues from spillover value capture. The spillover capture calculation takes each benefit generated and identifies third party liability holders who may see potential liability reductions and therefore cost savings. A percentage of these estimated cost savings can be captured as a revenue source for the project, to be negotiated with these liability holders as potential ‘outcome buyers’ (for example, the local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group may pay for the outcome of reduced cold weather hospitalisations from home retrofit, based on a percentage of savings from costs of x fewer patients not going to A&amp;E per&nbsp;year).  <p>These cost, impact, and revenues calculations will then be aggregated across the entire portfolio, giving an idea of financing requirements and potential investment returns. We are still reflecting on how secondary value, such as the ‘sequential value’ and ‘systemic value’ described above can be incorporated into the model’s current working form. Double-counting remains challenging to disentangle, especially in areas such as the mutually linked nature of physical and mental health outcomes.</p> A version 0.1 of our&nbsp;model <p>We have created a first attempt of the model based on the logic above in a spreadsheet. The estimates for costs, impacts, and revenues in this version are ‘back of the envelope’ calculations based on common sense assumptions and high-level research we have done so far. This model will be further developed as part of our next stage of work, as the types of impacts modelled are expanded, and deeper research is done to quantify and predict these impacts with more rigour. We have tried to make this modelling as tangible as possible by basing the modelling on the real-world location of Link Road, Birmingham, where Dark Matter Labs and Civic Square are working with a group of residents to test this approach.</p>Main dashboard of the interactive model, with current work being done to replace placeholder figures with more research.<p>The main interface of the model is the dashboard, which gives an overview of the neighbourhood climate transition portfolio, and the whole portfolio’s estimated costs, impacts and revenues. The dashboard allows global inputs, such as investment horizon and the assumed annual inflation rate. The dashboard also allows different civic assets/climate transition projects to be included as part of the neighbourhood portfolio, and the scale of those assets (e.g. no. of homes retrofitted, m2 of urban agriculture, etc.). By changing these inputs to model different scenarios, the user of this modelling tool, whether it is the residents themselves or their advisors, can experiment and find an ideal portfolio of projects that work for their vision of their neighbourhood, and test its viability both in financial terms and the benefits/impacts the community is&nbsp;seeking.</p><p>Beyond the dashboard, each civic asset will have its own page with a more detailed breakdown of the capital and operating costs, its impacts and co-benefits, and also potential both one-off and recurring direct revenues (e.g. government grants/subsidies) and revenues from captured spillover values, with the calculated values updated based on the scale of the asset, and also global inputs. In this version 0.1 of our model, we have begun to build out these costs, impact and revenue models for an average home retrofit (up to EPC C rating), with the ambition to refine the model with more research and sophisticated modelling methods.</p> Financial modelling assumptions and findings: <p>The key assumptions on the cost side&nbsp;are:</p>  Cost per home of retrofitting the home: This is the most significant variable and will depend on characteristics and size of existing home, lifestyle of occupants, target improvement levels and the local supply chain. The literature appears to include a wide range of costs. Most helpful for Link Road are probably the actual average costs incurred through the BEIS supply chain pilots which were mainly undertaken on owner-occupied ‘early adopters’ seeking to do whole-house retrofits. This ended up costing in the region of £20-£25k per home. We acknowledge that some homeowners would be comfortable with improving to EPC C and including a low/zero carbon heat source such as an Air-Source Heat Pump (ASHP). Therefore we’ve assumed a total cost of around £20k per home for this work, but acknowledge that it could be more expensive.  We have factored in operating/maintenance costs as a overall percentage of the capital costs, acknowledging that at regular periods and the end of the horizon (e.g. 30 years), the buildings and their retrofitted work may need to undergo periodic maintenance and upgrades. We hope to make this more granular depending on the type of intervention in future versions of the&nbsp;model.  Our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">approach to deep retrofit</a> beyond the individual house means we should consider improving the streetscape and open spaces as part of retrofit. In our model, we have treated public realm improvements as a separate civic asset. These costs tend to be modest in comparison with the domestic improvements.  <p>Key assumptions on the revenue&nbsp;side:</p>  Energy savings are hard to quantify as again they depend on the home, occupants and selected level of comfort. We have used high-level <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/932403/prs-epc-c-consultation-stage-ia.pdf">government assumptions</a> around improving to EPC level C saving around £220 per household per year. This could be an underestimate especially given rising energy costs. These can be capitalised at a suitable discount rate and a reasonable life-cycle of the elements installed to achieve these outcomes.  Carbon emissions avoided are also based on the same government assumptions, approximately 1.69 tonnes of carbon per house per year. Although these emissions reductions are not all currently traded, there is a potential for this to be financialised beyond the existing ETS system — we have used the current (possibly underpriced) value of carbon in the UK ETS market as a conservative indication of a potential source of revenue. This is subject to change based on the carbon intensity of the grid, the price of carbon, and other regulatory changes in emissions trading.  We have also started to estimate other outcomes. These include social outcomes (e.g. fuel poverty alleviation), health outcomes (e.g. excess winter mortality, respiratory hospitalisations), and environmental outcomes (e.g. reduction of NOx emissions), with more in the pipeline. These are high-level back-of-envelope estimations using data as specific to the context (Link Road / Birmingham / West Midlands / UK) as possible. We are also in the process of reviewing approaches of modelling precedents, such as the <a href="https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/The-Multiple-Benefits-of-Deep-Retrofits-A-toolkit-for-cities?language=en_US">C40 Cities model</a>, <a href="https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/what-we-do/research/research-cost-benefit-analysis/">GMCA’s Unit Cost Database</a>, or the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/energy-models/models/hideem">UK Government’s HIDEEM model</a>, as a way of informing our own modelling methodology.   Emerging findings &amp; next&nbsp;steps <p>The model is preliminary and requires substantial development as part of the second stage of work. The following points are findings that are beginning to&nbsp;emerge.</p>  Energy savings make the biggest contribution in the average household. This range could be around 15–30% of up front costs depending on capitalisation assumptions, modelled savings, lifestyle and poverty of household etc. At the time of writing, energy costs are rising and there is a general expectation that OFGEM will increase the tariff cap. Without further intervention this will result in greater fuel poverty, but will further strengthen the case for using energy savings as part of the&nbsp;model.  Carbon emissions savings (if traded) makes up around 10–20% of the up front capital if this can be realised. Alternative avenues beyond the ETS system should be considered as a way of realising the value of these emission&nbsp;savings.  The potential revenue from other spillover values such as health appear to be small based on the first tranche of research. However, we are seeing in some implemented projects, such as Warm Homes Oldham which is co-funded by the local public health service, <a href="http://shura.shu.ac.uk/15738/">where estimated savings to public healthcare are on a comparable scale to energy savings</a>. This requires further exploration and verification and does not rule out the viability of capturing these spillover values when they are aggregated across neighbourhoods and considered at a city scale (as proposed by the Transitioning Together model). This means that the contractual, technological and other mechanisms to allow this value capture would have to be tested at a small scale, albeit with negligible returns, in order for this to be scaled. This would also help us understand if the returns on these values can be efficiently measured and distributed.  <p>We are now entering the Strategic Design phase of the project. This has a number of strands. For the impact and finance workstream we&nbsp;will:</p>  Refine and test the assumptions and modelling approach.  Improve our understanding of the scale at which different elements of the model would work best, both in terms of any internal cross-subsidy required, but also in terms of efficiency.  Shortlist the liability holders and commence discussions with them, to test the political viability of outcome contracting.  Build a legible, user-friendly model that can be used in engagement with residents and other stakeholders  <p>We’ll be posting further updates of our progress as the work progresses.

   A digital wallet is a software program designed to keep your digital assets safe and secure. It can be used to store cryptocurrencies, verifiable credentials, and&nbsp;more.  These digital wallets can be broadly categorized into custodial and non-custodial wallets, depending on the level of control you have over your wallet. Specifically, this categorization is based on who stores the private keys

<p>A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a> is a software program designed to keep your digital assets safe and secure. It can be used to store cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/verifiable-credentials-in-bens-serendipity-b9acfa10f131">verifiable credentials</a>, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>These digital wallets can be broadly categorized into custodial and non-custodial wallets, depending on the level of control you have over your wallet. Specifically, this categorization is based on who stores the private keys of your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Before we jump into the differences, let’s recap how wallets work. Note that in this article, we will look only at <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/an-in-depth-exploration-of-self-sovereign-identity-and-verifiable-credentials-1a3eb2296004">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> wallets that store your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">verifiable credentials</a>.</p> Working of an SSI&nbsp;Wallet <p>Any credential such as your name, age, address, educational qualification, work experience, etc. can be issued in a digital format known as a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credential (VC)</a>. The obvious advantage of such a credential is that it is highly portable, easy to share, machine-verifiable, secure, and tamper-proof because it is cryptographically signed.</p><p>Here, “cryptographically-signed” means <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a> is used to secure the information contained in a VC, to prevent it from unauthorized viewing or tampering. The PKI has two parts, a private key, and a public key, and both these keys work only in&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>Every <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">verifiable credential</a> is signed by a public key and can be seen by anyone. But only the authorized people can access its contents as they will have the private key needed to unlock the public&nbsp;key.</p><p>The same principle applies to a wallet too. You need its private key to open the wallet and view or share the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-openbadges-vs-verifiable-credentials-d504c054d5db">verifiable credentials</a> stored in it. This is akin to a password.</p><p>From this standpoint, we can say that the entity that stores and maintains the private key of the wallet is its custodian.</p> Custodial Wallets <p>A custodial wallet is a type of digital wallet where the organization that offers this service holds the private key needed to open the wallet and access its contents. Here, the organization is the custodian of the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Advantages of Custodial Wallets <p>So, what are the advantages that come with custodial wallets?</p>  Most custodial wallets are web-based and hence, device agnostic. You can access these wallets from any part of the world, and need just a browser and Internet.  Highly convenient  The holder doesn’t have the responsibility to remember the password or the private&nbsp;key.  Extensible, as many organizations offer the same wallet for storing not just VCs, but also cryptos and other digital assets going&nbsp;forward.   Disadvantages of Custodial Wallets <p>Custodial wallets are not perfect, as they come with some shortcomings as&nbsp;well.</p>  The password is stored in the servers of a third party, and this can make it a lot less&nbsp;secure.  Requires considerable research to identify a secure and reputable wallet.  Custodial wallets come with a&nbsp;fee.  <p>In all, a custodial wallet is a convenient and extensible option for storing your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-vs-verifiable-credentials-vcs-cd0ebb13f1fb">verifiable credentials</a>. It takes the responsibility of storing and remembering passwords from the user, but at the same time, brings a third party into the transaction, thereby making it a lot less secure. Furthermore, the organization that controls the wallet’s keys can determine in the future how and where its contents can be&nbsp;used.</p> What are Non-Custodial Wallets? <p>As the name suggests, non-custodial wallets are those wallets that are solely controlled by the owner. In other words, you are the only one who knows the password to open the wallet, and hence, you’re the only one who can access it. No other entities are involved in managing your&nbsp;wallet.</p> Advantages of Non-custodial Wallets <p>The biggest advantages of non-custodial wallets are privacy and security. Since no one other than you can access the wallet, you can be assured that its contents will never be accessible to anyone and hence, offers the highest levels of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, only you can determine how your VCs can be used, and with whom they can be shared. In this sense, non-custodial wallets adhere to the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity completely.</p> Disadvantages of Non-custodial Wallets <p>The biggest disadvantage of non-custodial wallets is their inaccessibility when you lose or forget the password. Since you are the sole custodian, there is a huge responsibility on you to always remember the password of your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>The other minor disadvantage is that non-custodial wallets can be tied down to a device, depending on its implementation.

As part of the joint development, both companies have collaborated with SAP and Novartis, which have already subjected the product to extensive quality testing and functional validation. Spherity and Legisym are pleased to officially announce their partnership as of&nbsp;today.</p>Spherity is partnering with Legisym offering a joint compliance product, Credentialing Service, for the U.S. Life Sciences&nbsp;Market.<p>In November 2013, the U.S. congress enacted the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) in order to protect patients’ health. To ensure that only legitimate actors are part of the supply chain, the regulation requires U.S. pharmaceutical trading partners to ensure that they only interact with other trading partners that are authorized. Authorized is every trading partner holding a valid state-issued license or a current registration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>Today in 2022, U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain actors have no interoperable, electronic mechanism to validate each other´s authorized status. With more than 60,000 interacting trading partners involved in the U.S. Life Sciences Industry and a FDA recommendation to respond to data requests in under one minute, a solution that provides compliance with the regulations by 2023 is in high demand. Legisym and Spherity have decided to cooperate and offer an interoperable highly secure service to enable pharmaceutical supply chain actors to become an Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) according to U.S.&nbsp;DSCSA.</p><p>Legisym, as a trusted identity and license verification service provider, perfectly complements Spherity’s digital wallet technology for managing verifiable credentials. The verifiable credential technology is used to represent the authorized status of interacting trading partners in an highly efficient, secure and DSCSA-compliant way. To use credentialing for Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) requirements under DSCSA, trading partners need to go through a one-time due diligence onboarding process with Legisym. Once the verifiable credentials are issued, they are stored in a secure digital wallet which comes embedded with the Credentialing Service provided by Spherity. Using this technology enables U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain actors to interact with digital trust, as they now can digitally verify their ATP status in every interaction.</p><p>Georg Jürgens, Manager Industry Solutions at Spherity says, “together with our partner Legisym we focused on making the adoption of credentialing for trading partners as simple as possible. Manufacturers, wholesalers and dispensers can all acquire a digital wallet and ATP credentials within minutes without integration effort and use this innovative solution for DSCSA-regulated interactions.”</p><p>“Legisym is thrilled to be working alongside Spherity to bring the first production-level ATP Credentialing solution to the industry,” said Legisym President &amp; Co-Owner David Kessler. “With the successful completion of the ATP Credentialing Pilot in 2020 and the joint founding of the Open Credentialing Initiative in early 2021, the Spherity-Legisym partnership is already proving successful in collaboration and forward thinking.”</p><p>Legisym and Spherity founded along with other adopters, the <a href="http://oc-i.org">Open Credentialing Initiative</a> (OCI). This newly formed organization incubates and standardizes the architecture using Digital Wallets and Verifiable Credentials for DSCSA compliance for Authorized Trading Partner requirements. Besides U.S pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, and dispensers, the OCI is open for solution providers integrating the ATP solution.</p><p>For press relations, contact <a href="mailto:communication@spherity.com">communication@spherity.com</a>.

<p>A credential comprises one or more claims made by the issuer of a credential about the subject. For example; a driving license containing the licensee's name, SSN, date of birth, etc is a credential where such data and details are claims made by the license issuer about the licensee which is the subject. A credential is called a verifiable credential when its authenticity can be cryptographically checked by anyone because the credential contains a cryptographic signature by the issuer, and the issuer's public key is well known. To convince a service provider, the verifier, of the authenticity of a verifiable credential, the credential along with the signature is shared with the service provider who can then verify the signature.</p><p>However, the above approach may be harmful to the user’s privacy. The entity in possession of the credential being the holder, has to share the credential in its entirety with the verifier, which may reveal a lot more information than what was needed. As an example, the holder may have wanted to share his name and date of birth from his license, not the rest of the credential data like his SSN, all while still being able to convince the verifier that he does own a verifiable credential containing his name and date of birth. This desired property is called selective disclosure where the holder can choose to disclose only parts of the credential, rather than the entire credential. </p><p>Another problem to solve is linkability. Say the holder is able to achieve selective disclosure where it only reveals part of the credential data to the verifier (the part that is sufficient for the verifier to provide service to the holder), the holder would not want the verifier to link his previous interactions with him. This desired property is called unlinkability. There are cases however when the holder is willing to be linked across several of his interactions but that should be voluntary and we do support that.</p><p>In some cases, even the above two properties might not be sufficient, for example when the holder wants to reveal part of the data -</p>  If a holder wants to prove he is over 18 or above 65 for availing a service, he doesn't need to show his date of birth; just being able to prove those conditions, called predicates is sufficient for the verifier.  For proving that he/she is not a resident of a city/state, the holder should not need to share his exact address.  For availing of social welfare, when the holder's salary is below a certain amount, the holder should not need to reveal his salary from his bank statement, but show an anonymous credential to convince the verifier of the same.  Similarly, an investor should be able to convince a verifier that the total value of his assets is greater than some amount without revealing the actual values of his assets.  <p>One of the solutions to solve the above problem is called anonymous credentials, sometimes called Attribute-Based Credentials (ABC). The main idea in anonymous credentials is that rather than considering the credential data as arbitrary bytes which are then signed by the issuer, anonymous credentials adds "structure" to the credential. Each claim in the credential is treated as an attribute and then these attributes are signed in a specific way by the issuer to create a signature. These attributes and the signature now form anonymous credentials. For example, if a credential has 3 claims made by the issuer about the holder including, name, city, and SSN, these 3 claims correspond to 3 attributes, one for each claim. Because of the "structure" in this credential, the holder can prove to a verifier, using zero-knowledge proof, that he has this credential from the issuer without revealing any of the attributes. To be precise, the holder can disclose these attributes exist and have been signed by an official issuer, without disclosing the attributes themselves or the signature. </p><p>"The holder can also reveal one or more attributes as part of the zero-knowledge proof from this anonymous credential, thus achieving selective disclosure."</p><p>“One or more zero-knowledge proofs created from the same anonymous credential cannot be linked together thus giving us unlinkability. "</p><p>To achieve both of these properties, we use a signature scheme called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/663">BBS+</a>. A useful property of BBS+ (and similar) signatures is that when using several BBS+ signatures, attributes common to the signatures can be proven equal without revealing them. For example, if you have a driving license credential and passport, both with a BBS+ signature, you can prove that your SSN attribute is the same in both your driving license and passport without revealing your SSN. This property allows linking many credentials together and is helpful in cases when you need to prove that all credentials are about the same subject (or subject id).</p><p>Because credentials are essentially attestations made by an authority, i.e. the issuer, meaning they act as evidence or proof of something, it should be possible for the authority to permanently or temporarily renounce the attestations. These revoked credentials signal that the credential should not be accepted by any verifier. This kind of signaling requires the verifier to check the unique ID against a public list of all revoked credentials. However, revealing such a unique ID goes against our unlinkability requirement, as the unique ID of the credential ties all zero-knowledge proofs created from that credential. Therefore, we need a system in which the holder can prove that the membership of their credential ID is in a list in-zero knowledge:</p>  The verifier is assured the holder’s credential ID is not in the public list of all revoked credentials  The verifier will not have access to the credential ID  This system will ensure the holder is unlinkable.  <p>For this zero-knowledge membership, we use an accumulator which is a set-like database but with a very small size and allows such zero-knowledge membership checks. Accumulators also enable other use cases where such a membership or non-membership check is required. </p><p>Say that you have a bank details credential that contains your account number as one of the attributes. To convince a regulator that your account is not in a "suspicious-accounts" list, you can prove to the regulator that your account is not in the accumulator which contains all suspicious accounts. We use a pairing-based accumulator called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/777">VB accumulator</a>.</p><p>Some other common requirements with anonymous credentials is being able to prove conditions or predicates about the attributes like proving total income from a bank statement credential is less than the limit. Here the total income might not be a single attribute but composed of several attributes with one attribute per income source. Therefore, the attributes need to be added together before comparing to the limit amount, some cases may need more complex operations on one or more attributes. </p><p>These capabilities are not possible with BBS+ alone, and we therefore use zk-SNARK which can be used to prove arbitrary conditions on the attributes. The zk-SNARK we use is the same as used in Zcash but <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">adapted</a> to be linked with the BBS+ signature.</p><p>Anonymous credentials offer great privacy but too much privacy can sometimes be crippling for regulators or law enforcement. Consider an exchange as a verifier that allows customers to make transactions after they prove possession of a government ID, but does not ask for any other information. At any point, a regulator or law enforcement may want to know details of who made certain transactions, but the only information the verifier has and is able to provide, is that someone made the transactions with a government ID. </p><p>This isn’t sufficient for the regulator or law enforcement, traceability is needed here. However, not everyone in this chain needs traceability, certain authorities are the ones in need of it. We solve this problem by a technique called verifiable encryption.</p><p>Using the example above, a customer who possesses a government ID should be required to encrypt their SSN for the regulator without revealing the SSN itself. Authorities can decrypt the SSN and track who the government ID belongs to, while the customer is assured the exchange is not able to track them, only the authorities who need to trace them. Note that verifiable encryption is not mandatory with Dock credentials, it’s opt-in.</p>  The <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto">core cryptographic library</a> that implements the signature schemes and proof protocols is implemented in Rust.  The library contains different primitives in separate crates. The notable ones are <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/bbs_plus">BBS+ signatures</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/vb_accumulator">accumulators</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/proof_system">composite proof system</a>.  The composite proof system allows us to combine these primitives like proving knowledge of 2 BBS+ signatures with proof of accumulator membership.  <p>Since a large part of this code needs to run in a Javascript environment like a browser or a react native app, we built a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm">WASM wrapper</a> over the Rust code. The wrapper is quite thin and mostly does deserialization/serialization logic. It intentionally lacks abstractions like classes and is just some modules with free-floating functions. Finally, there is a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts">Typescript library</a> that uses the WASM wrapper and provides various abstractions like creating signatures, proofs, accumulators. &nbsp;</p><p>As verification of proofs and accumulator membership/non-membership requires publicly available authenticated storage, we deployed the ability to post BBS+ and accumulator public keys on our chain and also to create, update and remove accumulators. The changes have been live on the mainnet for some time and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/src/modules/bbs-plus.js">corresponding</a> <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/src/modules/accumulator.js">modules</a> and tests are added in SDK for <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/bbs-plus.test.js">BBS+</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/accumulator.test.js">accumulators</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/demo.test.js">composite proof</a> by fetching objects from the chain.</p><p>For a more detailed explanation of the primitives, see <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#overview">the explainer</a> in the GitHub repo. The usage with examples is described <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#usage">here</a>. It is broken down into the following sections:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#bbs-signatures-1">BBS+ signature</a>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#accumulators">Accumulator</a>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#composite-proofs-1">Composite proof system</a>  <p>The composite proof subsection shows several examples like <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a>, creating proofs over <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#multiple-bbs-signatures">multiple BBS+ signatures</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#bbs-signature-together-with-accumulator-membership">BBS+ signature with accumulator membership</a>, getting <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#getting-a-blind-signature">blind BBS+ signature</a>, meaning even the issuer is not aware of certain attributes, and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#verifier-local-or-opt-in-linkability">opt-in linkability</a> where the holder chooses to be linkable across several proofs of his credential, but only at a certain verifier.</p><p>We are exploring options for predicates like range proofs, verifiable encryption, and support for arbitrary computation on credential data in general, but we have PoCs for showing that they work with BBS+ signatures.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/cp-snark-bbs">PoC</a> shows the usage of BBS+ and <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">LegoGroth16</a>, which is an adaptation of Groth16, the zk-SNARK used in Zcash. The PoC shows how to:</p>  Prove that some attribute of a BBS+ signature satisfies some bound that can be used to prove that age is less than or greater than some number  Prove that the sum of certain attributes satisfy a certain bound which can be used to prove that the sum of liabilities is less than some number.  Prove that sum of certain attributes of 1 credential is less than the sum of certain attributes of another credential, which can be used to prove that the sum of liabilities is less than the sum of assets.  <p>This <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/saver-poc/saver">PoC</a> shows verifiable encryption based on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1270">SAVER</a>. We show in <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/blob/saver-poc/saver/src/tests.rs">this test</a>, that a user can verifiably encrypt any of his attributes for a third party, and convince the third party that the encryption has been correctly done. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udbhav-tiwari-b4919839/">Udbhav Tiwari</a>, Public Policy Advisor at <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>, compares the lack of data privacy protection laws in certain parts of the world to the&nbsp;others.</p><p>We have often spoken about the relevance of Web3 and decentralization in our podcast. Still, it is essential to talk about pioneers in the Web2 space fighting for free internet and data privacy. They are the advocates working with governments for data regulations that protect internet users. One of such organizations is Mozilla. In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we talked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udbhav-tiwari-b4919839/">Udbhav Tiwari</a>, Public Policy Advisor at Mozilla. During this discussion, he explains the role of Mozilla in the free internet ecosystem, data regulations discrepancies in the Asia Pacific and particularly India, and more. Here are edited excerpts of the&nbsp;podcast.</p><p>Mozilla’s role in the internet ecosystem: 20 years of Mozilla&nbsp;Firefox</p><p>Mozilla explicitly works towards treating the internet as a global public resource that should be accessible to everyone. It does this with the help of different <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/">products such as Firefox, Pocket, and Mozilla&nbsp;VPN.</a></p><blockquote>“My role in the global public policy team at Mozilla is to also look out for laws and regulations that may impact these products. I oversee if the laws can be improved to ensure that they lead to that open Internet — I then advocate for those laws. Or if there are particularly worrying things in certain laws and regulations that would be bad, not just for Mozilla’s products, but also for the internet — I also tend to work on those issues. And so far my remit has largely been in the Asia Pacific region but I also work on some other issues globally.”</blockquote><p>The main aspects of Udbhav’s role&nbsp;are</p>  data protection and&nbsp;privacy  content regulation and intermediary liability  connectivity, encryption, and&nbsp;security  <p>The Mozilla Foundation is actually a digital rights NGO. It has fellows that work on internet health and internet security around the world. At Voices of the Data Economy, we have interviewed two fellows in the past: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/julia-reinhardt-what-do-gdpr-and-ai-regulations-mean/id1506212617?i=1000531062544">Julia Reinhardt </a>and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/anouk-ruhaak-data-trusts-and-collective-consent/id1506212617?i=1000475444072">Anouk Ruhaak</a>. The foundation has initiatives like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keb0oAMV-I4">YouTube Regrets </a>and <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/">privacy not included</a>.</p><p>Data Regulations across Asia and&nbsp;India</p><p>Udbhav mentions that Europe has had a data protection law for much longer than other parts of the world (of course, now we have&nbsp;GDPR).</p><blockquote>“Here in the Asia Pacific region, it’s quite far from being the norm even to have a data protection law in the first place. If one were to turn the clock back, I would say even ten years ago; one could easily count on two hands the number of countries in the Asia Pacific region that had a dedicated data protection law on the books. But thanks to the proliferation of technology and public demands from civil society that want better protections for users and consumers– things are changing.”</blockquote><p>Australia has had a privacy law for a fair amount of time. Still, they are actually amid re-looking at their privacy law; it’s being updated to suit modern technologies better. If one were to move a little higher up, countries like the Philippines have now had a privacy law for some time. And in fact, business imperatives around the business processing and outsourcing industry in the Philippines played a considerable role in the Philippines, even having a privacy law in the first place. Sri Lanka is also looking at a data protection law. Even countries like Indonesia have been debating data protection laws for some time, and Indonesia also now has a data protection law. However, some provisions within the law still need to be notified, or specific, like regulatory entities under the law need to be set&nbsp;up.</p><blockquote>“Even in India, the protection, the conversation around data protection has been going on for well over, I think, 12 years now, approximately, there have been different versions of different bills that different committees have proposed.”</blockquote><p>Indian data regulation law and its relation with non-personal data</p><p>The drafted data protection law in India has the following issues:</p>  The first fundamental provision is around data protection and how it applies to governments. So the law in India currently has a section, the draft law, section 35, which will allow the government to exempt any part of itself from any part of the law. Everybody understands the need for exceptions: national security for law enforcement access, and all laws worldwide contain it like the GDPR contains some exceptions. But in India, many people think it has significantly exceeded that narrow scope. Hypothetically, it can say things&nbsp;like    These 15 sections will not apply to the Reserve Bank of&nbsp;India  These five sections won’t apply to view IDI, India’s digital identity authority or  The whole law will not apply to the Intelligence Bureau OR the whole law will not apply to the CBI, India’s centralized investigation agency.    The second provision is in general, around the independence of the Data Protection Authority that this law is proposing. The Data Protection Authority is the regulator that enforces data protection laws — they are the ones you can complain to if something goes wrong with you and a Data Collector. But some individuals do proactive audits who enforce the provisions of the law. And suppose you don’t have a robust Data Protection Authority. In that case, the law becomes a toothless tiger when it comes to data protection because you can’t do anything unless there is, you know, a capable infrastructure of people who can enforce that&nbsp;law.  <p>India’s data protection law contains both the drafts and the new one as well contains some pretty strong language that splits data into three categories.</p>  Personal data  Sensitive Personal&nbsp;data  Critical Personal&nbsp;data  <blockquote>“Critical personal data isn’t defined; it’s something that the government will be able to notify, for example, they can say health data is critical, they can say that. And in these three classifications, critical data will have to stay in the country and simply cannot leave the country. Sensitive data can leave the country for a short amount of time, but a copy of that data must always be kept in the country, and personal data can currently go around when it wants to. So as you can imagine this, fundamentally like rejigs the way the internet and its infrastructure works in a very big&nbsp;way.”</blockquote><p>When it comes to non-personal data, in general, numbers, data is actually like, it has a negative definition, which is anything that isn’t personal data is nonpersonal data. So all privacy laws and data protection laws around the world fundamentally apply to personal data, right, like data that identifies an individual or has identifying characteristics. So for example, if I write a poem, right, like on a piece of paper or on Google Docs, and I don’t write any my name on it, I don’t associate it with an account, then that is actually isn’t data. Yes. Is it personal data? No. Right? Like, because, for example, imagine Amazon has the list of the top 100 products that are sold in India every day, right without who bought them without any other information, just a pure List of 100 products, top 100 products that are sold in India every day. That is an example of nonpersonal data. It is data it has its uses as inferences associated with it. But it doesn’t meet the definition of personal data, which means it doesn’t have identifying characteristics that can’t be used to identify individuals, so on and so&nbsp;forth.</p><p>India’s status in Data Regulation</p><p>India, in many ways, is trying, and some people are now openly saying it is very much trying to carve what it calls is the fourth part of internet regulation; they think that the three main dominant models&nbsp;are</p>  The United States: with the free market, very little regulation  Europe: pretty strong prescriptive regulation,  regulation in countries like China, which differs much more from the state’s&nbsp;power.  <blockquote>“I think India, in all of the issues that we have discussed, is trying to pick and choose different models from these different countries in order to be able to implement them in practice. I think it is very deliberately doing so to set an example for other similarly placed countries. So it’s not just what we do here, but it’s also how we do things in a manner that other countries can&nbsp;follow.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>2.20 -7.25: Mozilla’s role in the internet ecosystem</p><p>7.25–13.20: Data regulations in the Asia Pacific with a focus on&nbsp;India</p><p>13.20–28:35: What is non-personal data, and how are the regulations?</p><p>28.35–32:05: How should a data protection law in India look&nbsp;like?</p><p>32.05–43.06: How does big tech behave in&nbsp;India</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-governance-across-continents-what-does-it-mean-for-internet-users-39c771ab1f08">Data Governance Across Continents: What does it mean for internet users?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Bribery, theft, lost opportunities: the threats posed by corrupt politicians to communities are immense. In parallel, inadvertently facilitating the laundering of illegally-acquired funds is also a major threat for financial or virtual asset service providers. By implementing ongoing sanctions lists and PEP data screenings in their KYC process, businesses can lower their risk of regulatory fines -

 È online il nuovo sito web di InfoCert-Tinexta Group per parlare alla platea sempre più vasta ed eterogenea di utenti dei Digital Trust Services. 



 Il progetto rientra nella più ampia strategia aziendale che punta ad arricchire e rafforzare il rapporto con i clienti con esperienze d’uso personalizzate e coinvolgenti in ogni ambito. 



<p>Roma, 20 Gennaio 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, annuncia il rilascio della nuova versione di infocert.it, il sito web dedicato all’offerta di soluzioni tra cui PEC, Firma Digitale, Marche temporali, Conservazione Digitale, Fatturazione Elettronica e SPID.</p>



<p>Il radicale rinnovo di infocert.it ha grande valore strategico per l’azienda, anche per il suo ruolo di porta d’accesso della clientela, in particolare PMI e Professionisti e privati, al mondo dei trust services: sono oltre 1 milione i clienti dell’ecommerce InfoCert ed il sito ogni anno registra oltre 100 Milioni di pagine visitate.</p>



<p>Inoltre, questa prima release del sito è la chiave di comunicazione digitale di InfoCert in Europa. Infatti, le aziende del gruppo InfoCert verranno allineate a questo nuovo format, con l‘obiettivo ambizioso di rendere sempre più riconoscibile l’immagine e l’offerta del gruppo InfoCert. Questo elemento è stato fondamentale per determinare la scelta attuale di User Experience e Look&amp;Feel, in quanto ha l’importante ruolo di comunicare non solo un marchio all’estero, ma soprattutto di intercettare le esigenze di geografie e culture diverse.</p>



<p>Il progetto è in continua evoluzione: già entro il primo trimestre del 2022, è prevista la trasformazione della sezione di e-commerce nonché la creazione di aree dedicate a specifici target di clientela.</p>



<p>Il nuovo sito si distingue per quattro caratteristiche principali:</p>



  Completo: gli utenti possono trovare sul sito non solo le informazioni su tutti i prodotti dell’offerta InfoCert per digitalizzare il proprio business, ma anche lo spazio per comprendere meglio il mondo dei servizi di digital trust.  Chiaro: le informazioni sono sintetiche, precise e facilmente consultabili anche grazie a numerosi video tutorial.  Conversazionale: lo stile punta su fruibilità e informalità, anche grazie a un uso di immagini coinvolgenti e rappresentative dei principali target.  Contemporaneo: il design risponde non solo a specifiche esigenze funzionali, ma è anche in linea con i più recenti e innovativi canoni estetici e qualitativo-esperienziali.  



<p>In sintesi, il nuovo sito web è in 4C per un’esperienza inedita, personale e coinvolgente su qualsiasi dispositivo, innanzitutto mobile.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Il nuovo portale vuole essere in linea con l’evoluzione del posizionamento di InfoCert, realtà tutta italiana che si è fortemente posizionata come leader in Italia dei servizi di Digital Trust e che negli ultimi anni sta adottando una strategia sempre più globale in Europa e non solo. Questo nuovo sito è solo la prima tappa di una strategia più ampia di cui si vedranno pienamente i risultati nei prossimi mesi.

Per continuare, e addirittura accelerare, il percorso di successo intrapreso da anni. Puntiamo al consolidamento e all’arricchimento del rapporto di conoscenza e fiducia con tutti i nostri sempre più numerosi interlocutori. Questo è dovuto essenzialmente ad una vera e propria esplosione, causata in larga parte anche dall’evento pandemico, della digitalizzazione sia in ambito professionale che non. A questo si aggiunge una platea internazionale crescente, vista la nostra dimensione sempre più globale”</p>Marco Lauro, Director Web &amp; Inside Sales InfoCert – Tinexta Group</blockquote>

  <p>UI designers and front-end developers are tasked with creating clean and consistent user interfaces. At the same time, testing is a cornerstone of software development. Each part of a software project is tested individually and isolated from the other elements in unit tests. This practice has been challenging to achieve in the context of user interfaces.</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> provides an open-source framework that lets you test UI components in isolation from the rest of the website. Storybook presents you with a browser of all the components in your web application. You can test each component independently and in different configurations. The tool runs as a separate application outside your main application, which means that you can test your components without worrying about application-specific dependencies or requirements.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to use Storybook to create a simple <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> application. The application will be a unit conversion app, and I will use Storybook to showcase the individual components and the application page itself. I will not assume any prior knowledge of React or Storybook. I will assume that you are familiar with JavaScript and Node, and have an up-to-date version of the <code>npm</code> packet manager installed on your computer.</p>

 Creating React components with Storybook 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to create a React application and implement components displayed in Storybook. These components will serve as the basis for the unit conversion application. To start, open a terminal in a folder of your choice and run the following command to create a new React application.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app@5 react-storybook --use-npm
</code>   

<p>The <code>create-react-app</code> command creates a new folder, <code>react-storybook</code>, and initialises a basic application skeleton. Next, turn this basic React app into a Storybook application. Navigate into the newly created folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx sb@6 init
</code>   

<p>When prompted, answer yes to install the <code>sb</code> package. Initializing Storybook will create a new folder, <code>stories</code> inside the <code>src</code> folder, and populate it with some pre-made demo components and stories to be used by Storybook. Open the project folder in your favourite IDE.</p>

<p>You can test out storybook straight away. Open a terminal session in the project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm run storybook
</code>   

<p>The command runs the Storybook app and opens a browser tab (http://localhost:6006). For now, you will only see the components that Storybook installs by default. You can keep Storybook running while you develop your app.</p>

<p>Using your IDE, create a new file named <code>src/stories/Components.jsx</code>. This will be the module that will contain some basic UI components. For the sake of this tutorial, I will place all these components into a single module. In practice, you might want to spread them out over several files. Open <code>src/stories/Components.jsx</code> and paste in the following code.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import './Components.css';

export function Input({ size, type, label, name, placeholder, onChange }) {
  return (
    &lt;label className={`input-component input-component--${size}`}&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;{label}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;input
        type={type==='text' ? 'text' : 'number'}
        step={type==='floating-point' ? 'any' : undefined}
        name={name}
        placeholder={placeholder}
        onChange={onChange}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
  );
};

Input.propTypes = {
  size: PropTypes.oneOf(['medium', 'large']),
  type: PropTypes.oneOf(['text', 'number', 'floating-point']),
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  placeholder: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  onChange: PropTypes.func,
};

Input.defaultProps = {
  size: 'medium',
  type: 'text',
  label: 'Enter a value',
  name: 'input',
  placeholder: 'Please enter a value',
  onChange: undefined
};

export function Select({ size, label, options, onChange }) {
  return (
    &lt;label className={`select-component select-component--${size}`}&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;{label}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;select className="select-component" onChange={onChange}&gt;
        {options.map((option) =&gt; &lt;option value={option.value}&gt;{option.description}&lt;/option&gt;)}
      &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
  );
};

Select.propTypes = {
  size: PropTypes.oneOf(['medium', 'large']),
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  options: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({
    value: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    description: PropTypes.string.isRequired
  })).isRequired,
  onChange: PropTypes.func,
};

Select.defaultProps = {
  size: 'medium',
  label: 'Options',
  options: []
};

export function Tabs({ children }) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(0);

  const onTabClick = (newActive) =&gt; () =&gt; {
    setActive(() =&gt; newActive);
  };

  return (
    &lt;div className="tabs-component"&gt;
      &lt;div className="tabs-row"&gt;
        {children.map((child, index) =&gt; &lt;div className={`tab ${index === active ? "active" : ""}`} onClick={onTabClick(index)}&gt;{child.props.label}&lt;/div&gt;)}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="tabs-content"&gt;
        {children[active]}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

Tabs.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.instanceOf(Array).isRequired,
};

Tabs.defaultProps = {
  children: []
};
</code>   

<p>This module exports three components. <code>Input</code> is a configurable <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with a label for entering text or numbers, <code>Select</code> is a dropdown <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element wrapped in a label, and <code>Tabs</code> is a component that shows its children in a separate tab. I am using the React feature <code>propTypes</code> to specify the properties that each React component expects as arguments, allowing Storybook to extract this meta-information and display it to the user. To provide a bit of styling for the components, create a file <code>src/stories/Components.css</code>, and fill it with the following contents.</p>

   <code>.input-component {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.input-component span {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

.input-component.input-component--large input {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.select-component {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.select-component span {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

.select-component.select-component--large select {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.tabs-component .tabs-row {
  font-family: 'Nunito Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  display: flex;
}

.tabs-component .tabs-row .tab {
  border: 1px solid #EEEEEE;
  border-bottom: none;
  border-top-right-radius: 4px;
  border-top-left-radius: 4px;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.tabs-component .tabs-row .tab.active {
  background-color: #EEEEEE;
  cursor: auto;
}

.tabs-component .tabs-content {
  border: 1px solid #EEEEEE;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}
</code>   

<p>With this, the components are usable as React components in your application. But you also want them to be browsable through Storybook. For this, you will need to create one file for each component. Start by creating a file <code>src/stories/Input.stories.jsx</code> and enter the following code in it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

import { Input } from './Components';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Input',
  component: Input,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Input {...args} /&gt;;

export const Normal = Template.bind({});

Normal.args = {
  label: 'Normal Input',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'normal'
};

export const Large = Template.bind({});

Large.args = {
  label: 'Large Input',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'large'
};

export const Number = Template.bind({});

Number.args = {
  label: 'Integer Number',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'large',
  type: 'number'
};

export const FloatingPoint = Template.bind({});

FloatingPoint.args = {
  label: 'Floating Point Number',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'large',
  type: 'floating-point'
};
</code>   

<p>The <code>export default</code> at the top of the file tells Storybook what the component’s name is and which React component the stories in this file refer to. The subsequent exports <code>Normal</code>, <code>Large</code>, <code>Number</code>, and <code>FloatingPoint</code> represent individual stories or use cases for that component. Each story defines a member <code>args</code> that specifies the properties to pass to the component. Creating stories in this way is quick, so now create the next one for the <code>Select</code> component. Create a file <code>src/stories/Select.stories.jsx</code> and paste the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

import { Select } from './Components';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Select',
  component: Select,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Select {...args} /&gt;;

export const Default = Template.bind({});

Default.args = {
  size: 'medium',
  label: 'Select an Option',
  options: [
    { value: 'a', description: 'Option A' },
    { value: 'b', description: 'Option B' },
    { value: 'c', description: 'Option C' },
  ]
};

export const Large = Template.bind({});

Large.args = {
  size: 'large',
  label: 'Select an Option',
  options: [
    { value: 'a', description: 'Option A' },
    { value: 'b', description: 'Option B' },
    { value: 'c', description: 'Option C' },
  ]
};
</code>   

<p>This file defines two stories for the <code>Select</code> component. One story shows it in normal size, and the other shows it in a large size. Finally, do the same for the <code>Tabs</code> component. Create a file <code>src/stories/Tabs.stories.jsx</code> and fill it with the contents below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

import { Tabs } from './Components';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Tabs',
  component: Tabs,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Tabs {...args} /&gt;;

export const Default = Template.bind({});

Default.args = {
  children: [
    &lt;div label="One"&gt;Content One&lt;/div&gt;,
    &lt;div label="Two"&gt;Content Two&lt;/div&gt;,
    &lt;div label="Three"&gt;Content Three&lt;/div&gt;,
  ]
};
</code>   

<p>Now, you are ready to test out your new components in Storybook. If you haven’t done so already, open the terminal in the project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm run storybook
</code>   

<p>The command runs the Storybook app and opens a browser tab (http://localhost:6006). You can browse the components in the left sidebar. The stories you just created can be found under the Components header, and when you select, for example, the Input -&gt; Number story, you should see something like shown in the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The component shows up in the main view, and the icons above let you change the background, the screen size, and even allow you to check the dimensions of the component’s layout. Below the main view, you can manually adjust the options passed to the component. I invite you to play around with all the features Storybook provides.</p>

 Creating the unit converter application using Storybook component stories 

<p>I will use the <code>convert-units</code> library to implement the unit conversion app. Open a second terminal in your project folder and run the command below.</p>

   <code>npm install -E convert-units@2.3.4
</code>   

<p>Now, in your IDE, create a new file, <code>src/stories/Converter.jsx</code>, and fill it with the contents below.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import * as convert from 'convert-units';
import { Input, Select } from './Components';

export const Converter = ({measure}) =&gt; {
  const possibilities = convert().possibilities(measure).map((unit) =&gt; {
      const descr = convert().describe(unit);
      return {
          value: descr.abbr,
          description: `${descr.singular} (${descr.abbr})`
      };
  });

  const [fromUnit, setFromUnit] = useState(possibilities[0].value);
  const [toUnit, setToUnit] = useState(possibilities[0].value);
  const [fromValue, setFromValue] = useState(1);
  const [toValue, setToValue] = useState(convert(1).from(fromUnit).to(toUnit));

  const updateFromUnit = (event) =&gt; {
    setFromUnit(() =&gt; event.target.value);
    setToValue(() =&gt; convert(fromValue).from(event.target.value).to(toUnit));
  };

  const updateToUnit = (event) =&gt; {
    setToUnit(() =&gt; event.target.value);
    setToValue(() =&gt; convert(fromValue).from(fromUnit).to(event.target.value));
  };

  const updateValue = (event) =&gt; {
    setFromValue(() =&gt; event.target.value);
    setToValue(() =&gt; convert(event.target.value).from(fromUnit).to(toUnit));
  };
  
  return &lt;div className="converter"&gt;
      &lt;Select label="From:" options={possibilities} onChange={updateFromUnit}&gt;&lt;/Select&gt;
      &lt;Select label="To:" options={possibilities} onChange={updateToUnit}&gt;&lt;/Select&gt;
      &lt;Input label="Value:" type="floating-point" onChange={updateValue}&gt;&lt;/Input&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;{fromValue} {fromUnit} = {toValue} {toUnit}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
};

Converter.propTypes = {
  measure: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

Input.defaultProps = {
  measure: 'length'
};
</code>   

<p>The component takes a single property called <code>measure</code>, which specifies the type of units to be converted and can be something like <code>mass</code> or <code>length</code>. The code for this component then consists of four parts. The first action is to query the <code>convert-units</code> library for all the possible unit conversion options. Units are mapped into an array of objects, ready to use with the <code>Select</code> component. In the next part, you’ll define four state properties, followed by three event handlers. These will react to a change in the user input and update the state accordingly. These event handlers contain the actual calls to the <code>convert-units</code> library where the unit conversion happens. Finally, the component is put together from all the parts and returned. You can also create a story for this more complex component with the individual components. Create a file <code>src/stories/Converter.stories.jsx</code> and paste in the following contents.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Converter } from './Converter';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Converter',
  component: Converter,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Converter {...args} /&gt;;

export const Default = Template.bind({});

Default.args = {
  measure: 'length'
};

export const Mass = Template.bind({});

Mass.args = {
  measure: 'mass'
};
</code>   

<p>When you installed Storybook with the <code>npx sb</code> command, the initialization script added a few components as examples to demonstrate Storybook’s capabilities. You will be reusing two of these components for the unit-conversion app. 
Open <code>src/stories/Header.jsx</code> and replace its contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { Button } from './Button';
import './header.css';

export const Header = ({ user, onLogin, onLogout }) =&gt; (
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;div className="wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Unit Converter&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      {user ? &lt;div&gt; Hello {user.given_name} &lt;/div&gt; : ""}
      &lt;div&gt;
        {user ? (
          &lt;Button size="small" onClick={onLogout} label="Log out" /&gt;
        ) : (
          &lt;&gt;
            &lt;Button size="small" onClick={onLogin} label="Log in" /&gt;
          &lt;/&gt;
        )}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
);

Header.propTypes = {
  user: PropTypes.shape({}),
  onLogin: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onLogout: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onCreateAccount: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

Header.defaultProps = {
  user: null,
};
</code>   

<p>I have modified the header component to show the correct application name and allow some structured user data to be passed in. In the story for the header, in file <code>src/stories/Header.stories.jsx</code>, modify the arguments passed to the <code>LoggedIn</code> story to reflect this change.</p>

   <code>LoggedIn.args = {
  user: {
    given_name: "Username"
  },
};
</code>   

<p>Now, open <code>src/stories/Page.jsx</code> and modify its contents to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { Header } from './Header';
import './page.css';
import { Tabs } from './Components';
import { Converter } from './Converter';

export const Page = ({useAuth}) =&gt; {
  const [user, login, logout] = useAuth();
  return &lt;article&gt;
    &lt;Header user={user} onLogin={login} onLogout={logout} /&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;Tabs&gt;
        &lt;Converter measure="length" label="Length" key="length"&gt;&lt;/Converter&gt;
        &lt;Converter measure="mass" label="Mass" key="mass"&gt;&lt;/Converter&gt;
        &lt;Converter measure="volume" label="Volume" key="volume"&gt;&lt;/Converter&gt;
      &lt;/Tabs&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;;
}

Page.propTypes = {
  useAuth: PropTypes.func.isRequired
};

Page.defaultProps = {
};
</code>   

<p>This component displays the application page, including the header and a tabbed container that allows switching between <code>Converter</code> components configured to convert different measures. The page needs a <code>useAuth</code> hook passed in that returns the user information and callbacks to log the user in or out. In the stories for the page, in <code>src/stories/Page.stories.jsx</code>, you need to create a mock function that supplies fake user data. Edit the contents of this file to look like the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Page } from './Page';

export default {
  title: 'Pages/Page',
  component: Page,
};

const mockUseAuth = (loggedIn) =&gt; () =&gt; [
  loggedIn ? {given_name: "Username"} : undefined, 
  () =&gt; {}, 
  () =&gt; {}
];

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Page useAuth={mockUseAuth(true)} {...args}/&gt;;

export const LoggedIn = Template.bind({});
LoggedIn.args = {
  useAuth: mockUseAuth(true),
};

LoggedIn.parameters = {
  controls: { hideNoControlsWarning: true },
};

export const LoggedOut = Template.bind({});
LoggedOut.args = {
  useAuth: mockUseAuth(false),
};

LoggedOut.parameters = {
  controls: { hideNoControlsWarning: true },
};
</code>   

<p>Note how <code>mockUseAuth</code> uses <a href="https://javascript.info/currying-partials">currying</a> to return a function that can be used as the <code>useAuth</code> hook in the <code>Page</code> component. You can now use Storybook again to test the <code>Converter</code> component and the full application page. If it’s not still running, run <code>npm run storybook</code> again. You can navigate to Pages -&gt; Page in the left sidebar, and you should see something like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

 Adding authentication with Okta to the application 

<p>You have created a page that uses an <code>useAuth</code> hook to manage user authentication. For the Storybook stories, you made a mock implementation of this hook. This section will show you how to implement the hook using Okta’s authentication service. First, register the application with Okta.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Next, install the necessary libraries. Open the terminal and run the command below.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@6.4.1 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.10.0 react-dom@17.0.2 react-router-dom@5.3.0
</code>   

<p>Open the file <code>src/index.js</code> and modify its contents to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import { App } from './App';
import { Page } from './stories/Page';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { useAuth } from './auth';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{clientID}',
  redirectUri: `/callback`,
});

function SecuredRoutes(props) {
  const history = useHistory();
  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
    history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
  };
  
  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/" exact render={(props) =&gt; &lt;App {...props} useAuth={useAuth}/&gt;} /&gt;
      &lt;SecureRoute path="/converter" exact render={(props) =&gt; &lt;Page {...props} useAuth={useAuth}/&gt;} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;SecuredRoutes /&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

reportWebVitals();
</code>   

<p>Here <code>{yourClientID}</code> is the client ID that you obtained earlier and <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> is your Okta domain. This change does several things. The <code>oktaAuth</code> instance provides a global authentication singleton. The main <code>render</code> function now contains a <code>Router</code> element that allows the application to navigate different routes. Finally, <code>SecuredRoutes</code> is a component that wraps the routes in a <code>Security</code> component. This component makes a <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook available for all components contained within it. Inside this component, you define the routes. Note how you pass a <code>useAuth</code> hook into the <code>App</code> and the <code>Page</code> components. Create a new file <code>src/auth.js</code> and add the following code to implement this hook.</p>

   <code>import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

export const useAuth = () =&gt; {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (authState?.isAuthenticated) {
      if (!user) {
        oktaAuth.getUser().then(setUser);
      }
    } else {
      setUser(null);
    }
  }, [authState, user, oktaAuth]);

  const login = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect('/');
  const logout = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signOut('/');

  return [user, login, logout];
};
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to modify the existing <code>App</code> component to use the authentication hook. Open <code>src/App.js</code> and adjust the content to look like this.</p>

   <code>import './App.css';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Header } from './stories/Header';

export const App = ({useAuth}) =&gt; {
  const [user, login, logout] = useAuth();

  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;Header user={user} onLogin={login} onLogout={logout} /&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Unit Converter&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;Link to="/converter"&gt;Go to the app!&lt;/Link&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Congratulations, you have completed your React application with Storybook. You can now open the console in the project folder and run the following command to start the app.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>You should see the application’s front page in your browser. When you click the  Go to the app! link, you’ll log in on the Okta page. After successfully signing in, you will redirect to the unit converter page, which looks like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

 Learn more about React, Storybook, and Single-Page Apps 

<p>In this tutorial, I have shown you how to create a React application and use Storybook to browse the application’s components. Storybook is a great tool that can enhance your development workflow.</p>
 
   It lets you view and test your components in isolation. 
   You can specify the location of each component in a hierarchical menu and then browse through the components in your browser. 
   You can have multiple stories showcasing different use cases for each component. 
   You can also modify the component parameters and see the impact on the visual appearance in real time. 
   Storybook can keep running during the development process, and it will reflect any changes you make to your code. 
 

<p>The application you wrote was a simple unit-conversion app. I guided you on using the <code>convert-units</code> library to convert length, mass, and volume. You assembled the individual components to create a larger component containing multiple input elements. I have shown you how Storybook lets you create stories, test these complex components, and complete application pages.</p>

 Protecting customer data will continue to be an urgent issue for businesses worldwide in 2022. The risks and requirements are not going away. 



<p></p>



<p>In 2021 we saw users demanding and gaining more control over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. Big tech/ad tech took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/16/big-tech-critics-mustered-their-forces-2021/">more hits</a> to their data-driven business models, even while introducing variously effective “privacy” measures (such as Google phasing out&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">third party cookies</a>&nbsp;and scrapping app developers access to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/google-makes-genuine-privacy-move-by-scrapping-ad-ids-for-users-who-opt-out-of-targeted-ads/">ad IDs</a>&nbsp;and Apple introducing the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">ATT</a>&nbsp;feature and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">privacy labels</a>&nbsp;in the App Store). When&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/the-whatsapp-facebook-signal-issue-explained-and-why-mysudo-is-the-best-solution/">WhatsApp</a>&nbsp;caused global outrage by demanding its 2 billion-plus users consent to sharing their personal data with Facebook, and Elon Musk switched millions of those users to private messaging app Signal with a two-word tweet, the world was never surer that consumers are tired of trading their personal information for access to services. This sentiment is only intensifying.</p>



<p>Throughout 2021, the regulatory landscape expanded, placing even greater compliance burdens on business and making cross-border data transfers more difficult.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/businesses-face-rising-cybersecurity-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;and the mass move to remote working environments continued to demand businesses find ways to protect employee devices and secure corporate data and resources as cybersecurity threats ramped up. Contact tracing also amplified the risks of sharing and storing personal information.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/cisco-the-age-of-privacy-has-arrived-helped-by-covid-19/">Cisco</a>&nbsp;confirmed the pandemic had seriously elevated the importance of data privacy as a business priority and, as we enter the third year of the pandemic, this imperative hasn’t changed. Privacy budgets and resourcing skyrocketed among businesses in response, and governments and health authorities are still struggling to balance public health with protecting personal privacy.</p>



 Obviously, data privacy will remain firmly on the agenda in 2022, so the big trends to watch for are: 



<p></p>



<p></p>



 Privacy regulations and compliance obligations will continue to expand and tighten in the US and globally.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>&nbsp;(IAPP) quotes Goodwin Partner and IAPP Senior Fellow, Omer Tene as saying,&nbsp;“In 2022, expect an avalanche of new laws and regulations, attempting to govern and impose order on a dizzying array of tech developments. New regulatory efforts will range from data protection laws in India and China to AI regulation in the EU to automated decision making rules in US states. Add to that a flurry of enforcement activities, and you get a perfect storm of tech regulation.”<br><br>But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">Tene</a>&nbsp;says it’s unlikely the US will gets its long awaited national privacy law in 2022, but at least six states will move to pass their own (Maryland, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida and Alaska), and it will be interesting to see whether any of those states includes a&nbsp;<a href="https://lawrina.com/blog/private-right-of-action/#:~:text=According%20to%20Federal%20law%2C%20a,legal%20violations%20under%20a%20statute.">private right of action</a>&nbsp;(PRA) —because, if they don’t, the game could change. “A couple of years ago, conventional wisdom was that the more states pass privacy laws, the greater the pressure will build on the business community, and consequently Congress, to pass preemptive federal legislation. Absent a PRA, however, an interesting dynamic may develop, where the more state privacy laws, the less appetite businesses – who are growing accustomed to complying with the emerging (PRA-less) state framework – have for federal pre-emption,” Tene says.</p>



<p>More tech legislation will flow out of Europe too. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">Tene</a>&nbsp;calls it&nbsp;“a veritable alphabet soup of tech regulation affecting digital platforms, digital services, online marketing, data intermediaries and more …”. The&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206">AI Act</a>, affecting algorithmic decision making across the economy, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-data-act">Data Act</a>, which broadens legal obligations, including cross-border transfer restrictions, to non-personal data will also be things to watch.</p>



 We’ll see more regulatory enforcement.  



<p></p>



<p>Governments in the US and Europe are expected to ramp up regulatory enforcement around breach reporting and risk reporting. GDPR enforcement increased in 2021 and this is set to continue. Tene says, “Importantly, regulators are expanding the lens from an early focus on data breaches to challenging companies’ legal bases for processing data and, notably, cross-border data flows. In 2022, expect an additional step up the enforcement ladder. We expect regulators to focus on issues such as protecting children’s data, restricting the use of sensitive health and financial information, and curbing the excess of digital marketing.” Of course, if greater enforcement is to happen, the regulators will need to be adequately resourced. Enforcement times are not getting any shorter on the complex cases. It will also be long overdue. For example, the Schrems II decision was in the middle of 2020 and there has been very minimal (if any?) enforcement action resulting from that change.&nbsp;</p>



 More limits on big tech/ad tech.  



<p></p>



<p>Regulators, the media and the general public have big tech/ad tech firmly in their sights and will continue to demand more privacy-first data tracking and sharing practices and business models. As we&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/consumers-could-gain-from-ftcs-stronger-focus-on-data-protection/">reported</a>&nbsp;last year,&nbsp;the Federal Trade Commission could go harder on consumer privacy protection and cybersecurity with President Biden’s recent nomination of digital “privacy hawk” and law professor&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/alvaro-bedoya-ftc-biden/">Alvaro Bedoya</a>&nbsp;and House Democrats’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/09/democrats-tech-reconciliation/">proposal</a>&nbsp;to allocate $1 billion for a new privacy and data security bureau.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tene notes: “Under the leadership of new Chair Lina Khan, the FTC has issued strong&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/eAgenda/StaticContent/202110/Statement_3084_FTC.pdf">statements and strategic plans</a>&nbsp;for broad&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202110&amp;RIN=3084-AB69">rulemaking</a>&nbsp;efforts, including rules to curb “abuses stemming from surveillance-based business models” and “lax security practices” and to “ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination.” But he notes this in part depends on Bedoya’s appointment proceeding in the Senate, which may not be quick.&nbsp;</p>



 Consumers will continue to favor brands that are genuinely good, honest stewards of their personal data.

<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">Cisco</a>&nbsp;released research findings in October 2021 which it says, ”demonstrates the growing importance of privacy to the individual and its implications on the businesses and governments that serve them.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">Eighty-six per cent</a>&nbsp;of respondents said they care about data privacy and want more control, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">79 percent</a>&nbsp;said they’d be willing to vote with their wallet and not support businesses that don’t protect their data and would indeed pay for better data protection.

Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-194-the-party-is-over-589625d2283c">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI — <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/trusted-airdrops-with-globalid-cf7cd6b51797">Trusted Airdrops with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a></p><p>This week:</p>  Can you trust your million dollar&nbsp;NFT?  What people are&nbsp;saying  The question of atoms v.&nbsp;bits  Tweet of the week — guy who created Ethereum&nbsp;edition  The investment everyone is talking&nbsp;about  Stuff happens   1. Can you trust your million dollar&nbsp;NFT? Bored Ape Yacht&nbsp;Club<p>One of the fundamental novelties of NFTs is that the framework has brought a sense of scarcity and permanence to a place — the internet — that has historically been of abundance and transience.</p><p>That NFTs exist on decentralized blockchains further gives users a sense of ownership over their items — perfect for digital collectibles and other use cases such as&nbsp;gaming.</p><p>But how permanent are NFTs really? And how decentralized are they actually?</p><p>That’s one of Moxie Marlinspike’s points from a blog post last week on his “<a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">first impressions of web3</a> (via /rcb) that’s making the rounds in the cryptosphere.</p><p>Here’s Moxie on the problem with&nbsp;NFTs:</p><blockquote>Most people think of images and digital art when they think of NFTs, but NFTs generally do not store that data on-chain. For most NFTs of most images, that would be much too expensive.</blockquote><blockquote>Instead of storing the data on-chain, NFTs instead contain a URL that points to the data. What surprised me about the standards was that there’s no hash commitment for the data located at the URL. Looking at many of the NFTs on popular marketplaces being sold for tens, hundreds, or millions of dollars, that URL often just points to some VPS running Apache somewhere. Anyone with access to that machine, anyone who buys that domain name in the future, or anyone who compromises that machine can change the image, title, description, etc for the NFT to whatever they’d like at any time (regardless of whether or not they “own” the token). There’s nothing in the NFT spec that tells you what the image “should” be, or even allows you to confirm whether something is the “correct” image.</blockquote><blockquote>So as an experiment, I made an NFT that changes based on who is looking at it, since the web server that serves the image can choose to serve different images based on the IP or User Agent of the requester. For example, it looked <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307/1">one way</a> on OpenSea, <a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307:1?tab=details">another way</a> on Rarible, but when you buy it and view it from your crypto wallet, it will always display as a large [poop] emoji. What you bid on isn’t what you get. There’s nothing unusual about this NFT, it’s how the NFT specifications are built. Many of the highest priced NFTs could turn into [poop] emoji at any time; I just made it explicit.</blockquote><p>That’s the current NFT reality. But technology has never been just about code. It’s also an inherently social endeavor — as Matt Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">points out in his Money Stuff newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>The NFT does not by itself convey ownership of the underlying thing in either a legal or practical sense. It conveys ownership in some more metaphysical sense: If you buy a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, then the people who are part of the BAYC NFT community will treat you as the owner of your ape. This is essentially a social fact and can be true even if the immutable code of the blockchain says that you don’t own the ape, because you were <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3v3ny/all-my-apes-gone-nft-theft-victims-beg-for-centralized-saviors">hacked or whatever</a>. The technology is a scaffolding on which to hang a social system, but the social system is what does or does not convey “ownership” in a meaningful sense.</blockquote><p>It’s also likely that as the space develops — web3 and NFTs really only entered the mainstream conversation last year — that new solutions will emerge to address some of those technological gaps. (For instance, your NFT might be stored on Filecoin’s Interplanetary File&nbsp;System.)</p><p>But there will also be cases where some gaps can’t be addressed or more practically, it doesn’t make sense to address them with decentralized solutions.</p><p>As Moxie points out, that’s something the industry and community as a whole will continue to grapple over going forward. There are philosophical merits to decentralization, but in order to deliver a compelling and convenient product to end users, some sort of balance will be struck between the vision of a decentralized world and the efficiency of centralized solutions. (To Moxie’s point, that’s already the case with NFTs and platforms like OpenSea.)</p><p>For Moxie, it’s about expectations:</p><blockquote>This isn’t a complaint about OpenSea or an indictment of what they’ve built. Just the opposite, they’re trying to build something that works. I think we should expect this kind of platform consolidation to happen, and given the inevitability, design systems that give us what we want when that’s how things are organized. My sense and concern, though, is that the web3 community expects some other outcome than what we’re already&nbsp;seeing.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>However, even if this is just the beginning (and it very well might be!), I’m not sure we should consider that any consolation. I think the opposite might be true; it seems like we should take notice that from the very beginning, these technologies immediately tended towards centralization through platforms in order for them to be realized, that this has ~zero negatively felt effect on the velocity of the ecosystem, and that most participants don’t even know or care it’s happening. This might suggest that decentralization itself is not actually of immediate practical or pressing importance to the majority of people downstream, that the only amount of decentralization people want is the minimum amount required for something to exist, and that if not very consciously accounted for, these forces will push us further from rather than closer to the ideal outcome as the days become less&nbsp;early.</blockquote><p>All of which is hardly a radical take. Decentralization in and of itself is no panacea — even if it is a cornerstone for where we’re evolving&nbsp;toward.</p><p>And as web3 continues to grow in prominence and end product, these conversations will only continue and new gaps will be identified.</p><p>One gap that will command increasing focus in 2022 is the question of identity. If technology is a fundamentally social endeavor, we need to know who we’re dealing with, whether from a personal, community, or regulatory perspective.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— Moxie Marlinspike: <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">My first impressions of&nbsp;web3</a>  Matt Levin e— <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">Web3 Takes Trust&nbsp;Too</a>  <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-web3-debate">The Web3&nbsp;Debate</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-11/signal-founder-marlinspike-gives-web3-nfts-an-emperor-s-new-clothes-moment">Web3 Just Had Its Emperor’s-New-Clothes Moment</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876891/signal-ceo-steps-down-moxie-marlinspike-encryption-cryptocurrency">Moxie Marlinspike has stepped down as CEO of&nbsp;Signal</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/moxie-marlinspike-is-leaving-signal-heres-where-we-suspect-hes-headed-and-why/">Moxie Marlinspike is leaving Signal — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/easwee">/easwee</a> — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/01/10/newton-signal-crypto-payments?s=09">Casey Newton on the Danger of Signal Adding Anonymous Payments</a>   2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Here’s FTX’s <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1481381452696723459">Sam Bankman-Fried’s tweetstorm on the subject</a>, referencing <a href="https://medium.com/@danfinlay/what-moxie-missed-on-web3-wallets-8dc572e7f39b">this blog post response from Dan&nbsp;Finlay</a>:</p><blockquote>I think Dan’s ‘right to exit’ is a key piece. Sure, there are centralized apps in crypto — FTX is one! But you have the right to exit: if you don’t like FTX, you can withdraw assets to another exchange, or to your private&nbsp;wallet.</blockquote><blockquote>And, in fact, everything in the crypto universe — or at least almost everything — is plugged into decentralized rails which connect all of the (sometimes centralized) pieces. It’s not perfect, from a decentralization angle. But it still helps a&nbsp;ton.</blockquote><blockquote>And those rails are not just decentralized, they’re also open to competition. Don’t like using blockchain X to transfer assets? Try blockchain Y! Banks have had the same ~2 ways of sending funds for decades, and can’t change that. Crypto exchanges generally have&nbsp;~20.</blockquote><blockquote>And, similarly, if some infrastructure provider sucks — RPC nodes, for instance — people can create a new one. That doesn’t, of course, mean that they *will* — and I think Moxie makes some really compelling points that we probably don’t do enough of that as an industry.</blockquote><blockquote>There is concentration of usage in various places, and some of those places are not really making progress.</blockquote><blockquote>In general, I really encourage people to find pieces of crypto infrastructure that seem shitty, and build competitors to them.

The question of atoms v.&nbsp;bits <p>Elsewhere in web3, here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ddaa6b58-1ed2-40bb-bf71-642e2b9767a9">a compelling take from the FT’s Rana Foroohar</a> (via /rcb) on why we shouldn’t forget about the real world despite the froth around the metaverse:</p><blockquote>As Tim O’Reilly, a technology big thinker and one of the popularisers of the term Web 2.0, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/why-its-too-early-to-get-excited-about-web3/">wrote recently</a>: “The easy money to be made speculating on cryptoassets seems to have distracted developers and investors from the hard work of building useful real-world services.”</blockquote><blockquote>But when we step back from the dust that will eventually settle around Web3, it will be the ubiquitous, industrial changes driven by companies like Tesla that will probably be most impactful. They are transforming old industries and building real world&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><p>It reminds me of something Peter Thiel likes to say, paraphrasing: We’ve done a lot of work in the world of bits, but we need to do more work in the world of&nbsp;atoms.</p><p>(By the way, it’s not necessarily clear that those two things are mutually exclusive.

Citadel Securities is interested in getting into crypto market making, but is waiting for greater regulatory clarity surrounding digital currencies, especially in the U.S., a company spokesperson told The Information.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Paradigm and Sequoia can also connect Citadel Securities to exchanges and companies that would enable the market maker to build a crypto business. Both VC firms have invested in crypto exchange FTX, for example, as well as in Fireblocks, a startup that offers a platform for market makers to manage crypto&nbsp;trading.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition to potentially securing a powerful new partner for their portfolio companies, Paradigm and Sequoia could also benefit from investing in a company that’s well-positioned to be a major player in crypto trading, in the event that the Securities and Exchange Commission recognizes digital currencies as securities. That move seems likely given SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s recent attitude.</blockquote><blockquote>Even though many crypto advocates don’t consider digital currencies to be securities, Paradigm and Sequoia seem to be betting on that to change with their investment. Citadel Securities already has two decades of experience in trading securities and established relationships with regulators, although it has recently tangled with the SEC. Its deep connections could help it quickly become a crypto market maker in compliance with emerging regulations. Citadel Securities could also let Paradigm, which helped create a digital currency lobbying group, gain better access to regulators.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/paradigm-sequoia-to-invest-115b-in-citadel-securities-bringing-trading-firm-closer-to-crypto/">Paradigm, Sequoia to Invest $1.15B in Citadel Securities</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/business/dealbook/citadel-sequoia-paradigm.html">Ken Griffin’s Trading Powerhouse Gains New&nbsp;Partners</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-ftx-sets-up-2-billion-venture-fund-11642163402">WSJ News Exclusive | Crypto Exchange FTX Sets Up $2 Billion Venture&nbsp;Fund</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/visa-partners-with-consensys-to-develop-cbdc-on-ramp-tool/">Visa Partners With ConsenSys to Develop CBDC On-ramp Tool — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/12/us-banks-form-group-to-offer-usdf-stablecoin/">US Banks Form Group to Offer USDF Stablecoin</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-07/paypal-is-exploring-launch-of-own-stablecoin-in-crypto-push">PayPal Explores Launch of Own Stablecoin in Crypto&nbsp;Push</a>  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/venmo-paypal-zelle-must-report-600-transactions-irs-rcna11260">Venmo, PayPal and Zelle must report $600+ in transactions to&nbsp;IRS</a>   6.

<p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a>, a service for regaining control over your digital identity using KILT Protocol. SocialKYC is a building block for making online services in Web3 better and safer, providing a way to return your credentials to where they belong — with&nbsp;you!</p><p>KYC or “Know Your Customer” is standard practice while opening an account with a bank or exchange, where customers must prove they possess government-issued credentials like a passport. SocialKYC gives the user power to extend trust in a similar way, by building a digital identity using their social accounts.</p><p>SocialKYC and <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a>, the KILT wallet, were built by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (B.T.E.) a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT. Used together, SocialKYC and Sporran allow users to manage and store their personal credentials, and decide which elements of their private information they share with online services.</p><p>SocialKYC issues credentials to users confirming the ownership of their email address or social media accounts after the user proves that they control the account. Unlike sign-in processes on the internet to date, SocialKYC then forgets about the user and the credential as soon as the credential is issued. The credential, the personal information, and the control remain with the&nbsp;user.</p><p>How it&nbsp;works:</p>  SocialKYC first sends the user a simple task to verify their control of a specific account (confirm your email address; Tweet this message to prove this is your account).  After a successful check, SocialKYC issues a credential to the user. The user can save the credential in their Sporran wallet, which is installed locally on their computer. The credential states the ownership of the specific&nbsp;account.  This personal data is not stored or shared by SocialKYC. It remains in the user’s Sporran wallet under their full&nbsp;control.  Using Sporran on their local computer, users can later send their credential to any online service that accepts the credential.  Users can also choose to publish one or more of their credentials, making them accessible to anyone. Published credentials can be unpublished by the user at any&nbsp;time.  <p>Create your identity and get your first KILT credentials now! Here’s how to get&nbsp;started:</p> Get Your&nbsp;Sporran <p>The first step is setting up your Sporran, a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome that serves as a wallet for your KILT credentials and KILT Coins. Download this at<a href="https://www.sporran.org/"> sporran.org,</a> then <a href="https://support.kilt.io/support/solutions/articles/80000959735-how-do-i-create-a-kilt-sporran-identity-">follow our step-by-step guide</a> to set it&nbsp;up.</p> Create Your KILT&nbsp;Identity <p>In KILT, identity starts with a unique decentralized identifier (<a href="https://dev.kilt.io/docs/sdk/core-feature/did">DID</a>), represented by a string of numbers and&nbsp;letters:</p><p>did:kilt:light:014sxSYXakw1ZXBymzT9t3Yw91mUaqKST5bFUEjGEpvkTuckar</p><p>You will get your first DID as part of the Sporran setup. Your digital identity is built by adding different credentials like email, Twitter account, passport, certificates, etc. to this identifier. You may even want to create several digital identities; one personal, one for work, one for&nbsp;gaming.</p> Get Your KILT Credentials <p>Once your Sporran is set up, follow our guide to creating your email credential or Twitter credential via SocialKYC <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_Identity_19Jan.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>By default, these free credentials are anchored on the KILT blockchain and are linked to a “light” DID that lives on the computer it was created&nbsp;on.</p><p>Credentials for platforms such as Discord, GitHub, and others are coming soon, which will support use cases like gaming, e-sports leagues, health care, academia, media, and decentralized social networks. We’ll announce SocialKYC partner integrations as they happen, so keep an eye on our <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> account and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a>.</p> Upgrading to a Full&nbsp;DID <p>The Sporran also provides the option to upgrade to a “full” on-chain DID. This allows you to create a service endpoint such as a url, providing a way to make your credentials public and making it easier for online services to access&nbsp;them.</p><p>Upgrading to a full DID requires a transaction fee payable in KILT (currently less than 0.01 KILT) and a deposit of 2 KILT. The deposit is designed to incentivize users to clear the data from the blockchain once it is not needed any longer, reducing wasted storage space. If you choose to delete a DID at a later date, this deposit is returned.</p><p>This could also be of use, for example, for companies who want to share their product credentials, etc. The full DID also allows the owner to set additional keys for different purposes beyond authentication, including attestation and delegation. This would allow the owner to issue their own credentials and create delegation hierarchies — useful in a company where several employees would be involved in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>On-chain DIDs will also be useful for individuals who want to publish their credentials, use key rotation for extra security, and anchor their DID anchored on the blockchain.</p><p>See how to upgrade&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_On-Chain_DIDs_19Jan.pdf">here</a>.</p> Start Building! <p>We’ve created the infrastructure. The rest is up to you, the Web3 community! Got an idea? Build it! We can’t wait to see you create services that use SocialKYC to make Web3 a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Go to our <a href="https://dev.kilt.io/">dev site</a>, read our documentation, and check out the open-source SDK. If you’re not already in the community, join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a> channel. We’re excited to see the apps and concepts you come up with. Don’t forget, KILT Treasury funds are available for creating infrastructure or initiatives that benefit the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We’ve started the ball rolling with a fun use case — a SocialKYC launch raffle on <a href="https://clankilt.io/raffle">ClanKILT</a>. Set up your credentials with SociaKYC, then enter to win limited edition KILT and Sporran&nbsp;swag.</p><p>Keep an eye out for more exciting uses for the full DID coming soon, like&nbsp;DIDsign!</p> About B.T.E.

Community Growth   This week, DuMont, an outstanding Harbinger from our English community, published《<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/staking-vs-candidate-node-ownership-9191bfbd5661">Staking vs Candidate Node Ownership</a>》, which introduced the Ontology staking strategy for the community members in detail. The article answered questions relating to ”How to participate in Ontology staking”, “How to launch a candidate node?”, and more. Community members all said that they have benefited a&nbsp;lot.  This week, Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to join the AMA held by <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481824177879273477?s=20">BingX</a>. He shared Ontology’s long-term efforts and future goals, with a focus on DID and data. He explained how users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence. Humpty also interpreted Ontology 2022 Roadmap: From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not&nbsp;changed.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481710138624929795?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1483363542262640645?s=20">Telegram Community Call</a>, with the theme “Staking”. For those who are new to Staking, they rely more on APY when choosing a node, while Ontology Harbinger Polaris and SG Node believe that it is necessary to pay more attention to the revenue distribution ratio of each node. It is necessary to check the comparison before the start of each Consensus Round, which can reduce problems such as staking reward&nbsp;losses.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about DID, including its function, meaning, and the changes it brings to Web3. The Ontology community believes that DID will be an indispensable foundation in Web3; by comprehensively deploying DID, Web3 will realize the protection of identity and privacy, and truly return data ownership to&nbsp;users.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was invited to participate in an exclusive interview hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoCoinShow/status/1482817191619829762?s=20">Crypto Coin Show</a>, and shared the latest progress of Ontology EVM. He said that Virtual Machines (VMs) play a crucial role in both the aforementioned need for interoperability and in the expansion of applications built on Ontology. The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022, and aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform and to offer an inclusive experience to developers and&nbsp;users.  Moonstake published a series of articles to introduce their strategic partners. In the article 《<a href="https://moonstake.io/what-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-in-2022/">What You Need to Know about Ontology in 2022</a>》, Moonstake elaborated on Ontology’s plans and goals for 2022, stating that they are proud to be strategic partners of Ontology. They will continue to maintain strong support for the ever-growing and developing Ontology ecosystem in 2022, building Web3 infrastructure with Ontology together.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Finextra — 《<a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/21543/five-digital-identity-trends-to-watch-in-2022">Five Digital Identity Trends to Watch in&nbsp;2022</a>》</p><p>“In 2020, the world went online and fraudsters were quick to pounce on the opportunities as businesses rapidly digitised their operations. The wave of opportunistic fraudsters drove the rate of identity document (ID) fraud up by 41% in 2020. Given the rise in sophisticated identity fraud over the past 12 months and the staggering<a href="https://aite-novarica.com/report/us-identity-theft-stark-reality"> losses of $712 billion</a> as a result, it is critical that organisations understand the most common trends and take the necessary steps to protect themselves. ”</p><p>With the continuous development of decentralized technology, decentralized identity is getting more and more attention. Whether it is traditional Internet giants or blockchain start-ups, they are building their own decentralized identity solutions based on blockchain technology, and are committed to building a new generation of Internet with more security and privacy.

<p>Many industries are seeing a significant increase in the use of digital services. Of course, this has been ongoing for some time, but the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited it.   &nbsp;</p>



 With more digital services comes an increased risk of fraudulent activity 



<p>As customer onboarding and verification become automated, there are new challenges with which we must deal. Regulation has been devised to address such matters through the control and use of technical solutions and the checks and processes which currently exist. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow has developed solutions that offer state-of-the-art video-based and biometric onboarding. These have been designed to meet regulations in Europe and the Middle East. They continue to do so as regulations expand and tighten, particularly as our industry evolves and becomes more engrained as a standard part of the AML / KYC process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The UAE is one of the furthest ahead countries in the Middle East. It has technology, AML, and electronic signature regulation in place. The country has also adopted full use of national identities. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">IDnow’s AutoIdent</a> product is ready to meet UAE regulations and help financial institutions realize the security and user experience benefits of automated verification.  (See also our article: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uae-accelerates-automated-identity-verification/">UAE accelerates use for automated identity verification</a>)</p>



 Growth of identity verification and regulation &nbsp; 



<p>Video and automated onboarding has increased in recent years, along with controlling regulations. Of course, there is a need to ensure secure processes, both in identity matching and in the wider area of safeguarding against fraud and money-laundering activity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Europe and the UK have been leading developers of identity regulation. The first AML laws (the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives</a>) were released in 1991, following Financial Action Task Force  (FATF) guidance. Germany – traditionally a highly regulated market – later moved to allow video-based identity verification. Many other countries have since done the same. Being more deregulated in this area, the UK is one of the most supportive.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>This use and approval of video-based verification have quickly expanded to further automated and biometric verification. Many EU countries now permit some form of electronic identification / verification, and the trend is well set for expansion. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s verification solutions have been developed alongside this growth. They aim to fully support new and evolving technology while also meeting the latest regulations. Many of such regulations throughout the Eurozone, have been promulgated with the input of IDnow and our relationships with national and international contacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>VideoIdent was launched in 2014, largely to meet German regulators’ requirements for video-based identity verification. As regulations and technology evolved, AutoIdent was launched as a single solution offering greater user experience, faster conversion rates, and added security against fraud. </p>



<p>AutoIdent takes VideoIdent further and offers fully-automated biometric identity verification with video or agent fallback. As a fully automated or hybrid solution, Autoident encompasses current and the most recent developments in digital identity verification. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-autoident-meeting-eu-regulations/">ID Verification with AutoIdent – meeting European Regulations</a></p>



<p>The regulatory trend to allow biometric solutions that rely on automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to onboard customers is evolving across Europe, Asia, and now the Middle East. &nbsp;</p>



 UAE regulations &nbsp; 



<p>For technical regulation, the UAE follows joint guidelines issued by The UAE Central Bank, Securities and Commodities Authority, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). They have jointly issued “<a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/sites/default/files/2021-11/Guidelines%20for%20Financial%20Institutions%20adopting%20Enabling%20Technologies%2020211107.pdf">Guidelines for Financial Institutions Adopting Enabling Technologies.</a>“   &nbsp;</p>



<p>These regulations apply to all financial institutions that are licensed and supervised under UAE law. In terms of identity verification, these are advanced and far-reaching regulations – going further than many European countries as of early 2022. They permit video onboarding as well as fully automated biometric solutions. The use of NFC technology for reading national identity cards is also permitted. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to these technical regulations, anti-money laundering laws cover monitoring and screening requirements. The primary law in the UAE is ”Federal Decree-Law No. (20) of 2018 On Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations.” These AML regulations have been designed to follow international FATF guidance, much like the European AMLD regulations.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of electronic signatures is regulated under two separate laws. Federal Law No. 1 of 2006 (eCommerce Law) applies countrywide in the UAE, while Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has introduced separate legislation under the DIFC Electronic Transactions Law of 2017. These are more open than EU laws, however, and they do not define specific <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature</a> standards. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as AutoIdent meets European regulations and is used with several financial institutions, it also complies with UAE regulations. The following are some of the main areas to consider. &nbsp;</p>



 Use of AutoIdent to meet UAE regulations for automated identity verification &nbsp; 



<p>UAE regulations permit the use of automated and biometric identity verification. Under the UAE joint regulations, an automated solution should carry out the following steps: &nbsp;</p>



  ID Proofing Check (to check the identity document is valid and genuine) &nbsp;  Similarity Check (to match the person and the identity document) &nbsp;  Liveness Check (to ensure the person is physically present) &nbsp;  



<p>IDnow’s AutoIdent solution is designed to support these steps. Full automated identity verification is also supported by manual verification as a backup. If the AI is unsure of a case (or country regulations require a hybrid approach), <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">manual video-based verification</a> is available to ensure the completion of the process.  &nbsp;</p>



 







 Supporting NFC technology &nbsp; 



<p>The UAE is a leader in the region with its Emirates ID national identity card. This is compulsory for citizens and uses NFC technology. &nbsp;</p>



<p>AutoIdent has the functionality to read biometric data from NFC chips, developed to meet ICAO 9303 standard. NFC is currently used to read German identity cards but can work with any chips using global standards – such as the Emirates ID.  &nbsp;</p>



 Meeting AML regulations &nbsp; 



<p>AutoIdent has been developed for compliance alongside EU AMLD regulations, and it fully meets the requirements of the latest 4AMLD, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD</a>, and 6AMLD updates.  These regulations have evolved to respond to criminal behaviour changes and increasing sophistication of methods used.  </p>



<p>UAE AML regulations, despite being first released later than EU regulations, incorporate many of the main advances seen in AMLD. This includes key areas such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Political Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> and checking sanction lists.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Under AML regulations (AML-CFT Decision 4.2(b), 7.2, 15, 22, 25), enhanced due diligence must be carried out for PEPs and customers associated with high-risk countries. AutoIdent offers this functionality through add-on modules to the single platform. It handles fully compliant <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML Screening &amp; Monitoring</a>. This includes checking Politically Exposed Person (PEP) and Sanction Lists. &nbsp;</p>



 Use of Qualified Electronic Signatures &nbsp; 



<p>The use of QES is relatively new in the UAE but is permitted in many areas. Crucially, the UAE’s laws allow the use of electronic signatures and state that a contract may not be deemed invalid or unenforceable solely because it is in electronic format. However, acceptance and legal basis are more open than under European regulations.   &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/electronic-signature/">Electronic Signatures</a> can only be used in some areas. Traditional paper signatures are currently still required for transactions involving immoveable property, negotiable instruments, civil documents, and other processes that require a notary public.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>AutoIdent fully supports eIDAS regulations for the use of Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES). Neither the UAE E-Commerce Law nor the DIFC law prescribes specific technical criteria for acceptable signatures, and as such, QES would not be automatically deemed acceptable. Working to the highest QES standards with a reputable provider is the best way forward, though. With limited use to date, the area is somewhat untested. &nbsp;</p>

 Moving to more automation in the future &nbsp; 



<p>Many countries are rapidly moving towards greater use of automated identity verification and electronic signatures. In Europe, Germany, Austria, Spain, and the UK all permit this process, and more are moving this way. The UAE is a leader in the Middle East, but other countries will likely follow. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, in August 2021, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank reported that it had successfully implemented automated customer onboarding. This uses facial recognition techniques combined with reading NFC data from a customer’s Emirates ID card and passport.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow firmly believes that the industry is moving to document and biometric-centered identity verification – in the Middle East and elsewhere. There is growing evidence that automatic techniques are more secure than manual ones in many areas (especially facial recognition). The FATF now supports this, and many more regulators are likely to follow its guidance.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>For a more in-depth look at AutoIdent, how it has evolved, and how it offers a well-thought-out balance between security and user experience, take a look at IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">recent webinar</a>. &nbsp;</p>

 Understanding containers vs. virtual machines 

<p>In 2013, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> was released, beginning a shift in how we think about hosting applications and managing infrastructure. Infrastructure teams and operations had been leveraging virtual machines with great success for decades, so you may be tempted to think, “isn’t this just a virtual machine?” In spirit, yes; in application, no.</p>

<p>To talk about containers, we have to talk about virtual machines. A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual representation of a computer, all the way from its boot process to loading an entire operating system (OS). This provides a lot of flexibility. You gain fine-grained control over an entire virtual computer, as well as all the pitfalls of a whole computer. The operating system has to be maintained, patched, and updated; disks have to be managed, and all manner of operational overhead goes into their care and feeding. Notably, VMs are huge because an entire OS has to go on them. So when you start a VM, you have to go through the entire boot sequence of a traditional computer.</p>

<p>There are three major problem areas that containers hope to solve: ease of management, size, and speed to start. There are others, but for simplicity, I will focus on those that are the most relevant to business processes. Containers differ from traditional virtual machines in one significant way. They do not have an actual OS. This may come as a surprise to you, even if you’ve dabbled in containers before. Instead, containers rely on an abstraction of an operating system that provides hooks into the host OS using standards and conventions supplied by the container system.</p>

<p>Docker is the de facto container standard for all practical purposes, but other container technologies do exist. The notion of a standardized container comes from the shipping industry. In shipping, there was no standardization, which made transport difficult because you had to figure out how to hold each item on a boat, train, or truck. Containers provided a standard format for moving goods: “You can put whatever you want inside the container so long as it conforms to a standard set of dimensions and can be opened and bolted down in a uniform way.” This simplified the logistical process of moving real-world items. In this same way, standardizing the way a software container interacts with its host OS to delegate the responsibility for executing tasks simplifies management of the most crucial part, the application.</p>

 Hosting containers with AWS ECS Fargate 

<p>Now that we have a better idea of what makes a container different from a virtual machine, how does this solve our three problems?</p>

<p>First, containers make management easier by letting us write build scripts to create a stable, repeatable representation of the host. This is needed to do the body of work required by the application. Second, since an OS ultimately hosts the container, that OS can enforce company and security policies. In the worst case, this would be the most a given container could do. For example, if the host OS only allows traffic inbound from a specific subnet and port, the container cannot override this restriction. The container is ultimately bound by the host OS’s networking rules.</p>

<p>This kind of management reliability continues into data management, memory management, and any other policies that need to be enforced. Ultimately, the result here is business agility. Operations can open the doors to developers knowing that established guide rails are in place. As for size–our second key problem area–since you no longer need a whole OS, container images are often as small as a few MB vs. many GB. On the topic of speed–our third key problem area–since there isn’t a complete boot cycle, the container can effectively start up as fast as the hosted application.</p>

<p>The difficulty with containers moves further up the abstraction chain (as is the style of such things) than virtual machines. The challenge comes down to networking and managing container images across many resources so that you can treat a set of computing as one homogeneous unit. Fortunately, products like Kubernetes, OpenShift, Mesos, Nomad, and others can help you solve these challenges. However, you are ultimately back to managing a fleet of computers along with the associated management overhead.</p>

<p>This is the sweet spot of AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) Fargate. Fargate gives you networking abstractions across a virtual network known as a VPC (virtual private cloud). This network abstraction is built right into the heart of AWS and is well vetted for any type of workload, including high-security government workloads. Fargate takes this a step further by abstracting away the machine management. You can set up traditional clusters and manage your machines if you want, but leveraging Fargate simplifies one more part of your process. Ultimately the goal with using cloud vendors is to let them handle the infrastructure management so you can focus on managing your business.</p>

<p>Time to jump in and try out .NET containers with AWS Fargate!</p>

<p>What you will need to get started</p>

<p>What you’ll need to continue are the following:</p>

 
   Basic knowledge of .NET 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/dotnet/core/install/">.NET SDK 3.1</a> 
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">An AWS account (you’ll be using a free tier product)</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI V2</a> 
   <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker Desktop for Windows/macOS (Not required if you are on Linux)</a> 
 

<p>This tutorial assumes you already have Docker set up and running.</p>

 Build and dockerize a .NET chat application 

<p>So what do you want to build? To keep things simple and see the value in using something other than standard HTTP protocols, you’ll use SignalR to build a very basic chat application.</p>

 
   Secure: Only logged-in clients should be able to use the chat functionality 
   Chat users’ names must come from their validated identity 
   Real-time 
 

<p>To achieve this, I am going to use four technologies:</p>

 
   Okta for identity management 
   .NET to host the application 
   SignalR to provide the socket management abstraction 
   Vue.js to provide the rendering for the front-end 
 

 Authentication for Your .NET chat app 

<p>Authentication is vital in any application, but doubly so when you need to depend on who someone is. Okta makes it really easy to delegate access to those who need it and shut down access across the entire suite of applications if a bad actor gets a set of credentials.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Other. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:5000/authorization-code/callback</code> and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:5000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Note the Issuer URL and Client ID. You will need this in the next step.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: To test out your chat application, don’t forget to manually add a second user to your Okta org. Log in to your Okta org and navigate to the Directory &gt; People page. Click the Add person button and fill out the form.</p>
</blockquote>

 Set up a .NET Core web application 

<p>Let us create a new ASP.NET Core web application using the <code>dotnet</code> CLI. Navigate to the location where you want to create the project and run the following command.</p>

   <code>dotnet new webapp -n Okta.Blog.Chat
</code>   

<p>Let’s call the project Okta.Blog.Chat.</p>

<p>Now, set up your Okta application credentials by opening appsettings.json and add the following to the JSON object after AllowedHosts:</p>

   <code>"OktaSettings": {
  "OktaDomain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
  "ClientId": "{yourOktaClientID}",
  "ClientSecret": "{yourOktaClientSecret}"
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You can find the required values from the .okta.env file created at the folder where you executed the <code>okta apps create</code> command. The value of <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> should be something like <code>https://dev-123456.okta.com</code>. Make sure you don’t include <code>-admin</code> in the value!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure to exclude appsettings.json from Git so that you don’t accidentally commit your client secret. You can generate a .gitignore file by running the command <code>dotnet new gitignore</code>.</p>

<p>Now you’ll need to add the authentication library. Run the following command inside the Okta.Blog.Chat folder.</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore
</code>   

<p>Now modify Startup.cs to use the Okta authentication provider.</p>

<p>Modify the method <code>ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)</code> to look like the code below. A line is commented out on purpose. You will use it later for authorization.</p>

   <code>public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    var oktaMvcOptions = new OktaMvcOptions()
    {
        OktaDomain = Configuration["OktaSettings:OktaDomain"],
        ClientId = Configuration["OktaSettings:ClientId"],
        ClientSecret = Configuration["OktaSettings:ClientSecret"],
        Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
    };

    services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
    {
        options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
    })
    .AddCookie()
    .AddOktaMvc(oktaMvcOptions);

    services.AddRazorPages()
    .AddRazorPagesOptions(options =&gt;
    {
        //options.Conventions.AuthorizePage("/Chat");
    });
    services.AddSignalR();
}
</code>   

<p>Make sure to add imports.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
using Okta.Blog.Chat.Hubs;
</code>   

<p>This will add the authentication provider, set the page Chat as an authorized page, and add SignalR support.</p>

<p>Next, modify the method <code>Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)</code> to look like the code below. A line is commented out on purpose, you will use it later during our SignalR setup.</p>

   <code>public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
        // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
    {
        endpoints.MapRazorPages();
        //endpoints.MapHub&lt;ChatHub&gt;("/chathub");
    });
}
</code>   

<p>The key difference here is <code>app.UseAuthentication();</code>.</p>

<p>Next, create a new folder called Hubs and a new class file in that folder called ChatHub.cs. This will provide our chat backend.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Okta.Blog.Chat.Hubs
{
    public class ChatHub : Hub
    {
        public async Task SendMessage(string message)
        {
            if (this.Context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
                await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", this.Context.User.Identity.Name, message);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>You’ll see in this class you’ve made use of the user’s authentication status. This way, even if someone knows the backend is SignalR, you’ve mitigated their ability to use the system unless explicitly authenticated. Any additional authorization logic could go here as well.</p>

<p>Next, you need to make sure you have the pages you need. In the Pages folder, go ahead and delete the page Privacy.cshtml and Privacy.cshtml.cs and add a new page named Chat.cshtml by running the following command from the Pages folder.</p>

   <code>dotnet new page -n Chat
</code>   

<p>Edit Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml and modify the second nav item from this:</p>

   <code>&lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>To this:</p>

   <code>&lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Chat"&gt;Chat&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now, if you run the <code>dotnet run</code> command or run the application from Visual Studio, you should be able to navigate to the chat page with the heading “Chat”. Make sure that it runs successfully before moving on to the next step.</p>

 Add Docker support to your .NET chat application 

<p>Before you add the chat functionality, add the Docker support. Add a file named Dockerfile to the root Okta.Blog.Chat folder with the following content:</p>

   <code># build and publish the app
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:3.1-bullseye AS build
WORKDIR /src
## copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY Okta.Blog.Chat.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore
## copy everything else and publish app
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app --no-restore

# final stage/image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:3.1-bullseye-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app ./
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Okta.Blog.Chat.dll"]
</code>   

<p>We are building and publishing our application first. Next, you will copy the build files and call <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>, which translates to “run dotnet with our published DLL” - nothing extraordinary, right? The <code>FROM</code> keywords use other built docker files as base images to build our image from, so the work of installing .NET is already done.</p>

<p>Now add a .dockerignore file with the below content so that they are not copied to the final image.</p>

   <code>**/.dockerignore
**/.git
**/.vscode
**/bin
**/obj
</code>   

<p>If you use Visual Studio, you’ll now have the ability to debug right into a running container in your debug toolbar. If you press F5 or click the play button, you’ll run your app in a Docker Container.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you are not using Visual Studio, run the following command to build and start the container.</p>

   <code>docker build . -t okta-chat
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 okta-chat
</code>   

<p>The app should be accessible at <code>http://localhost:5000/</code>.</p>

 Authorize Your chat app 

<p>Modify Setup.cs and uncomment the following line.</p>

   <code>options.Conventions.AuthorizePage("/Chat");
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: At this point, if you try to authenticate the <code>/Chat</code> path using Google Chrome, you’ll get an error. This is because you are running the app without TLS and Chrome blocks set-cookie headers with <code>SameSite=None</code> when the <code>Secure</code> attribute is not present (which will be preset only for HTTPS requests).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s make sure our docker container can run with HTTPS.</p>

<p>First, you need to create a certificate. You can use the .NET CLI for creating self-signed certificates for development. Please note that this is only for development purposes and should not be used in production.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create a self-signed certificate. Use the correct command based on your OS and use an appropriate password.</p>

   <code># clean existing certs if any
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
# create a new cert on macOS/Linux
dotnet dev-certs https -ep ${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx -p mypass123
# create a new cert on Windows
dotnet dev-certs https -ep %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p mypass123
# trust the cert
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
</code>   

<p>Now you can run the container with HTTPS using the below command. You will use the certificate you created above and mount it as a volume.</p>

   <code># macOS/Linux
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 -p 5001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=5001 -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="mypass123" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx -v ${HOME}/.aspnet/https:/https/ okta-chat

# Windows
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 -p 5001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=5001 -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="mypass123" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx -v %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https:/https/ okta-chat
</code>   

<p>The app should be accessible at <code>https://localhost:5001/</code> now.</p>

<p>In your Okta Developer Portal, go to Applications &gt; Applications and click the application name you created using the CLI. Edit the General Settings, and add URI for Sign-in redirect URIs and Sign-out redirect URIs as below:</p>

   <code>Sign-in redirect URI = https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback
Sign-out redirect URI = https://localhost:5001/
</code>   

<p>Try running the application. You should see that to open the chat page, you’ll be redirected to the Okta Single Sign-On portal and then redirected back. You are now successfully authenticated.</p>

 Add chat functionality with Vue.js and SignalR 

<p>You’ll use Vue for state management since you can take as little or as much as you want. With Vue, you. can start with a CDN script tag and use it for a single component, a single page, or a deep dive with a robust build system on Node. For this exercise, you’ll be using a CDN-hosted script.</p>

<p>But first, you need to finish one thing on the backend.</p>

<p>Since you have created your ChatHub.cs, open Startup.cs and uncomment the following line:</p>

   <code>endpoints.MapHub&lt;ChatHub&gt;("/chathub");
</code>   

<p>Now modify the Chat.cshtml file to look like this:</p>

   <code>@page

&lt;div id="chatApp"&gt;
  &lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="col-2"&gt;Message&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="col-4"&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" v-model="message" id="message" /&gt;
        &lt;input type="button" v-on:click.stop.prevent="sendMessage" id="sendButton" value="Send Message" /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-12"&gt;
      &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
      &lt;ul id="messagesList"&gt;
        &lt;li v-for="(item, index) in chatLog" :key="index"&gt;{{ item.User }} - {{ item.Message }}&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/aspnet-signalr/1.0.27/signalr.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.2.24/dist/vue.global.prod.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl("/chatHub").build();

  const VueChatApp = {
    data() {
      return {
        isConnected: false,
        message: "",
        chatLog: [],
      };
    },
    mounted() {
      connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) =&gt; {
        this.receiveMessage(user, message);
      });
      connection
        .start()
        .then(() =&gt; {
          this.isConnected = true;
        })
        .catch((err) =&gt; {
          return console.error(err.toString());
        });
    },
    methods: {
      receiveMessage(user, message) {
        this.chatLog.push({
          User: user,
          Message: message,
        });
      },
      sendMessage() {
        connection
          .invoke("SendMessage", this.message)
          .then(() =&gt; {
            this.message = "";
          })
          .catch((err) =&gt; {
            return console.error(err.toString());
          });
      },
    },
  };

  Vue.createApp(VueChatApp).mount("#chatApp");
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>We use CDN for the SignalR client library, and the connection to the ChatHub uses the endpoint you set earlier:</p>

   <code>const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl("/chatHub").build();
</code>   

<p>The state is stored in the data section of our Vue app. There are three properties in use: a flag to let us know if it is connected, the message currently being typed, and a chat log.</p>

   <code>data() {
  return {
    isConnected: false,
    message: "",
    chatLog: [],
  }
},
</code>   

<p>Your app has two methods: <code>receiveMessage</code> and <code>sendMessage</code>.</p>

<p>When <code>receiveMessage</code> is called, it appends an object to the chat log with the user and the message.</p>

<p>When <code>sendMessage</code> is called, you use the SignalR connection to invoke “SendMessage” and pass along our message properties. Once the message is sent, you blank it out to fill a new message.</p>

   <code>receiveMessage(user, message) {
  this.chatLog.push({
    User: user,
    Message: message,
  });
},
sendMessage() {
  connection
    .invoke("SendMessage", this.message)
    .then(() =&gt; {
      this.message = "";
    })
    .catch((err) =&gt; {
      return console.error(err.toString());
    });
},
</code>   

<p>When the app is created, a hook is added for “ReceiveMessage” that calls the ViewModel <code>receiveMessage</code> method described previously.</p>

<p>Then the connection to the hub is started, and if successful, <code>isConnected</code> is set to true.</p>

   <code>connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) =&gt; {
  this.receiveMessage(user, message);
});
connection
  .start()
  .then(() =&gt; {
    this.isConnected = true;
  })
  .catch((err) =&gt; {
    return console.error(err.toString());
  });
</code>   

<p>If you run your application at this point, you’ll have a secured chat application running in a container!</p>

 Deploy your .NET chat application to AWS 

<p>Now that the chat application is complete, it’s time to deploy. First, you need to build the docker image and deploy it for use in AWS. AWS has private container repositories via its Elastic Container Registry (ECR) product.</p>

 Create an ECR repository 

<p>First, you need to make one final change to the Dockerfile to get TLS working on Fargate.</p>

<p>Add the following two lines to the Dockerfile right after the <code>dotnet publish</code> command:</p>

   <code># build and publish the app
...
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app --no-restore

ARG CERT_PASSWORD
RUN dotnet dev-certs https -ep /app/aspnetapp.pfx -p ${CERT_PASSWORD}

# final stage/image
...
</code>   

<p>This will create a self-signed development certificate right within the docker image, which you can use to run the application with TLS on Fargate for demo purposes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This type of development certificate is not recommended for production use. It is used here for simplicity in a demo. For a production setup, you should use a certificate signed by a certificate authority. Recommendation: to run a production .NET application on ECS, use an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic to a reverse proxy (Nginx) via an HTTPS listener configured to use a certificate signed by a certificate authority. The reverse proxy would then route traffic to the application. The reverse proxy and the application should also be configured to use TLS using valid certificates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Log in to your AWS console and navigate to ECR.</p>

<p>Click Create Repository.</p>

<p>For visibility settings, choose Private and name your repository. Then click Create Repository at the bottom of the wizard.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Navigate to okta-chat and click View push commands. This has all the steps you’ll need to build and push your image to ECR.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Follow the steps and push the images to ECR. Make sure to pass <code>--build-arg CERT_PASSWORD=mypass123</code> to the <code>docker build</code> command like below.</p>

   <code>docker build --build-arg CERT_PASSWORD=mypass123 -t okta-chat .
</code>   

<p>Select the copy button in the URI column next to your image and save that for later. This is the path to your image.</p>

<p></p>

 Set up the ECS Fargate cluster 

<p>Now set up your ECS cluster.</p>

<p>On the left menu, click Clusters under Amazon ECS, then click the Create Cluster button.</p>

<p>Click Networking Only &gt; Next step from the options.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I named my cluster “okta-test”, name yours as you see fit, and click Create on the following screen. Then click View Cluster.</p>

<p>Now that the cluster is set up you’ll need to create a task for your image.</p>

<p>Click Task Definitions on the left menu and click Create new Task Definition.</p>

<p>For launch type, select FARGATE and click Next step.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For the Task Definition Name, I named mine okta-chat.</p>

<p>Set the Task memory (GB) to 0.5 GB.
Set the Task CPU to 0.25 vCPU.</p>

<p>.NET Core applications are very efficient, as are containers. For many applications, you’ll find you can serve many requests with smaller boxes than you might expect.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Leave other options unchanged.</p>

<p>Now you need to define the image you want to use. Click Add Container.</p>

<p>Let us name the container the same thing – okta-chat.</p>

<p>For the Image, you’ll need the path you copied from the ECR repository earlier.</p>

<p>Set the soft limit to 512, and add ports 80 and 443.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down to the ENVIRONMENT section and add the following key-value pairs:</p>

   <code>ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+"
ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=443
ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="mypass123"
ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=./aspnetapp.pfx
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Click Add at the bottom of the pop-up. Now click Create at the bottom of the page. Go back to your cluster, click on the Tasks tab, and click Run new Task.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Here’s a recommendation: Create services instead of tasks for production to take full advantage of the elastic scaling capabilities of ECS. I’m using tasks directly for the simplicity of the demo. When using an ALB (application load balancer) to route traffic to the application, use of services is also required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Select FARGATE as Launch type.</p>

<p>Select your default VPC and Subnets under VPC and security groups.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Edit button next to the security groups. Click on Add rule to add a new inbound rule for HTTPS port 443. Click Save on the pop-up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, click Run Task.</p>

<p>You’ll be taken back to your cluster. Select the task you created by clicking its ID. Make a note of its public IP; you’ll need that to adjust your Okta application settings.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In your Okta Developer Portal, go to Applications &gt; Applications and click the application’s name you created using the CLI. Edit the General Settings and add URI for Sign-in redirect URIs and Sign-out redirect URIs using the IP address from your running task as shown below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, if you navigate to <code>https://YOUR_FARGET_TASK_PUBLIC_IP</code>, you’ll see you are the proud owner of a fully functional chat application, secured with Okta, running in an ECS Fargate container.</p>

 Recap 

<p>Whew, that was a ride! Good job on making your new chat application. What can we take away from this?</p>

 
   Serverless is good for HTTP request/response, but other protocols need something different. 
   Containers are more lightweight than virtual machines but come with their own challenges. 
   A docker file consists of the instructions to build your application and launch it, and which ports to expose. 
   Fargate makes the hosting of containers easier since you don’t have to manage the host machine infrastructure. 
   SignalR makes real-time communication easier by abstracting most of the heavy lifting. 
   Vue can be used for state management without taking on additional build and development pipeline. 
   Okta makes it easier to secure any type of .NET web application. 
   There is no reason to have an insecure site! 
   Use AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) + Nginx configured to use TLS with valid certificates in production.

				  Indicio will upgrade Hyperledger Indy to support “did:indy” DID Method Specification, which will enable greater interoperability across Indy-based networks  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Indicio has won the&nbsp; <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace/opportunities/code-with-us/e3dd1605-cc1d-4c30-a9ee-245940bccd0d">BC Gov “Code With Us” Challenge</a> to develop the did:indy DID Method for the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> project, the open source project housed at the Hyperledger Foundation that provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledger. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge has two goals. The first is to expand the types of content that can be written to DIDDocs, documents that instruct users on which ledger they need to find and read so that they can use verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Second, the new method will align Hyperledger Indy with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifier (DID) Specification</a>. Most of Hyperledger Indy’s development occurred prior to the completion of the standard DID Specification by the W3C and, as a result, identifiers written to one network are currently not resolvable on other networks. A new did:indy DID Method will fix that and make it easier for decentralized identity products and services to interoperate across different Indy networks.</p>
<p>“Given the increasing use of Indy Networks, we are grateful to this &lt;/&gt; Code With Us challenge and to BCGov for sponsoring this important contribution,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “As a company, we are committed to open-source development, and we applaud BCGov for its leadership in sponsoring critical development needs that will make interoperability easier and lead to increased adoption. We’re excited to work with BCGov on this—and it means a lot given that several of Indicio’s developers have been contributing to the Hyperledger Indy project since its inception.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Winning the challenge comes as Indico is about to kick off a series of&nbsp; <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/11/22/hyperledger-foundation-community-training-accelerate-your-decentralized-identity-skills-with-two-free-hyperledger-indy-and-hyperledger-aries-workshops">Hyperledger Community Training Workshops</a> in using the Hyperledger Aries codebases to design and develop decentralized identity solutions. Indicio has made training on all aspects of decentralized identity a key part of its mission and product offerings. Places on the free Hyperledger workshops filled rapidly, so keep an <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">eye out</a> for future events.</p>
<p>To learn more about decentralized identity training, or how to start developing decentralized identity products on the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">Indicio TestNet</a>, or how to use our products, services, and hosting to create trusted data ecosystems, please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us</a>. </p>

<p>I have always given a damn about digital identity.</p>



<p>Hi. <a href="https://wider.team/team/#wolff">I’m Phil Wolff</a>. And this is a personal note to start my year. </p>



<p>I love that digital identity tries to answer deep philosophical questions. What does it mean to be human? How do we trust ourselves and each other? What is the reality we agree on? What is personal integrity? What helps civilization and a civil society endure? What is fairness and justice?</p>



<p>I love that it’s more than a technical discussion. It’s laws. Sociology. Politics and civics. Commerce. Psychology. Ethics. History. Economy. All the humanities.</p>



<p>Identity touches everything. It always will. Computation and communication continue their pervasion, and identity spreads with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity ships. I like that a few standards folks have the power to turn grand ideas into covenants into engineering protocols. To settle things for everyone for a while. To versioning something pragmatic that others can build from and evolve.</p>



<p>Shaping identity is a human endeavor. I like the geeky and artistic communities that emerge for a while around problems and opportunities. We show the best of ourselves. Comradery while tackling authenticity and the unidentified. Courage taking on concentrations of power. Conviction while building safety and security for all. Grit for persevering through long slogs to make stuff work. </p>



<p>So I’m passionate for digital identity’s formative process, its purpose, and its impact on our world.</p>



<p>That’s why I organized online for data portability as a human right (DataPortability Project). Why I literally marched on Oakland City Hall for privacy and joined police in working out a surveillance policy (Oakland Privacy). Why I promoted open data and open source in civic projects at more than 150 civic hack nights (OpenOakland). Why I fostered identity-centric startups (PDEC). Why I consult on identity as transformational strategy here with Wider Team.</p>



<p>Since 2021, I’ve worked with standards bodies on digital identity in clinical IoT, trust governance, decentralization and fiduciaries, and biometrics. I hope to continue these efforts along with the growing cadre who focus on the intersection of technology, society, and enterprise. </p>



<p>Have a healthy and impactful 2022, y’all. </p>

<p>Picture above: SSI workshop at Decentralized Web Summit 2018, San Francisco Mint, (left to right) Kim Duffy, Christopher Allen, Jonathan Holt, Daniel Buchner, Christian Lundquist, Markus Sabadello, Eugeniu Rusu, Rouven Heck.</p>



<p>At this point, we know what self-sovereign identity (SSI) is, but where does it come from? A short timeline highlights just how quickly SSI has developed. It underlines the path and development of the evolution of Internet Identity. From a centralized to a federated to a user-centric identity, the self-sovereign identity is seen as the most recent and urgently needed step in this evolution. It is independent from any individual silo, and provides three essential elements: individual control, security, and full portability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The source goes back to the 1990s&nbsp;  



<p>Christopher Allan estimates the birth of SSI in the early 90s (cf. Allan 2016). In 1991, PGP mentions a first hint towards what could become a self-sovereign identity when introducing a ‘Web of Trust’. This was an example of a decentralized trust management, but focusing only on email addresses. Therefore, PGP can be seen as one of the first to highlight a different way, in which identity can be supported by peers instead of centralized authorities. As another early thought, Allan recognizes a paper by Carl Ellison that examined how digital identity was created, published in 1996 (‘Establishing Identity without Certification Authority’). Ellison’s main argument highlighted that there was a need for a method of establishing identity without using certificates from trusted certification authorities (Ellison 1996).&nbsp;</p>



<p>These early approaches could mark the beginning, but it is safe to say that SSI really took off in the 21st century, along with the development and further spread of the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, things have changed of course. Essentially, Sovereign is really about the individual being able to control what happens to stuff others (trusted parties) say about them. The community as a whole does not rely on web of trust infrastructure anymore for SSI, but rather connects the SSI technology with the existing trusted certification authorities (ie. the state).&nbsp;</p>



 Taking off: SSI in the 21st century&nbsp; 



<p>In 2000, the Augmented Social Network provided the groundwork for a new digital identity. Their most significant advance was ‘the assumption that every individual ought to have the right to control his or her own online identity’ (Jordan 2003).&nbsp;</p>



<p>One major contribution, paving the way for the SSI development, is the Internet Identity Workshop, which started back in 2001 and introduced on a new term: user-centric identity. It is interesting to notice that the term of self-sovereign identity itself only came into increased use in the late 2010s. At Jolocom, we used the term ‘autonomous identity’ before SSI picked up.&nbsp; One of the first references is Devon Loffreto’s blog post back in 2012, where he wrote about ‘Sovereign Source Authority’ (Loffreto 2012).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five years later, Phil Windley described self-sovereign identity as an ‘Internet for identity’ (Windley 2012). He highlights three major virtues of such: no one owns it, everyone can use it, and anyone can improve it. Ever since, SSI has grown into an ecosystem aiming to put users in control over their own personal information and data. Identity management can be expected to become increasingly significant due to the rise in digital interactions. Already, self-sovereign identity is becoming a large industry.&nbsp;</p>



 The late 2010s&nbsp; 



<p>A year to remember is 2018. Back then, the emerging SSI community agreed on a high level definition of the term SSI in the Identity Position Paper by Bundesblock for the first time. INATBA’s position paper ‘What’s at stake’ in 2020 built on exactly this foundation and furthermore highlighted possible development scenarios for SSI. These efforts helped to make SSI a priority in the digitalization process within Germany and the EU. In Germany specifically, the SDI (secure digital identities) projects are a significant effort to start an SSI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a European level, developments towards an SSI friendly legal framework were proposed by the European Commission in June 2020. The initial examples of successful SSI pilots and projects across EU member states and the international momentum on the topic have found their way into the proposal for an updated eIDAS (electronic Identification, Authentiction and trust Services) regulation. This proposal It is currently being debated by the European Council and the European Parliament&nbsp; and foresees a introduction of European Digital Identity Wallets for all European citizens. The proposed regulation is taking inspiration from self-sovereing identity principles and is a great chance for Europe. It’s main potetnial lies in the provision of a legally binding Trust Framwork, as well as associated Technical Specifications for a coherent technical infrastructure. As a result, if the European Commission has its way, all public services should be available online by 2030 and 80 percent of EU citizens should use an eID solution. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been contributing to this process on a German, European and Global level in different capacities of the past years as Jolocom and will do our best to ensure that our vision for an open- and decentralized infrastructure will be achieved.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

			 What does our new strategic partnership with Inveniam mean for issuers? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>We are off to a great start this year as&nbsp;we teamed up with Inveniam to&nbsp;unlock asset liquidity via tokenization.&nbsp;The partnership comes alongside a €5m investment from Inveniam, Apex Group, and K20 Fund.</p>
 Assets tokenized and priced&nbsp; 
<p>The most exciting part about this partnership is that <a href="https://inveniam.io/inveniamio/">Inveniam’s data solution</a> complements the T-REX ecosystem by providing tokenized assets with a valuation reference, which will fully unlock private market asset liquidity.</p>
 Covering the entire value chain of tokenization 
<p>As a result of this collaboration, securities tokenized through <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643/">the ERC-3643 standard and the T-REX suite</a> will be enriched with timestamped valuation data linked to their underlying assets. The result? High functioning securities that will unlock liquidity:</p>
 
 Issuance: We provide the enterprise-grade white-label tokenization platform – <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> – to help asset managers compliantly bring assets to blockchain. 
 Asset management:&nbsp;Tokenized assets and investors are managed via our T-REX platform. In addition, tokens are enriched by real-time data regarding asset valuation delivered by Inveniam. 
 Secondary trading:&nbsp;Peer-to-peer transfers are available through our compliance framework. With trusted pricing references provided by Inveniam, investors can then make fair deals with confidence. 
 
  
 Accelerating the tokenization adoption&nbsp; 
<p>By addressing the&nbsp;two biggest issues in private markets, which are pricing discovery and compliance, we are now making private market assets more accessible and liquid together with our partner Inveniam.</p>
<p>Additional value to the market will accrue as the partnership will ultimately enable Apex Group, Inveniam’s fund administration partner, to deliver end-to-end cutting-edge services to a broad ecosystem of private asset owners.

SWN Global &amp; MetaMUI x Blockchain Research Institute<p>We are excited to announce that SWN Global and MetaMUI became a Pioneer member of the Blockchain Research Institute(BRI).</p><p>BRI is a globally well known and most active blockchain think tank to be the catalysts of the blockchain transformation. BRI has more than 100 research projects underway to explore, understand, document and inform leaders about blockchain strategies, market opportunities and implementation challenges. All the research and programs done by BRI are funded by BRI members, including enterprise organizations, governments, universities, colleges and blockchain startups from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Here is a greeting from Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute.<br>“Digital identity and central bank digital currencies are two emerging technologies that will bring about profound changes to businesses, governments, and societies around the world. At the Blockchain Research Institute, we are pleased to collaborate with companies like Sovereign Wallet Network and MetaMUI, who are paving the way for digital transformation using these technologies,”</p><p>We are proud to be one of the members of the BRI and we are excited to do a joint research with the BRI and keep strong connection each other to build a new era of digital currency.</p><p>BRI announcement link: <br><a href="https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/blog/2022/01/17/swn-metamui/">https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/blog/2022/01/17/swn-metamui/</a></p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism(CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>The world is moving towards digitalisation and its having both a positive and negative impact on businesses. On one hand, with the rise of cybercrime, and cybercrime damages costing the world roughly $6 trillion in 2021, regulators and authorities are looking into solutions that can ensure highest security standards. On the other hand, completely automated processes, that can be used remotely are a new requirement amongst users.</p>



<p>The Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) made an important step and changed its online identification ordinance. The Austrian Anti-Money Laundering Act (Austrian AMLA) has been amended to allow for the use of a fully automated biometric process for remote identity verification. The new process allows banks and other AML-required companies to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements using a variety of remote identity verification methods. This is a positive development not only for users, but also for companies, who can now offer quicker processes and achieve better conversion rates.</p>



<p>According to the proposed amendment, biometric verification criteria must meet current state-of-the-art technology and offer the same level of security as an “in person” identity. This procedure involves technical requirements ranging from ID document security feature checks to biometric capture or Liveness Detection, which can be verified via video recording. From January 2023 onwards, a photo ID must be verified by reading the electronic security chip (NFC chip) under the current contingency under the new amendment.</p>



<p>IDnow is constantly working with the authorities, regulators and European standardisation working groups like IDO Alliance working groups from identity verification to European digital identity. IDnow is also a member of Hyperledger, W3C and, Linux Foundation, to work towards a safe, modern identity ecosystem and to ensure a superior platform for all compliance needs.</p>

<p>Over the past years, various frameworks and models for defending against cyber-attacks have been published. A popular one is the NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework), another one is MITRE D3FENDTM. Both have overlaps and differ in other areas. But, when looking at these approaches, there also are missing elements that are required for a comprehensive approach.</p>
<p>Comparing NIST CSF and MITRE D3FENDTM</p>
<p>While NIST consists of the five stages Identify – Protect – Detect – Respond – Recover, the MITRE approach has Harden – Detect – Isolate – Deceive – Evict as its five main stages. When comparing these in a matrix, it looks like this:</p>




<p>NIST CSF</p>


<p>MITRE D3FENDTM</p>




<p>Identify</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Harden</p>




<p>Protect</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Detect</p>


<p>Detect</p>




<p>Respond</p>


<p>Isolate</p>
<p>Deceive</p>
<p>Evict</p>




<p>Recover</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Table 1: Mapping NIST CSF to MITRE D3FENDTM shows that the overlaps and differences between both approaches.</p>
<p>Also, while the MITRE approach is more a list of technical steps and technologies, NIST also focuses on continuous improvements. It details the actions by mapping the functions (such as “identify”) into categories, which are split into subcategories that then reference to established standards such as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 or COBIT 5.</p>
<p>When analyzing the MITRE framework, one also could argue that some essential steps such as hardening the operating system. patching applications or hardening by enforcing consistent access controls at the system and application level are lacking. In addition, Access Governance for enforcing the least privilege principle, or Privileged Access Management (PAM) should be considered along with endpoint management related capabilities, which are absent. Notably, all this could be easily added to the framework.</p>
<p>The even more interesting challenge becomes apparent in table 1: The bread around the sandwich is lacking, with the phases of identify and recover not (yet) being part of the MITRE framework. NIST CSF starts with Asset Management as the first category within the first stage of “Identify”. Without understanding which systems are in place, which software is running on these systems, or how these systems are configured, the knowledge of which systems to harden in which way, or analyzing the state of security becomes difficult, as well as response becomes a challenge.</p>
 You can’t protect what you don’t know 
<p>Experience from practice tells that a lot of organizations struggle in case of incidents with the simple fact that they don’t know exactly which systems, be it clients, servers, or services, they have in place that could be affected. Identifying these systems takes valuable time and the right endpoint management systems can assist in discovery and identification actions.</p>
<p>Asset management and software inventory are essential capabilities for every defensive approach, capturing the information about the state of IT. Such repository is the foundation for automating activities for hardening/protecting as well as for response.</p>
 Response is not enough – keep your business up and running 
<p>While protecting or hardening, detection, and responsive actions such as isolation, deception, and eviction are essentials, there also is a need for recovery. These activities also must be well-prepared, for rapid reaction in case of an incident. This, e.g., might include recovering both endpoints and data in case of a ransomware attack, to return to normal work as quickly as possible. Also, in case of many other types of attacks, the ability to recover or restore to a known state is an essential capability.</p>
<p>Thus, a comprehensive approach must look beyond the technical response and forward to getting back to work based on a known, safe state. A key capability therein is the ability to recover systems, including endpoints, rapidly, which is a common capability with Endpoint Management Systems solutions available today.</p>
 Operate and automate 
<p>Last not least, it also is about automation and efficient IT operations. Neither steps such as identification and hardening, nor response or recovery, can be only based on manual activities. Efficient protection across all systems and services requires a high degree of automation, where, again, Endpoint Management comes into play. Rapid reaction equally requires automation, to be fast in, e.g., restoring systems and data.</p>
<p>IT operations is the glue that ensures that all these activities can be executed fast, efficiently, and with a high degree of automation.</p>
 Taking the best of both worlds: Bread, mustard, cheese, and more 
<p>Both frameworks, the one from NIST as well as the one from MITRE, deliver very valuable input for organizations when implementing their cyber defense, as other references such as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 or NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 are doing. The analysis of these frameworks also shows that there is not a single, simple answer to all challenges. The depth MITRE delivers when it comes to technical activities is impressive, while NIST CSF takes a broader perspective.</p>
<p>For being well-prepared against cyber-attacks, a broad perspective is essential, from the identification of both risks and the assets to be protected, to the ability for quickly recovering from attacks. Technologies such as UEM, Asset Management, and solutions that support in recovery from both a data perspective (Backup and Restore) as a system perspective (UEM again) thus must become part of a comprehensive approach on defense against cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>The KuppingerCole Recommended Risk Framework:</p>




<p>The Sandwich</p>


<p>When To Use</p>


<p>The New Recommended Framework</p>




<p>Bread</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the Attack</p>


<p>Identify</p>




<p>Mustard</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Harden</p>




<p>Cheese</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Protect</p>




<p>Ham</p>


<p>During the Attack</p>


<p>Detect</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Respond: Isolate, Evict, Patch</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>After the Attack</p>


<p>Recover</p>




<p>Bread</p>


<p>Improve</p>




<p>At the end, it is like with a good sandwich. It is not only about ham or cheese, about mustard or other sauces, it also is about the bread and putting all this together the right way. MITRE D3FENDTM is a very valuable approach, providing depth at the technical level other models don’t deliver. Other approaches such as the established NIST CSF add another perspective and a broader coverage across the whole cycle of cyber-attack resilience.</p>

<p>At Ubisecure, our financial year runs with the calendar year, and so January is a time to reflect, (re)calibrate and drive, and I’d like to share some of my reflective thoughts from 2021.</p>
<p>Like much of the world’s population right now, I am sitting in my home office space – a converted section of garage that embraces the current continuum that used to be known as the work-life balance. It seems like whilst 2020 was a year of shock and discovery, 2021 was a year of acceptance, leveraging the “silver lining” and getting on with the job, and that is what I’m proud to say Ubisecure has done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Corporate Growth 
<p>We are a private company, so don’t talk publicly about the detail of our financial performance, however our provisional results from 2021 are fantastic and a testament to everyone in the company. We’ve spent three years deploying funds from the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/ubisecure-announces-growth-funding-from-octopus-investments/" title="investment made by Octopus mid-2018">investment made by Octopus mid-2018</a> with the target of passing break-even in 2021, and we have unequivocally achieved that. We have also seen significant revenue growth, whilst approaching nearly 90% of sales on a subscription basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Record Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) Issuance 
<p>Issuing LEIs through our RapidLEI brand has generated impressive statistics throughout the year. You might have seen us mention some of these during 2021, such as:</p>
 
 RapidLEI is #2 for total number of LEIs issued, passing Bloomberg and WM Datenservice. 
 RapidLEI is #1 for cumulative growth rate – issuing more new LEIs than DTCC, Bloomberg &amp; LSEG combined. 
 RapidLEI is the #1 destination for LEI transfers. 
 
<p>To me, the most impressive is that RapidLEI was the number 1 issuer of validated LEIs every single month in 2021, from a standing start in 2018. This is a testament to our pioneering platform which enables automated LEI issuance, our brilliant internal team and fantastic global partner network – and completely supports the premise behind our vision that automation is the key to business efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Launched the CI Pipeline 
<p>Keeping with the theme of automation, 2021 saw the new Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline come online for our Identity and Access Management (IAM) engineering team. The complexity of software in general, and IAM software in particular, means that automation of build, test and deploy is critical. The proof point of this was the Log4J CVE last month. Like many software companies, we took action to ensure customers using our platform were not negatively affected. The CI pipeline enabled us to patch all supported versions of our software within hours, which was especially important with the rolling fixes that appeared for the Log4J library. A great achievement by the engineering team, and a great reassurance to our customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Announced LEI Everywhere 
<p>2021 saw the launch of our <a href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">LEI Everywhere</a> proposition – a Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF)-approved operational model for KYC Service Providers, Banks, FinTechs, &amp; Trust Service Providers. The model allows these institutions to leverage their existing KYC &amp; AML workflows to enhance legal entity identity information, while synchronously issuing LEIs in real-time. Our automated systems provide value-adding functionality over the basic GLEIF Validation Agent definition by detecting anomalies in legal entity data and highlighting these to enhance KYC and AML processes. We will be making several announcements in early 2022 detailing a number of global banks who have already joined the LEI Everywhere programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advancing our IAM Platform 
<p>We had three IAM releases in 2021, with each release bringing further incremental features and value to existing customers. Throughout the year we delivered a number of features including enhanced extensibility, increased support to our already broad range of EU high assurance identities, deeper usage data, PKCE enhancements, and programmatic key rotation. I’m excited to introduce further features and enhancements that we have planned throughout 2022.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Looking forwards 
<p>When I look at the achievements of the individuals, teams and departments within Ubisecure I feel rightly proud of what has been achieved and frankly honoured to be part of it all. As you would imagine, the success and growth means we are continually looking for high calibre individuals to join us.

 SmartPlaces partners with Ocean Protocol to unlock data monetization for Web3 social interaction app <p>SmartPlaces Protocol is partnering with Ocean Protocol to enable users who contribute to social interactions through the SmartPlaces app to securely monetize their data while preserving their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The mission behind SmartPlaces Protocol is to provide users with a new way of social interaction based on the benefits of blockchain technology. SmartPlaces Protocol makes it possible for people to interact and connect in real-world situations. This is done through a geo-location based mobile application that allows them to make their thoughts and interests visible for others in a direct real-life environment.</p><p>With the “1-click-wingman”, people can easily seize everyday’s life opportunities and immediately connect with others. The hyper-localized application will be launched at a later stage in 2022 and, based on strategic partnerships, it will be made available in approx. 40 countries. In addition, SmartPlaces will provide use cases for the Metaverse, as it allows users to earn an identity and trust label based on the volume and the quality of real-life interactions with the&nbsp;others.</p><p>The SmartPlaces app data will be shared and monetized on Ocean Market. Ocean’s Compute-to-Data technology aligns perfectly with SmartPlaces Protocol’s need, as it provides a means to exchange data while preserving privacy — the data stays on-premise with the data provider, and data consumers can run compute jobs on the data — to train AI&nbsp;models.</p><p>Bruce Pon, Co-Founder of Ocean Protocol, commented:</p><p>The current data economy is not inclusive, transparent, nor does it allow for easy entry and access. The collaboration between Ocean and SmartPlaces Protocol is adding to the opportunities for people to take control over their data and monetize–this is the social media of tomorrow, fair, responsible, open, beneficial for everyone who is a part of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Hung Luu, CEO of SmartPlaces Protocol added&nbsp;that:</p><p>The digitalised world lacks real-life interactions between people. Smart Places Protocol’s vision is to create a new era of social interaction by engaging people to connect with others. I’m sure that our values and vision have the potential to align decentralized technologies with everyone on a real social level. We believe that Ocean Protocol could play a major role in enabling this ambitious but realistic plan in a distributed way. We envision that our cooperation will build a redistributed social data ecosystem, by being a solid proposition to our&nbsp;society.</p><p>We’re aware that the data produced by the user’s activities, like geolocation, consuming behaviors, and other metadata is private and must be protected. With Ocean Protocol we’re sure to have the right partner to combine privacy requirements with opportunities for monetizing these data in favor of the users, says Björn Heinze (COO &amp; Legal) expert and specialist in data protection /&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a new Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality data. Ocean’s intuitive marketplace technology allows data to be published, discovered, and consumed in a secure, privacy-preserving manner. By giving power back to data owners, Ocean resolves the tradeoff between using private data and its public exposure.</p><p>About SmartPlaces Protocol</p><p>SmartPlaces’ mission is to provide users with a new way of social interaction based on the benefits of blockchain technology and to build a decentralized ecosystem. As a result, SmartPlaces Protocol helps to (re)connect people in real life and creates unique user experiences.</p><p>SmartPlaces Protocol introduces the “connect2earn” approach and rewards all users who contribute to interact with other users. SmartPlaces Protocol will also allow users to earn NFT-based identity and trust label that covers various use cases within the Metaverse.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/smartplaces-partners-with-ocean-protocol-to-unlock-data-monetization-for-web3-social-interaction-cb59d14033f5">SmartPlaces partners with Ocean Protocol to unlock data monetization for Web3 social interaction…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>"Privacy and Consent Management" is an exciting topic in a continuously changing market. Annie Bailey has just completed her latest Leadership Compass, which researches this market segment. To mark the release of this document, she joined Matthias for an Analyst Chat episode where she talks about the innovations and current developments.</p>
<p>In A Nutshell</p>
<p>In the episode 108 “Privacy &amp; Consent Management” Matthias hosts Anne Bailey.</p>
<p>Q: “From a definition point of view, what do we need to think of when we talk about privacy and consent management?”</p>
<p>Anne: “Yeah. So this is one of those terms where you could spin it in a lot of different ways, you know, privacy is so much in the public discourse that it doesn't really have a concrete definition anymore. So I thought it might be useful to get us all on the same page before we talk any more about it. So the way at least I have defined privacy and consent management in this most recent report. It's, of course, considering organizations and it's their administrative and governance capabilities over data privacy within their organization and of course, the tools and the solutions that are there to make that happen. So you could think of it then in a simplified manner about the capabilities that such a tool or a solution would have to the first group of capabilities, would then to be able to manage any incoming signals about privacy and consent. So these are things like being able to manage cookies and trackers that are on websites, being able to accept and then implement those consent or preference choices that an end user would make. And that would be over the range of different channels. So on a smart TV, on a mobile device, on a website, over the phone, via email in person interactions as well, should be considered. So that's all about managing the incoming signals. But what's also very important as well is the organization's ability to take care of their own internal management of privacy. So being able to govern sensitive data, which is in the organization and private data, being able to document their steps towards compliance and something which is a buzzword in this most recent report is being able to operationalize privacy.”</p>
<p>Q: “Recently, you published an updated version of your Leadership Compass report, which compares providers and services. What are the changes in the market that you can observe that you want to share with us?”</p>
<p>Anne: “Yeah. So this is an especially dynamic market area. Things are always changing. And so we can see some pretty big market changes between the report which published 18 months ago or so and the one which just came out this week. And that's in the types of vendors that were interested in participating. So what we saw in the last report were a lot of vendors that really focused on being able to manage those incoming signals, so being very focused on cookie management, on being able to collect consents and preferences and make sure that those are all able to be implemented in the many different connected systems within an organization and all the downstream vendors that may impact. Very focused on this incoming flow of information from end users. And what we saw, which was different in this report, is that there were more vendors that are really focused on data governance and using that as a foundation for privacy. So being able to operationalize and take action within the organization to further their privacy goals. And so we could think of that as an example. So being able to identify a privacy weakness of some sort in a process and then from that same administrative screen, then be able to do something to address that weakness. I guess we could go into more concrete details on what that could be. So, you know, if there was a scan done on a database and that scan returns the notification that there is private information in this database, there would then be the chance to leverage automation to go and anonymize those sensitive fields. So you're then connecting information about the status of privacy in the organization with an action to then improve it. So that was something that we noticed among several of the vendors that they're moving more in this direction. And that also does connect back to the relationship between the end user and the organization. So there was a big focus on being able to provide support for data subject requests and being able to process those. So in the same way of operationalizing privacy, if a consumer then submits a data subject request, the administrator would then be able to scan and automatically compile a report containing their personal information rather than needing to do that manually.”</p>
<p>Q: “Vendors offer products and services globally. Do you think they can catch up with changing privacy and consent requirements?”</p>
<p>Anne: “Mm-Hmm. Yeah. And frankly, this is really hard to stay up to date with because given our very globalized presence on the internet and connection with consumers all around the world, many organizations do have to stay up to date with the regulations that are not just for their own jurisdiction and in the region where they reside, but they have to pay attention to where their customers are, where any of their downstream suppliers or, you know, MarTech partners may reside and where this data is moving. So they have to be aware of a much wider legal domain than they've been used to before. And as I mentioned before, this is a really dynamic space. And part of that is because there are many privacy regulations which are being released all around the world. So this is something that we've identified as a really key capability in privacy and consent management tools, is that having some basis, some support from legal experts in-house to be able to keep up with all of these changing regulations and be able to pass that knowledge down to their customers is a really valuable thing.”</p>

 To stake or not to stake? Or even better, should I choose to stake or should I create my own candidate node instead? Is it worth it? What are the benefits? This and more you can find answered in this article, brought to you by your Telegram admin, Ontology Harbinger and proud owner of candidate node “CZ/SK Ontology community node”,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">DuMonT</a>.  Which one is better for&nbsp;me? <p>In order to make a correct decision, you should know what staking is, what it means to run a candidate node, and what are the main differences. To put it simply, staking means that you assign your ONTs to a candidate or consensus node. For doing this, you earn ONG rewards based on the distribution ratio set by the node owner. On the other hand, as a node owner, the main advantage is that you manage the distribution ratio. Let’s see the main pros and cons of both approaches.</p> Staking <p>(+) Low limit - you can stake as little as 1 ONT, while the upper limit depends on how much the specific node can accept from&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>(+) Higher flexibility - you can decide to cancel the full, or part of the stake at any time. Your tokens are unlocked when consensus round ends (in the case of unstaking from candidate nodes).</p><p>(+) No entry barrier - no extra fees applied, only a transaction fee of 0.05&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>(-) Trust in the node owner - your rewards depend mainly on the node’s distribution ratio, the risk is that node owner can change it or even cut it to 0, which may force you to stake to a different node. To minimize the risk, it is recommended to either stake with nodes that have stable fee sharing ratio checkmark at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>, or regularly check whether the node you stake with changed the ratio to unfavorable values.</p><p>(-) Switching nodes - if you decide to change a node, cancelling the stake and staking to a different node will result in losing 1 consensus round of&nbsp;rewards.</p> Candidate node&nbsp;owner <p>(+) You manage the distribution ratio - you decide on how much % of generated rewards you keep, and how much is distributed to your&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>(+) Potentially higher rewards - explained in next parts of&nbsp;article.</p><p>(+) A way to promote yourself/your company.</p><p>(-) Higher entry limit - minimum amount to start a candidate node is 10,000&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>(-) Lower flexibility — as a node operator you can not reduce your stake below 10,000 ONT, or unstake such an amount that would result in user stake being more than 10x higher than your remaining node stake (example: your node stake is 15K ONT, user stake is 100K ONT, at max you can unstake 5K ONT). In case you would need to unstake more, you must cancel your node entirely.</p><p>(-) Entry fee - to start a node you need to pay a fixed 500 ONG fee, + 0.05 ONG transaction fee.</p> Summary <p>Staking is a great way to get passive rewards for holding your ONTs. Moreover, it is suitable for everyone as you can stake from as little as 1 ONT, and it also provides more flexibility than when you run a node. You can learn more about staking in the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ultimate-ontology-staking-guide-e70c44330429">Ultimate Ontology Staking Guide</a>. On the other hand, if you have more than 10,000 ONTs, and you are a long term holder that wants to maximize your rewards, it is a good time to consider creating your own candidate node.</p> I want to run a candidate node! <p>So you decided to run a candidate node? In the next part, I will cover how to create a candidate node, the requirements, and possible strategies.</p> How it&nbsp;works? <p>Ontology candidate nodes are nodes which do not validate transactions. They could become active validators if they get to the top 15 by size, which would turn them to consensus nodes. A basic candidate node is something like staking pool, which creates room for stakers. Therefore, once you register a candidate node, and you are not in the top 15, you are not required to have your device online 24/7. This is all you need to start generating ONG rewards. In addition, you could run an online node, which synchronizes the blocks generated by consensus nodes. This would require your device to be online but does not bring you any extra rewards as you do not actively participate in consensus. If you still want to go in that direction, then you can find documentation at <a href="https://docs.ont.io/ontology-node/abstract">https://docs.ont.io/ontology-node/abstract</a>, but it also requires some technical skill.</p> How to launch a candidate node? <p>The main tool you need is OWallet on your PC. It is a desktop wallet application developed by Ontology. Download it only from the official GitHub source: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases</a>.</p><p>Once you have OWallet installed, you can create a new wallet, import your existing wallet, or use a Ledger hardware wallet. Last but not least, you need at least 10,000 ONT in your wallet address, + at least 500.05 ONG. Ontology published a step-by-step guide on how to proceed within OWallet, you can find the guide here: <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/guides/sign-up-to-run-an-ontology-node">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/guides/sign-up-to-run-an-ontology-node</a></p><p>Once you launch the node within OWallet, and set important settings, you just need to wait until a new consensus round begins. At that point, your node generates rewards which will be available for you to claim after each consensus round&nbsp;ends.</p> Explanation of important settings in&nbsp;OWallet <p>There are few important settings, which you definitely should not miss because they define rewards distribution as well as how stakers see&nbsp;you.</p>  Allowed stake unit — located at the “User stake Authorization” page, determines how many ONT your node can accept from stakers. By default it is set to 0, which means stakers can not stake at your node. The maximum value you can set is 10x of your initial node stake, and you can also see this value in the table below. So, if your node stake is 10K ONT, you can set a maximum of 100K&nbsp;ONT.    Fee sharing ratio — located at at “User Stake Authorization” page, determines the distribution ratio of rewards between the node operator and its stakers. You set the ratio for the node’s initial stake and user stake separately. Remember, in OWallet, you set reward values which you, as node operator, decide to keep. The remaining rewards are automatically distributed to stakers. The first value represents % of rewards generated by the node initial stake, while the second value represents % of rewards generated by the user stake. If you set it to 100/100, this would mean you keep all rewards and stakers get 0 (so nobody will stake with you). On the other hand, if you set it to 0/0 then all rewards will go to the stakers and you get 0. The trick is to find the ideal setting which fits your strategy. Some popular ratios are 90/10, or even more generous to stakers, 90/5. This would be displayed to stakers at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a> as 10/95. Keep in mind that any change of ratio takes effect in the consensus round after the next one. (Example: you change the ratio in OWallet during round 150. When round 151 begins, it will be displayed to stakers at node.ont.io as the next round ratio and becomes effective when round 152&nbsp;begins).  Node info — it is a separate page where you can fill in all the information about your node. For instance, you can change the node name, set a logo, etc. If you want to obtain a “Verified” checkmark next to your node at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>, you need to also fill in the “Email to contact with Ontology”. You can learn more about checkmarks at <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/node-checkmark">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/node-checkmark</a>   When will I get&nbsp;rewards? <p>Reward distribution frequency is the same as when you are a staker. You do not get rewards for the round during which you launch a node, but you get your first rewards for the next consensus round. Rewards are added to your profit section each time when a consensus round ends. You can claim them after each round, or keep them accumulating and claim anytime you like. (Example: you launch the node during consensus round 150, you will get your first rewards when round 151 ends and the next rewards when round 152 ends,&nbsp;etc.)</p> Candidate node possible strategies   Operator only — some candidate nodes decide not to allow user staking to their node so they participate only with their node initial stake. In this case, they keep all rewards generated by node initial stake, but lose the potential of getting additional rewards from user stake. The difference from normal staking is that they do not need to worry about changing the distribution ratio, because they are node&nbsp;owners.  Self promotion — some nodes may decide to use their node for promotional purposes, such as Unifi Protocol node, which distributes 100% of all rewards to stakers. Node operator gets 0 rewards but in return is well visible in the community, which can help achieve long term goals of the operator in the&nbsp;future.  Win/win — this strategy means that you set a distribution ratio, which gives you, as node operator, higher rewards than you would get with the “operator only” strategy, and at the same time gives good rewards to stakers, which motivates them to stake with you. Success of this strategy depends on the node operator’s ability to attract stakers, because the goal of such a node is to achieve 100% filling of the staking capacity. An example may be Harbinger nodes, which are represented by outstanding members of the Ontology community. Stakers can decide to stake with those Harbingers to support them and their work, instead of some company or corporation.  Anything else — you can develop your own strategy which fits you best&nbsp;:)  <p>In the end, I hope this article helped you with your decision making process.

<p>200,000 OCEAN available for Web3 data economy projects!</p><p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the month. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">The Ocean ecosystem becomes self-sustainable</a> as the builders of the Web3 data economy leverage Ocean Protocol to create products, services, and resources that the community finds valuable and fosters value creation for the Ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">The OceanDAO website</a> has up-to-date information on getting started with OceanDAO.</p><p>OceanDAO’s next funding round — Round 14 — has 200,000 OCEAN available. Submissions are due February 1st 2022; we encourage you to submit early, reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a> for feedback and guidance. The rest of this post has details about Round&nbsp;14.</p><p>Thank you to all of the OceanDAO participants, voters, and proposers.</p> OceanDAO Round 14&nbsp;Outline  Funding Amount <p>There is 200,000 OCEAN in grant funding available in Round&nbsp;14.</p> Grant Funding Categories   Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself   Submit your&nbsp;Proposal <p>As a builder, you can check out the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO home page</a> to get onboarded and create your proposal. Once completed, you can submit your proposal to our forum:&nbsp;<a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-14/74">Port</a>.</p><p>As a voter, Port is where you can see all proposal details and cast an informed&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO receive funding in&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> Project Standing <p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing. This enables eligibility in upcoming Funding Rounds. Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p> Funding Tiers <p>To incentivize completion and outcomes we are continuing Funding Tiers, which can be achieved by Teams delivering on their grant promises.</p><p>The funding tiers&nbsp;are:</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>4. Veteran&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $35,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 5 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>Above are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects for OceanDAO Grants Round 13. The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  24,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  12,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  134,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>A total of 200k OCEAN is available.</p><p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to Ocean Protocol there are earmarked Core Tech Initiatives that are being continuously expanded upon. You can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#4-build--improve-core-ocean-software-core-tech-initiatives-earmark">view them inside our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>Please find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech Working Group discord channel</a> and review your proposal ahead of time to qualify for the Core-Tech Earmark.</p><p>Unleash Data&nbsp;Category</p><p>In Round 13 we have revised the Unleash Data Category to have the same rules as the rest of the Funding Categories. They can qualify again for funding up to 35,000 OCEAN conditional that Unleash Data projects:</p>  “Unleash data” has actually always had a broad intent, towards driving Data Consume Volume. It is intended for projects like: becoming a data broker to get data owners’ data into Ocean Market, networking / “hitting the phones” to increase consumption on Ocean Market, integrating Filecoin &amp; publishing data on Ocean Market, etc. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#3-unleash-data">Here are further examples</a>. It was never meant to be solely for constructing / maintaining a small number of datasets.  Whatever is proposed should be high value-add to the Ocean ecosystem.  Example of poor value-add: requesting a lot of OCEAN to construct / maintain a small number of datasets to sell with expectation of profit. We expect and encourage OceanDAO voters to downvote such proposals.  <p>Burning becomes Recycling</p><p>Starting Round 13, any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the Treasury.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">For intuition on how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>You can find all the steps&nbsp;below:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  Any remaining funds inside an Earmark, are then moved towards [General&nbsp;Grants]  [New &amp; Core Tech] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Categories].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds inside the [General Grants] Category are moved back to the treasury.  <p>Quadratic Voting</p><p>We are planning to ship Quadratic Voting for Round&nbsp;14.</p><p>This will include a portal where participants will be able to register, receive a voting boost, and increase their total voting&nbsp;power.</p><p>Please keep an eye on Twitter and Discord for announcements.</p><p>Working Groups</p><p>Head to the <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> and dive into each Working Group. There you will find each Working Group’s respective documents, stewards, members list, meeting times, and&nbsp;more:</p>  Project Guiding Working&nbsp;Group  Parameters &amp; Roadmap Working&nbsp;Group  Core Tech Working&nbsp;Group  OceanDAO Engineering Working&nbsp;Group  Data Consume Volume Working&nbsp;Group  Ambassadors Working&nbsp;Group  <p>Working Group&nbsp;Outline</p>  Each Working Group has its own public discord sub-channel. Then, each Working Group can leverage real-time discord channels (voice/video).  Each Working Group has its own membership + working&nbsp;process.  Each Working Group has a weekly or bi-weekly call.

<p>In the world of real-time ACH payments, open banking instant account verification is quickly making the old, manual methods look like the rotary phone. Why use an unreliable relic, when there’s a better, more secure, faster innovation? Throughout the years, financial institutions have relied on voided checks, manual routing and account number input by the consumer and microdeposits. These require days or weeks to complete, and are prone to errors or fraud.</p>
<p>More recently, data consortiums were used to confirm customer-submitted account details, checking them against existing databases. This assisted with clearing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Mixed-solution authenticators provided a fraud risk rating for the account being verified, but their information was sometimes based on older data. At best, these methods yielded only a sensible prediction of risk. With FinicityPay, failed payment risk is mitigated by obtaining account owner and balance insights prior to processing.</p>
<p>Previous methods of verification were rife with processing delays and lost revenue due to failed payments and fraud. Open banking APIs and platforms are the next evolution of payments. Faster, more secure and more transparent.</p>
 Open Banking Platforms Create a Real-Time Network of Connections to Financial Institutions 
 
 Trusted financial data aggregation platforms facilitate secure access to consumer-permissioned data via traditional connections (enriched with bank-level security) and APIs. 
 Tokenized access to account credentials is granted to third-party financial services innovators, utility providers and investment platforms, opening up consumer options. 
 Open banking is making third-party ACH payments faster and more secure, maximizing savings, rewards and investment opportunities. 
 A simple account balance check smooths the pre-funding path and protects consumers and merchants alike from failed payments and potential fees. 
 
<p>Using secure, consumer-permissioned access, financial institutions and vendors now get instant account balances and data from a consumer’s bank. Owner details, addresses, account and routing numbers and real-time balances are all immediately available. They can be scrutinized before authorizing payments on an open banking platform. Account access credentials are packaged into a “token” that can be passed to a third party. It yields no meaningful data if intercepted and hacked. This new level of security is spawning a much larger, more niche-oriented market of financial services providers and app developers. Open banking applications allow users to move money at the speed of the market.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking Opens Up Payment Enablement and Authentication 
 
 Innovation across all data-sharing stakeholders in the ecosystem expands what you can do to verify data and customize it to fit your payment use cases. 
 New technologies like AI are now available to integrate into your user experience. Move customers through your account setup process quickly and intuitively, while gaining permission to curated data that fits your needs.&nbsp; 
 Once an account is authenticated, payments from it can be issued instantly (dependent upon market/account providers) throughout your suite of products. Financial management, investment, utilities and recurring payments are all open for immediate money movement. 
 
<p>All of this has been revolutionary for consumers. Their mobile phones are full of financial services options powered by open banking, and they’re adopting them at a rapid pace. With a few taps on the screen, a user can grant permission to third-party apps and platforms, without having to type in account or routing numbers. The app or service the user wants to access is up and running with a full package of information pre-loaded. Secure, real-time ACH payments can be made within moments of installing and setting up an app. With the richer level of insight that’s available through consumer-permissioned data, developers are giving consumers a wealth of new options for managing, spending, and borrowing money. This is industry-changing innovation. It’s giving consumers more flexibility and ownership of their financial position than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking Simplifies the Payments Experience for Consumers 
 
 Customers aren’t asked to supply sensitive information, just permission to their accounts. 
 No more waiting periods for further verifications, like microdeposits or database checks. The customer’s data is pulled in milliseconds and rolled into the app they’re using, making real-time payments a breeze. 
 Financial management apps with AI integration pull together a holistic picture of the consumer’s moment-to-moment financial well-being.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While authenticating account details, ownership and current balance can streamline your payment process, it also reduces the hassle of setting up accounts and making payments for your customers. Enhancing their experience, especially when setting up payment is one of the first interactions they have with you.</p>

        <p>Major transaction processors in the Bitcoin SV network are upgrading to accept and handle Bitcoin block sizes up to 4 Gigabyte.</p>
  <p>On January 24, 2022, major transaction processors in the Bitcoin SV network are upgrading to accept and handle Bitcoin block sizes up to 4 Gigabyte!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The upgrade to 4GB is a breakthrough that will help everyone in the BSV ecosystem. TAAL is here to support the community and to help every BSV transaction processor to mine bigger and bigger blocks. That’s why we’re encouraging all miners to immediately increase their excessive block size limit to 4GB. They’ll be able to take full advantage of the node upgrade to expand their revenues and client base,” said Lars Jorgensen, TAAL Chief Operating Officer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin protocol does not have a limit on the block size (!), it is up to the decentralized transaction processors (aka “Miners”) to decide how big a block they accept based on their own capacity.</p>
<p>The market decides. When there is a market demand for more transactions and thereby larger blocks, the transaction processors will invest in hardware, network and energy contracts to be able to capture and handle more transactions efficiently and earn the transaction fees on the transactions they process and store.</p>
<p>The old term “Crypto Mining” becomes irrelevant as the initial “block reward” diminishes and becomes irrelevant compared to the massive amount of (very low) transaction fees. Transaction processors are not “mining crypto” they are processing transactions and storing data in the distributed blockchain.</p>
<p>Now when the Bitcoin blocks become larger and store many million transactions, the energy cost per transaction also becomes irrelevant, especially as the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) becomes very high due to the practical use of Bitcoin blockchain technology in for example enabling Global Supply Chains to become more efficient.</p>
<p>Global Supply Chains waste at least 80%! i.e., global supply chains end-to-end aggregated efficiency is less than 20%. If we can increase global supply chains efficiency by just some percentages by using Bitcoin Blockchain technology the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) will be enormous! Not to mention the enormous positive environmental and sustainability effects that will bring us.</p>

			<p>Tokeny, the Luxembourg-based tokenization platform, announced today a partnership with Inveniam Capital Partners, Inc. (“Inveniam”), a SaaS company delivering trust, transparency and completeness of data to private market assets. The partnership includes a €5m investment by Inveniam, Apex, and K20 Fund.</p>
<p>Inveniam works with private market asset owners and managers to deliver trusted valuation and pricing data using distributed ledger technology. This data underpins private market digital assets and gives these assets integrity upon which market participants can establish price discovery. The benefit to asset owners and managers is a more liquid asset, which can unlock value.</p>
<p>Tokeny offers a comprehensive and institutional-grade white-label solution for digital assets that allows asset owners and managers to efficiently and compliantly issue, transfer, and manage digital assets. All processes, from the client onboarding process including KYC/AML checks to the administration required to manage investor subscriptions, capital tables, distributions, capital calls, etc., are streamlined on the Tokeny platform.</p>
<p>The partnership aims to fully unlock asset liquidity via tokenization, which will be facilitated by providing all technical solutions private asset owners need, covering the entire value chain of tokenized assets underpinned with trusted data regarding asset valuation and pricing. These synergies can return significant value to each company’s clients.</p>

		 
	 
    We’ve been watching the Tokeny team’s progress and product evolution for more than two years and know they're building next-gen tokenization systems the efficient and compliant way. Totally altering the global trading of private market assets will only work on the institutional level if the experience is seamless, the technology is top-notch, and the right regulatory structures and business networks are in place. This partnership addresses all those requirements for success.  Patrick O'MearaChairman and CEO of Inveniam    
	 
		 
			<p>While Tokeny’s solutions provide a compliance infrastructure enabling asset managers to easily bring nearly every kind of real-world asset to blockchain, Inveniam allows their investors to access trusted data and asset valuation. Liquidity will be realized as investors can conduct peer-to-peer transfers using Tokeny’s compliance framework with a fair and transparent price reference provided by Inveniam.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokeny’s capabilities pick up right where Inveniam’s end and vice versa, addressing two biggest obstacles in private markets — pricing data and compliance — on a hyper-efficient infrastructure. In tandem with this very synergistic partnership, the investment by Apex, K20, and Inveniam will allow us to further improve our solutions and accelerate the adoption of tokenization with the best-in-class technology.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions    
	 
		 
			<p>Additional value to the market will accrue as the partnership will ultimately enable Apex Group, Inveniam’s fund administration partner, to deliver end-to-end cutting-edge services to a broad ecosystem of private asset owners.</p>

 MetaMUI and Sovereign Yidindji Government launched 1st Self-Sovereign Identity-based National ID&nbsp;system 1st Self-Sovereign Identity-based App “Yidindji SSID” for Yidindji’s National ID&nbsp;system<p>We are delighted to announce that our first E-Government pilot program with the Sovereign Yidindji Government has been successfully completed on Jan 7,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The Sovereign Yidindji government is a representative of Sovereign Yidindji which is a rainforest-based micronation with several clan groups in the area described as far north Queensland on the Australian continent and it has a combined population of more than 150,000 Australian citizens and Yidindji citizens. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the planet. In 2014, history was made on September 20 as the official government of the Yidindji nation came into life with the launch of its coat of arms. Since then, the SYG, as it is known, has created several departments and its parliament continues to pass laws for the peace, order and good governance of the Yidindji territory. Currently, SYG has 17 ministers and 22 ministries and plans to be the first government to become fully digitized in its venture towards E-Governance and national ID&nbsp;system.</p><p>The purpose of this pilot program was to establish the world first fully blockchain-based E-Government. During the six-month pilot program, Sovereign Wallet Network(SWN) team has implemented the first self-sovereign identity-based national identity system to digitize all government services such as digital identity authentication, vaccination certificate, and digital administrative works.</p><p>We just finished our first step to open the gate for making governments become automated and fully compatible with each other country on top of MetaMUI Blockchain. MetaMUI Blockchain is the world’s first blockchain that every government and institution can issue their own digital currency while complying with all the financial legal conditions. MetaMUI Blockchain allows users to have their own Decentralized Identity(DID) and all the personal information of the users only stays inside the users’ device. Every ownership of the assets is bound to the identity of the user, not to the private key, therefore it can be recovered should the user lose the private key. This will make every bank adopt MetaMUI Blockchain to build a practical application for their customers and it will allow the customers borrow, lend and store their digital currency and digital assets through the&nbsp;app.</p><p>The Yidindji SSID and MetaMUI SSID will soon provide more functions such as storing various digital assets including NFTs, Carbon Credits, Stocks and even gold certificates. These 2 apps will also present a special feature called “Pairwise Trust”. Pairwise Trust is a two-way cryptographic binding system that enables users to login any websites without registering a new ID and password but only with DID. Users can also avoid phishing websites through its Pairwise Trust function because the two-cryptographic binding makes possible not only the users prove themselves to the website but also the website must prove itself to the users through the&nbsp;system.</p><p>More innovations will come through the year of 2022 and our journey has just begun. We are glad that we could deliver this wonderful news to our audience at the very first month of this year and we will keep building and developing our technology to make a better&nbsp;world.</p><p>Cointelegraph article:<br><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/metamui-and-sovereign-yidindji-government-launched-1st-self-sovereign-identity-based-national-id-system">https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/metamui-and-sovereign-yidindji-government-launched-1st-self-sovereign-identity-based-national-id-system</a></p><p>Sovereign Yidinji SSID Launch Video: <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjX1OysGbk4&amp;t=102s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjX1OysGbk4&amp;t=102s</a></p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism(CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

 Ontology Opens New German Office To Expand Its Digital Identity Solutions and Web3 Infrastructure Across&nbsp;Europe  Ontology aims to contribute to the burgeoning European privacy ecosystem through new partnerships, community members, and employees <p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the project bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions, has today announced the opening of a new European office in Berlin,&nbsp;Germany.</p><p>Ontology’s move reflects its alignment with Europe’s efforts to increase data privacy and protection through legislation such as GDPR. In addition, the European Commission’s endorsement of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2663">Digital Identity</a> as a more secure and convenient means for data storage and exchange for citizens makes Germany an ideal environment for Ontology’s expansion. By opening its new office in Europe, Ontology aims to play a role in increasing privacy across the continent and highlight the benefits that its decentralized solutions can bring to users and regulators alike.</p><p>Increasing privacy, transparency, and trust, Ontology’s high speed, low cost blockchain is designed to give users and enterprises the flexibility to build blockchain-based solutions that suit their needs, while also ensuring regulatory compliance. <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a>, Ontology’s decentralized digital identity application, which enables users to fully control their digital identity, surpassed 1.5 million users in September 2021. Other products include the <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO</a> wallet, which allows users to securely manage their identities, data, and digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Europe is one of the largest hubs for blockchain related services and Web3 innovation worldwide, with much of the action happening in Berlin, which has seen over <a href="https://links.angel.co/u/click?_t=26b4e8aeb47d4cd3acd5eba415f76f62&amp;_m=2bf0624adc7b4627af6b1684bdcb8210&amp;_e=jnAKQaFyCL4Xj1-PO3VdQpiRJtpBJducEChrJfyUW_7VgEonJHdQ_piG16mHseFTHkoy_KCla9fVN9G5Kxjv510qFjOP9hi0Sr9heMsNfrNXTpACCiVi8nRszWWQZJG01YxUCeiKjWXBtRxjaKWqEmgT2I5ngx69Am-m7pEHHcI-reY_05akQEdngBU6eTx9BhfT19nc8UlJBj0ZEdarrvYiWMDhh465x-4Bf5gm7rivF-iNmvaW5nH30ApI3LZHIvaUbHUGObxEIn6FtKCNJgSI-gVfXOk3gRnMy8IPAqmsaxeNptRUr-P45G8yd1Vl7j_Hj6q9rhn-ezY9aYvHUaNb0pjmzCTXzw7UFPgrkZLmoQdgU4-wV9ZryYKpMutH">$13 billion of investment</a> since 2016. As such, Ontology has chosen Berlin as a key strategic location where it will aim to expand its reach and capitalize on the incredible talent and resources available.</p><p>Gloria WU, Chief of Ecosystem Partnerships at Ontology, said: “Europe sits at the forefront of Web3 and technical innovation and its continued focus on increasing user privacy and security aligns clearly with our mission at Ontology. By opening our new office in Berlin, we are excited to contribute to the continent’s ongoing efforts to create a more secure web. We look forward to growing our presence in Europe and contributing to the ecosystem through a host of new partnerships, community members, and employees. We are currently hiring for a number of roles available.”</p><p>The opening of the office supplements Ontology’s long standing roots in Europe, which have been established through a host of different partnerships. Following on from its previous partnership with Mercedes parent Daimler Mobility to develop<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/welcome-home-is-now-approved-f8aada08a1bc"> Welcome Home</a>, an in-car system designed to transform driving experiences, Ontology recently <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-decentralized-mobility-platform-bloxmove-to-bring-interoperable-6490c6f50112">partnered</a> with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-decentralized-mobility-platform-bloxmove-to-bring-interoperable-6490c6f50112">bloXmove</a>, a European mobility blockchain platform designed to simplify travel across multiple forms of transportation. The partnership will see bloXmove integrate Ontology’s decentralized digital identity protocol into its platform, providing users with an identifier that will allow them to share their verifiable credentials, such as driving licenses and passports just once, in a way that is totally private, secure, and encrypted.</p><p>Specifically in Berlin, Ontology has partnered with the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-to-collaborate-with-berlins-htw-university-to-advance-blockchain-education-research-7ee413022d56">Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft</a> (HTW) University to explore joint research and teaching initiatives, with a view to developing a number of bespoke blockchain applications.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>A few keen-eyed readers pointed out that I never wrote a follow-up article on last year’s DevCamp. They’re absolutely right; all I wrote since the start was this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-more-holochain-releases/#devcamp-8">small update</a> halfway through the course. It’s time to write something!</p><p>As you may have heard, over 1800 people signed up for the DevCamp, which amazed us all. This was a huge increase from the previous DevCamp’s roughly <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/speedy-improved-holochain-release-unblocks-all-the-things/#register-for-devcamp-7">200</a> registrants. More and more people are hearing about Holochain, among them developers who may go on to create some really wonderful apps.</p><p>I’m so grateful to the DevCamp organisers. I think they did a fantastic job presenting a pretty demanding subject to a huge group of people, all online and spread out across time zones. They facilitated with enthusiasm, structure, patience, and compassion. This was a big project, and they faced it courageously and skillfully. (Did you know that they were all volunteers, doing it simply because they love the project?)</p><p>The organisers did have some selection criteria to make sure it would be a rewarding experience for participants — this was, after all, meant to train people to build Holochain apps, so it probably would only be useful to people who intended to build Holochain apps. Roughly 1000 of the registrants were selected for participation, and roughly 400 enrolled once they were accepted.</p><p>Over the course of the DevCamp’s two-month schedule, we did see a drop in participation. Live session attendance dropped by 67% between the beginning and the end of the course. This might sound disappointing, but it’s actually quite good — various studies say online courses see from <a href="http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html">85%</a> to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2019/01/16/study-offers-data-show-moocs-didnt-achieve-their-goals">97%</a> dropout rate. This shows that an above-average number of people committed themselves to learning a pretty demanding subject.</p><p>Not knowing why individual participants decided to leave, I have some guesses: some may have found the course load or meeting times didn’t work for their schedules, others may have decided that Rust or Holochain development wasn’t for them, and still others may simply have joined because they wanted to learn a little bit about the project but not develop an app.</p><p>Some Holo team members helped with the DevCamp too, which gave us the opportunity to do some research. We learned a few important things:</p>  People don’t get interested in Holochain simply because it solves a technical problem for them. Instead, they get involved because they believe in the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/what-holochain/">values</a> it represents — agency, accountability, privacy, cooperation, voluntary participation. They want to join a movement, not just use a piece of tech.  Holochain’s community is unique among open-source communities — it seems stronger, more closely knit and supportive, with passionate people who are willing to give their time to help newcomers. (The DevCamp organisers are a case in point!) Reputation revolves around commitment to helping others grow, rather than crowing about one’s accomplishments.  It’s not just one ‘community’ either — there are many communities who value slightly different things or are focused on different aspects of the project. There are a lot of different perspectives about what matters. In a way, the tech and the social structures mirror each other.  DevCamps are a special way to experience the health of the community — it might be that the community is the most valuable part, because they create a supportive space for learners and help them become part of the Holochain community at large. The Discord server, in particular, was a great addition to DevCamp 8, and resulted in a lot more active conversations than the <a href="https://forum.holochain.org">forum</a> had had in previous DevCamps.  There’s a steep learning curve. Not only is Rust a new language for most, but Holochain is quite different from either cloud or blockchain. Many DevCamp participants had already participated in a DevCamp but wanted to reinforce or refresh their knowledge. The strong, supportive community also helps people gather the courage to meet this challenge.  Many participants feel like there was still so much to learn by the end of the course. In fact, we learned that some had already participated in a DevCamp and wanted a refresher. This reinforces what we learned about the learning curve, and suggests that a community, ongoing events, and self-serve resources for alumni would be useful.  Not everybody can participate in a DevCamp or online learning community. Time constraints — busy life or time zone differences — are the biggest barriers. Most people participated asynchronously, replaying the recorded session videos and chatting on Discord. We would do well to develop more self-serve resources for those people. (Fortunately, the organisers have published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuXrtFJO6zVMOMiqt0iOvwGtEba470wi">all of DevCamp 8’s session videos</a> on YouTube, which is a great start!)  Session 1 of the DevCamp Holochain 0.0.122: big gossip performance improvements <p>Most of the recent Holochain releases have been maintenance releases.</p><blockquote>But today’s release brings big New Year news. I’ve been looking forward to sharing this one!</blockquote><p>Recently one of the core developers has been troubleshooting a performance bottleneck we saw in the Elemental Chat tests. Gossiped DHT ops were being integrated at a rate of 40 per second, which seemed unusually slow because it didn’t involve a lot of processing.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with the mechanics of the DHT, here’s how it works: when an agent commits an element to their source chain, it results in the creation of a number of DHT operations. These operations are messages, sent to peers on the DHT, that update their local DHT shard. Here’s an example of the ops produced by a ‘create app entry’ element:</p>  A <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.StoreElement"><code>StoreElement</code></a> operation stores the header in the neighbourhood of the new header’s hash.  A <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.StoreEntry"><code>StoreEntry</code></a> operation stores the entry, and a copy of the header, in the neighbourhood of the new entry’s hash.  Finally, a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.RegisterAgentActivity"><code>RegisterAgentActivity</code></a> operation stores a copy of the header in the neighbourhood of the author’s public key, allowing those authorities to detect source chain forks or serve up source chain segments to other validators.  <p>Each of these operations has to be ‘integrated’ by the authorities in the neighbourhood — that is, validated and stored in their DHT shard. This happens initially, at publish time, when the author first sends out these operations. But it also happens on an ongoing basis, as new peers join the DHT and start building their shard, or as peers disappear and cause remaining peers to increase their coverage. These peers share this information through gossip, which happens at regular intervals — more frequently for new data, less frequently for historical data.</p><p>In the Elemental Chat tests, the historical data gossip loop was slowing down HoloPorts. Part of this was because sharding wasn’t yet turned on, which meant that everybody gossiped everything with everybody else. But that ended up being a great way to catch this performance problem.</p><p>The solution was to optimise the table that stores the operations, along with the queries that manipulate it (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1167">#1167</a>). Now, operations are integrated at a rate of 1000 per second — a 25× increase!</p><p>There are other changes you should know about as a developer:</p>  The conductor API lets you manually insert elements into a source chain. This will be used to build source chain redundancy for Holo hosting, as well as source chain backup and restore for natively installed Holochain instances. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1166">#1166</a>)  Breaking: The <code>Path</code> abstraction for working with links has changed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1156">#1167</a>)  Breaking: You can now query a source chain by ranges — either between two sequence numbers, between two hashes, or the most recent element plus a certain number of preceding elements.

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the launch of <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops on GlobaliD</a>.</p><p>Every crypto project faces the same challenge: How to strategically or fairly distribute tokens to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>A common practice is called an airdrop — giving away tokens to users who qualify for certain terms or accomplish certain tasks. For example, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, created one billion governance tokens and airdropped 15% of them to anyone who had used the protocol up to that point — 400 UNI tokens in total, at the time, worth about&nbsp;$2000.</p><p>Airdrops are a great way to distribute tokens to your most active and engaged users while also helping to promote and market the&nbsp;project.</p><p>But as airdrops have gained in popularity and prominence — and with significant money at stake — these distributions are increasingly vulnerable to people gaming the system, undermining their equity and effectiveness. When bots sabotage your airdrop, it compromises the strategic intent of the token distribution.</p><p>For any project, the goal is to reach engaged users that are real people. Naturally, that extends to NFT drops, DeFi platforms, and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) as&nbsp;well.</p> Trusted Airdrops <p>By introducing self-sovereign identity to airdrops, you can now guarantee that real people receive tokens rather than bots in a privacy preserving way. It’s the natural symbiosis between decentralized finance and decentralized identity.</p><p>With GlobaliD’s Trusted Airdrops, developers can quickly and easily verify that wallets belong to real&nbsp;people.</p><p>Users that receive airdrops can conveniently verify themselves and participate in exciting new projects without compromising ownership or control over their identity or their data. GlobaliD never sees users’ private data, which is encrypted and decentralized.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/why-self-sovereign-identity-matters-8fd2c982ca2e">Learn more about why self-sovereign identity&nbsp;matters</a>  <p>The process is simple and straightforward:</p>  Developers create a signup link for their airdrop through&nbsp;GlobaliD  Recipients follow the link to verify their&nbsp;identity  Recipients add a wallet and get their&nbsp;drop  <p>You can learn more about the process&nbsp;here:</p>  <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>For projects building on XRPL, they can leverage <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-globalid-enhances-trust-for-xrpl-labs-xumm-wallet-d397cc836cf7">GlobaliD’s native integration with XUMM Wallet</a>, the most popular XRP wallet in the ecosystem that boasts over 200,000 active&nbsp;users.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs/status/1410301192702410757">How to verify your XUMM Wallet with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>It’s also incredibly cool to see the many projects come up with hacky solutions for custom needs.

In just the last few weeks, we’ve seen dozens of projects choose GlobaliD through word of&nbsp;mouth.</p><p>In order to meet and address that demand, we’re actively working toward improving our documentation and developer support. That starts with the <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops</a> landing page, but it’s just the beginning.</p><p>It’s also just the tip of the iceberg for what’s possible with GlobaliD and the entire suite of tools available for developers. That includes GlobaliD Groups for building communities as well as the GlobaliD Wallet for payments.</p><p>We’ve also been working with a handful of DeFi organizations to address some of their biggest challenges — all while maintaining the decentralized spirit of their platform.</p><p>That includes:</p>  ID verification for compliance (Green DeFi or&nbsp;XeFi)  Elimination of bots, scams, and bad actors on the&nbsp;network  Protecting their master nodes and protocols  <p>So stay tuned for more exciting releases in the very near future (including a noncustodial wallet) as we look to make self-sovereign identity more useful for more&nbsp;people.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-globalid-enhances-trust-for-xrpl-labs-xumm-wallet-d397cc836cf7">How GlobaliD enhances trust for XRPL Labs’ XUMM&nbsp;Wallet</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/trusted-airdrops-with-globalid-cf7cd6b51797">Trusted Airdrops with GlobaliD</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The online sports betting market in Ontario, Canada is seeing rapid expansion after lawmakers passed a bill (C-218) in June 2021, removing the prohibition of single-game betting in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This bill allows players to make single bets, rather than the previously allowed combination-only betting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result of this bill is hugely increased flexibility for both operators and bettors, as single bets make up a sizable portion of gambling activity and are some of the simplest to both place and offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sports betting regulation in Canada comes down to local governments, with each province having authority over the regulations in their jurisdiction and Ontario is no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In July 2021, shortly after the passing of C-218, Ontario created iGaming Ontario (iGO) – a body to conduct and manage iGaming in Ontario, serving directly as a subsidiary of the pre-existing Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of iGaming Ontario is to enter into agreements with operators, allowing them to offer online gaming experiences to residents of Ontario, so long as they are compliant with the new legal code and provincial law. One of the four iGO and AGCO’s market objectives is Consumer protection quoted on <a href="https://igamingontario.ca/en">IGO website</a> are 3 bullet points:&nbsp;</p>



  Ensure safe and responsible play, and game integrity&nbsp;  Prevent underage access  Ensure compliance by private operators with applicable laws, including compliance with anti-money laundering rules and regulations and compliance with relevant privacy and information security laws&nbsp;  



<p>A full list of <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a> details what is expected of operators and what kind of rules and regulations are being enforced for iGaming in Ontario. These are largely based on existing standards of Ontario’s regulatory body, AGCO, and there are some key things to note for operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canada’s iGaming sector is also subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC). Although, iGaming Ontario has established a strict set of regulations, which go beyond the basic FINTRAC requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, there are a strict set of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and know your customer (KYC) requirements. Operators are required to maintain internal AML operating procedures that comply with Canadian federal regulatory requirements, which include a wide range of rules and regulations, such as reporting suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there are detailed KYC requirements in place, such as in-depth identity verification standards. This means players will have to provide official government documents, recent photos (or selfies), and liveness (such as a video) to verify their identity during the registration process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Becoming Compliant With Ontario’s iGaming Regulations&nbsp; 



<p>Considering the depth and complexity of iGaming requirements in Ontario, entering the region as an operator may prove to be difficult. Operators will have to meet strict PCMLTFA and FINTRAC standards, as well as go above and beyond those to meet iGaming Ontario-specific regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key barriers will also include meeting iGO’s AML and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC</a> program requirements, which could require operators to complete overhauls of data storage, tracking, and verification systems. This is something that has already been a hot topic around the world, with more and more regulators calling for stricter iGaming systems and regulations. A good example of this were <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/german-online-gambling-regulations/">the changes for operators in Germany</a> which was challenging to say the least. Having experienced partners in a situation like this will be key to success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One solution to overcoming this is working with an identity verification partner like IDnow. As an identity verification specialist, IDnow has the experience and tools to aid operators in entering new markets. This is done with the help of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">Autoident</a> – an AI-powered verification tool that quickly and securely verifies users identities, while being completely AML compliant.</p>







<p>Autoident is very well suited to the FINTRAC standard set by Ontario, already supporting verification processes that include Document verification, selfie and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">liveness detection</a>, while also being backed by an experienced team with years of success and experience, globally in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">iGaming</a> industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there are also other ways to become compliant with Ontario’s regulations, such as adjusting things like the onboarding process, looking at AML reporting requirements, and much more that is required by iGO. Depending on an operator’s current systems, this could be an expensive and time-consuming process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whichever way operators choose to tackle Ontario’s regulatory climate, it will be a complicated and tough battle to become compliant in a reasonable timeframe. </p>



<p>However, utilizing an identity verification partner to help smoothen the bumps in the road and provide a guiding hand will prove to be an incredible advantage. KYC and AML should not be a burden but an enabler for your success.&nbsp;</p>

				  Helen Garneau joins the Hyperledger Foundation as Vice Chair of the Marketing Committee and Trevor Butterworth joins the Steering Committee of the Covid Credentials Initiative.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>, an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies hosted at the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>, has welcomed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helengarneau/">Helen Garneau</a>, Chief Marketing Officer of <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> as Vice Chair of its Marketing Committee.</p>
<p>This is the second leadership role for Indicio in recent months at a Linux Foundation Project. In December, Vice President of Governance, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorwbutterworth/">Trevor Butterworth</a>, was elected to the Steering Committee for the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.org/">COVID Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI), a part of <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH), the leading organization for hosting and nurturing open-source technology for the benefit of public health initiatives.</p>
<p>Garneau has an extensive track record in implementing successful marketing strategies for a range of Hyperledger Foundation projects, including <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>,<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/aries"> Hyperledger Aries</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>. She also played a key role in project launches and the growth of Hyperledger communities.</p>
<p>As Vice Chair of the Marketing Committee, Garneau is committed to broadening Hyperledger’s membership base during her one-year term.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to be named vice-chair of the Hyperledger Foundation Marketing Committee alongside Chair, Duncan Johnston-Watt, CEO &amp; Co-founder at Blockchain Technology Partners (BTP),” said Garneau. “One of the things I enjoy most&nbsp; in the Hyperledger community has been seeing the technology, use cases, and contributions from other members and companies. The dollars that companies put into their Hyperledger Foundation membership are valuable and I’ve seen the return in business growth first hand. The Hyperledger marketing team does an incredible job and I look forward to helping articulate that value proposition in my role as Vice-Chair.” </p>
<p>Butterworth was already involved in Linux Foundation Public Health as Chair of the Steering Group for the Cardea Project, an open-source ecosystem built on Hyperledger Indy&nbsp; and Hyperledger Aries for digital health credentials developed by Indicio and SITA and donated to LFPH.</p>
<p>“At Indicio, we are at the front end of building and implementing digital health credentials with commercial partners—and our success in this area, in open-sourcing the results, and in creating a community of developers to extend functionality is a win for both the Hyperledger Foundation and Linux Foundation Public Health,” said Butterworth. “Joining the Covid Credentials Initiative will help us learn from its experts, build better products, and drive adoption of technology that is sustainable and solves fundamental problems in privacy and security.”</p>
<p>Indicio is both a member and active contributor to the Hyperledger Foundation and Linux Foundation Public Health and has taken a significant leadership role in the open sourcing of a number of technologies. Among others, Indicio has helped lead the development and contributions to several projects at Linux Foundation including:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-monitor">Hyperledger Indy Node Monitor</a> (August 2020): A set of tools for monitoring the status of Hyperledger Indy networks.

Malcolm and I were among several of that group who share a belief that decentralization and maintaining the ecosystem is critical to its foundational success.</p><blockquote>“As Malcolm and the policy side of Shyft had already been working together, both in his capacity at BitMEX, and through policy development across regulators, bringing on Malcolm to drive this next phase of institutional development &amp; growth was a 1+1 = 6 equation.</blockquote><blockquote>“We began working on Shyft Network &amp; its public infrastructure out of a belief that we can apply the open innovations built from within the ecosystem to bridge the gap between the traditional world’s regulatory &amp; compliance requirements, identity &amp; decentralized economies without eroding privacy, decentralization &amp; openness.</blockquote><blockquote>“As these two worlds collide and we see rapid acceleration in both regulatory requirements, as well as adoption, we also need the best and brightest people who continue to bring balance for the ecosystem to be driving critical infrastructure like Veriscope &amp; other public utilities for the new market participants who need identity-based compliance capabilities to operate across all verticals. Malcolm’s deep expertise across the space, from policy makers, to Open Standards, as well as his vast experience prior to entering crypto, makes him an excellent person to lead all compliance related aspects of the public utility smart contracts that the Shyft Core team developed for the Shyft network.”</blockquote> Leading role <p>In this role, Malcolm will be tasked with leading the Veriscope teams both inside of Shyft Core, and across all VASPs &amp; Travel rule solutions that are globally utilizing or contributing to the public network, while also managing the open governance task force responsible for proposing policy changes across the counterparty processes that are universal to Veriscope through the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Along with this, Malcolm will lead all regulatory compliance &amp; institutional strategy for upcoming extension systems of Veriscope that includes universal cross chain layers for Institutional Defi, NFT’s, DAO’s and&nbsp;more.</p><p>As Shyft Network is an open source project, and it’s infrastructure is being deployed to open source, Malcolm’s work will focus across regulators, institutions currently joining Veriscope, the Shyft DAO &amp; continued open standards development across the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>Malcolm will be tasked with designing and documenting the frameworks and critical policy requirements across Shyft Network’s products and maintain his already impressive status as an industry thought leader recognized by virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and financial institutions.</p><p>On behalf of the Core team, the Shyft Community, Veriscope’s open Network of VASPs&amp; institutions, and all developers building atop of Shyft Network, We are excited to welcome Malcolm to the Community</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner.

 Web3Auth raises $13M Series A to drive mass adoption on Web3 applications and wallets via simple, non-custodial authentication infrastructure  Led by Sequoia Capital India with participants such as Union Square Ventures and Multicoin Capital, the Series A funding round advances our mission to eliminate seed phrases and make blockchain authentication decentralized and accessible to&nbsp;all. <p>We are excited to announce that we have raised $13M led by Sequoia Capital India, Union Square Ventures, Multicoin and others, to drive mass adoption in Web3 through simple, secure, and non-custodial auth infrastructure for apps and wallets. The round follows demonstrable success, with our infrastructure securing over 1M monthly users and 8M keys, on wallets and applications such as Binance Extension Wallet, Ubisoft, Kukai, Skyweaver, and more. We are also proud to reveal Web3Auth, which kickstarts the decentralization of the Torus&nbsp;Network.</p><p>The Series A was raised with additional participation from FTX, Bitcoin.com, DARMA Capital, Chainstry, Hash, KOSMOS Capital, Kyros Ventures, LD Capital, Minted Labs, P2P Capital, Phoenix VC, Staking Facilities, YBB Capital, Moonwhale Ventures, and Decentralab.</p><p>For those who don’t know us, the Torus team (now specifically more known as <a href="https://web3auth.io">Web3Auth</a>) have been working on improving onboarding and non-custodial key management in the crypto space. A critical problem that quantifiably has contributed to the loss of nearly 20% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Fear of loss and unfamiliarity of keys/seed phrases presents a significant barrier to entry that deters non-technical users from exploring Web3 and participating in the ecosystem.</p> Introducing Web3Auth <p>Web3Auth is simple, non-custodial auth infrastructure for Web3 wallets and applications. For your crypto native users Web3Auth makes them feel right at home, allowing them to connect or use their key management of choice, be it Metamask, Phantom, Ledger and so on. For new users developers can use Web3Auth to build intuitive login flows, such as single sign-on with Google and Twitter, eliminating the need for users to directly interface with vulnerable public-private key&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>Under the hood, Web3Auth’s mainstream UX is powered by the Torus Network (which Torus now refers exclusively to), it enables users to use multiple factors to access their wallet, leveraging on existing things a user has to secure these factors. These include their social login, existing devices, backups/passwords and in the future even family. This immediately improves on the existing key management standard of seed phrases, which is essentially a single point of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>For those who have known Torus before Web3Auth, Web3Auth consolidates our existing products, and draws a clear distinction between the products we build and the underlying infrastructure, allowing us to take further steps towards further decentralizing this infrastructure. Moving forward, the Torus Network will refer to the underlying infrastructure that supports our products, and Web3Auth will refer to the one stop pluggable product that Web3 apps/wallets know &amp;&nbsp;love.</p><p>Developers can integrate Web3Auth into their application just with a couple lines of code and allow users to connect to any blockchain. And can start&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">here</a>.</p><p>Apart from the initial connection, Web3Auth also provides:</p>  Customizable UI / even fully whitelabel  Plugging in your own existing auth and user&nbsp;base  Fiat-to-crypto aggregator, so users can also choose the best fiat-to-crypto provider for your application and the user’s&nbsp;region.  Incremental security and better redundancy, which drastically reduces support tickets for mainstream users.  Broad platform support, including SDKs for iOS, Android, React Native and&nbsp;Unity.   What will happen to existing users/developers and the Torus&nbsp;Network? <p>Existing users and developers on our current products (i.e. CustomAuth, OpenLogin, Torus Wallet) do not have to do anything, and they can be rest assured that these products will continue to be developed and supported as they are used as components of Web3Auth. No action is required from developers or end-users.</p><p>We will continue working on the underlying infrastructure to improve efficiency and security, but the priority for us is to further decentralize the Torus Network. This means major improvements to the capability for new nodes to join and leave the Torus Network, as well as additional features that formalize the interactions between dApps and nodes. Stay tuned for more updates on this over the next few&nbsp;months!</p><p>As usual, we’re always hiring and if you’re interested in solving some of the hardest problems in this industry, we welcome you to apply. If you’re an application or wallet looking to use Web3Auth, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@web3auth.io">hello@web3auth.io</a>, and let’s&nbsp;discuss!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-raises-13m-series-a-to-drive-mass-adoption-on-web3-applications-and-wallets-via-simple-948b6008cdb5">Web3Auth raises $13M Series A to drive mass adoption on Web3 applications and wallets via simple…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Highlights <p>The <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-2022-roadmap-a0036cd72f1b">Ontology 2022 Roadmap</a> has been officially released. Our goal for 2022 is to make the Ontology high-speed, low-cost, public blockchain, the blockchain of choice for Web3 applications. We are working hard to develop a more diverse and prosperous Ontology ecosystem. Ontology’s efforts in creating interoperability between the different public chains, including Ethereum with the upcoming Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) launch, will provide the opportunity to incubate more high-quality Web3 applications in the new year, across a multitude of industries and services. Ontology will continue to vigorously develop ONT ID, ONTO, and other products, making Web3 available to everyone. Ontology is proud to be part of this rapidly changing landscape and is excited to share more updates in the future. Here’s to another year exploring the future together.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet. Developers are welcome to conduct various application tests. Related documents can be obtained at the <a href="https://docs.ont.io/">Ontology Developer Center</a>.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the ONT and ONG decimals and we are 75% done with&nbsp;testing.  We are 72% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.  We are 53% done with the truebit challenge design&nbsp;survey.  We are 22% done with the Rollup VM&nbsp;design.   Product Development   ONTO App v4.1.5 was released, bringing support for Avalanche and NFTs on OEC, as well as FIO address registration and&nbsp;binding.  ONTO is hosting its very own <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1479362169737302018">NFT ONTOvaganza</a>. This event rewards NFT holders from previous ONTO events with more NFTs. Each NFT comes with a different ONG airdrop quota and rights. Top winners can get up to 1,000 ONG from this event. The event is in progress, and the claiming of NFTs will end at 21:00 (Singapore time) on January 15th. Don’t forget to open ONTO and claim your&nbsp;NFT!  ONTO is hosting a campaign with <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1479800051132100608">Parking Infinity</a>. Participants who complete related tasks have the opportunity to earn rewards. The event is in progress, with more than 1,100 participants.  ONTO hosted an NFT Giveaway campaign with <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1478712890773450760">MetaYoka</a>. Participants who completed related tasks had the opportunity to earn NFT rewards. The event has successfully concluded, with more than 2,000 participants.  ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1477263336899108868">HyperJump</a>. Participants who completed all the tasks had the opportunity to earn rewards. The event has successfully concluded, with more than 1,000 participants.   On-Chain Activity   123 total dApps on MainNet as of January 10th,&nbsp;2022.  6,856,727 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 18,420 from last&nbsp;week.  16,928,849 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 75,643 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   5,539 new members joined our global community this week. Over the past four years, Ontology Harbingers have always been our most dedicated supporters, driving the growth of the global community. We welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join us</a> to experience and promote a more decentralized future together with Ontology.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1471563278023217152?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “EVMs”. The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022. The EVM aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform, and offer an inclusive experience to developers and users. The new VM will join a suite of existing VMs, which include the Native (Ontology) VM, NeoVM, and WasmVM. Community members believe that this is a crucial step in the realization of the Ontology Multi-VM. It adds to the opportunities provided by the WasmVM, which allows more traditional developers to deploy apps on the blockchain.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about ENS, including its application scenarios, how to participate in the ecology, and more. Community members discussed the differences between Ontology DID and ENS. For example, ENS currently focuses more on associated addresses, while DID focuses on a wider range of information and is more inclined to personal&nbsp;data.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Gizmodo — 《<a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-is-web-3-and-why-should-you-care-1848204799">What Is Web3 and Why Should You&nbsp;Care?</a>》</p><p>“In recent months, you may have come across a phrase growing in popularity: Web3. You might be wondering what it is, what it will mean for the future, and how exactly the third-generation internet differs from the first two. And now the dawn of Web3 is upon us. People define it in a few different ways, but at its core is the idea of decentralization, which we’ve seen with cryptocurrencies (key drivers of Web3). Key to this decentralization is blockchain technology, which creates publicly visible and verifiable ledgers of record that can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. The blockchain already underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as a number of fledging technologies, and it’s tightly interwoven into the future vision of everything that Web3 promises. The idea is that everything you do, from shopping to social media, is handled through the same secure processes, with both more privacy and more transparency baked&nbsp;in.”</p><p>Ontology has worked on bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through providing decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions. From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not changed. 2021 draws to a close and 2022 promises to bring us closer to Web3 than ever before. Four years of work has positioned Ontology as a leader in the space, through the development of products focused on DID and data, and by taking a Multi-VM approach.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>With millions of people boarding flights every day, customer data and experiences are the most important elements to the travel industry. As airports increasingly ramp up to meet the digital age, they are more prone to cyberattacks and data breaches. One such incident occurred when <a href="https://www.airport-technology.com/features/five-times-airports-were-involved-in-cyberattacks-and-data-breaches/">Heathrow airport</a> was fined £120,000 when they lost sensitive data stored on a memory stick, which included the Queen’s travel history and passport numbers.</p>



<p>To prevent such data leaks in the future and avoid heavy fines, airports are constantly evolving and adapting biometric security in airports.</p>



 Why Are Biometrics Used in Airports? 



<p>The technology associated with air travel has advanced considerably in recent years. Biometrics for airports have provided passengers with a faster, safer end-to-end experience. It may go unnoticed at first but biometric technology is used widely in airports. Be it filling your visa application from the comfort of your home or automated barrier control at the airports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biometrics for airports can provide a contactless experience using facial recognition for the ease of passengers and to meet growing concerns around health concerns with contact methods. Biometric technology can identify individuals, measuring dozens of physical attributes, such as fingerprint, voice recognition, and facial recognition, among others.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Biometrics for airports can be used for security checks, luggage, boarding, and check-in facilities. Implementing biometrics at airports helps automate the verification process, and sharing a digital identity can expedite the immigration process.</p>



 Benefits of Using Biometric for Airports 



<p>Biometric authentication and its use cases in the travel industry and airports provide several advantages including:</p>



 High Security 



<p>Biometrics provide increased levels of security to the airlines that the person is truly who they claim to be. The identification is done by tangible and real-world traits that relate to the passenger. Nearly any username, passwords, and PINs can be compromised, and a data breach can leak sensitive information to the hackers.&nbsp;</p>



 Improved User Experience 



<p>The internal implementation of biometric technology may be difficult, but it provides a smooth user experience to passengers at the airport. Placing a finger on a scanner and getting border access is much easier and fast than going through the long processes of physical verification.&nbsp;</p>



 Non-Transferable and Unique 



<p>Every individual has a unique set of biometrics which are impossible to duplicate with current technology. Also, biometrics are not transferable. The only way to access biometric data at airports is through the physical application.&nbsp;</p>



 4 Biometric Technologies Used at Airports 



<p>There are currently four biometric technologies being used at airports. These include:</p>



 Facial Recognition 



<p>Facial recognition identifies facial features such as distance between eyes, eye shape, nose shape, and more, through stored facial patterns and data to find a match. Facial recognition enhances security, is contactless, and is easy to integrate.&nbsp;</p>



 Fingerprint Recognition 



<p>Fingerprint recognition automatically identifies someone based on a comparison between a stored and live fingerprint. Fingerprint recognition is one of the most popular biometrics and is being implemented at airports all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



 Iris Recognition 



<p>Iris scanning or <a href="https://imageware.io/the-eyes-have-it-what-is-iris-recognition">iris recognition</a> is the process of using infrared light to take a high contrast image of your iris. Similar to fingerprints, iris patterns are unique to each individual and provide exceptional accuracy. Iris recognition is another contactless biometric method which is considered to be one of the most accurate.</p>



 Palm Recognition 



<p>Palm recognition evaluates the unique patterns and characteristics in the palms of an individual’s hands. The systems use a scanning device that processes data from a digital photo of an individual’s hand and compares it to the stored biometric template in the database. Many airports have started deploying palm recognition as a part of their authentication processes.&nbsp;</p>



 Biometric Solutions for Airports with Imageware 



<p>Imageware develops identity solutions that can provide comprehensive and easy-to-use applications to create inviolable photo identification and access credentials. With Imageware’s solutions, you can strengthen your biometric security for airports by:</p>

 Web3Auth has allowed Binance Smart Chain users to seamlessly create and manage their extension wallets with their Social&nbsp;Accounts  About Binance Chain Extension Wallet&nbsp;(BEW) <p>Binance Chain Extension Wallet is the official Binance cryptocurrency wallet for accessing Binance Smart Chain, Binance Chain, and Ethereum. The extension allows users to securely store crypto and connect to thousands of projects across different blockchains. It currently supports Chrome, Firefox, and&nbsp;Brave.</p> The Story Behind the Integration <p>Key management is a long-standing problem in crypto. Users have lost crypto worth over $150bn (Worth more than even GDPs of several nations) due to inefficient management of their private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem knew how important it was to make key management and onboarding easy for mainstream crypto adoption. Especially with the increase in the adoption of decentralized apps, mismanagement of private keys was rampant leading to significant financial loss.</p> The search for a perfect non-custodial key management solution <p>To fix this — the BSC community started considering multiple private key management solutions. Few solutions had made significant progress in streamlining the user onboarding experience but had long been plagued by the trilemma of sacrificing security or redundancy for convenience. Many of these systems also had points of centralization that reduced censorship resistance.</p><p>They were then introduced to Web3Auth.</p> Onboarding thousands of users through&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Binance chain Extension Wallet (BEW) introduced a new seamless and secure user onboarding process through Web3Auth in early 2021 and has since onboarded hundreds of thousands of users into the BEW&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Designed with a simple and straightforward user experience for mainstream users, the onboarding includes OAuth logins, key management that reduces account loss while retaining the non-custodial guarantees that the decentralized ecosystem requires.</p> How Web3Auth handles users’ private&nbsp;keys <p>Web3Auth is a model of threshold key management that solves the trilemma without sacrificing user experience while retaining end-user autonomy and security. The model implements the Shamir Secret Shares (SSS) scheme using the user’s device, private input, and wallet service provider.</p><p>The user’s private key is split into multiple factors, and these split factors are used to reconstruct the original encrypted secret key. Like 2FA systems, as long as the user has access to 2 out of 3 of their factors, they will be able to retrieve their private key and gain access to the&nbsp;wallet.</p> BEW — Web3Auth pave the way for crypto’s&nbsp;future <p>BEW’s partnership with Web3Auth ensures that no user in the future will ever lose access to their valuable Cryptos just because they forgot or misplaced their private keys. This revolutionary approach paves the way for the mainstream adoption of cryptos across the industry.

 Kukai: A go-to wallet for leading NFT projects on&nbsp;Tezos  About Kukai <p>Kukai is the longest-running web-based Tezos wallet. It allows you to manage your tokens, NFTs and digital assets in a single easy-to-use and secure platform. As a Tezos wallet, Kukai includes the ability to store, transfer and delegate your Tezos (XTZ) tokens, so you can easily receive XTZ rewards through staking. Kukai supports the fast-growing Tezos ecosystem with features like an NFT gallery, DeFi token support and more. Kukai has been pivotal to the success of Ubisoft, HicEtNunc, OneOf, and other notable NFT launches.</p> The Origin <p>The origin of Kukai goes back to 2018 when it was started as an open-source community project. The team spent the initial days figuring out the technical aspects and focused on security. Once the tech was sorted and the wallet started gaining traction — the team realized how the onboarding experience was integral to achieving their goals of acquiring millions of mainstream users.</p><p>That’s when Web3Auth came into the&nbsp;picture.</p> Deciding on&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Kukai discovered Web3Auth at the perfect time when they decided to redesign the wallet user experience to drive user adoption. The ease of onboarding provided by Web3Auth’s social logins and key management solution made a lot of sense. The primary reasons they chose to integrate Web3Auth SDK&nbsp;were:</p>  The Decentralised Non-custodial nature of the private key&nbsp;handling  The Social logins to onboard blockchain non-native users  The Web3Auth’s Lookup feature to send crypto/NFTs to socials&nbsp;directly  The single-click setup, the documentation, and the dev support throughout  <p>The Kukai team was evaluating other solutions as well but did not proceed with them because of their inflexibility, low maturity, and centralized method of managing&nbsp;keys.</p><p>“We have been so happy with Web3Auth, and whenever we do our regular reviews of other solutions we continue to be convinced we made the right choice for Kukai users” <br>— Klas Harrysson, Co-Founder, Kukai</p> Winning the NFT space with&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Kukai took less than two weeks to integrate Web3Auth SDK. The detailed documentation and the code examples made the integration process straightforward and easy to complete. With Web3Auth developer support readily available, our engineers worked closely with the Kukai team to build the final product within a short developmental time&nbsp;frame.</p><p>It’s been one year since Kukai launched with Web3Auth handling their authentication and key management, and the SDK has processed more than a million social logins thus&nbsp;far.</p><p>“We never faced any roadblocks during integration because the Web3Auth team was always available at every step” <br>— Klas Harrysson, Co-Founder, Kukai</p><p>Kukai has onboarded hundreds of thousands of non-native crypto users with ease and they devote the success to the Web3Auth SDK which has made their app’s onboarding look like any other web2 app’s. The Tezos community loves Kukai and Web3Auth is excited to support the Tezos ecosystem in their Kukai 2.0 and the upcoming mobile wallet where they expect to multiply their user-base threefold.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/how-kukai-reached-a-million-user-logins-with-web3auth-sdk-58bdc08ca83d">How Kukai Reached a Million User Logins with Web3Auth SDK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and welcome to the first episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity for this New Year 2022. And we have a very special guest who has been in very short clips in an episode we had in October, very recently in October. A very special episode, a storytelling episode called <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/openid-connect/" title="<em>How OpenID Connect took over the World</em>">How OpenID Connect took over the World</a>, and today’s guest was there. We are talking about our super special guest called Nat Sakimura, one of the creators of the OpenID Connect standard.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura is a well-known identity and privacy standardisation architect and a representative partner of NAT Consulting. Besides being an author and editor of such widely standards such as the OpenID Connect, FAPI, JWT, OAuth PKCE among others, he helps communities to organise themselves to realise the ideas around identity and privacy. As the chairman of the board of the OpenID Foundation, he streamlined the process, bolstered the IPR management, and greatly expanded the breadth of the Foundation spanning over 10 working groups whose members included large internet services, mobile operators, financial institutions, government, etc. He has been serving in various committees in the Japanese government, including a Study Group on the Platform Services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and a Study Group on the competition in Digital Market of the Fair-Trade Commission of Japan.</p>
<p>Hello, Nat.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura: Hi, Oscar. Thanks for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s a great pleasure talking with you, Nat. And well, Happy New Year. And let’s talk about digital identity.</p>
<p>Nat: Likewise, yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. And I think we know a lot of your involvement, of course, you are leading one of the most important standardisation organisations in the digital space. We’d like to hear a bit about yourself, something personal, of course, how life led you to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So you wanted to know, how was my journey to the world of identity?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. There are three reasons. They all converge to identity. In the middle 1990s, I was working on VPN as an alternative way to secure communications than having dedicated leased lines. And at that time, we were using dedicated leased lines in the financial institutions. And that actually amounts to the identification and the authentication of machines and people as well as integrity protection and encryption of the communication channel. So there you have identity.</p>
<p>Then also, the second reason was that I found in the hard way that access to our personal data is not granted. My daughter had a failed surgery, she was three years old then, and for re-operation I needed to access the medical record quickly but it was not granted. So it was not useful for us. That was a surprise for me. We didn’t have the right nor technology in place to access our own data in a meaningful timeframe. So I started on the combination, the identity and privacy then.</p>
<p>The third one was the research commissioned by the Japanese Postal Agency. It’s been subsequently privatised, but it was still a government agency at the time, on the future of mails. And as part of the research, I got acquainted with Drummond Reed, who dragged me into the standardisation part of the identity arena.</p>
<p>All of these combined paved the way for me to get into the digital identity standardisation work.</p>
<p>Oscar: I see, it’s very interesting you mentioned these three points. One very technical, solving the security problem so that those time- the VPNs in ‘90s, 1990s. Then you needed to access personal data of your daughter, right? And even though I’m sure it was stored somewhere, but you were not able to access it in a timely manner, as you said so.</p>
<p>Nat: Right.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And then I think the opportunity came, as you mentioned in the Japanese Postal Agency to start working on the standard. So, yeah, super interesting. And we have talked recently and you say you wanted to talk about FAPI, one of the… yeah, one of the main – well children of OpenID Foundation. We have <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/don-thibeau-openid-foundation/" title="interviewed also Don Thibeau">interviewed also Don Thibeau</a> a bit more than one year ago. He a little bit talked about that standard. He has been very enthusiastic about talking that standard and I’m sure you have much more to tell us. But please tell us what is the… what – where is the beginning of that? So what were the challenges that you were working on OpenID Foundation found, led that – led to the, yeah, to start working on the creation of FAPI?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So, right after we have finished OpenID Connect in 2014, I think I have started working on FAPI- preparation for FAPI in 2015. OAuth and OpenID Connect are designed to scale from the point of view of security. If you use only the very basic, you can achieve entry-level security quite simply. Since you’re not using options, it was not that hard to achieve interoperability.</p>
<p>However, when you wanted to achieve more security, you had many options to choose from. And the different combinations not only led to different security properties, but also a lack of interoperability. We needed to bolt the options down so that we have known security properties as well as interoperability.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, I think interoperability is a word that always come to any standard because there are so many different… yeah, so many possibilities can be done and so many different needs in different, yeah, different industries, different places in the world. Yeah. FAPI is Financial-grade API, correct? And I understand also that from the beginning, it has been, as the name says it’s for financial transactions. Please tell us a bit, what is FAPI in practice?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, the FAPI is a general purpose security profile of OAuth and OpenID Connect to protect APIs. It started off from financial use case, from which the letter F comes from. But later, it also made clear that it has general purpose. So we changed the name from Financial API to Financial-grade API. It can be used by for example, healthcare, transportation, and name any.</p>
<p>So there are two notable characteristics of FAPI. Number one is that all the communication is integrity protected, so that it’s tamper-evident. All messages are authenticated. And the second characteristic is that no bearer token is used.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So even if the token was stolen, it cannot be used. You know, the bearer token is like metro ticket or something like that. So if you drop it, and if somebody picks it up, it can be used, right? And instead, in the case of FAPI, we decided to use something called sender constrained tokens. Sender constrained token is much like international airline ticket, I mean the boarding pass. So when you use it, it’s got your name, and you need to show your passport, for example, or travel card so that the person at the entrance can match that you are the rightful user of that boarding pass. So that’s the sender constrained token. And in FAPI, we have stopped using bearer token completely and went all the way to the sender constrained tokens.</p>
<p>So another way to look at it is that it fulfils four authentication properties. In many cases, when we talk about these things, we kind of focus on the user authentication. But there are many other kinds of authentication, which is really important. The number one is strong server authentication. Number two, strong client authentication. Number three, strong message authentication. And these combined with strong user authentication, you will have a pretty complete security picture. So that’s the security part.</p>
<p>And also, we wanted to address the interoperability. So to improve our interoperability, we also needed to provide a testing framework. That is now provided by the OpenID Foundation as FAPI Certification. There are now over 150 implementations that are certified and number is increasing quite rapidly now.</p>
<p>Oscar: And there is some sort of self-certification, correct?</p>
<p>Nat: Yes, it’s a self-certification. So, the test suite is also available as open source. So you can, for example, use it for the continuous development – some banks are actually using it like that. But when you are done with the development, and you have passed all the tests, you can submit the result to OpenID Foundation, and then it will be published from the OpenID Foundation site, and they can be checked by your peers as well so that you know, you have a conformant implementation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Yeah. One thing I was not aware now that I said just before asking you is FAPI’s Financial-grade API. And when I read and when I heard for the first time that term, to me sound like yeah, it’s financial, but now you clarified that initially it was Financial API but then now it’s financial-grade, so as secure as the financial transaction, I guess that’s the idea, right? So now it’s more general purpose in a very secure profile from OpenID Connect and OAuth 2, so that’s interesting.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, that’s correct. Yeah. I mean, so I think it was by 2017 or ‘18, we had a request from both the healthcare sector as well as the international travel sector, you know airlines, that they wanted to use it. But their request was to change the name because having labelled as financial, it’s going to be harder for them to actually make industry-wide adoption of it. So we kind of searched for the name. By then the acronym FAPI was quite popular so we didn’t want to change the acronym and we wanted to generalise the F part. And we couldn’t come up with anything better than financial-grade. But the intent is that it is for any industry, and it’s secure. That’s what we wanted to communicate.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for that clarification. I think it’s very important also, for the ones who are not so familiar with the term yet, so yeah. And also, the fact you mentioned in the description that in FAPI, as a profile of OpenID Connect, you don’t – you get rid of the bearer token so that already tells a lot about how much secure it is per se, the bearer token is just – it’s not a possibility in this profile.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So we have removed the bearer token, removed completely to the sender constrained token, as well as other communications even through the browser, is integrity protected. That’s not the case in the usual OAuth or OpenID Connect. So…</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that is correct.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds very interesting. I have to play myself in the browser, what can I see, what I cannot see, so it’s super interesting.</p>
<p>Nat: So unless the sender and the receiver is using the encryption model, you can still see it, but you cannot tamper it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly.</p>
<p>Nat: &nbsp;It’s signed. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Exactly. The integrity, you cannot, yeah. You cannot modify it. OK, excellent. Please tell us, yeah, you mentioned that initially it was for financial, then at least healthcare and aviation or transport were interested, what are the – nowadays, let’s say, what are the main use cases? Those are still the main use cases or it’s even broader?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, as I’ve said, it’s general-purpose, so it can be used for any use cases that require high level security. Having said that, since we have started off from the financial world, they are leading in the implementation. They had like two years of head start. So the most popular implementation scenario currently is banking. So like accessing banking data, or making payments, and things like that.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. And I know, I read from some examples from FAPI, the documentation is available. They mentioned some has been already – FAPI has been made part of some, I don’t know standards or regulations in few different countries, including UK, open banking is the most known. Could you tell us about those? How has FAPI being implemented in different countries?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, so as you mentioned, the first mainstream usage was the UK Open Banking. Nine biggest banks were mandated by Competitive Market Authority, CMA, to open up the API and FAPI was chosen as the protocol to secure them. And I understand the first reason for that is to make banking data portable. But subsequently, PSD2 kicked in, and now it was expanded into the payment.</p>
<p>And then after that, Australian Consumer Data Standard adopted FAPI. So as the name suggests, it’s much wider than just banking. It’s for any consumer data costs. Again, they have started from banking, and if I remember correctly, they are now expanding into electricity and things like that.</p>
<p>And then Brazil followed the step. I actually had the opportunity to talk with the Vice Governor, I think of the Brazilian Central Bank in London, just before the COVID outbreak. And we agreed that adopting a standardised approach for the testing or certification coming together is going to be really, really vital for widespread adoption and quick adoption. So I think that was taken by Brazilian Central Bank and they are now mandating that to the banks and TPPs, they’re like parties in FinTechs.</p>
<p>And then more recently FDX in the United States announced its adoption, so did the Russian FinTech Association, they have been public. While FDX has made a written statement in the blog post on their website, in the case of the Russian FinTech Association, it’s still verbal, but they’ve been speaking about that in the conferences. So I think it’s, you know, public knowledge now.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a little bit of tweaks that are required for the Russian use cases. In the case of current FAPI, for the purpose of bolting down the options, we have specified a few encryption algorithms and signature algorithms to be used. But in the case of Russia, they need to use their own cost standard for those algorithms. So we need to expand it, modify it and expand it a bit. But that can be done as extension. We are talking about that right now.</p>
<p>And then most recently, we have started joint workshop with the Berlin Group, which is very prominent in continental Europe to seek a way to converge. So, it’s getting good traction now.</p>
<p>Oscar: Berlin Group, I’m not so familiar. It’s also into financial or what it covers, Berlin Group?</p>
<p>Nat: So Berlin Group is mainly… how can I put it? It’s an association of mainly banks. And then there are advisory groups made up which includes FinTechs and other industries as well. But although the name says Berlin, it’s not only Germany. It’s from many other countries as well. So it’s quite widespread in the continent of Europe. And also, I heard some of the Berlin Group banks are now implementing FAPI, or they have already implemented FAPI as well. So that’s an interesting development as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: And it’s also possible that some – in other countries, in different institutions they can implement independently, right, without having a regulation or a main association that – say it force them to use them.</p>
<p>Nat: Sure. Sure. It’s a standard and standards, unless required by regulations like in some other cases, it’s totally optional. It’s totally voluntary. But at the same time, you know, anybody can actually use it. So you don’t have to wait for regulators to come in, and mandating you to use it.</p>
<p>Oscar: So it’s very likely that we will hear in the next, well, in the new year and in the coming months, coming years more associations like this, or banking or even in other industries, more regulations in different other geographies that are embracing FAPI.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, so one of the reasons for FDX I understand to adopt FAPI is to move ahead. Well, I don’t know if that’s correct in other countries, but in many countries, if industries or industrial body actually self-regulate themselves, the government regulations do not kick in and you’ll get more freedom. So I think it’s actually better for the industry to adopt something like this without being mandated by the government.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/global-assured-identity-network-gain-elizabeth-garber/" title="GAIN">GAIN</a>, the project you are heavily involved also, a project that was released a few months ago that also requires GAIN, or – I’m sorry, FAPI. Is FAPI part of GAIN, or could you tell us?</p>
<p>Nat: So GAIN itself is technology neutral, so…</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Nat: It’s not mandating any particular technology. It’s open, but FAPI can also be used. And certainly, that is envisaged by some of the participants in GAIN as the first step. So certainly, you can use FAPI and there are people who are using FAPI in the GAIN POC that they’re self-organising right now.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And could you tell us – leaving a bit outside of the main topic of FAPI, but could you tell us a bit what was also coming from in GAIN, what is happening lately and what is coming in the next months?</p>
<p>Nat: So, there are two distinct paths, at least two, or maybe depending on how you count, it can be three. One is a technical working group, which is hosted by OpenID Foundation and the others are the legal and the business working groups, which are hosted by IIF and Open Identity Exchange. IIF stands for International Institute of Finance, right?</p>
<p>And as to the technical part, we are currently working on the legal agreement, a legal participation agreement so that we can create a safe space for all the participants whose taking part in GAIN POC. We’re in the final phase of drafting such a legal agreement, so that we can participate in POC feeling safe.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So yes, more… the POCs are coming for GAIN. Excellent. And tell us, core FAPI is the project that has ended, I know you are you’re working on that. So tell us what is coming next for the FAPI Working Group?</p>
<p>Nat: So FAPI Working Group is very far from being done, right? And we have ever more work to do. In the beginning, we didn’t create a profile for dynamic client registration, or consent or intent grant, and every jurisdiction says it slightly differently, but grant management will be core. We had enough work to work then as well. So we kind of postpone the work.</p>
<p>However, after UK, EU, Australia and Brazil went online, it became quite clear, painfully clear, that there are compatibility and security headaches because of no standardised way of doing it. So we decided to start work to address them. So the new technical specification called Grant Management for OAuth is being drafted. And it’s gone through the first implementers draft for OAuth successfully so that it can be implemented by implementers without fear of being sued or something like that. And people are just ironing out the kinks about the draft. We’ll probably need multiple rounds of these things to get to the finalisation but it’s a good start, right.</p>
<p>And then now we’re just starting, just in this, like, a month or so, we’ve been starting dynamic client registration part. It’s been done slightly differently in the UK, Australia and Brazil, as well. And, you know, we are gaining a lot of knowledge from that as well. So we are trying to codify the best practices about those. And hopefully, that’s going to be a very good guidance for other jurisdictions to follow.</p>
<p>Oscar: So that relates to the enrolment of customers or identity for customers.</p>
<p>Nat: Well, actually, no, that’s KYC, right. The dynamic client registration is so the end users uses software to interact with the, for example, banks, in the case of open banking, right? And this software actually needs to be registered to those banks. And we have to exchange the keys and things like that. And that can, of course, be done manually but that doesn’t scale. So we needed to have some kind of programmatical way of doing it. That’s called dynamic client registration. And again, we have a lot of options there. And we need to fold it down for the interoperability purpose and to have predictable security. So that’s what we are doing.</p>
<p>When it comes to the KYC part, KYC is a big field. And it’s a headache for all the financial institutions. It hasn’t been too effective to date, but we’re trying and one of the ways to help the pain there is to create a protocol which would make it easier and more secure to exchange those KYC data among the participants, like GAIN. And that’s not being worked on by FAPI Working Group, but in the adjacent working group called eKYC and IDA Working Group.</p>
<p>Actually, if you join the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> call without dropping off and calling another number or accessing new URL, you will be seamlessly taken to eKYC and IDA Working Group. It’s just happening at the same time, I mean at the same location, just they are connected to each other. And that working group is working on the data and metadata side. That is how to express verified attributes and how they were verified. And these attributes, in the first phase we are sorting out the natural persons, but in the coming days we will also be doing legal entities as well, just passing that this person has been verified as, for example, Nat Sakimura isn’t good enough, you really can’t trust it, right? You need more information and, for example, how it was verified, why it was verified, which evidence you have used, under which legal framework, and so on, so forth, and when.</p>
<p>So, these we call metadata needed to be sent with the data itself. And the specification called OIDC for identity assurance, or OpenID Connect for identity assurance, deals with it. And using that standard, you can get those data and metadata together in a signed format. So the combination of the standard, together with FAPI will be very, very powerful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see it’s needed definitely. It’s powerful as you said. So yeah, fantastic job that the FAPI Working Group and this other adjacent group is doing together. Nat, just one final question, for all business leaders who are listening to this conversation we had, what is the one actionable idea that you would like them to write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So while it’s been talked a lot about – the data economy, that it will be over 5% of GDP, it’s yet to be seen. Why? The data economy needs a secure and interoperable data network. And we are finally getting there with FAPI and eKYC standards. So, you guys need to get ready for the ride. It’s the time. You need to start acting, start preparing for that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And that will affect all industries.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, it’s not only financial institutions. Yeah, it’s for everybody.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Thanks a lot Nat for this very interesting conversation. We had knowing a lot more about FAPI and all the great work you do. And please let us know for people who like to continue the conversation with you or know more about the work you are doing, what are the best ways to find you on the net, get in touch?</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So, I’m in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natsakimura/">LinkedIn</a>. If you search Nat Sakimura, you can get there. I’m on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NatSakimura">YouTube</a> as well, so you can get to me there as well, so is <a href="https://twitter.com/_nat_en">Twitter</a>. And of course, if you’re technical, I highly recommend you to join <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> so we can share the technical ideas in a safe IPR environment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot Nat for this interview and all the best and Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Nat: Thanks, much obliged and likewise.</p>

<p>How people pay bills, shop online, open accounts and experience their finances is evolving quickly. Fintech innovations are altering the way consumers think about and relate to money. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated the digital transition. The shifting reality of how finances are managed is underway. Bank branches and paper checks are an afterthought to a growing number of consumers. Eight in 10 Americans are linking their bank accounts digitally, using these connections to automate everyday tasks like paying credit card and utility bills, according to Mastercard’s new study, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">The Rise of Open Banking</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sea change in consumer expectations is already in motion. With every leap in speed, security, and ease of use, open banking apps and services usher in the next generation of finance. The advent of the internet has trained the human mind to process far more information than in the past, and to do it quickly. When it comes to their personal finances, people want the real-time data whenever they want it. Save them time and money, and enhance their financial health, or they won’t adopt your platform.</p>
 1. Saving More Time, Creating Less Work 
<p>Just a handful of years ago, a group of friends out to dinner would have to all reach into their wallets and purses, chip in cash, write a check or stack a pile of credit cards on top of the bill, and wait for the server to swipe them all. With the massive adoption and growth of P2P payment apps, these antiquated processes are quickly becoming a thing of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In real time, payments can be split between friends with a few taps on the mobile screen. Digital wallets allow a busy shopper to tap their phone against a payment terminal and breeze through checkout at retail stores. Encrypted credit card info auto-populates, saving time and reducing user error when shopping online. The countless hours these new processes save is the biggest driver for adoption. 59% of study respondents cited this as their number one motivator.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Saving Money 
<p>65% of Americans <a href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/budgeting/spending-knowledge-survey/">don’t know</a> how much money they spent last month. Saving doesn’t come naturally to many people, and our <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/08/why-are-we-so-emotional-about-money">emotionally-charged relationship</a> with money certainly doesn’t help. So much emphasis is placed on new and better ways to spend that saving becomes just a lurking afterthought. Open banking innovators are addressing this huge segment of consumers with a rich slate of apps and services. AI and machine-learning engines do the heavy lifting of savings calculation, goal-setting and projection, raising the level of users’ financial literacy. 42% of Americans surveyed wanted help saving their money, and trust technology to give them the advantage they need.</p>
<p>Open banking technology powers some of the most effective fintech apps for saving money, using artificial intelligence and machine learning to take a deep dive into spending habits and cash flow. Some even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/how-gamification-can-help-you-meet-financial-goals/">gamify finances</a>, injecting the process with fun and some healthy self-competition.&nbsp;</p>
  
 3. Improving Financial Health 
<p>Open banking and AI make a powerful duo. Open banking connections to third-party financial service providers are flipping the data experience to favor the consumer. Anyone can download a financial management app, grant permission to access their bank accounts, and be guided easily through opening accounts, investment suggestions, and loan applications. This happens in moments, not hours or days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fintech AI systems process massive amounts of data in milliseconds. App and service developers can leverage this power to analyze a consumer’s subscription payments, utility bills, direct deposits and loan obligations near-instantaneously. Machine learning and AI engines can use this rich, real-time data to suggest smart financial planning and investing options. It’s a growing expectation that has to be accounted for in app development. Exposure to the open banking ecosystem is raising the level of consumer financial literacy, and it’s happening quickly. As a result, financial decision-making can improve dramatically. Consumers are seeing the positive results of adoption in their bank balances: 35% of respondents to the survey say improved financial health is why they use fintech.&nbsp;</p>
 4. Automate It! 
<p>No one leaps out of bed in the morning in wild anticipation of paying the electricity bill. Mundane, time-consuming financial tasks don’t actually have to absorb anyone’s time. Open banking allows easy setup and maintenance of connections to financial institutions, allowing consumers to set a variety of monthly payments and subscriptions to auto-pay. With the average consumer spending <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/average-consumer-spending-273-per-month-on-subscription-services-report/">$273 per month</a> on a mixed bag of small payments, automation saves a considerable amount of time, and it ensures payments aren’t missed. U.S. households average <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/18/deloitte-consumers-load-up-on-subscriptions-but-are-frustrated-with-fragmentation/">nine separate payments</a> per month just for entertainment subscriptions. Add gym memberships, retail subscriptions and utilities to an ever-growing list of small, recurring transactions, and the benefit of utilizing technology to manage these payments becomes obvious. 26% of North Americans surveyed are attracted to technology to help them automate these little chores, freeing up their time for more important concerns.&nbsp;</p>
 5. Getting a Better Holistic View of Finances 
<p>Gone are the days when consumers used file drawers stuffed with manila folders, neatly tabbed, in an attempt to keep checking the pulse of their financial health. Open banking data has spawned a wealth of apps and services that give consumers and small businesses an up-to-the-moment picture of their finances. Open banking connections across accounts and across financial institutions power the apps that consumers are using to take their financial temperature. The growing expectation is that individuals should be able to see what their money is doing and where it’s going, 24 hours a day. 18% of North American users said that tracking their money was a major driver for fintech adoption.&nbsp;</p>

And a rapidly changing economy has the Federal Reserve playing catch-up, Axios’ Neil Irwin&nbsp;writes.</blockquote>  Less than a month ago, the Fed made an abrupt pivot toward a more hawkish monetary policy stance. By the end of last week, the data was pointing toward an even faster withdrawal of stimulus.  <blockquote>Why it matters: Cheap money has become baked into the economy, so the Fed’s moves to take it away will bring risks of abrupt swings in markets that could spill back over into the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>By the numbers: Friday’s jobs data are Exhibit A. While initial headlines focused on soft growth in payroll numbers, the report points toward a labor market that has become exceptionally tight, contributing to already high inflation.</blockquote>  The unemployment rate is down to 3.9%. In the last economic cycle that level was not reached until May 2018 — at which point the Fed had already raised interest rates six times (now:&nbsp;zero).  Wages are not only rising, but rising at an accelerating pace. Average hourly earnings rose 4.7% over the entire course of 2021, but at a 6.2% annual rate in the final three months of the&nbsp;year.  <blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The bottom line: The labor market has gotten tighter, faster than most people, including at the Fed, thought possible just a few months ago. Now, policy is on track to follow&nbsp;suit.</blockquote><p>Goldman Sachs now predicts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/goldman-predicts-the-fed-while-hike-rat%20es-four-times-this-year-more-than-previously-expected.html">the Fed will hike rates four times next&nbsp;year</a>.</p><p>Once the Fed starts hiking rates, they’ll also start <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/fed-minutes-december-2021.html">shedding their balance sheet</a>, essentially sucking easy money out of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>When that money gets sucked out, it gets sucked out of riskier assets like certain equities and&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>We’re now entering that part of the&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/goldman-predicts-the-fed-while-hike-rates-four-times-this-year-more-than-previously-expected.html">Goldman predicts the Fed will hike rates four times this year, more than previously expected</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-10/goldman-now-expects-four-fed-hikes-sees-faster-runoff-in-2022">Goldman Now Expects Four Fed Hikes, Sees Faster Runoff in&nbsp;2022</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/fed-minutes-december-2021.html">Federal Reserve puts wheels in motion for balance sheet reduction</a>  <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-yields-build-on-post-fed-minutes-rise-11641472017">2-year Treasury yield hits an almost 2-year high as Fed’s Bullard says first rate hike could come as soon as&nbsp;March</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/business/economy/federal-reserve-minutes-interest-rates.html">Fed officials discussed raising rates sooner and faster in&nbsp;2022.</a>   2.

According to the order published by the CFTC, Polymarket offered at least 900 such markets over the last 18&nbsp;months.</blockquote><blockquote>These markets are swaps under federal&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Polymarket cooperated with the investigation, according the CFTC’s press release, leading to a reduced fine. The company will stop offering markets by Jan. 14 and commit to making all funds available to users by Jan. 24, according to the order. Polymarket will also cease and desist any further violations of the CEA, though it doesn’t appear the company itself will be shut&nbsp;down.</blockquote><blockquote>Elsewhere, Berlin-based Neuhaus is<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/10/why-were-shutting-our-successful-fundraising-platform/"> preemptively shutting down a “viable security token business” due to lack of regulatory clarity</a> (via /gregkidd):</blockquote><blockquote>Our concept-proving case — Greyp Bikes — made the full cycle, from issuing tokenized shares for retail investors, through corporate governance on blockchain, to the exit to Porsche and proceeds distribution via ERC20 tokens. Effectively, there were never any compliance issues, technical problems or security breaches. An European tech company fundraised through the issuance of securities using a decentralized technology. And more than 1,000 investors from dozens of countries participated. How&nbsp;cool.</blockquote><blockquote>Yet, we are closing the Neufund business.</blockquote><blockquote>Why? Because today, more than two years after Greyp fundraised, we still are unsure whether regulation allows us to repeat the Greyp fundraising model with other similar companies. Despite engaging with regulators for years, we didn’t manage to get out of the limbo of legal uncertainty.</blockquote><blockquote>And, I dare say, no DeFi (decentralized finance) company, aiming for regular investors on a bigger scale, has ever made it so&nbsp;far.</blockquote><p>Not the most encouraging updates.

<p><a href="http://dock.io/">Dock</a> is a bespoke blockchain designed and built to be used for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. One of the many important use cases where Dock’s technology can be used is alongside NFTs to reduce fraud and preserve the privacy of NFT owners. To help illustrate how this could work, we are sharing a specific use case with world-renowned vintage watch dealer, <a href="https://www.fogcityvintage.com/">Fog City Vintage</a>.</p><p>Before we dive into the use case, it’s important to understand the differences between NFTs and Verifiable Credentials, and how they can work together.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials contain cryptographically signed pieces of information that can be instantly verified and authenticated based on the identity and trustworthiness of the issuer of the Verifiable Credential. Information contained in the Verifiable Credential is specific to the holder of the credential, which can be an individual, entity, or even an object, and Verifiable Credentials aren’t considered transferable or able to change ownership. In addition, Verifiable Credentials are stored off-chain, typically in a holder’s wallet, and the only data on-chain is the DID and a hash pointing to the credential ensuring data privacy. Some common use cases for Verifiable Credentials include credentials used to prove identity, skills, and achievements.</p><p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are blockchain-based tokens that contain digitally unique data and identifiers. They are designed to be transferable and can contain digital artwork, collectibles, or representation of real-world assets. Most NFTs today exist on the Ethereum blockchain and so their ownership is tied to a public Ethereum address. Dock has integrated with Ethereum to enable NFTs to be created directly on the Dock blockchain.</p> How can NFTs &amp; Verifiable Credentials work together? <p></p><p>Although they are fundamentally different, there are some very interesting use cases for Verifiable Credentials to be used alongside NFTs. Verifiable Credentials can provide a privacy preserving yet cryptographically provable identity linked to an NFT, and therefore provide tamper-proof information about the identity of an NFT owner, creator, or buyer.</p><p>Fraud is rampant both within and outside of the blockchain space, and NFTs are no exception with scammers setting up fake accounts and selling fake NFTs. A Verifiable Credential can be used to verify the identity of all parties involved in creating, buying, and selling NFTs, to ensure the reputation and authenticity of everyone involved without divulging private information. For example, an NFT creator could share a Verifiable Credential that demonstrates a history of creating legitimate NFTs, or a seller can have a Verifiable Credential that shows a reputation score based on their previous NFT sales. Verifiable credentials issued via Dock use Zero-Knowledge Proofs to ensure data privacy, so the parties involved in the NFT transaction can prove their legitimacy without actually revealing their real-world identities or private information.</p><p>Another way that Verifiable Credentials can be used alongside NFTs is to prove qualifications in order to access an NFT or an NFT marketplace. For example, an artist may want their NFTs to only be accessible by their fans or specific members of a community who meet certain criteria. In this instance, Verifiable Credentials could be issued to community members demonstrating they meet the criteria and can then present the Verifiable Credential to enable them to receive the NFT. There could also be an NFT marketplace that is only appropriate for certain ages or populations; a Verifiable Credential could be used to prove that someone meets this criteria without compromising their identity in order to be able to transact in the NFT marketplace.</p> Dock and Fog City Vintage Watches <p>Fog City Vintage is a world-renowned vintage watch dealer who is using NFTs to address specific problems that exist in the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/luxury-watch-shortage-drives-growth-of-20-billion-secondhand-market.html">$20 billion vintage watch industry</a>. Vintage watches are inherently unique, highly tradeable, and very expensive, but the market for these watches is highly susceptible to fraud and there are no quality standards. Most trades are based on loose connections and it’s not uncommon for sellers to be defrauded out of &nbsp;tens of thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands, of dollars. Tim Bender, CEO of Fog City Vintage, estimates that well over $1 billion is lost annually by buyers of fraudulent vintage watches.</p><p>Fog City Vintage is planning to use NFTs to represent the authenticity of the watch in order to prevent fraud and enhance the tradability of the watches. Fog City will be issuing NFTs that represent the vintage watches and provide an expert evaluation of the condition of the watches based on a new standard they are developing. By issuing NFTs, which can be done on the Dock blockchain, Fog City can provide watch buyers with the assurance that they are purchasing legitimate watches from reputable buyers.</p><p>Dock’s technology can be used to enhance Fog City’s watch marketplace in several ways. Verifiable Credentials can be issued to marketplace buyers and sellers that reflect their purchase history to eliminate fraudsters and ensure only legitimate parties are involved in the transactions. In addition, Fog City, as well as other vintage watch dealers, can have a Verifiable Credential that proves their own identity as reputable experts who are qualified to evaluate the condition of the watches. The watch dealers would issue certificates of authenticity for the watches based on their evaluations to ensure only genuine watches are being traded and therefore provide further trust and transparency in the marketplace.</p><p>Since Dock provides technology to issue anonymous credentials, all of the Verifiable Credentials shared in the transactions would protect the real identity of the marketplace participants without compromising the integrity of the marketplace. Verifiable Credentials and NFTs are stored in the holder's own digital wallets rather than in a centralized database, which removes the risk of holding customer data while giving customers control of their own identity and assets. Combining Verifiable Credentials with NFTs is a powerful and secure way to add trust and authenticity to marketplaces while ensuring the privacy of everyone participating.</p>

Description: Welcome to lucky episode number 13! Your new host Aubrey Turner, Executive Advisor at Ping, is thrilled to welcome Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder of the award-winning data platform Meeco. Katryna discusses Meeco’s mission to enable everyone on the planet access to equity and value in exchange for the data and information they share. She talks about why she saw a need for Meeco’s services, what we need to know as we approach a more “physigital”world, and how her vision all started with a Tom Cruise film. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [1:34] Katryna talks about her journey of founding Meeco, and how she was inspired by Tom Cruise’s movie Minority Report. In early 2012 she sat down and wrote a Manifesto, and asked the question: what would happen if everyday people had the power to make really good decisions on data, the way that social networks, government, and enterprise do? How can we create meaningful value and make better decisions with our data? [8:12] Katryna shares some of her concerns around modern privacy and where she sees things evolving, both good and bad. [9:35] Technology is neutral. It’s what we do with it that gives it bias and can make it either creepy or cool. [11:33] What does Katryna mean when she says it starts with trust by design? [17:22] The next wave may be just starting to bring people and things into the direct value chain, through wearables or IoT devices for example. [18:31] How can we create better digital onboarding for employees, knowing that even post-COVID-19 our world will not go back to how it was in December 2020? One thing that Katryna is sure of is that we must lean into innovation rather than doing nothing and waiting to see. [36:13] We must make sure we are paying attention to the misalignment between law and technology, especially when it comes to ethics and the safety of children growing up in a digital-forward world. &nbsp; Quotes:    “I think the challenge for any kind of technology and regulation is a lag  factor, not a lead factor.”—Katryna         “The line between creepy and cool is one of the things we are always trying to address from a technology point of view.”—Katryna   “There isn’t really the option to not find better ways of digitally engaging.”—Katryna    Mentioned in This Episode: PingIdentity AubreyTurner KatrynaDow Meeco “HowCOVID-19 has pushed companies over the technology tipping point—and transformed business forever”     &nbsp;       &nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;

<p>Today, January 11, is the International Day of Gratitude. What better time then, to tell partners that you cherish their work and thank them for the inspiration they have given you? We at Jolocom reflect on amazing projects that became possible by joining forces with partners such as T-Labs, Bundesdruckerei, Stacks, and TIB – the Technical Information Library Hanover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been a privilege to work with you and we hope to continue our work together.&nbsp;</p>



 About Us&nbsp; 



<p>Jolocom is a leading steward of self-sovereign identity (SSI) in Europe with a long-term commitment to open source and open standards. We bring a full SSI tech stack, including library, software development kit (SDK), SSI protocol and the Jolocom SmartWallet application, as well as our technical expertise, to the community. Our aim is to accelerate the deployment of DIDs and verifiable credentials, ensuring interoperability between available solutions and increasing the self-sovereignty of users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve had the chance to engage with multiple partners in the past year, allowing us to broaden and deepen our SSI knowledge and, what’s more, partnering up in projects that mark a significant turn in the SSI world and increase engagement from both users and developers.&nbsp;</p>



 &nbsp;<br>Thank You to..&nbsp; 



<p>T-Labs/T-Systems (Deutsche Telekom)&nbsp;</p>



<p>T-Labs is the Research &amp; Development Department of Deutsche Telekom, focusing on bringing new technology trends to the market and delivering tangible results into Deutsche Telekom’s innovation portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in November 2017, Jolocom has partnered with T-Labs to launch the development, bringing together a group of blockchain startups to build the prototype operating stack: the idea being that enterprises can build a decentralized back-end in a matter of minutes. Jolocom is developing a modular solution that enables individuals, organizations and companies to get a self-sovereign digital identity. In the T-Labs prototype, Jolocom provides the tool to create and securely verify claims about identity. This allows for the modeling of a trustworthy and complex relationships between entities (e.g. ownership structures of IoT devices with organizations/individuals). Modeling these relationships with a self-sovereign solution enables a frictionless bridge between different ecosystems and network environments. What we have begun with T-Labs in 2018, we are happy to continue from early 2021 into the middle of 2022 with T-Systems and others as part of our current project portfolios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Bundesdruckerei&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundesdruckerei (BDR)&nbsp; is home to the digital experts supplying Germany’s ID cards and passports. They are working with different ID management solutions and technologies at the federal government security company. One of these approaches made use of Jolocom’s identity library and wallet. In 2019, the BDR demonstrated the potential of decentralized self-sovereign identity solutions in NAME OF PILOT, where identity information remains under the complete control of the citizen via the Jolocom SmartWallet downloaded onto their mobile device.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More precisely, researchers at BDR merged the Jolocom software for decentralized identity and access management with the existing government IT infrastructure for verification and identification. The goal: creating one of the earliest proof-of-concepts (POCs) for a decentralized digital ID in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This particular POC was an early example of an issuing and verification authority merging its existing technology with self-sovereign identity software. Jolocom’s software is fully open source. The part we played was adjusting our app interface to support BDR’s work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With more governments exploring the advantages of blockchain and, more specifically, self-sovereign identity solutions for common identity and access management challenges, we look forward to offering our open source library more widely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, we have engaged with the BDR in another main project of which you might have heard: ONCE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft: ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’ projects ONCE, ID-Ideal and SDIKA&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project is part of the competitive innovation program “Showcase Secure Digital Identities” (SDI) funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), where a dozen consortia were invited to present their concepts in an innovation competition and&nbsp;four projects that qualified for a fully-funded three year implementation phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom is a partner in three of these four SDI implementation projects, to which we will lend our expertise in self-sovereign identity, years of experience in developing digital identity wallets and the open-source Jolocom stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ONCE is the first of these projects to launch, followed by ID-Ideal and SDIKA. A few words about each:&nbsp;</p>



<p>ONCE aims to harmonize eID with SSI in user-controlled wallets. ID-Ideal has the goal of harmonizing trust providers and consumers from multiple networks and legal setups under one coherent trust framework. Finally, SDIKA pursues the realization of cross-use case identities in open ecosystems with widespread adoption. We thank our new and old partners for joining us on this path.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these projects are funded and supported by the BMWi, and we are grateful for using this huge opportunity to bring SSI to the individual citizen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technical Information Library Hanover&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Technical Information Library in Hanover is the German specialist library for technology as well as architecture, chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics. TIB is the world’s largest specialist library for technology and natural sciences. What’s more, TIB and Jolocom have both been early adopters and pioneers of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and the Web 3.0 approach in Germany. Multiple encounters within the DLT community have led to a growing desire to join forces so we can further develop interoperability, open standards and open access. Together, we created the Conference Digital Identifier Integration (conDIDi) project. The idea was to implement the SSI approach in the academic sector, while also increasing global collaboration and interoperability due to the gradual integration of different solutions (i.e. ORCID, ConfIDent and conDIDi) into one single system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply put, conDIDi seeks to reduce the management burden for both participants and organizers: Automating the process of verifying that participants fulfilled requisite criteria, such as having paid fees, met requirements for paper submission, agreed to chair a panel, checked into the venue, etc, would reduce a large part of the bureaucratic, time-consuming and costly overhead of conference management.&nbsp; At the same time, automated exchange of verifiable participation credentials reduces the waiting time for academics to build their CVs and paper portfolios, and – more recently – for medical professionals to collect proofs of training and education requirements. ConDIDi is now an ongoing pilot project within TIB and we are excited to see what it will grow into and to support its continuous development in future collaborations with our partners at TIB. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Stacks&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom also partnered with Stacks, integrating the Stacks into Jolocom SSI solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The integration will enable any developer to easily add support for Stacks-based identities to their SSI service, and to build new SSI services (e.g. issuers, verifiers, mediators) with identities secured by the Stacks blockchain. Furthermore, the developed tools will also allow any user who owns a BNS name to easily derive a valid, globally resolvable DID and use it with various SSI services. Finally, the Jolocom SmartWallet will allow regular users to easily interact with SSI services secured by DIDs anchored on the Stacks network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, real-world activities providing any verifiable information for renting a bike or hotel room would happen in a much more seamless, secure, and privacy-preserving way. While the benefits of this technology will be globally available and relevant, we are applying to the Stacks Foundation with a time-sensitive opportunity to reach the European market with pilot projects that can really scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at Jolocom are looking forward to continuing our great partnerships in current and upcoming projects, as well as building many more partnerships in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Udi is full of takes, and this conversation twists and turns through the entirety of crypto—trading, culture, communities, memes, the metaverse, and beyond.</p> <p>------ 📣 ONJUNO | Crypto from your Checking Account! <a href="https://bankless.cc/OnJuno">https://bankless.cc/OnJuno</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href="http://podcast.banklesshq.com/">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM <a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | SMART ORDER ROUTING <a href="https://bankless.cc/Matcha">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🚀 SLINGSHOT | LAYER 2 SOCIAL TRADING <a href="https://bankless.cc/Slingshot">https://bankless.cc/Slingshot</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🏦 GEMINI | TURN FIAT INTO CRYPTO <a href="https://bankless.cc/Gemini">https://bankless.cc/Gemini</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET <a href="https://bankless.cc/Brave">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING <a href="https://bankless.cc/UniGrants">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro 3:30 Udi, a Meme Tactition 9:08 Trading Ponzis 15:58 Not Changing the World 22:22 Optimism, Memes, Community 30:20 Winners &amp; Decentralization 38:33 Composability &amp; User Experience 42:14 SBF and Competition 49:10 Culture &amp; Meme Communities 55:30 Bitcoin Twitter vs Bitcoin Reality 1:01:00 Pricing Values 1:06:30 Critique of Ethereum &amp; Bankless 1:14:53 2022, Metaverse, Resolutions 1:22:19 Closing &amp; Disclaimers</p> <p>------ Resources:</p> <p>Udi on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer?s=20">https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer?s=20</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

Sometimes, it may even be left behind for security&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>As a result, many of these people become stateless and are unable to get refugee status or its benefits, and for the most part of their lives, languish in camps and work only in low-paying jobs.</p><p>The sad part is that this trickles down to their children as well, and the next generation of refugees are unable to study or find jobs because the parents don’t have the required documents.</p><p>In this sense, the state of refugees today is an identity crisis as they do not have documents to prove their identity and nationality.</p> What is the Solution? <p>From the above discussion, it’s clear that every refugee requires an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">identity</a> that would enable that person and his/her family members to get the refugee benefits offered by the host&nbsp;country.</p><p>Ideally, the document must&nbsp;be,</p>  Verifiable, so the refugee can get access to financial and non-financial benefits under treaties and host nation programs.  Easy to access from anywhere, so an individual can digitally prove his or her educational credentials and job experience to make it easy for them to find work in the host&nbsp;nation.  Stored in a safe&nbsp;place.  Tamper-proof.  From a competent authority that is trustable by anyone in any part of the world. For example, the government of a&nbsp;nation.  <p>While these conditions may sound daunting at first, the truth is we already have such an identity in place. It’s called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/is-ssi-the-disruptor-for-a-better-world-aec34cef6275">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and this is implemented through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p><p>The existing format of these VCs has to be simply extended to meet the requirements of the host nation, so every refugee can prove his or her identity and credentials in no&nbsp;time.</p> How can Verifiable Credentials Help? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a> meet all of the requirements mentioned above.</p><p>It is machine-verifiable, tamper-proof, and has the digital signatures of the entity that is authorized to issue&nbsp;it.</p><p>Here is how a VC&nbsp;looks.</p><p>As you can see, the cryptographic proof in the VC proves that it has come from an authorized entity while the identification details show the credentials of the holder. Furthermore, it cannot be tampered with or censored.</p><p>Let’s understand this with a real-world example.</p> Real-world Example <p>Let’s say Mr.X is forced out of his country due to war and he reaches the neighboring country but doesn’t have any physical document to prove his identity such as name, address, educational qualifications, work experience, etc.</p><p>Thankfully, he has them all in the form of a verifiable credential. So, he visits the Foreign Office of the host nation, logs into the office’s computer, generates a verifiable presentation, and shares the same with the government officials.</p><p>In turn, the officials scan the QR code and learn all about Mr. X. They check if he qualifies for the refugee status and grants the same through a&nbsp;VC.</p><p>Now, Mr.X is all set to move around the host nation, collect refugee allowances, study, find a job, and get on with&nbsp;life.</p><p>As you can see, the entire process takes only a few minutes and gives Mr. X a chance to start his life all over again. That’s the true power of&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Before we start dreaming about a pain-free world, note that VCs may not work well in all situations.</p> Are There Any Downsides? <p>There are a few problems that come with using VCs to handle refugee identities.</p><p>Let’s say Mr. X is going to his neighboring country because of political persecution. Knowing this, his country revokes all the VCs issued for him. As a result, he can no longer use the VCs to prove his identity, though he can use VCs issued by his employer and educational institutions, provided they are not <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">revoked</a>. In this sense, VCs can be used for political revenge.</p><p>The second issue is that <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> can become inaccessible if Mr.X forgets the password of his digital wallet where the credentials are&nbsp;stored.</p><p>So, is VC a solution at&nbsp;all?</p><p>Yes, in most cases. These VCs can be a life-saver for most refugees as it proves their identity, work experience, and&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Curious to know how else VCs can be <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">used</a> across different industries and situations?

  The gaming industry is entering a new era, with blockchain gaming growing faster than ever. But what are the benefits, and how does it benefit the players?

<p>If there were a sheriff in gaming country, he better be worried, cause there is a new player in town. Most gamers would be familiar with pay-to-win (P2W), an insidious game mechanic that enables faster progress to those who fork out real cash. Players can acquire more powerful weapons or equipment, extra health allocation, etc. -for a price-, thus giving these ‘premium’ players an unfair advantage...</p>

 Stories from the UK and&nbsp;Ghana <p>In 2021, together with <a href="https://habitusinsight.com/">Habitus Insight</a>, we explored stories on the human impact of identity exclusion for <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/home">Women in Identity</a>. This is the first of two blogs on that research — the following blog will share the findings from the UK and&nbsp;Ghana.</p><p>As part of that work, we spoke to several people who have experienced ID exclusion. Va-Bene is a transwoman — or as she calls herself, a transvatar — based in Kumasi, Ghana. She faces challenges every time she goes to a physical bank branch. Her IDs (and particularly the photos on them) don’t reflect who she is&nbsp;now.</p><p>“If I have to withdraw money with my ATM card, that is fine. But any other thing I will do directly in the bank. Believe me, either we are going to fight in the bank or I’m just going to be delayed for several hours without any money.” Being denied access to her own money not only has a direct financial impact on Va-Bene. It also has an emotional impact: “it is very frustrating when I am excluded. Very, very frustrating. Very depressing.”</p> “Know Your Customer” and existing challenges of exclusion <p>In her book <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780199463510.001.0001/oso-9780199463510">In Pursuit of Proof</a>, Tarangini Sriraraman documents how “identification” began as a need to recognise individuals for governance, but has become a process heavily shaped by social norms. Why is gender an important characteristic for identification? Who decides how that is categorised (male/female)? What happens when gender goes beyond binary, as in Va-Bene’s case?</p><p>“Know Your Customer” (KYC) is a legal requirement to comply with anti-money laundering regulations (AML) in most countries. Verification requirements to access financial services often include database checks, identity document verification, and, increasingly, biometric checks. For proof of address, utility bills or bank statements can often serve as acceptable documentation. By verifying a customer’s identity and intentions when they open an account, and then understanding transaction patterns, financial institutions can more accurately pinpoint potential account takeover or other suspicious activities.</p><p>However, many people get stuck when trying to prove who they are (like Va-Bene) or where they live. Obtaining an ID can be a time-consuming and expensive process, made more challenging for those who are <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/why-is-id-important-for-women/home">female</a>, from an ethnic or racial minority background, live in a rural area or with a disability, or are <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/report-launch-identity-at-the-margins-identification-systems-for-refugees-69466244fa62">refugees or migrants</a>. <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/early-financial-inclusion-can-lead-to-exclusion-experiences-of-kenyan-youth-eb99c7476d7d">Youth, too, are emerging as a demographic</a> facing barriers to ID. Often these issues include not having a proof of address (being without a fixed address, having recently arrived in the country, or for other reasons) or not being able to easily prove who one is (not having <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/types-id-systems">foundational ID</a> documentation). These challenges can become even harder to address without knowledge of where to go or what to do&nbsp;next.</p><p>Interview with Payal, a recently arrived migrant in northwest London, UK, who faced challenges opening a bank account without proof of&nbsp;address.</p> Next steps <p>In addition to Va-Bene and Payal, we spoke to a range of participants who are or who have felt excluded from financial systems for different reasons and we’ll be sharing these stories over the next few months. This research is the foundation for Women in Identity to build an Identity Code of Conduct — a set of guiding principles and a framework for inclusive ID-product development.</p><p>Nowhere is this more necessary than in financial services, where ID is needed to protect users (e.g., from financial crime), but at the same time provide access to specific products. Service providers need to know who users are, but how does that process happen, why, and when does it become problematic? The Identity Code of Conduct will establish a set of guiding principles around inclusion, building on the broader <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/principles">Digital ID Principles</a>. It will offer a practical set of tools to address inclusion at every stage of identification.</p> Note from Women in Identity: <p>At <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/">Women in Identity</a> we believe identity solutions should be inclusive, built for all, by all. But we also believe this does not happen by&nbsp;chance.</p><p>The aim of our initial research and videos is to work towards this Code of Conduct: a practical guide for product designers to gain deeper empathy for the challenges experienced at the user end of the ID lifecycle and the knowledge to take these challenges into account when designing products.</p><p>Other sectors already take this approach to product development. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has an ongoing Code of Practice based on principles of care, fairness, honesty, and respect that impact agreed standards of product development (e.g., clear and transparent information on packaging).</p><p>We believe we can learn from other industries and create an Identity Code of Conduct which ensures inclusion is built into identity product design, thus making these products better for the organisations that rely on them and for the people that use&nbsp;them.</p><p>We look forward to you joining us on this journey and welcome feedback and suggestions. Please reach out to us on @WomenInID on Twitter or @WomenInIdentity on LinkedIn!</p><p>Read more about this project at <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/code-of-conduct">ID Code of Conduct</a> and follow us at @womeninID @WomenInIdentity @CaribouDigital @habitusinsight #DiversityByDesign #ForAllByAll #IDCodeofConduct #IdentityExclusion</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-human-impact-of-identity-exclusion-in-financial-services-ce1e0d769389">The human impact of identity exclusion in financial services</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
