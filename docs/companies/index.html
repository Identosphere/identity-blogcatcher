<p>Before the pandemic, most organizations moved their digital strategies forward at a steady pace. Leaders either wanted proof of success and didn’t feel great urgency to invest more in digital or the organizational culture seemed resistant.</p>
<p>But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, many employees started <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ask-these-questions-before-deploying-remote-access-technology/">to work remotely</a> and organizations ramped up digital engagement with customers. Surveyed corporate directors increased the development of digital products and services to maintain and accelerate their customer engagement, and help them reach their revenue growth targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz05NTlhZjA0MDE0NDgxMWViYWJhYTBhNTZkNmU3ZDRjZg=="></a></p>
<p>The way forward for them was to increase, rather than decrease, the speed of<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/prioritize-digital-business-initiatives-to-accelerate-into-the-future/"> their digital business initiatives </a>and to elevate funding for IT to support this acceleration.</p>
<p>The survey found that 87% of corporate directors deemed technology as having a transformational role in addressing strategic business priorities. Sixty-seven percent of corporate directors expected budgetary increases in technology, and the majority of them anticipated a 6.9% increase in their current IT budgets as a result of the acceleration.</p>
 Why is digital strategy acceleration important now? 
<p>Digital business acceleration is important now for three reasons:</p>
 
 COVID-19. The pandemic demonstrated the value of digital initiatives in e-commerce, deliveries, supply chain virtualization, process automation and other activities, especially where physical activities were no longer possible. 
 Costs and operations. The recession has driven the need to overhaul costs and streamline operations. 
 Results. The rapid responses to the pandemic make accelerating digital business seem feasible and also critical for the survival of a company. 
 
 Boards of directors position the CIO as a partner in digital strategy&nbsp; 
<p>To respond to this crisis and its aftermath, the role of the CIO as an advisor to the board on digital business issues will also increasingly change. More than half of boards of directors said that CIOs will serve as partners with senior business leaders, while over a third look to the CIO to lead digital business issues alone.</p>

 Knock, knock. Who’s there? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To most Americans, the question is a pathway to laughter. To many Sub-Saharan Africans, on the other hand, the matter of who’s who can be painfully complicated, inconvenient, and potentially transformative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">494 million</a>&nbsp;people do not have a form of identification, which is as much as 45% of the population. In other words, almost half of the Sub-Saharan Africans cannot prove who they say they are, thus walled off from access to public services and social welfare such as education or healthcare, denied the right to vote, and left ineligible to participate in any formal financial transactions or economic activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Cash. Cash Who? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implications of identifying livelihoods are more pronounced in the region because, among the many challenges mentioned above, Sub-Saharan Africa has historically hosted the biggest population underserved by the financial sector. </p>
<blockquote><p>Despite steady growth over the past years,&nbsp;<a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=1228">less than one-third</a> of adults (age 15+) in the region own at least one financial account, compared with the world average of 67.1% and 93.8% in North America. Without an ID, individuals and businesses have no options but to rely on cash transactions.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financially speaking, for individuals, having a digital identity means&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/toward-new-impact-narrative-financial-inclusion">building resilience</a>&nbsp;— coping strategies in the face of life uncertainties and changes — through activities like instant online saving in a secure way, instead of having to choose between finding a reliable savings club, spending hours traveling to a bank, and keeping cash under the pillow. It also significantly eases the process of participation in pension schemes and receiving qualified subsidies. The value of digital identity to individuals is more than resilience building; it’s also about seizing opportunities. By leveraging financing tools such as loans or investments, individuals have higher chances to survive and thrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For businesses, having an identity as the business owner helps with financing for business needs, such as a planned expansion or weathering an unplanned pandemic, through formal financial arrangements with&nbsp;<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.617.4016&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">more competitive interest rates</a>. It also builds business credit history, which is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/blog/10-stats-explain-why-business-credit-important-small-business">especially meaningful</a>&nbsp;to small to medium enterprises. Moreover, having a credible online presence verified by the government agencies or a third-party IDV service provider can be a critical part of customer acquisition in a global economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, financial inclusion banks on identification, and to Sub-Saharan Africa, digital identity will turbo-charge inclusive financial growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No Time Like the Present 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers have&nbsp;<a href="https://faculty.babson.edu/lcdstein/research/stein-yannelis-freedmanbank.pdf">found</a>&nbsp;that financial inclusion interventions have a larger effect on people who open bank accounts earlier than those who do so later. It takes time for the enabling effect of digital identity on financial inclusion to occur, and so does the digitalization of identity. The writer argues that now is the best time to assess the needs for designing and rolling out digital identity systems that serve both the currently documented and undocumented in the region. The region can leverage the existing and continuously developing mobile networks and data and privacy regulation frameworks and follow in the footsteps of a few pioneer countries in the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SIM connection rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to grow from 77% in 2019 to 86% by the end of 2025, at a CAGR of 4.3%, and the mobile internet user rate from 26% to 39%, at a CAGR of 9.7%, according to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GSMA_MobileEconomy2020_SSA_Eng.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;published by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/">GSM Association</a>. The rising mobile penetration level lays a solid foundation for the potential continent-wide rollout of mobile identity, whose worldwide addressable market was valued at $34 billion through 2022, per OWI’s&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/product/mobile-identity-the-34-billion-opportunity/">research in 2018</a>. The high mobile penetration rate also means plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SCT_Report_R_WebSingles.pdf">opportunities</a>&nbsp;leveraging tools such as mobile money for transactions among individuals and businesses and government-sponsored cash transfer programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A reliable digital identity system also needs to be backed by a strong data and privacy regulation framework. By 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://unctad.org/news/data-and-privacy-unprotected-one-third-countries-despite-progress">half</a>&nbsp;of the African countries have had data and privacy legislation in place, and 61% have set up e-transaction laws, with the number&nbsp;<a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2019/12/24/kenya-now-has-a-data-protection-law-what-does-this-mean-for-netizens/">on a gradual rise</a>.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, several countries in the region have already taken the first stab at the digital identity system. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europeanceo.com/world-view/electronic-identification-cards-herald-a-digital-future-for-ghana/">Ghana</a>&nbsp;began its national registration and issuance of electronic ID cards to citizens in 2018;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/kenya-creates-africas-first-national-digital-id-scheme/">Kenya</a>&nbsp;is creating a population-wide identity scheme in Africa, a US$60 million program; and earlier this year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/loans-credits/2020/02/18/nigeria-digital-identification-for-development-project">Nigeria</a>&nbsp;launched the Digital Identification for Development Project with a US$115 million credit from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA). The identity digitization initiatives in these countries are not only meaningful for financial inclusion. They serve as trailblazers for their neighboring countries, especially given the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/digital-identity-for-all-push-in-africa-now-has-clarity-and-political-will-id4africa-executive-director">increasing demand</a>&nbsp;for digital identity and digital assets driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and its&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239797">disproportionate economic impact</a>&nbsp;among households.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the rising mobile penetration, promising regulatory landscape, and the countries carrying the torch, there are hurdles to clear to optimize for the success of financially inclusive digital identity. For instance, there’s still room for modification in regulation. It is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/no244_0.pdf">found</a>&nbsp;that many of the data and privacy laws are not as comprehensive as international regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Some of the rights enforced by GDPR, such as the right to data portability, which&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/data-protection-and-privacy-laws">mitigates the risk</a>&nbsp;of locking consumers into a single service provider, is not covered in these laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, while policymakers and other stakeholders, like international organizations, should be careful when evaluating costs and feasibilities, the benefits of acting sooner rather than later are self-evident. With the data collected from digital identity systems, from simple data like population and gender ratio, to more complicated data points like health and socio-economic statistics, Sub-Saharan African policymakers will be<a href="https://theconversation.com/poor-data-affects-africas-ability-to-make-the-right-policy-decisions-64064">&nbsp;better positioned</a>&nbsp;to conduct evidence-based research and make data-informed policies. In addition, better infrastructure supported by the government initiatives will help attract private-sector players both at home and abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, digital identity can be a transformative force in advancing regional criticalities such as financial inclusion in the public and private sectors. The sooner we take action, the faster we may bring changes to communities in need.</p>

  <p>The question of how much control to retain versus how much to give up is something that occupies the minds of parents, management consultants, and often coaches. A high level of control helps achieve specific objectives, but, at the same time, it may lead to a complex bureaucracy that slows down self-initiative, entrepreneurship, and general productivity. A high level of empowerment, on the other hand, fosters creativity and ownership, but it may lead to unmanageable or risky outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the world of identity and security, organizations across all sectors also face this conundrum. Managing identity involves both controlled (stateful) and autonomous (stateless) security tokens.&nbsp;</p>

  Stateful tokens are opaque and can be de-referenced by a central authority only after request (token introspection). The authority manages the state of the token, including revocation. The token depends on the availability and performance of the authority. 
	 Stateless tokens are self-contained and can be "unpacked" by any party with the appropriate key material. Stateless tokens can be processed with or without the availability of an authoritative service.&nbsp; 
 <p>Knowing which to use is often straightforward, but sometimes what you really want to deploy is something in between.</p>

 A Closer Look at Token Swapping Use Cases 

<p>Exposing open services and APIs to external clients is a perfect use case for stateful tokens. Because external clients can be located anywhere and security tokens can travel over many networks, more control is needed. With stateful tokens, you can have opaque tokens that don’t carry sensitive content, always introspect tokens against a central authority, and revoke tokens as needed to provide a high level of control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a> architectures that require security checks at every stage, including each microservice-to-microservice call, using stateless tokens makes more sense. That’s because they don’t depend on a central authority, which could impact the ability to scale and to continue operations if the authority is unreachable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Token swapping describes the ability to exchange one security token for another in a different, enriched, or restricted form. A gateway can function as the "token swapper." It intercepts requests, validates tokens, and generates new tokens either by itself or in conjunction with other services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let’s look at the example of a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services">financial</a> company exposing APIs to partner organizations. Such a scenario requires a higher level of control and the ability to revoke granted access, so, for these external clients, the financial institution issues stateful tokens. Token swapping allows the company to use those stateful tokens on the front end but then switch to stateless tokens for scalability and other benefits within their microservices environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you swap a stateful token for a stateless token in the right way and at the right time, you can achieve that delicate balance between control and autonomy to better suit your purposes.</p>

  <p>In the aforementioned scenario, ForgeRock Identity Gateway, deployed as a north-south gateway, validates stateful OAuth2 tokens by introspection with ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">Access Management</a>, ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">Identity Cloud</a>, or any other OAuth2 authorization server. After validating the stateful token, Identity Gateway then generates a stateless JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the identity information the downstream services need to proceed autonomously.</p>

<p>Self-contained JWTs are a compelling token type for scenarios that require a high level of scaling, do not have a strong dependency on external services (such as the authority), and can tolerate the absence of token revocation capability. For many microservices scenarios, this is a very effective use case for token swapping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Local JWT validation can also be conducted by service meshes, such as Istio, or by ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">Identity Gateway</a>, deployed as an east-west gateway, or Microgateway with the JwtValidationFilter. Note, however, that service meshes support self-contained JWTs but do not integrate well with stateful OAuth2 and remote token introspection. Furthermore, JWTs consumed by service meshes like Istio need to have the appropriate content, which can be built using token swapping. The "token swapper" can aggregate the appropriate JWTs.</p>

<p>Token swapping is not limited to stateful OAuth2 to JWT token swapping. You can create transformations using other token types – such as OpenID Connect, SAML or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">SSO</a> tokens – and services like the security token service (STS). You can also enrich tokens with user roles, entitlements, or attributes obtained from the authority.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To learn more about balancing control and autonomy with token swapping, read about the following useful components: <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/JwtBuilderFilter.html">JwtBuilderFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/JwtValidationFilter.html">JwtValidationFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/IdTokenValidationFilter.html">IdTokenValidationFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/OAuth2ResourceServerFilter.html">OAuth2ResourceServerFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/TokenTransformationFilter.html">TokenTransformationFilter</a>.</p>

<p>With token swapping, you can expand your options for obtaining the right balance in the control versus autonomy dilemma—at least in the identity and security realm. Parents, philosophers, and management will have to look elsewhere.</p>

The format is focused on open collaboration which creates a real and rare opportunity to organically discuss not only the latest technology developments, but also the surrounding social, political and legal implications.</p><p>This year, over 400 attendees from across the globe participated in IIW31. It was a great showcase of both the work and progress being achieved across a variety of open standards and open source communities.</p><p>Although there is too much to cover in one write up, we wanted to highlight MATTR’s pick of the three major&nbsp;themes:</p>  KERI comes into the spotlight  Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity   KERI comes into the spotlight <p>One of the technologies that received a great deal of attention this year was Sam Smith’s <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> (KERI). Sam first introduced this topic over a year ago, and it’s evident that a lot has happened since then to bring these ideas and concepts to&nbsp;life.</p><p>KERI attempts to address the self-certifying aspect of identifier-based systems such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Central to this technology is the concept of Key Event Logs (KELs) which are maintained by each user in a distributed identity system. Key Event Logs contain digitally signed messages of all key management related transactions done by the user, and can be used not only to prove control over your identifier, but also shared with other external ‘witnesses’ who can independently validate and prove that you control your identifier. In practice, this means that KERI identifiers and keys are not “ledger-locked” — they are fully portable and can be validated using any ledger, distributed database, or other verifiable data registry.</p><p>In a session called “<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/2E/_KERI_for_Muggles">KERI for Muggles</a>”, Drummond Reed and Sam Smith identified 7 main characteristics that make KERI useful for identity:</p>  Self-certifying identifiers  Self-certifying Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Witnesses for Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Pre-rotation as simple, safe, scalable protection against key compromise  System-independent validation  Delegated self-certifying identifiers enable enterprise-class key management  Compatibility with the GDPR “right to be forgotten”  <p>There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=12A/_KERIfying_DID_Methods_%26_KERI_for_Interop">number</a> of <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13E/_DIDn%27t:_did:un_and_overlap_between_DIDs_%26_KERI">additional</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14A/_Verifiable_Trust_Bases:_How_to_make_the_web_of_trust_new_again_with_KERI">sessions</a> that dived into advanced KERI topics, including how KERI can create interoperability between different <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a> and solving the operational concerns related to bringing these ideas to life. There are <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keripy">ongoing</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keriox">open-source projects</a> at the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) which are driving this work forward. We look forward to the positive change this will bring to our ecosystem, particularly in reducing our technology’s strict dependence on specific infrastructure like distributed ledgers.</p> Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems <p>Following on from <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">IIW30</a>, there was a continued theme around the bridging of W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) with existing identity protocols on the web today such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), which are mainly used in federated identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Evolution of existing protocols such as OIDC allows existing infrastructure providers to make adjustments to their implementations in order to start using new technology, rather than having to tear it all down and rebuild. The goal here is to build as much as we can upon previous work while addressing a number of significant shortcomings around federated identity as it exists today. We’ve covered <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">this topic</a> before, so needless to say, we’re committed to solving this problem and we were extremely supportive of the continued discussion around these issues at this&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>A key component of this approach is the ability to allow existing identity solutions to issue and verify Verifiable Credentials. One way to achieve this is to extend the OpenID Connect protocol to enable more portable digital identity. Instead of using OIDC as a bearer token between an Issuer and Relying party, we can create a client-bound assertion that’s held in a user’s digital wallet. To that end, we <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1F/_OpenID_Connect_Credential_Provider">introduced</a> an approach that we’re calling <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, which turns traditional Identity Providers (IdPs) into credential providers. It modifies current authentication/issuance flows used by OpenID Connect to allow IdPs to issue assertions that are re-provable and reusable for authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-relation information and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the “wallet” layer between issuers and relying parties. There was great participation in this discussion from some of today’s existing Identity Providers, and one of the outcomes from this IIW is that the specification will be contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item, where it will be further developed by the community there.</p><p>There was also a great deal of interest around the evolution of <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP). The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">SIOP chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect specification was written in a way that clearly tried to leave room for some of the user-centric design concepts that are quite popular today, but given that it was first introduced in 2014, it lacked the context of today’s technologies such as DIDs and VCs. ُThere’s a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues/1180/siop-laundry-list">laundry list</a> of topics to cover here, so kick starting this effort has been a matter of breaking down each component and coming up with potential solutions. We identified 3 main problems that SIOP aims to&nbsp;address:</p>  Enabling portable identities between providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR&nbsp;problem</a>  Dealing with different deployment types of OpenID providers  <p>There are a number of insights we can gain by addressing each of these issues separately, and bringing them together to form more robust solutions. It was exciting to see that there are <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14B/_SIOP_-_progress_on_the_laundry_list_(wrt_DID)">many people</a> interested in revisiting SIOP and trying to address the underlying issues with federated identity. The work will continue to develop at the OpenID Foundation AB working group, so the conversation doesn’t stop at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>In related news, there was some <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13J/_The_Web_Platform,_Privacy_and_Federation_(thoughts_on_WebID)">collaborative</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=20C/_Browsers,_Privacy_and_Federation_(Cookies,_WebID,_CHAPI,_etc)">dialogue</a> with Google’s <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> technology, which aims to explore how browsers can help solve the user privacy problem of cross-site cookie tracking on the web. Given that the IIW community is deeply focused on issues of security and user privacy, it made a lot of sense for those working on WebID to connect with people working on OpenID Connect, as well as the W3C community working on the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI). The team developing Chromium discussed the possibility of adding a minimal set of browser APIs to work with CHAPI. Having something like CHAPI supported directly by the browser would allow for a more friendly user experience, allowing a credential holder to choose the provider of their identity (instead of being dictated by the relying party) and enabling better credential storage synchronization. The discussion here is really just a starting point, and we’re looking forward to seeing how WebID incorporates this approach and continues to work with the IIW community as the work develops.</p> SSI maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity <p>It’s been nearly 15 years since Kim Cameron wrote the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of Identity</a>, and over 4 years since Christopher Allen first laid out the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 Principles of SSI</a>. In the time since then, thinking has evolved a great deal around how to bring the power of SSI to users. This work has not only included building out the foundational technologies, but also addressing the practical tradeoffs between convenience, usability, and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As these technologies get deployed in the real world, what’s emerging is the fact that what we call ‘SSI’ (Self-Sovereign Identity) is more a set of guiding principles in how we would like digital identity systems of the future to behave like or be based around, rather than a concrete checklist where you can say this technology is SSI. As it is, there are always new ideas about how to bring these principles to life in real world applications. This continued to be a hot topic at this IIW, including:</p>  Scaling peer communications  Scaling blockchains  Scaling privacy   Scaling peer communications <p>Besides all of the ongoing work on KERI, there were a number of updates surrounding technology enabling peer-to-peer communication. There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1J/_DIDComm_Messaging_V2_-_Where_we_are_and_what_to_expect">few</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=21D/_DIDComm_Mediator_Agents_(v1_%26_v2)_-_Intro_and_where_open_source_projects_are">sessions</a> dedicated to giving the community an update on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a> protocol, showing that the specification is maturing to a point where it will be stable enough to broadly implement. In addition, Daniel Hardman of <a href="https://www.evernym.com">Evernym</a> presented a thought provoking <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=23G/_Discovery:_Solving_the_Kobayashi_Maru_of_SSI">session</a> on the intersection of privacy and discoverability on the web, which he calls “The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru">Kobayashi Maru</a> Problem of&nbsp;SSI”.</p> Scaling blockchains <p>The team at <a href="https://consensys.net">Consensys</a> presented an interesting <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/3E/_Better_DID_Mehtods_with_Zero_Knowledge_Proofs_(ZKPs)%3F_-_Privacy_Preserving,_Globally_Verfiable_DIDs">proposal</a> for a new DID method based on <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK Rollups</a>. In recent years, there has been a big push in the community to reconsider the use of ledgers and minimize what information is made public, especially when it comes to identifying individual people. While there has been a lot of interest in DID methods that don’t use any blockchain or ledger infrastructure, Consensys and many others continue to explore the use of ledgers due to their unique properties, such as the ability to offer global resolvability. Although it’s early stages for this work and there is no codebase yet, there was a lot of interest from those in the community looking to use blockchain-based DID methods. Their approach would give DIDs global resolvability with the potential to keep the DID “off ledger” and privacy preserving, making it ideal for persons using DIDs. As mentioned earlier, the work on KERI is also helping to illustrate how we can continue using decentralized ledger technologies in a way that preserves user sovereignty and data portability.</p> Scaling privacy <p>As a followup to last IIW, we provided an introduction to multi-message signatures and an overview of recent developments made around using <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+ Signatures</a> for selective disclosure in JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials. We <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April of this year. Since then, steady progress on open-source implementations and technical specs have resulted in a number of additional enhancements to the privacy preserving characteristics of zero knowledge proof based credentials, including the ability to have blinded subject credentials and domain bound proofs. In addition to progress on the technical specification, there have been significant developments on open-source implementations from a number of independent organizations. This progress has made the case for privacy-preserving credentials and selective disclosure stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p> Summary <p>SSI and decentralized digital identity are maturing at a steady pace, but we still have a lot of work ahead to solve the difficult problems around trust, privacy, and scalability that come with deploying systems in the real world. We’re excited to see progress on the critical issues move forward as the work happens across so many different communities and areas of interest.</p><p>As always, we’re incredibly grateful for the work that <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Young</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a>, and the team at IIW are doing to bring together different perspectives and to host important discussions which are open, respectful, and always illuminating. As for MATTR, you can usually find us on <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal">GitHub</a> and working within organizations like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>, and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> to push forward the vision for a more open and accessible internet. We will see you all at&nbsp;IIW32!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/highlights-of-iiw31-c36883cb70db">Highlights of #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   CDR is here! But don’t panic if your bank isn’t quite there yet. We can help with our new ForgeRock CDR Open Banking Accelerators. 

<p>Well, it’s finally here. The Australian government’s<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0#:~:text=On%2026%20November%202017%2C%20the,and%20control%20over%20their%20data.&amp;text=Consumer%20data%20relating%20to%20mortgage,shared%20after%201%20November%202020."> Consumer Data Right</a> (CDR) regulation is taking effect – in phases – starting with bank loans and personal information for the Big Four banks. The rest of the industry will follow suit in 2021.</p>

<p>Understandably, the rollout of yet another new regulation tends to be met with a bit of resistance. But <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services/cdr">CDR</a> has some significant upsides for banks that fully embrace the open standards requirement that come with it. It’s been argued that the open standards can lead to a new wave of greater innovation and consumer services. Here are three ways banks can benefit from CDR:.&nbsp;</p>

<p>#1. CDR can pave the way to greater uniformity of security and boost consumer confidence. Third-party global banking integrations have been quite loose with regard to security in the past. Lacking application programming interface (API) openness, some developers have resorted to insecure “screen scraping” techniques that left consumer data vulnerable. CDR requires openness, mandating industry-standard, security-conscious protocols that will increase consumer confidence in the way their data is handled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>#2. CDR can lead to better customer and user experiences (CX/UX). Everything today is digital and online. Even processes previously handled exclusively face to face – like new customer onboarding and enrollment – can now be done remotely, without ever having to set foot in a branch office. Since many customers have an online-only relationship, the digital experience must be optimized. This means speed and security need to be core components of the offering, ensuring that there are no data loss or sync issues between your bank and a third-party provider. Secure uniformity and openness of APIs can help support this.</p>

<p>#3. CDR can help monetize data for new consumer services. A core focus of CDR is putting consumers in charge of their data. But this doesn’t eliminate opportunities for new service offerings and partnerships between banks and third-party API developers or other financial services organizations. When done properly, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/kuppingercole-leadership-compass-identity-api-platforms">opening up your APIs</a> – and by extension, customer data –&nbsp; can lead to new revenue opportunities.</p>

<p>But before any of this can happen, you need to become compliant with CDR. Maybe you’re already there, but is the job really done? Was it a struggle to become compliant because of the legacy IT systems you have in place? Will that solution scale to your current needs, as well as the evolving and changing CDR standard?</p>

<p>No matter where you are in the compliance journey, ForgeRock has solutions – called “Accelerators” – that can help. Let’s take a more detailed dive into some of the specifics so you can see for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock recently released <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/cdr-open-banking-accelerators">CDR Open Banking Accelerators</a> to help drastically speed up compliance with the Australian Government's CDR mandate. These accelerators make it easier for you to comply with CDR mandates by providing a fully compliant container-based reference implementation, along with comprehensive documentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our accelerators are designed to minimize integration efforts, by deploying into your production environment rapidly and in an automated way. Identity architects, DevOps, developers, and project managers report that our accelerators have saved them up to two thirds of their total implementation time and cost. CDR Open Banking Accelerators can help you achieve a rapid ROI and improve the customer experience at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock CDR Open Banking Accelerators also ensure that the APIs used by financial providers prioritize customer authorization when sharing data with other requested providers. We designed the tools to adhere to CDR guidelines outlined by the Australian government.</p>

<p>ForgeRock can help you overcome compliance hurdles. Here’s how the CDR Open Banking Accelerators addresses four primary use cases within the Open Banking framework:</p>

  Gives Data Holders a plug-and-play, CDR-compliant endpoint, where Accredited Data Recipients can dynamically register themselves. 
	 Provides Data Holders with a compliant, centralized consent engine enabling Accredited Data Recipients to request access to customer data. 
	 Provides Data Holders with a MetaDirectory Cache Data Model and Sync Engine to create and maintain the required copy of the Registry. Provides Data Holders with a fine-grained <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/authorization">authorization</a> service based on customer consent. This Core Banking API enables you, as an accredited Data Recipient, to access data the customer consents to. 
 <p>You can decide to simply comply with the CDR regulation, or you can use it as a springboard to compete in the new Open API economy. ForgeRock firmly believes that, in the near future, the quality of CDR implementations and broader API offerings will be a determining factor for customers choosing new services. As Data Recipients begin to offer innovative services using banking APIs, customers will start to expect to make use of these third-party services. Plus, non-mandatory APIs help progressive organizations like yours capitalize on the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services/open-banking">Open Banking</a> revolution, so it’s a real opportunity to grow and evolve your business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re grateful to our trusted partner<a href="https://www.middleware.co.nz/#/"> Middleware NZ</a>, whose knowledge of the Australian banking market and technical acumen helped make the CDR Open Banking Accelerators a reality.</p>

<p>With a modern identity and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a> (IAM) platform, you can transform your customers’ user experience. They’ll be able to control who can access their data and what can be done with it. And by empowering your customers, you’ll open up new and exciting innovation opportunities for your organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1400050338">https://bihu.com/article/1400050338</a></p><p>Original publish time: November 3,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: Xiang Yao, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p><p>This is the first time that the Stablecoin Report has been published as a monthly report, please feel free to leave suggestions.</p> Quick Preview   The market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $1.510 billion to $22.13&nbsp;billion.  Last month, the circulation of USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI increased by 299 million, 306 million, 301 million, and 26 million. The circulation of TUSD decreased by 194&nbsp;million.  USDC has stepped out of Ethereum and has been deployed on Algorand and Solana, with a supply of more than $30&nbsp;million.  BUSD continues to grow on the&nbsp;BSC.  Stablecoins have attracted the attention of global regulators. The European Commission, the Financial Stability Board, and the IMF have issued regulatory frameworks or&nbsp;reports.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past month(September 26, 2020 ~ October 25, 2020, same below, the data report of the natural month will be provided from next&nbsp;month).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $1.510 billion to $22.13&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past month, Tether additionally issued 299 million USDT on Ethereum. The circulation of USDC, BUSD, DAI, PAX, HUSD, and GUSD increased by 306 million, 301 million, 25.6 million, 74.89 million, 96.12 million, and 510,000. The circulation of TUSD decreased by 194&nbsp;million.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last month, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all decreased by&nbsp;215,000.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT decreased by 253,000 and the number of holding addresses of USDC increased by 33,000. The number of other stablecoins holding addresses has not changed&nbsp;much.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last month increased by an average of 6.55% compared to the previous&nbsp;month.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous month, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;11.83%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last month decreased by an average of 28.82% from the previous&nbsp;month.</p> 2. Stablecoin stepped out of&nbsp;Ethereum <p>About 70% of stablecoins still choose Ethereum as the main issuance platform, and except for USDT which chooses to be issued on multiple blockchains, most stablecoins choose Ethereum as the only issuance platform. During the continued congestion of Ethereum, in addition to the steady increase of USDT on Tron, stablecoins have gradually stepped out of Ethereum. USDC chose multiple smart contract platforms to deploy, while BUSD began to expand within its ecosystem.</p> USDC has been deployed on Algorand/Solana <p>The Centre Alliance announced several pieces of cooperation information in September and October, announcing that it would deploy USDC assets on Algorand, Stellar, and Solana. Among them, the supply on Algorand and Solana has reached $7.180 million and $25 million, and USDC on Stellar will be issued in the first quarter of&nbsp;2021.</p> BUSD continues to grow on&nbsp;BSC <p>As a stablecoin asset issued by Binance, BUSD not only exists in the form of ERC-20 on Ethereum but is also deployed on Binance Chain (BEP2) and Binance Smart Chain (BEP20). With the progress of mining on BSC, the number of holding addresses of BUSD on BSC has exceeded 9,100, which is the same as the number of holding addresses of BUSD on Ethereum. Since the bridge of assets is provided by Binance Exchange, it is not easy to count the supply of BUSD on each blockchain. However, according to bscscan, the supply of BUSD on BSC should have exceeded $40 million, among which the amount of BUSD on Pancake exceeds $18&nbsp;million.</p> 3. Stablecoins attracted global regulatory attention <p>As early as 2019, stablecoins have attracted the attention of global regulators. The concept of ‘GSC’ was first formally proposed in the ‘Global Stablecoin Evaluation Report’ of the G7 Stablecoin Working Group in October 2019. ‘Global’ mainly refers to the stablecoin spanning multiple jurisdictions. The Bank for International Settlements also released a report on strengthening cross-border payments in July 2020, suggesting that CBDC and global stablecoins can provide potential assistance for cross-border payments.</p><p>The rapid growth of stablecoins in 2020 has even attracted the attention of global regulators. The European Commission, the G20 joint FSB, and the International Monetary Fund have successively issued regulatory reports on stablecoin.</p> European Commission announced the regulatory framework for encrypted assets and stablecoins <p>The European Commission published the final draft of the regulatory framework for encrypted assets on September 24. The report is 168 pages long and elaborates on the background of the proposal, the current status of the development of encrypted assets, and the regulatory recommendations for stablecoins.</p><p>The report pointed out that although the scale of the encrypted asset market was still small and did not pose a threat to financial stability, this situation may change with the emergence of ‘GSC’. Because ‘Global Stablecoin’ has stable value and uses the network effects generated by companies promoting these assets to seek wider applications. The European Commission will create a comprehensive and holistic EU ‘stablecoin’ framework for encrypted assets that are not covered by the EU’s existing financial services legislation to mitigate the risks identified by the Financial Stability Board, especially financial stability risks.</p><p>The plan still needs to be considered by the legislative counterparts of the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European&nbsp;Council.</p> The G20 joint FSB released a stablecoin regulatory report <p>On October 23, the FSB released the “Regulation, Supervision, and Supervision of the ‘GSC’ arrangement” report, which made high-level recommendations for the supervision, supervision, and supervision of the ‘GSC’ arrangement.</p><p>The FSB pointed out that the so-called ‘stablecoin’ is a specific type of encrypted assets that had the potential to improve efficiency in the delivery of financial services by linking their value to one or more other assets (e.g. sovereign currencies) to solve the high volatility of ‘traditional’ encrypted assets, but at the same time could pose risks to financial stability, especially in the case of mass adoption. Stablecoins have the potential to improve payment efficiency and promote financial inclusion, but the use of ‘GSC’ may have a huge impact on the justice of many countries.</p><p>The FSB was established after the G20 Summit in 2009. It was officially commissioned by the G20 to provide observation reports and policy recommendations for the global financial system, sponsored and led by the Bank for International Settlements.</p><p>The G20 is working with the IMF, the World Bank, and the BIS to discuss the complexity of the GSC in terms of practice and technology, including design and interoperability, and assess the potential and challenges of CBDC in cross-border payments. By the end of 2022, the G20 will work with the IMF, the World Bank, and BIS to complete the framework for regulating stablecoins and research on the design, technology, and experiments of&nbsp;CBDC.</p> The IMF issued a report showing that CBDC has potential, but it cannot solve all&nbsp;problems <p>A report issued by the IMF on October 16 stated that CBDC may benefit those countries that wish to increase control over their monetary policy, but it will not solve all&nbsp;crises.</p><p>The IMF pointed out that new digital currencies including CBDC and GSC had attracted regulatory attention. CBDC and GSC can reduce transaction costs through competition, broaden service channels through mobile devices, and promote financial inclusion. The cross-border use of digital currency will also bring risks and policy challenges. For countries with economic downturns, CBDC is not a panacea solution. It cannot save those countries with high inflation rates or similar domestic problems.</p><p>The report concluded that CBDC had not yet qualitatively changed the global pattern of currencies, but it may intensify the effects of currency substitution and currency internationalization. And if the GSC and the existing currency have the same accounting unit, it may have a currency effect similar to that of CBDC, and at the same time, there is a potential threat to financial stability. If a new GSC with an independent accounting unit appears (e.g. a new currency with a basket of currencies as a reserve), it can also provide better financial services, but it will have a more profound impact on global currency and financial stability.</p> Tips <p>This is what we’re sharing in this MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report, welcome to stay tuned for follow-up crypto stablecoin reports. We will provide you with more analysis of the development status, trends and international impact of stablecoins to help readers stay updated on the development status of stablecoin.</p><p>PS: MYKEY Lab has the final right to interpret the content of the article, please indicate the source for the quotation.

<p>Over the past few months Mydex CIC has been working for the Scottish Government on a project to test whether an ‘attribute led’ approach to public service provision can work. <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/05/13/digital-identity-scotland-prototype-draws-to-a-close/">The good news is: it can indeed work</a>, and that opens up a whole new world of opportunity for citizens, Government and service providers.</p><p>Under the approach we tested, public sector organisations provide individuals with verified attributes (details about them which have been checked using rigorous processes). Individuals store these attributes in their own Attribute (or personal data) Store, and can then share these attributes with other public sector service providers as and when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>We need this sort of approach because. when applying for and using public services, the personal data citizens need to provide can range over many different aspects of their lives, to some depth (in some cases). Creating the infrastructure for sharing verified attributes means that the right bundles of data can be put together quickly, efficiently and safely — in ways that protect the citizen’s data and privacy. (<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">Verified attributes are bits of information</a> about individuals that have been generated or checked by responsible organisations using robust, widely accepted processes.)</p><p>By equipping citizens with the means to accumulate and share this information in a safe, easy and secure manner it is possible to achieve significant reductions in friction, effort, risk and cost for both citizens themselves and service providers.</p><p>In the prototype work we tested all the independent components that need to work together to deliver a resilient, scalable system. This system is designed to place citizens at the centre of data sharing about themselves, empowering them with their own attribute store, with the ability to reuse verified data about themselves on an ongoing basis. Key areas of work included testing different ways of authenticating the identity of participants, ensuring the robustness of all necessary technical underpinnings (such as APIs), working with citizens to design user-journeys that are easy and intuitive, and addressing related communications issues.</p><p>For those interested in the details, <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Attribute-Prototype-Report-new.pdf">the full report is available here</a>.</p> Taking the next&nbsp;steps <p>Thanks to the success of this prototyping work the Scottish Government is now able to move on to the next stage:<a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/"> a ‘beta phase’</a> that will test the operation of this approach in practice. If this beta phase is successful, it could bring far ranging benefits to citizens, service providers and Government, making it much easier and cheaper for public services to be provided and used whilst improving outcomes and the speeding up of access to services citizens&nbsp;need.</p><p>But it also has bigger implications. The provision of Attribute Stores by which citizens can receive and share these Verified Attributes changes the architecture of personal data collection and use — moving it from a situation where service providers are the only ones gathering and storing the information they need, with citizens holding none of this information, to a situation where some of the data service providers need is stored separately from them (in the citizen’s Attribute Store) and accessed when needed. <a href="https://futurescot.com/digital-identity-service-could-be-used-from-birth-to-create-lifetime-records-for-every-scot/?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=97043733&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D1gas4oYmIQVhegdjVUK8L5-zuu18ngjg7HV6aIJE83InLTdOCiojxuOK0zStkqtr6tpUiDTsVe6V7OJH5hRz0PQ3ag&amp;utm_content=97043733&amp;utm_source=hs_email">For a press article on this, see&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>In the longer term, the creation of this new, independent layer of data sharing infrastructure could radically change how exactly how our digital economy works. What’s needed for this however, is an effective implementation strategy. We’ll discuss this in our next&nbsp;blog.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">Proving Verified Attributes Work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology is Now Officially a Technical Provider for Enterprise Solutions through Cointelegraph Consulting  May this be just the beginning. <p>For a thorough adoption of blockchain technology, the road must go through enterprises — this is something we have always known at Ontology, and with the recent addition by Cointelegraph Consulting to its technical provider list after a rigorous screening, we are more confident than ever that enterprise solutions will be a cornerstone to not just the success at Ontology, but the entire blockchain industry as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/advertise#:~:text=Cointelegraph%20is%20the%20leading%20media,million%20unique%20visitors%20per%20month.">With over 5 million unique visitors each month and over 17 million page views</a>, Cointelegraph has rapidly established itself as one of the media anchors in the blockchain space. But the readers it attracts aren’t merely traders, enthusiasts, or bitcoin fiends — rather, Cointelegraph has quietly established itself as a legitimate mediator between established enterprises and blockchain technology providers. As a result, a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/consulting">consulting arm</a> was launched that aims to “…connect the world between blockchain and traditional institutions of all sizes by bringing wider adoption of digital assets and enterprise-grade blockchain solutions through education and professional consulting services.”</p><p>In many ways, this match between Cointelegraph Consulting and Ontology was a predetermined match, as illustrated by the pre-existing enterprise case studies implemented by Ontology. The most recent example, with Daimler Mobility, saw the implementation of Ontology’s DeID to allow users to customize and personally manage their automotive experiences regardless of the car they’re sitting in. A decentralized identity solution is at the forefront of blockchain technology and provides unlimited potential for organizations since much of the digital trend these days revolves around data &amp; identity protection.</p><p>Another example of the pre-existing enterprise implementations is Ontology’s partnership with Kaiyun Motors and OGQ. By providing the technical support for a public chain, Kaiyun Motors has been able to store over 2 million data sets ranging from claims on autonomous vehicles, to real-time wear and tear data during last-mile logistics. Not only has this potentially saved lives on the road, but it has also possibly drastically cut down costs on claims and overdue maintenances for Kaiyun Motors. As for OGQ, Ontology’s public chain has recorded over 250 million pieces of digital asset content that have been uploaded on OGQ and granted over 14 million content creators to immutable possess their digital property such as emojis, images, videos, music, new fonts, stickers, and memes to&nbsp;fans.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.sagamarket.io/"> SAGA market</a> is another real-case application for Ontology’s public chain as over 200,000+ users and 10,000+ ecosystem partners rely on SAGA to access streams of decentralized data ranging from foreign exchanges to meteorology.</p><p>In addition to these in-depth case studies provided, Ontology also offers a series of enterprise solutions in the following sectors:</p>  <a href="https://ont.io/automotive">Automotive</a>: Component Authentication, simplifying the supply chain, and automating claim processes.  <a href="https://ont.io/marketplace">Data Marketplace:</a> Lowering transaction costs, adding a layer of security, improving data quality, and ensuring proper data&nbsp;access.  <a href="https://ont.io/attestation">Data Attestation:</a> Certification of data and identity, as well as providing proof of existence.  <a href="https://ont.io/finance">Digital Finance:</a> 5,000+ transactions per second, ONT ID to simplify the KYC&nbsp;process.  <p>Moving forward, Ontology will be <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/consulting/vendors">officially listed</a> on Cointelegraph’s vendor page, as will be the case studies we mentioned above in addition to others. By focusing on decentralized identities, Ontology is able to provide a wide range of use cases for enterprises of all sectors. This doesn’t even take into account the newly launched <a href="https://ontscore.com/">OScore</a>, a self-sovereign credit evaluation system based on user data stored on the Ontology blockchain — which also fully integrates with ONT ID to give users an added layer of identity protection, and control over who gets to access their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>We look forward to potential new use cases of implementing Ontology’s robust set of technical solutions for enterprise-grade problems.

  <p>With the increasing popularity of single-page apps and the growing API economy, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are becoming a very popular method for authenticating users. Rather than relying on the server to store the user’s state, JWTs encode information in a keyed payload stored on the client.</p>

<p>JWTs are not inherently less secure than server-side session storage. But developers should understand the tradeoffs and know what to do <a>if a JWT is compromised</a>. You should expire JWTs frequently and always <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/go/overview/">validate them before trusting them in your application</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re using JWTs properly, they provide several benefits. For single-page applications—where much of the heavy-lifting is done in the browser—JWTs make a lot of sense. Assuming the client can decode the JWT and verify its signature, it doesn’t need to make another trip back to the server to authenticate the user. JWTs also make sense for highly performant, globally-distributed server-side applications. By storing user information in the JWT, each node can authenticate the user locally rather than querying an authentication service on every request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll create a Laravel API that uses JWTs provided by <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> to authenticate users. You’ll use custom <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/middleware">Laravel middleware</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-php">Okta JWT Verifier package</a> to verify requests and restrict access to your API to authenticated users. If you’d like to download the final codebase, <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-laravel-jwt-example">it’s available on GitHub</a>. Otherwise, read on for the step-by-step process.</p>

 Using JWT Authentication to Secure a Laravel API 

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll use Okta to generate a JWT that allows users to call your API securely. You’ll then verify the JWT using Okta’s JWT Verifier package to ensure that users have a valid, non-expired token before they get your data. To keep this example simple, you’ll use a client credentials grant, but the same JWT returned in <a>standard Laravel authentication with Okta</a> would also work.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: Please ensure you have already installed PHP, Composer, and have signed up for a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">free Okta developer account</a>.</p>

 Setting Up a New Laravel Application 

<p>Before adding the API endpoints and authentication packages, you will need a fresh Laravel application with a database table and model. For this tutorial, you’ll create a <code>Location</code> model and database table that includes the names of several locations and their desirability on a scale of 1-10.</p>

<p>If you already have <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> installed, you can use it to create a new Laravel application from your command line:</p>

   <code>composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel okta-laravel-jwt
</code>   

<p>Then you’ll need to <code>cd</code> into the folder and install the dependencies.</p>

   <code>cd okta-laravel-jwt
composer install
php artisan key:generate
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This tutorial assumes you are using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x">Laravel 8</a>. While not considerably different from previous versions, you may notice some import paths have changed, so be sure to adjust this for your version of Laravel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Laravel abstracts away most differences between database providers, so you can use any database you like, but the simplest way to get started is with <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. To use SQLite, create a new file to house your database:</p>

   <code>touch database/database.sqlite
</code>   

<p>And update the <code>DB_CONNECTION</code> environment variable in your <code>.env</code> file to <code>DB_CONNECTION=sqlite</code>. Remove all the other <code>DB_</code> environment variables as you don’t need them for a SQLite connection.</p>

<p>Next, use the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/artisan">Laravel Artisan command</a> to create a new model and migration file:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:model Location --migration
</code>   

<p>You will need to allow mass-assignment of the <code>name</code> and <code>desirability</code> attributes on this model, so open up the <code>app/Models/Location.php</code> model file. Add the following <code>$fillable</code> property to the class:</p>

   <code>...
class Location extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'desirability'];
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you’ll need to add the model’s attributes to the database using the migration. Open up the new migration file Laravel created when you ran the above Artisan command. It should be the last file in your <code>database/migrations</code> folder. Modify the <code>up()</code> method to include the <code>name</code> and <code>desirability</code> fields:</p>

   <code>...
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('locations', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table-&gt;id();
        $table-&gt;string('name');
        $table-&gt;unsignedInteger('desirability');
        $table-&gt;timestamps();
    });
}
...
</code>   

<p>Commit the migration to your database using the migration Artisan command:</p>

   <code>php artisan migrate
</code>   

<p>Finally, before you build the endpoints for your API, you can create some default seed data using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/seeding">Laravel’s Database Seeder</a>. Open up the <code>database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php</code> file and replace the contents with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
namespace Database\Seeder;

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use App\Models\Location;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Seed the application's database.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        DB::table('locations')-&gt;truncate();
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Aruba', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Jamaica', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Bermuda', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Bahama', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Key Largo', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Montego', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the seeder via the Artisan command to reset the database and create the six new locations:</p>

   <code>php artisan db:seed
</code>   

<p>Your Laravel application, database table, and model are now ready. In the next step, you’ll add the API endpoints needed to retrieve, create, and delete data from this table.</p>

 Adding and Testing the API Endpoints 

<p>In a production application, you’ll probably want to create a controller to contain your API’s business logic. Because this is just a demonstration, you can do all the work in <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/routing">Laravel’s route file</a>. Open up the <code>routes/api.php</code> file and replace it with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Models\Location;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

Route::prefix('locations')-&gt;group(function () {
    Route::get('/', fn() =&gt; Location::all());
    Route::post('/', fn(Request $request) =&gt; Location::create($request-&gt;all()));
    Route::delete('/{id}', fn(int $id) =&gt; Location::destroy($id));
});
</code>   

<p>The first route will return all locations when <code>GET /api/locations</code> is called, the second will create a new location when <code>POST /api/locations</code> is called, and the third will delete a location based on the <code>{id}</code> you pass into the <code>DELETE /api/locations/{id}</code> call. To test these new endpoints out, start your local Laravel server:</p>

   <code>php artisan serve
</code>   

<p>You can use <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> or <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> to call each endpoint described above. For example, when I call <code>http://localhost:8000/api/locations</code> in Postman, I get the following JSON response back:</p>

   <code>[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Aruba",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Jamaica",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Bermuda",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Bahama",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Key Largo",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "Montego",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    }
]
</code>   

<p>Now that your API is set up, you are ready to add JWT authentication.</p>

 Adding the Okta JWT Verifier 

<p><a href="https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/middleware">Middleware</a> is usually the best place for custom authentication and request validation logic. In this step, you’ll create a new Laravel middleware, use the Okta JWT verifier to make sure the user has passed a valid JWT in as their bearer token, and add this middleware to all of the <code>/api/locations</code> routes described above.</p>

<p>First, install the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-php">Okta JWT verifier</a> package and its peer dependencies using Composer:</p>

   <code>composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt guzzlehttp/psr7 http-interop/http-factory-guzzle
</code>   

<p>The JWT adapter we’ll use is <code>firebase/php-jwt</code>, <code>guzzlehttp/psr7</code> provides HTTP interfaces for the API requests this library makes to Okta’s servers, and the <code>http-interop/http-factory-guzzle</code> adds PSR-17 support. The <code>guzzlehttp/psr7</code> library will be getting this <a href="https://github.com/guzzle/psr7/issues/327">support in version 2.0</a>, but in the meantime, the interop library allows you to fill in the missing pieces.</p>

<p>To use the JWT verifier, you’ll need a new Okta application with a Client ID and the Issuer URI of your Okta Authorization Server.</p>

<p>Log in to your Okta account and go to API &gt; Authorization Servers. Copy the Issuer URI and add it as the environment variable <code>OKTA_ISSUER_URI</code> in your Laravel application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To create a new server application, go to Applications and click the Add Application button in the top left. Select Service, Machine-to-Machine and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter a name for your application and click Next again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from this page and add them to your Laravel application’s <code>.env</code> file as <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET</code> respectively.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you have your Okta application and credentials, you are ready to use them to verify JWTs in Laravel. Create a new middleware using the Artisan command:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwt
</code>   

<p>Open up the new file at <code>app/Http/Middleware/VerifyJwt.php</code> and replace the contents with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;

class VerifyJwt
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Instantiate the Okta JWT verifier
        $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
            -&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
            -&gt;setAudience('api://default')
            -&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
            -&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
            -&gt;build();

        try {
            // Verify the JWT passed as a bearer token
            $jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());
            return $next($request);
        } catch (\Exception $exception) {
            // Log exceptions
            Log::error($exception);
        }

        // If we couldn't verify, assume the user is unauthorized
        return response('Unauthorized', 401);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>To use this middleware, you need to add it to your <code>Kernel</code> class and routes. Open <code>app/Http/Kernel.php</code> and add the following to your <code>$routeMiddleware</code> array:</p>

   <code>...
'jwt' =&gt; \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyJwt::class,
...
</code>   

<p>Next, open your <code>routes/api.php</code> file again and add the middleware to your <code>locations</code> route group:</p>

   <code>...
Route::prefix('locations')-&gt;middleware('jwt')-&gt;group(function () {
...
</code>   

<p>This applies the new middleware to every endpoint within the group, but you could apply it selectively to specific routes if you wanted.</p>

<p>Restart your Laravel application and try the endpoints again. This time, the API will return a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> response because you have not added a valid JWT to your request. In the last section, you’ll issue a JWT and use it to make requests to the API.</p>

 Issuing JWTs 

<p>Before you can issue a JWT and use it to authenticate users trying to access your new Laravel API, you need to create a custom scope in Okta to provide access. Go back to the API &gt; Authorization Servers page in the Okta Developer Console and click the pencil icon to edit the authorization server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Scopes tab and then the Add Scopes button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Give your scope a Name and Display phrase so you can identify it. In this example we’ll use <code>locations_api</code> for the scope name. Click Create when you’re finished.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that your Okta authorization server has a new scope specifically for your new API, you can get an access token with this scope. For demonstration purposes, you’ll use the Client Credentials grant to get an access token without user interaction. In a real application, you would likely have the application use an OAuth login flow and then issue the access token to the client application.</p>

<p>On the command line, use <code>curl</code> to get an access token, replacing the placeholder values in the command below with your own application’s client ID and secret:</p>

   <code>curl https://dev-XXXXXX.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d client_id=OKTA_CLIENT_ID \
  -d client_secret=OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -d scope=locations_api
</code>   

<p>When you run this command, Okta will issue an access token and return a JSON object which contains the JWT in a field called <code>access_token</code>.</p>

   <code>{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiI5b1o2N...",
    "scope": "locations_api"
}
</code>   

<p>Copy the value of the <code>access_token</code> field. Make a <code>GET</code> call to the <code>http://localhost:8000/api/locations</code> endpoint with the JWT in your <code>Authorization</code> header as a bearer token. In curl, the request will look like this:</p>

   <code>curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8000/api/locations' --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiI5b1o2N...'
</code>   

<p>Laravel will use the Okta JWT verifier you added to your new middleware to verify and decode your token. If it’s valid and not expired, you should see the same list of locations as you did before you added authentication to the app. The same bearer token can be used to access the  <code>POST</code> and <code>DELETE</code> endpoints until the JWT expires.</p>

<p>While this application used a machine-to-machine application to generate a JWT, you could use any Okta-issued JWT with the proper scopes to get the same access to the API above. This decoupling of authentication from your application logic is one of the most significant advantages of using a third-party authentication provider like Okta. It allows you to build scalable, distributed, and secure Laravel APIs.</p>

Everyone is pretty much focused on one thing right now. Today is election day in the U.S. And while for some, a result either way amounts to an existential crisis, for Big Tech, it doesn’t really matter who&nbsp;wins. <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-doesnt-much-care-who-wins-2020-election-5265548d-df6a-4a24-b387-1f0e147056ed.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The big picture: Individuals in tech are as passionate and fingernail-biting about Tuesday’s election as any other Americans. But the path ahead for the massive companies that have seized the industry’s reins over the past decade will only alter incrementally based on the polls’&nbsp;outcome.</blockquote><p>On regulations:</p><blockquote>Trump’s term saw a dramatic shift toward government action against tech firms. The Justice Department has sued Google, action against Facebook by states and the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly imminent, and investigations of both Apple and Amazon remain&nbsp;open.</blockquote>  These processes are all ostensibly non-partisan and theoretically unaffected by a change in administration.But in practice, a new attorney general could soft-pedal or even scrap the Google&nbsp;suit.  Democrats have their own reasons for pursuing action against the big companies — but unlike Republicans, they’re less focused on claims of censorship and more on the concentration of corporate power and the spread of misinformation.  <blockquote>The bottom line: Whoever wins the White House, scrutiny of tech’s allegedly monopolistic behavior will continue.</blockquote><p>A Biden presidency could see the issue of privacy elevated, but given everything else going on at the moment, don’t expect it to be a priority in the short&nbsp;term:</p><blockquote>Tech companies control the hardware and software that shapes our public and private communications, and that has placed them at the center of a million controversies.</blockquote>  We hold them responsible when their platforms become channels for misinformation and hate speech, and we blame them when their collection of personal data becomes intrusive or&nbsp;harmful.  <blockquote>Democrats have typically been readier than Republicans to favor stricter privacy rules and tougher controls on online misinformation, and if they win the White House and Congress, they might find ways to advance legislation that has long been&nbsp;stalled.</blockquote>  But a Democratic administration would have a long list of priorities ahead of such&nbsp;action.  <blockquote>Be smart: Some tech leaders — most prominently, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg — have practically begged the government to enact nationwide (and preferably lenient) nationwide laws on privacy and content moderation. They’d love to stop winging their way through one ethical minefield after another and just play by some standard, easy-to-follow rules.</blockquote><p>A Biden administration likely won’t focus as much on platform bans such as TikTok and WeChat, but tensions with China will continue and a divided internet is still on the&nbsp;table:</p><blockquote>The bottom line: Regardless of who wins the U.S. election, tech leaders expect U.S.-China tensions to continue, since each side sees the other as a long-term existential threat — but they also hope in the short term to keep getting what they need and selling what they&nbsp;can.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/trumps-campaign-website-hacked-by-cryptocurrency-scammers/">Trump’s campaign website hacked by cryptocurrency scammers — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/dutch-hacker-trump-twitter-account-password/">President Trump’s Twitter accessed by security expert who guessed password ‘maga2020!’ — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W85QiwL7qiU">Krystal and Saagar: The WORST Moments From The Big Tech Congressional Hearing</a>  <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/scoop-polls-show-support-for-tech-antitrust-action/">Scoop: Polls show support for tech antitrust action</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/for-tech-ceos-capitol-hill-is-now-mandatory-c0da9092-f9af-4e5c-a24d-04867979dccc.html">For tech CEOs, Capitol Hill is now mandatory</a>   2. And so regardless of who wins tomorrow (or whenever they figure out the results), there’s still a pandemic going on. 2021 will see us continue building on all the trends from&nbsp;2020. <p>Here’s Ina&nbsp;Fried:</p><blockquote>The big picture: As mentioned above, tech faces pressures on the privacy and antitrust fronts, but the pandemic has also accelerated the digitization of even the most change-resistant parts of society, including health&nbsp;care.</blockquote><p>And Karen&nbsp;Weise:</p><blockquote>“It is a ‘big, getting bigger’ moment in general we’re seeing. Which ties in, of course, to the antitrust focus and stuff that’s happening right now. The pandemic is obviously aberrational, but we’ve seen that everything reinforces existing patterns in many&nbsp;ways.”</blockquote><p>Nothing we didn’t already know. 2021 will be an exciting year for GlobaliD.</p> 3. If election results won’t have much of an impact on Big Tech’s path, a Biden win could hurt Facebook. <p>According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-facebook-has-the-most-to-lose-from-biden-democratic-victories">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>If Democrats sweep to power next week, as several pollsters predict, Facebook’s already lowly political fortunes are likely to take a sharp turn for the worse, Democratic congressional staffers and lobbyists say.</blockquote><blockquote>While the entire tech industry is fighting off demands by lawmakers for more regulation, Facebook is especially hard up for friends in Democratic circles, which could leave it on the outside as a possible Biden administration and Democratic Congress debate the future of the tech industry. Inside Facebook, some executives are bracing themselves for a tougher time if the political pendulum swings away from the Republicans, said a person familiar with the company’s thinking.</blockquote><blockquote>In recent years, Democrats’ ire toward Facebook has grown because of a perception that the social media app has become a conduit for President Trump and right-wing groups to spread disinformation and dehumanizing speech. They are still seething over Facebook’s failure to identify and block Russian actors from spreading disinformation to aid Trump during the 2016 presidential election.</blockquote><blockquote>“Facebook is seen as having sucked up to the Trump administration and had a profoundly negative effect on the culture of America and — in particular — of political dialogue,” said Blair Levin, a Washington-based policy analyst for New Street Research, a boutique Wall Street research&nbsp;firm.</blockquote><p>The end&nbsp;result?</p><blockquote>But a swing in political power to the Democrats could further minimize the company’s role in critical debates looming in Congress over the next year. Those debates are expected to include proposals to reform antitrust laws, aimed at making it easier for regulators to force tech companies to unwind their past acquisitions and to change the legal immunity that protects them from lawsuits over user-posted content. On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was among a handful of tech CEOs who appeared at a Senate committee hearing to discuss Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides that legal immunity.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-fb-3q-earnings-report-2020-11603992607?mod=djem10point">Facebook Posts Record Revenue Despite Ad&nbsp;Boycott</a>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2020-earnings-204642328.html?mc_cid=6fb48796ba&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">Facebook is losing users in the US and&nbsp;Canada</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-facebook-has-the-most-to-lose-from-biden-democratic-victories">Why Facebook Has the Most to Lose From Biden, Democratic Victories</a>   4. Speaking of Facebook, they recently launched their new streaming game app, but it won’t be available on&nbsp;iOS. <p>Because Apple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/26/facebook-launches-cloud-games-on-desktop-and-android-but-not-on-ios.html">won’t allow&nbsp;it</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook could bring cloud gaming to iOS if it enables the new product on the mobile web version of its service, but the company wants users to go to its apps instead, said Jason Rubin, Facebook’s vice president of special gaming initiatives.</blockquote><blockquote>“We don’t want people going to web Facebook 20 times a day. We have a great app,” Rubin said. “We would have to use Apple’s technology and browser on iOS, and that isn’t optimized to the benefit of cloud&nbsp;games.”</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook cloud gaming on iOS would allow iPhone and iPad users to find out what games their friends are playing, see lists that show top games on Facebook or play games with Facebook-unique features, Rubin&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“In many ways, consumers are being hampered,” Rubin&nbsp;said.</blockquote> 5.

That credential had to be acquired in a way that demonstrated consent, and presented for verification to a verifier in a way that allowed for selective disclosure of personal information. The solution had to support the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Verifiable Credential Data Model</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DID) standards/specifications</a>.

					 <p>As the developer platform for verifiable credentials, Trinsic has focused on abstracting the complexities of advanced open source technologies and protocols away into easy-to-use APIs &amp; SDKs used by hundreds of developers. We’ve also pioneered digital wallets in both technology and user experience, releasing the first wallet to achieve multi-vendor interoperability and introducing the iconic card-like UI which has other vendors around the world following suit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we are pleased to launch the next big innovation for our developers and mobile app users.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Introducing interactive connections 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>At Trinsic, we seek to provide developers with the best, most flexible tooling for implementing any use case. That’s why after <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">pioneering connectionless credential exchange</a>, we’re now pleased to support connections that are more useful and powerful than ever before. This brings flexibility and additional functionality to the hundreds of developers and companies that build on Trinsic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Current digital wallet implementations fall short of the vision of self-sovereign identity (SSI) because they only allow wallet holders to respond to, not initiate, interactions with institutions. This reduces wallet holders to a passive role, which at best delivers suboptimal utility to the holder, and at worst can reinforce the unhealthy power asymmetries between institutions and people that exist today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive connections solve this problem by creating a two-way street between a wallet holder and an institution. Instead of a passive responder, the wallet holder is a peer who can initiate actions of their own. In addition, wallet holders can interact not only with institutions, but also with other wallet holders, to communicate securely and share verified information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive connections are supported in the new Trinsic Wallet 3.1.0 release available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streetcred-identity-agent/id1475160728">App Store for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.streetcred.apps.mobile">Play Store for Android</a>. Like the other features in the Trinsic platform, interactive connections will continue to evolve over time based on the needs of our developer community. We’ve implemented four new features that help us get closer to the rich interactions people should expect with SSI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Proactive credential sharing  Interoperable chat messaging  Activity log  Connection invitation   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Sharing your credentials proactively 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Historically, wallet holders couldn’t share information from their credentials unless someone requested it through something called a verification request (or ‘proof’/’presentation’ request). That means you wouldn’t be able to share, for example, your business card with a new connection, or your address with someone who needed directions to your home, unless those people somehow conjured up a presentation request to send you first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can now share information from your credentials in a way that others can verify instantly conveniently from the Trinsic Wallet. When sharing credentials proactively, make sure 1) you and your connection are using the same network and 2) both of you have the Trinsic Wallet mobile app open throughout the credential sharing process.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Interoperable chat messaging 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Basic messaging functionality has been highly-requested ever since we removed messaging during our rebrand from Streetcred ID to Trinsic. It was a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">favorite feature of many</a>. Use cases range from the practical—eg., what if your name was misspelled in a credential offer—to the critical—developers in the UK and USA have created local contact tracing solutions using messaging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We chose to implement the feature using DIDComm—specifically the Aries Basic Message <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0095-basic-message">RFC 0095</a>—and display it in a chat-like interface on the Trinsic Wallet. That means messaging is interoperable between Trinsic and any other Aries-based implementations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Integrating communication and credential exchange tightly in a single experience ensures developers have the tools they need to create rich experiences with their users. The Trinsic API supports messaging (in beta) and has been used to send thousands of messages by a handful of developers. Our next release will include full messaging support in the API, SDKs, and documentation.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Activity log 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A historical log of activities with a given connection can now be found in the chat interface of the mobile application. You can view:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  messages you’ve sent or received  credentials you’ve shared or received  credentials others have shared with you  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our beta testers unanimously preferred embedding the activity inline with chat messages. At Trinsic, we frequently call upon familiar mental models to explain complex topics, like we did by introducing the credential card design to the market. Displaying historical credential exchange in a chat-like format invokes a similarly familiar mental model, making credential exchange even more accessible to people everywhere.</p>

					 <p>You can now connect with anyone by creating your own connection invitation. Instead of waiting for a QR code to scan, you can now create your own QR code. You can also send a connection invitation to someone through email, SMS, WeChat, or whatever your preferred method of communication is.</p>

   by Paul Fisher  Privileged Access Management (PAM) must evolve if it is to meet the demands of different types of organizations and IT architecture. A one size fits all approach does not work in a world where access to privileged accounts is changing.

 IDX and SkyDB join forces for a future of Web3 hackathon  The hackathon lasts through Nov.&nbsp;23 <p>In recent months, the Web3 ecosystem has seen an explosion of of new tools and platforms that allow developers to build mature, sophisticated dweb applications with functionality that was previously unimaginable.</p><p>To celebrate this evolution in Web3, <a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">IDX</a> is teaming up with <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skydb-a-mutable-database-for-the-decentralized-web-7170beeaa985">SkyDB</a> to kick off a hackathon which gives you the opportunity to experiment with and build applications that combine these two new technologies. Our teams are offering a combined $12,000 in rewards paid out in Siacoin (SC), and to make things even sweeter there’s a consolation prize paid out to every eligible submission.</p><p>The hackathon kicks off today November 2nd on <a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/skydb/onboard">Gitcoin</a>, and lasts for three weeks until November 23. Here’s how to get&nbsp;started:</p>  <a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/skydb/onboard">Register for the hackathon</a>  <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">Hop into the IDX Discord</a> and the <a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Sia Discord</a> for help or to share what you’re working on. We’re more than happy to help discuss your IDX integration with&nbsp;SkyDB.   Build apps on a next-gen Web3&nbsp;stack <p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skydb-a-mutable-database-for-the-decentralized-web-7170beeaa985">SkyDB</a> is a decentralized database system built on <a href="https://siasky.net/">Sia</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">IDX</a> is a decentralized identity system built on <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>. By combining these two technologies, developers can easily build full-stack, data-rich applications that give users direct control and full ownership over their information — all without running servers or siloing information to a particular key pair, application, or database technology.</p> SkyDB: A mutable DB for dweb&nbsp;apps <p>The SkyDB database allows developers to build any feature that requires a decentralized, mutable key-value store. Being able to store user and/or application data in a mutable but decentralized way opens up a world of new possibilities for dweb applications. You can use it to store user-generated content, files, media, application state, or any other type of dynamic information without worrying about managing one-off skylinks for each individual content update. For a quick-start intro to SkyDB, check out this blog post which makes a simple Skynet app that uses&nbsp;SkyDB.</p><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skydb-example-a-note-to-self-app-ccd4e7ba31ba">SkyDB Example: A Note-to-Self App</a></p> IDX: An open identity system for dweb&nbsp;apps <p>The IDX identity framework allows you to tap into a universal decentralized identity layer that makes user and data management for your dweb app much more open and powerful. IDX provides a universal cross-platform identity (DID) for users that can be used everywhere across the Web3 ecosystem, a way to store/access public metadata such as profiles and social graphs, a way to associate your app’s data storage systems (i.e. SkyDB) to the user’s identity, a way to discover and import available third-party data sources for the user (even ones outside of the SkyDB ecosystem such as Filecoin files, TextileDBs, OrbitDBs, and much more!), and a way to publish schemas for your data so that others might easily make use of your application data within another application or&nbsp;context.</p><p>By design, IDX is completely agnostic as to which wallet users authenticate with and which backend configuration you choose to build with — including any blockchain and data storage system — so it easily integrates into the rest of your stack and allows you to build truly cross-platform interoperable applications. You can save data wherever you choose, and import data from other applications that may even be outside of the SkyDB ecosystem!</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">IDX: A Devkit for Open Identity</a></p><p>// Good luck to all the hackers!

   Get Started With Our Identity Platform as a Service Checklist&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Every organization is looking to transition from legacy systems to a more modern IT infrastructure by leveraging cloud for cost savings, better user experiences, new revenue streams, and greater employee productivity. Why then have only 25% of organizations achieved their initial IT modernization objectives?&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.insightcdct.com/getattachment/cf7658e2-9678-496b-96e4-534094f3ccb5/The-2020-IDG-survey-ebook.aspx">IDG survey</a>, “The State of IT Modernization 2020,” organizations struggle to modernize, in part because they lack a clear strategy. Figuring out the best path forward is complicated. Most likely you’ve got a combination of competing priorities, outdated processes and tools, aging infrastructure, lack of in-house expertise, insufficient budget, and operational limitations around application development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Modernizing your identity and<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management"> access management </a>(IAM) toolset is no exception. Determining the best strategy to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">modernize IAM</a> and leveraging a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud IAM platform</a> can also be a challenge. Identity drives user experiences, engagement, and productivity. If done right, you defend your organization and users — whether employees or consumers — against compromised accounts and data breaches, as well as differentiate your organization by providing exceptional user journeys. So what steps can you take to modernize IAM while taking infrastructure into account? You can start here by reading our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/your-iam-future-in-the-cloud-checklist">Identity Cloud Checklist: Top 10 Considerations and Best Practices to Strategize IAM in the Cloud</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Don’t Compromise when Modernizing IAM&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>When it comes to modernizing IAM, many organizations settle for one of the following:</p>

  Switch to a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/evolution-idaas-saas-delivered-iam">IDaaS</a>-delivered IAM model built on simplicity and ease of use but supports&nbsp; limited use cases and cannot adequately support legacy, on-premises IAM systems, applications, and things.&nbsp; 
	 Stick with a legacy on-premises identity solution that offers fuller feature sets, but is complex, difficult to maintain, and offers no clear roadmap to get you to the modern security and useability features and functionality you ultimately need.&nbsp; 
	 Build an in-house cloud or hybrid solution – that is, if you have the skill set to build it and then keep maintaining and tuning it.&nbsp; 
	 Acquire multiple point IAM solutions that can only address specific use cases with no feature parity across deployment models, be it on-premises, private cloud, public cloud, hybrid, or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/multicloud-hybrid-cloud-identity-solution">multi-cloud</a>.&nbsp; 
 <p>All these options have shortcomings, and none can provide the enterprise functionality that you need to support users and secure on-premises and cloud applications at scale. Additionally, as priorities and strategies shift, you need an IAM solution that can move with you. Cloud has played a significant role in how organizations modernize and secure user experiences but cloud is not a one size fits all solution. Many organizations operate in a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">hybrid</a> world today, yet traditional options don’t make it easy for you to modernize. In fact, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3985689/understanding-cloud-data-management-architectures-hybrid">Gartner</a> states the majority of enterprises using data in the cloud will be living in a hybrid — and likely multicloud — deployment world for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>

 Planning for the Future 

<p>If you haven’t already, you should start thinking about how to future-proof your IAM strategy. Look for an IAM solution that can be <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">easily deployed across any environment</a> to fit business needs as they evolve. You should also think about use cases and business outcomes. For example, you might find that initially you need to secure identity for employees, and, later, for your workforce, consumers, citizens, and things.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tailoring your IAM solution for your industry is also important. For example, if you are in a regulated industry, you will most likely need an identity cloud solution that can coexist with on-premises solutions, provide true <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/107430026/whitepaper/forgerock-identity-cloud-security-whitepaper.pdf">data isolation</a>, enable fine-grained transactional <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/authorization">authorization</a>, and integrate with leading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network#trust-network-frm">anti-fraud solutions</a>. If you are in healthcare, you will need to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">manage identity relationships</a> – such as parent and child and doctor and patient – and incorporate these relationships into <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/profile-and-privacy-management-dashboard">access and authorization decisions.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>And, of course, overall functionality, security, feature parity, availability, vendor support, and cost must also be taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s lots to think about. Fortunately, we’ve taken the guesswork out of what to consider as you either start or evolve your identity strategy with our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/your-iam-future-in-the-cloud-checklist">Identity Cloud Checklist</a>.

B2B brands like DNV GL, a certification and accreditation firm, likewise ramped up its ability to conduct digital inspections for customers during lockdown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are just a few examples of the ways in which businesses accelerated digital business to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">respond</a> in the early days of the pandemic.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37577"]</p>
<p>“The onset of COVID-19 spurred rapid action to get digital commerce; contactless, remote customer relationships; remote learning; and working from home up and running within days and weeks,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/15859">Kristin Moyer</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “As Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) put it, ‘We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months.’”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">Why Now Is the Time to Accelerate Digital</a></p>
<p>CEOs and boards want to accelerate digital business. Moyer says, “Great, there’s momentum. But I’ve never spoken with an executive leading digital business who says they’re trying to go as slow as possible. The real question is, how do you go faster?”</p>
<p>Gartner has identified four digital business accelerators that will help executive leaders make faster digital business progress through quick fixes, smart tactics and new directions.</p>
<p></p>
 Tactic No. 1: Win different 
<p>The pandemic uncovered new customers and sources of demand for businesses. Some organizations pivoted to new products and opportunities using existing systems. Now is the time to explore new business models, operating models and platforms to operationalize those opportunities. To win differently over the short-, medium- and long-term, executives should employ:</p>

 Quick fixes 
 
 Interview customers about their current challenges and needs 
 Speak directly to end users through the service contact center 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Drive deeper digitalization and intelligence into existing products 
 Enable more contactless customer interactions on a continuum of 100% digital to 100% human 
 
 New directions 
 
 Set up a strategy think tank to explore digital opportunities that are adjacent to their core market 
 Create a “virtual global tour” video of what’s going on digitally in their industry 
 
 Tactic No. 2: Unleash force multipliers 
<p>A force multiplier is an action that powers momentum. Multipliers can come through internal actions, such as a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">business model innovation</a> workshop. They can also come through external actions, such as an acquisition that enables moves into new geographic or product markets. Force multipliers can include:</p>
 Quick fixes 
 
 Ask every board member to bring an example of a digital business that impressed them to the next supervisory board meeting 
 Host product digitalization creativity workshops 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Launch an open <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/">innovation</a> challenge focused on new digital product opportunities 
 Sketch an “anti-strategy” — state what your company won’t do and what it won’t be 
 
 New directions 
 
 White-label a product or service from a digital-native partner 
 Empower business technologists (employees outside of IT who have technical skills) with self-service, automation and reuse 
 
 Tactic No. 3: Banish drags 
<p>A drag is a negative internal or external force that adds friction to the business. Examples of external drags are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-invest-in-your-supply-chain-before-its-too-late/">supply chain disruptions </a>or government shutdowns. Internal drags include outdated processes or legacy systems. Ideas to banish drag include:&nbsp;</p>
 Quick fixes 
 
 Cancel large-scale, pre-crisis, non-digital programs&nbsp; 
 Fortify digital productivity by using crisis culture hacks focused on hope, belonging, agency and pride 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Use robotic process automation (RBA) to drive even deeper back-office automation 
 Shorten the decision distance by removing steps and intermediaries that come between experts and decision makers 
 
 New directions 
 
 Embed work design assessments into talent management activities to better sync work design with how work gets done 
 Formalize how processes can flex by creating boundaries for autonomy and proceeding with consent rather than waiting for consensus 
 
 Tactic No. 4: Redirect resources 
<p>The majority of CFOs report delaying capital investments. At the same time, they hope to redirect pandemic-related savings from areas like travel and entertainment to growth-oriented programs. Executives can recapture resources and redeploy them using tactics such as:</p>
 Quick fixes 
 
 Shut down marginal and low-volume non-digital channels or initiatives 
 Freeze enhancements to programs that will be less essential in a COVID world 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Shift more work from complex sourcing providers to gig workers 
 Create a talent marketplace to match internal skills to the initiatives that need them 
 
 New directions 
 
 Rightsize real estate leases and assets for a hybrid workforce 
 Sell legacy assets or business units that don’t align with the company’s digital future 
 Shift travel and entertainment savings to SaaS and cloud acceleration

The team at Meeco is excited to announce we rolled out major releases to our sandbox environment, publicly available SDKs, and other tools at the end of October. And drumroll please: we have released the new version of the <a href="https://dev.meeco.me/">Developer Portal</a>!




 




Among the features we’re rolling out, some of the highlights are detailed below. But first, we wanted to chat with Meeco’s Chief Product Officer, Jan Vereecken on why we’re developing these tools, our roadmap and his longer-term vision.




 Why is Meeco building developer-centric tools? 




Jan: Storing, retrieving and sharing data in a secure way is not easy. Right from its inception, this has been one of the focal points for Meeco. First of all, there are technical issues to solve but as a company, we are always thinking about the user experience.




<blockquote>We’re always asking ourselves… “we have the technology but what are the consequences for anyone that will use our technology?” <p></p></blockquote>




How can we create applications that behave in a very similar way as they do today but where privacy and security are built-in from the very foundation? Where raw data is only ever visible as close to the user as possible, namely on a device or computer running the web browser. Over the years we have been active in this space, we’ve built many applications for a variety of use cases, each time expanding, improving and refining our personal data management tools and products.




 




Last year, we had the chance to build the <a href="https://www.kbc.be/retail/en/products/payments/self-banking/on-your-smartphone/mobile/digital-safe.html">Digital Safe</a> for the Belgian retail bank <a href="https://www.kbc.be/retail/en.html">KBC</a>, which was awarded the <a href="https://kbc.be/bestbank">Best Bank </a>award for the fifth consecutive time. Just last week, Meeco was awarded a <a href="https://thefinnies.org.au/2020-finnies-award-winners/">Fintech Australia Finnie for Industry Collaboration and Partnerships</a> for this solution.



This focus on enabling our partners was how the idea of opening up our tools emerged. We wanted to make our internal tools available and release libraries that make it possible for other developers to build front end applications. Being able to integrate this capability with all the possibilities that come with it means more collaboration and better outcomes for people.<br>




<blockquote>“We want to position Meeco as a set of components that you can use in your product at make a better value proposition.”

</blockquote>




For me, it’s really important to eat our own dog food. Everything we release on the developer portal is used internally. The <a href="https://docs.meeco.me">Meeco docs</a> for example, is the first thing a developer reads when joining the company as it introduces them to the terminology and enables them experiment and develop an general understanding of what we are doing really quickly.




 




For us as a company, it is also a really good way to understand where we are missing certain information or when something is out of date. The idea behind it is actually dead simple, what is usable for us, also is for other companies.<br>




<blockquote>“For me, it is really important to eat our own dog food. Everything we release on the developer portal is used internally.” 



</blockquote>




Since launching the Developer Portal earlier this year, we have been delighted by the increasing interest from organisations and developers to build on our platform. More and more we hear that it’s the fastest way to manage the complexity of data privacy and make it simple to get started. We’re inspired by the organisation that want to tackle this problem in earnest. In the same way as a lot of people nowadays don’t start building their own database, logging infrastructure or cloud infrastructure, we want to position Meeco as a set of components that you can use in your product to make a better value proposition for people without asking them to trade their privacy for convenience. With our tools, it is possible to have both.








 What does this release mean for Meeco? 





<blockquote>“In scope, this change was truly massive. The team has been hard at work to make this possible and I believe it gives us a solid foundation to build upon.”





</blockquote>




Jan: I think this release, which is the 4th generation of our platform, emphasises our desire to open up the platform and invite others. We have been building and improving the software for quite some time and as a consequence we have a lot of experience in this space. Now we are making it easy for others to unlock the potential of our secure data vault, encryption tools and UI components.




 




This release opens up all of these possibilities for other developers to explore our product, read (in detail) documentation and make use of our tools. I always like to advise someone new to, at least, do the 15 minute <a href="https://docs.meeco.me/getting-started/quickstart">quickstart</a>. It allows you to create a new user account and save your first item to the vault. This seems trivial but if you read what is needed, there is actually a lot going on. The information is there, the code is there, the next step is simply to build. In scope, this change was truly massive. The team has been hard at work to make this possible and I believe it gives us a solid foundation to build upon.




 What other features are on the roadmap for Meeco? 





<blockquote>“Always, increasing security whilst focussing on usability. This combination is exactly what we are good at.” 

</blockquote>




Jan: We have a few really exciting upcoming features we are working on, but the ones I would like to point out are Delegated access, Meeco Identity Provider (Meeco IdP) and Wallet.




 





  Delegated access is a feature that allows users to do certain actions in another users’ vault. The first use case which uses this feature is the upcoming <a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it platform</a>, where grown-ups take control over what happens in the vault of their children. For example, how can mum and dad, both control what happens inside the vault of their child, while ensuring that all data is only every decrypted and encrypted on their respective devices. The tricky part here is the key management. You see, all encryption keys need to be shared between these users, without a middleman knowing that secret.  





 





  Meeco IdP is a service that we’ll extract out of existing services into a separate component. The goal here is twofold. On one hand, we are trying to simplify, where you’ll only need one access token to access all our services (vault, keystore, downloader) instead of a separate access token per service. On the other hand, we are also looking at better enterprise interoperability and tools that help us tap into standard flows (e.g. <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>). In our “lab”, we are also experimenting with the <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop">Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider DID profile</a> (SIOP), a new way to authenticate yourself in a new, more decentralised, world.  





 





  We are seeing more and more use cases that can be powered by the use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">DIDs</a>. We are building a decentralised Wallet that stores, verifies and presents these credentials to interested parties. The accelerated adoption that we are seeing cause of what is happening in 2020 is something that we are investing in heavily. Our existing services, Vault and Keystore are also complimentary as we have observed in market that people want more possibilities, increased security but still with a focus on usability. This combination is exactly what we are good at.  





 





 What is your long term vision for the developer tools? 




Our personal data platform developer tools are a core offering in Meeco. Our personal data platform and developer tools are a core offering in Meeco. We want to make the components available and make it easy to use and integrate our tools to enable people and organisations to collect and protect data. First and foremost, we test everything by building with it first. If it helps us create better security, enable more user control, provide privacy by default or seamless enterprise integration, then it makes sense it will also help our partners. I am confident that others will also find them as useful once they invest a few hours and see what is possible.




 




We’ll keep improving the portal, tools and resources based on the feedback that we receive, so we would love to hear from you. We trust that these changes will bring lots of exciting possibilities for developers all over the world to enable everyone on the planet to collect, protect and permission their personal data.




 




You can see a list of the upcoming changes for the October 2020 release<a href="https://docs.meeco.me/releases"> here</a>  including a high-level summary of new and updated features such as:




 





  On-sharing – the ability to allow other users to share an item that has been shared with you if the item’s owner allows it. This includes a verification step to make sure the on-sharer has not modified the data.  





  Organisations – you can now create an account for your organisation and add members and services.  





  Integration Engine – an open source project written in Elixir to work as a great starting point for you to automate your user connections and shares or just to use a reference for writing your own integrations in a language of your choice.  





  Accepting of shares – we’ve identified that sometimes the terms of a share need to be reviewed and explicitly accepted or rejected before seeing the data so we’ve now made this possible.  





  More efficient file attachments – we now have the ability to encrypt and upload an attached file one chunk at a time. This allows for handling of larger files, better performance on lower end devices, and even streaming of downloaded encrypted data into video players.  





  Improved Sharing – sharing is more streamlined, comprehensible and performant than ever before.  





  Sharing of encrypted files with other users.  





  Re-encrypting of shared data to cut down on the number of Encryption Keys needed to be stored/managed indefinitely.  




There are a range of other changes that will continue to be released between now and the end of the year. You will always find the latest information in our changelogs.




 




In the meantime, if you have any suggestions or queries please don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@meeco.me">info@meeco.me</a>, we look forward to hearing from you!

For this reason, we support a number of different decentralized identifier (DID) methods. While we are committed to providing optionality to our customers, it’s equally important to communicate the selection criteria behind these options so that customers can consider the tradeoffs of underlying DID-methods alongside the problem set they’re solving for. Essentially, we help them pick the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p> In the spirit of sharing and improving as an industry, here are the work-in-progress criteria we use to help customers assess what DID method is best for their use&nbsp;case:  Interoperability <p>This DID method meets the interoperability requirements of my business, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Other parties can verify my DID&nbsp;method.  I can switch out this DID method in the future if my business needs&nbsp;change.   Security <p>This DID method meets the security requirements of my business, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Approved cryptography for jurisdiction/industry  Ledger/anchoring preferences  Key rotation/revocation   Privacy <p>This DID method meets privacy requirements relevant to my use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Identifiers of individuals (data privacy and consent priorities)  Identifiers for companies (organization identity and legal protection priorities)  Identifiers for things (scaling, linking, and selective sharing priorities)   Scalability <p>This DID method meets the scalability needs of my business use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Speed  Cost  Stability/maturity   Root(s) of&nbsp;Trust <p>This DID method appropriately leverages existing roots of trust that have value for my business or network (or it is truly decentralized). For&nbsp;example:</p>  Trusted domain  Existing identifiers/ identity&nbsp;systems  Existing credentials  <p>We are currently using and improving these criteria as we co-design and implement solutions with customers.</p><p>For example, our commercial importer customers care a lot about ensuring that their ecosystem can efficiently use the credentials they issue (interoperability) without disclosing sensitive trade information (privacy). Government entities emphasize interoperability and accepted cryptography. Use cases that include individual consumers focus more on data privacy regulation and control/consent. In some instances where other standardized identifiers already exist, DIDs may not make sense as primary identifiers at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Examples of DID methods Transmute helps customers choose from today include: Sidetree Element (did:elem, Ethereum anchoring), Sidetree Ion (did:ion, Bitcoin anchoring), Sidetree Photon (did:photon, Amazon QLDB anchoring), did:web (ties to trusted domains), did:key (testing and hardware-backed keys), and&nbsp;more.</p> How do you think about selecting the right DID method for the&nbsp;job? <p>Let’s improve this framework together.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/did-customer-4ca8b7957112">did:(customer)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) promises to deliver innovation and value in every industry for a variety of use cases. It’s already picking up steam in financial services, healthcare, and government sectors around the world. But in order to get widespread adoption, sustainable business cases need to be developed—not just use cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our recent expert-panel webinar, “Making Money with SSI,” we dive in to the details of creating a business out of SSI from experts who’ve done it. Whether you missed the webinar or just want to refer back to the best parts, we’ve got you covered with a full recording. Scroll below the recording to view a highlight reel!</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Intro to the business of SSI 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Before we got into the meat of the webinar, Riley Hughes, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Trinsic, kicked us off by briefly defining <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) and discussing the business value of SSI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He began by simplifying human identity into two parts:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Intrinsic identity:&nbsp;This is what we see when we look in the mirror. It’s our gender identity, political identity, or cultural identity. It’s who we are in the context of our relationships with our closest confidants. It’s intrinsic to us and is the truest form of identity.  Extrinsic identity:&nbsp;This is how others, often institutions, identify us. A driver’s license is the most ubiquitous example. Although intended to prove your eligibility to drive on public roads, it is also how financial institutions, airports, and bars identify you. It works because institutions trust the DMV, and with a driver’s license, you always have the DMV vouching for you. And it isn’t limited to government ID—educational, professional, and membership credentials all work this same way.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Social sites, blogs, and other internet platforms help people express their intrinsic identity. However, up until now, there has not been a good way to share your extrinsic identity online. SSI is the answer to that problem because it reduces transaction costs of verification. Riley explains this concept in the video below.</p>

<p>Q1： Is there a guideline to Ontology node staking on&nbsp;ONTO?</p><p>A：Yes, please refer to the Ontology node staking guideline: <a href="https://node.ont.io/stake">https://node.ont.io/stake</a></p><p>Q2： What is the APY for Ontology node staking on&nbsp;ONTO?</p><p>A： There is no fixed APY for Ontology node staking because it can be influenced by many factors such as Ontology’s network operation, the proportion of node fee distribution, the number of users staking, or the current price of ONT and&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>Users can instead refer to the Last Round Rewards per 10,000 ONT (ONG) or calculate the expected staking yield with the Node &amp; Staking Yield Calculator: <a href="https://node.ont.io/calculator/staker">https://node.ont.io/calculator/staker</a></p><p>Q3： Are the staked assets on nodes&nbsp;safe？</p><p>A： Ontology has a complete node access, in addition to providing an exit and anti-evil mechanism, so the stability of each node is high. This makes the security of the assets users stake on nodes is also incredibly high.</p><p>Q4：How long does one staking round&nbsp;take？</p><p>A：Each node staking round is synchronized with an Ontology consensus round. You can view the progress of the current consensus round at <a href="https://node.ont.io/stake">https://node.ont.io/stake</a> and predict the remaining time of the current consensus round based on the speed of the previous consensus round. For a deeper understanding, the guideline provided takes the 107th, 108th, 109th and 110th consensus rounds as examples, with each round taking about 2 to 3&nbsp;days.</p><p>Q5： Are there limits on the node staking&nbsp;amount?</p><p>A:The minimum staking limit is 1 ONT. There is no maximum&nbsp;limit.</p><p>Q6： Will I be rewarded ONG immediately if I confirm the&nbsp;stake?</p><p>A：Being successfully confirmed in the round ‘T’ will result in the staking to take effect in the round ‘T+1’ and ONG rewards will start to generate at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>Users are able to withdraw the ineffective part of ONT assets at any time before the staking takes&nbsp;effect.</p><p>Q7： How much does transaction for node staking&nbsp;cost?</p><p>A： Confirming the stake and canceling the stake each require a 0.05 ONG transaction fee. Users need to confirm that there is sufficient ONG in their wallet to&nbsp;advance.</p><p>Q8： When can users withdraw the staking&nbsp;rewards？</p><p>A：If generated in the ‘T’ round, the staking rewards allow users to withdraw at the beginning of the round&nbsp;‘T+1’.</p><p>Q9： When will I receive the ONT if I cancel the&nbsp;stake?</p><p>A：</p><p>If the cancellation of staking on non-Consensus node occurs round ‘T’, users are able to withdraw the ONT at the beginning of the round&nbsp;‘T+1’.</p><p>If the cancellation of staking on Consensus node occurs in the round ‘T’, users are able to withdraw the ONT at the beginning of the round ‘T+2’ because the cancellation will confirmed by the Ontology network in the round&nbsp;‘T+1’.</p><p>Q10: Compared with the ONT staking services provided by other third-party trading platforms and wallets, what advantages does the node staking of ONTO wallet&nbsp;have?</p><p>A：Instead of setting up a centralized staking custody, ONTO’s node staking service enable users to receive the ONG rewards directly from the nodes, making ONTO much more&nbsp;safe.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-node-staking-on-onto-467d0dc71844">Everything you need to know about Ontology node staking on ONTO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Midsize enterprise (MSE) CIOs began 2020 leaning in to the need to equip their organizations for digital business with modern infrastructure and strategic use of automation. They still are doing so, but with more urgency, as the pandemic economy forces them to make the most of their people, platforms and data, and still protect the enterprise from security threats.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technologies cited in this Hype Cycle offer MSE IT leaders a high degree of benefit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“MSE CEOs are looking to technology enablement from technology, automation, business intelligence, data and digital, as the No. 1 way to improve productivity/efficiency within their organizations, says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/43526">Mike Cisek</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “The technologies cited in this Hype Cycle offer MSE IT leaders a high degree of benefit and applicability.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>The 41 technologies in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Midsize Enterprises, 2020 reflect these complementary priorities in IT, with a focus on three particular themes driving CIO investments.</p>
 
 Data-driven culture: CIOs are delivering the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-4-data-and-analytics-trends-for-midsize-enterprises/">data and analytics </a>infrastructure and capabilities business leaders need to understand and act on <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/data-sharing-is-a-business-necessity-to-accelerate-digital-business/">data-driven insights</a>. 
 Risk-based security: Trends related to remote worker and edge infrastructure have accelerated the need to strengthen security and simplify how IT teams deliver it. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-balance-risk-trust-and-opportunity-in-an-uncertain-world/">Risk-based security</a> allows CIOs to focus on high-priority areas of risk in an efficient and cost-effective way. 
 Infrastructure utility: Modernizing legacy infrastructure is a high priority for MSEs to enable <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/mitigate-the-challenges-of-remote-work-for-an-mse/">remote work</a> and higher productivity. Infrastructure utility solutions support distributed workloads to securely navigate between on-premises infrastructure and cloud-native architectures.

<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1iM2E0OWMzZTE3YmUxMWViYTlmNDBhMGQ2NmZkZGI0Nw=="></a></p>
 Workplace analytics 
<p>What is it? Insights about employee experience, engagement, collaboration and productivity, based on data from workplace applications, network traffic, user devices and other sources.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? Workplace analytics provide one input on the state of individual and team productivity and collaboration. Workplace analytics can offer insights about, for example, the business impact of a new tool or policy, or which team members are overburdened or underutilized. Challenges remain with how analytics solutions access and integrate data, and employee concerns about privacy can delay adoption.</p>
<p>Time is short. Enterprises are still working out how to best use workplace analytics, but the potential benefits are high and will drive rapid adoption over the next two to five years.</p>
 Citizen data science 
<p>What is it? Tools that automate aspects of data preparation, exploration, pattern detection and modeling to enable business users to get value out of data assets without needing an expensive and high-demand data scientist to do the work.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-mse-cios-guide-to-citizen-it/">Citizen data</a> science makes data insights more accessible and applicable across the organization, while helping to optimize the value delivered by scarce specialty data scientists. Citizen data scientists also contribute domain expertise to ensure data initiatives align with the needs of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the next two to five years, citizen data science will become more widespread</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citizen data science is an emerging capability that should transform how businesses design and deploy next-generation analytics and machine learning. Over the next two to five years, citizen data science will become more widespread as BI and data science platforms add more augmented analytics capabilities.</p>
<p>Look for collaboration opportunities between specialist data scientists and citizen data scientists, and work to educate and advocate with business units about user enablement, responsible use, data ethics and other key issues.</p>
 Managed detection and response (MDR) 
<p>What is it? A 24/7 security threat monitoring, detection and response service that leverages advanced analytics, threat intelligence and human expertise to prevent or minimize security breaches. MDR technologies and deployments currently focus on network and endpoint security, as well as monitoring the cloud.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-9-security-and-risk-trends-for-2020/">Gartner Top 9 Security and Risk Trends for 2020</a></p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? MDR services allow enterprises to secure their networks and reduce the complexity of identifying and investing in the right mix of in-house people, processes and technology. MDR solutions<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-strategic-cost-optimization-action-items-for-security-leaders/"> provide particular value for organizations</a> that want a single, turnkey solution or that lack the internal resources to respond to threats when they occur. MDR may not be right for businesses that have already invested in point solutions for network security, such as endpoint detection and response.</p>
<p>MDR solutions will continue to mature and increasingly deliver high value over the next two to five years.</p>
 Firewall as a service (FWaaS) 
<p>What is it? A multifunction security solution delivered as a cloud-based service to protect multiple satellite offices or remote users. FWaaS provides a more flexible and centralized way to deliver enterprise firewall features to multiple locations.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? FWaaS gives distributed organizations an efficient way to deliver secure internet connectivity to all work sites (including remote work sites). FWaaS competes with secure web gateways and web application firewalls to achieve many of the same aims. Interest in FWaaS will grow over the next two to five years as solutions integrate more closely with SD-WANs and prove consistently good latency across all endpoints.</p>
 Hybrid cloud 
<p>What is it? A combination of integrated public and private cloud services that operate as separate entities. Distinct from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-organizations-choose-a-multicloud-strategy/">multicloud</a>, which is the use of two different cloud service providers, hybrid cloud includes some enterprise-managed infrastructure with the addition of service integration, cross-service security, availability/disaster recovery and other useful capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? Hybrid cloud theoretically combines the cost optimization and flexibility benefits associated with cloud with the control and compliance capabilities of private infrastructure. About 10% of MSEs have implemented hybrid cloud for availability/disaster recovery purposes, but that number is expected to grow rapidly. MSEs seek to optimize their resources as they explore new business opportunities that require flexible infrastructure. Expect high benefit from this still-immature technology.</p>
 Hyperconvergence 
<p>What is it? Designed for IT leaders who want simplified solutions, hyperconvergence is a building-block approach to deploying software and infrastructure. Hyperconvergence vendors use off-the-shelf infrastructure and packaged software, which they can deliver as a service or in a public cloud.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? Hyperconvergence is attractive to enterprises seeking IT management simplicity. Hyperconvergence allows IT teams to deliver or add functionality more frequently through modular solutions, instead of requiring business stakeholders to wait for less frequent but bigger upgrades.</p>
<p>The acquisition cost of hyperconvergence may be higher than for three-tiered compute, storage and networking implementations, but the management efficiency is often better, leading to faster response times. MSEs can eventually expect lower operational costs, especially if they standardize on hyperconvergence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This post was authored by Dev Bharel, who helps lead the SSI initiative at GlobaliD.</p>The opening circle at&nbsp;IIW<p>Last week, GlobaliD attended the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW), a longstanding biannual (un)conference that focuses on building collaborative environments where developers can share ideas and work on open industry standards together.</p><p>The idea of an unconference is a reference to the event’s unique format, where rather than having a set agenda, participants huddle together every morning to define the topics and sessions of the day (typically socratic style conversations).</p><p>Free of business interests, you’ll often see direct competitors collaborating on the latest and greatest standards in the industry. Talks can range from very technical machinations (such as of Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) to more socially focused talks about how to build a more Ethical Digital&nbsp;World.</p><p>All of which culminates in a highly influential gathering that has been the birthplace of frameworks such as OpenID Connect along with tons of other identity technologies.</p> GlobaliD and&nbsp;SSI <p>Attending on behalf of GlobaliD were myself, Dev Bharel, and Alexis Falquier. We are <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> architects who have been working on the initiative of migrating GlobaliD to open SSI standards, namely Hyperledger Aries and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> is an umbrella organization under the Linux Foundation that houses a number of open source projects. The two projects of note for identity are Indy, an identity specific blockchain and Aries, a framework to build cross-chain identity agents that interact with verifiable credentials and decentralized identity documents (DIDs).</p><p>Alongside Hyperledger, there are also a number of nonprofit organizations that participate in conversations involving these open standards — the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>, all of whom have hosted various working groups around the interoperability of these standards across the wider digital landscape.</p> GlobaliD’s open source SSI frameworks <p>GlobaliD led two sessions at IIW to showcase some select&nbsp;work.</p><p>In our first session, we open sourced our iOS and Android native Aries frameworks and donated them to the Hyperledger Aries project. These frameworks can be used by any organization to create mobile native Aries agents to receive and hold verifiable credentials. The frameworks are the result of months of intense work at GlobaliD to incorporate Aries agents into our platform.</p> GlobaliD Groups for SSI governance <p>In our second session, we unveiled our Dynamic Governance API using GlobaliD Groups. Employing GlobaliD Groups addresses the challenge of dynamic governance on an Indy-based chain. By dynamically managing membership lists using Groups, verifiers of credentials no longer need to worry about the nitty gritty of issuers within their organizations. All they need to know are the key parent organizations they want to accept credentials. This is especially helpful as issuer lists grow and as individuals join and leave those organizations.</p> Stay tuned for&nbsp;more! <p>We had a blast at IIW31. We’ll be publishing a series of blog posts in the coming weeks highlighting our time at the conference including a deep dive into Governance and Guardianship as it applies to self-sovereign identity.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7">GlobaliD shares SSI code at the Internet Identity Workshop</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Mike Kubzansky, CEO, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>2020 has challenged and consumed us — as individuals and as a society. From the pandemic to politics, to the severe economic downturn and the desperate cries for Black lives to matter; too many across the country and around the globe are struggling — financially, physically, and mentally.</p><p>We are at times scared, or angry, or resigned, and a pervasive sense of helplessness underpins so much of current daily life, across whole swathes of society. Yet so many people have remained remarkably resilient and resolute. We have donned our masks and taken to the streets to peacefully protest, help at food banks, or simply serve as poll watchers. We have prayed, meditated, eaten (and then tried to exercise) our way through this year of chaos and uncertainty. Several of us even got new kittens or&nbsp;puppies.</p><p>While everyone has different coping mechanisms, there is one thing I hope we all do:&nbsp;vote.</p><p>As political scientist Larry Sabato said, “Every election is determined by the people who show up.” Whether it’s by mail, drop box, in person, early, or on election day (masked, of course), we must all show up. We believe deeply in democracy. It is the bedrock of this nation, and it will only be of, for, and by all the people if we all vote. That’s why Omidyar Network signed <a href="http://adayfordemocracy.com/">A Day for Democracy</a> pledge to give our staff in the US time off to vote and do their civic&nbsp;duty.</p><p>And when voters do their civic duty, their votes must be counted. We are proud of the work of our sister organization, <a href="http://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>, and many of our grantees like <a href="http://communitychangeaction.org/">Community Change Action</a>, <a href="https://demosaction.org/">Demos Action,</a> <a href="http://citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>, and <a href="http://jwj.org/">Jobs With Justice</a> for their ongoing efforts to dismantle barriers to voting, so that everyone who is eligible can vote with ease — <a href="http://www.protecttheresults.org/">and can trust that election outcomes are legitimate</a>, so that we have genuine majority rule by a full and fully empowered electorate. It’s also why I signed on to <a href="https://medium.com/world-justice-project/a-joint-appeal-to-protect-the-rule-of-law-in-the-2020-u-s-elections-1f1f6876b351">World Justice Project’s letter</a>, along with a number of other foundation presidents, demanding that the rule of law is protected to ensure the security and integrity of the elections.</p><p>We cannot let expediency outweigh accuracy. We must be patient as election officials do their jobs and count every vote, even if it takes extra time before a winner is declared. Ensuring that every vote is counted will enhance the legitimacy of the election and strengthen our democracy.</p><p>While democracy is not a focus area for Omidyar Network — nor is improving its functioning our mission — it weaves through much of our work to strengthen technology and the economy. And pluralism, if true to its ideals, should have spillover benefits that improve democracy.</p><p>In Responsible Technology, we know that online platforms with outsized power can ravage our democracy by allowing unfettered hate, bigotry, racism, antisemitism, and disinformation to run rampant. We support organizations leading the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">#StopHateforProfit</a> campaign to call on Facebook to change its policies that inflame intolerance and undermine democracy. We also support <a href="https://graphika.com/">Graphika’s</a> investigations into domestic disinformation and potential foreign interference in the 2020 election, as well as its partnership with the <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/">Election Integrity Partnership</a>, which identifies instances aimed to “prevent or deter people from voting or to delegitimize election results.”</p><p>In our call to <a href="https://omidyar.com/our-call-to-reimagine-capitalism-in-america/">reimagine capitalism</a>, we recognize that democracy and the economy are fundamentally intertwined. We cannot address one without taking into account the other. Concentrated economic power too easily spills over into political power. That has resulted in policies that prevent the economic interests of the many from being fulfilled. We are working to address these imbalances, and support communities, working families, and small businesses to have greater power and voice in the economic decisions that impact their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>We also cannot reflect on American democracy without reflecting on race. The US is still not living up to its democratic ideal in which all people are created — and treated — as equal. In addition to the continued horror of the 164 Black individuals who have been killed by police through August, we see every day continued work <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/poll-prri-voter-suppression/565355/">to disenfranchise and suppress voting by Black and brown voters</a>. So it’s not surprising that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/us/election-nonvoters.html">some voters drop out of the system and choose to simply not participate</a> — real change has been too slow to&nbsp;come.</p><p>We know that change won’t always happen as quickly as we would like — or many times need — but it will happen. Voting is the first step on this journey toward a more just and equal&nbsp;future.</p><p>As President Obama said in Philadelphia at a rally last week, “Voting’s about using the power we have, and pooling it together to get a government that’s more concerned, and more responsive, and more focused on you and your lives and your children, and your grandchildren, and future generations. And the fact that we don’t get 100% of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we’ve got to vote, and then get some change, and then vote some more, and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it&nbsp;right.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/keep-voting-until-we-get-it-right-88e3cb4611ab">Keep Voting Until We Get it Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/schuetze">Christopher Schuetze</a></p><p>15 to 20 years ago, a virus scanner&nbsp;– or let me call it Endpoint Protection&nbsp;– on your private or corporate computer was standard. Today, you must also have something like a virus scanner on your endpoint device. But in 2020, is it sufficient to detect viruses, worms, and rootkits or botnets like we did in the past? There have been a lot of changes in the way attackers try to steal data, get access to your computers, or even block you from working with your computer. This evolution must be part of your strategy for protecting your endpoints. It is called Endpoint Protection, Detection and Response (EDPR) – adding Detection and Response to your virus scanner.</p>
 Scanning suspicious files based on a signature is dead 
<p>I hope you agree that when it comes to endpoint protection, a classic virus scanner alone is no longer enough in the fight against the "bad guys". Anti-malware is necessary, but you need a lot more besides. And yes, security for endpoint devices plays a central role in your overall security strategy – you might also call it “Zero Trust” strategy. Endpoints today are way more than traditional PCs and notebooks. It is any device you interact with, including computers, virtual desktops, servers, smartphones, tablets, and IoT or SCADA devices. They all must be part of your strategy to prevent harm to your organization.</p>
<p>Investing into a single tool that can detect malware based only on patterns is very outdated because attackers are now focused on collecting data from your organization or blackmailing you via a ransomware attack. Attackers are continually trying to trick your employees into clicking on links to enter their credentials on a manipulated website or to download malware to get access to your organization. Your strategy must cover this, and EDPR meets this requirement.</p>
 Protection means to detect before, during, and after the execution 
<p>Protecting an endpoint is a broad field, and with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, it is changing a lot. Real AI is much more efficient in detecting creatively implemented malware which might use exploits and change its signature frequently. Detection at runtime is essential, but difficult. Traditional tools focus more on pre-execution detection based on a static signature of a piece of malware.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Looking more at the behavior of a malware and having tools which help to detect an attack, even after it happened, is also important. If attackers are currently in your system and preparing a bigger attack by infecting your servers with ransomware, for example, this needs to be detected. This is called post-execution and typically involves forensic analysis to enable organizations to respond to an attack even after it has begun.</p>
 The focus of such tools must be understood 
<p>Defining the broad range of use cases to protect an endpoint can be overwhelming at first. In light of this, it could be useful to consider the following:</p>
 
 Protecting your endpoints with a combination of detection and prevention features. The local agent should be able to prevent an employee from executing a compromised file, as well as be able to detect malware post-execution, based on more complex detection mechanisms. 
 Threat intelligence features should detect threats based on the behavior of the threat and knowledge from other attacks and be able to respond automatically to such an attack to prevent further harm to your organization. 
 Advanced alerting and reporting mechanisms can help to identify the health state of endpoints on a central dashboard and be able to react to threats by collecting relevant information. 
 
<p>Do you use already use tools like this in your organization? Is the device you are currently using part of this protection strategy?

  <p>If you’ve been an engineer for any considerable time, you’ve probably made some mistakes that made you want to crawl under your desk and hide. You may have even considered packing up your desk!</p>

<p>In the spirit of the greatest holiday ever (Halloween), the Developer Advocacy group at Okta has shared some of their scariest engineering stories.</p>

 Exploit Explorer 

<p>Back when I still ran my own physical servers, 10 or more years ago, the word was going around about a new Linux kernel exploit that could be used to let a local user gain root privileges by running a carefully crafted binary. It turns out it affected many kernel versions and there was a good chance that any machine online at the time was vulnerable. It required local access to the machine, it wasn’t something that could be run remotely, but it was still a pretty big deal given how common it was for people to share access to physical servers.</p>

<p>I never liked dealing with kernel upgrades on my servers since it was a pretty lengthy process that inevitably resulted in more downtime than I would like, so I decided to check if my machines were vulnerable to this and only upgrade them if they were. In order to test if they were vulnerable, I decided to actually run the exploit proof of concept code, since that seemed to be the fastest way to find out, and since these were machines I already had root access on it seemed like a perfectly reasonable way to test this out. A couple of my machines were not vulnerable, the exploit code just failed silently (probably because I was a few kernel versions out of date and the bug hadn’t been introduced yet!), but on one of the machines I tried, it worked! My normal user account was suddenly logged in as root! Excited, I started writing up an explanation of what just happened, including all the commands and the console output as part of the process. I ran the exploit code again so I could get a clean screenshot, but this time instead of getting me root access, the entire machine crashed!</p>

<p>And that’s how I brought down several dozen production websites at an organization too large for me to be willing to name in this blog post.</p>

 Apologies for “HaHa”ing Up Your Desktop 

<p>When I was attending university, I lived on campus in the dorms and became friends with the group of guys that lived next to me. All of us were computer science majors and had a shared interest in computers, video games, etc. They were great!</p>

<p>At the time, I was writing a lot of software in AutoIt, a scripting language that allows you to build native Windows applications. One day, while working on a project and searching for information on developer forums, I stumbled across some cool information: Windows XP allowed you to automatically run software on a USB thumb drive or a CD-ROM when it was inserted by simply specifying what the file is.</p>

<p>In the spirit of chaotic fun, I wrote a simple AutoIt program that ran in the background and created millions of folders on the desktop titled “ha1”, “ha2”, etc. I then packaged this program up to run automatically on a USB thumb drive and shared it around the dorms with my buddies as a joke. They’d insert the USB drive, not notice anything happening, only to later discover their desktop was cluttered with empty folders that served no purpose.</p>

<p>I thought it’d be funny.</p>

<p>Little did I know, by inserting the thumb drive into their computer, not only would the program run automatically, but it also wouldn’t stop running unless the process was explicitly killed. Removing the thumb drive didn’t stop the process from executing.</p>

<p>Because of this, several of my friends continued using their computers like normal until eventually, they got a BSOD because their disk was so fragmented with hundreds of millions of 0-byte folders that NTFS broke and they had to completely reformat their computers 🙁</p>

<p>What started off as a stupid, innocent joke ended up being an absolute nightmare. It’s still something I regret to this day! I apologized right away, but still feel terrible that my stupid joke ended up costing my buddies so much time to recover from 🙁</p>

 It All Depends on the <code>/usr</code> 

<p>In 1995, I helped launch the SciFi (now Syfy) channel’s first website (earliest link from Internet Archive is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970106060027/http://www.scifi.com/">1997</a>). It was running on a Sun Sparcstation 20 knockoff, which sat on the edge of a desk connected to a 56k line.</p>

<p>It was very limited on space, so, in an effort to make more space available for content, I wanted to thin out the /usr folder, which had a lot of unnecessary, large files in it.</p>

<p>As the root user, I started with:</p>

   <code>mkdir /usr.new
cd /usr.new
cp -p -r ../usr .
</code>   

<p>(which, temporarily doubled the space <code>/usr</code> was taking up)</p>

<p>I pruned out everything that was unnecessary from /usr.new. Here’s what I wanted to do next:</p>

   <code>mv /usr /usr.orig
mv /usr.new /usr
</code>   

<p>Maybe it would have worked if I had done it as one command? Maybe not. Solaris was finicky in those days.</p>

<p>As soon as I did: <code>mv /usr /usr.org</code>, all hell broke loose.</p>

<p>This is because all the important stuff that made Solaris work was dynamically linked to libraries buried in /usr.</p>

<p>So, the (new) website was non-responsive. Basic commands like <code>ls</code> were non-responsive.</p>

<p>I had to quickly boot the machine into maintenance mode off of a number of floppies and restore <code>/usr</code>. Thus, was my first lesson in website downtime and not mucking around in production.</p>

 Somebody Get Me a Master Boot Record 

<p>In ancient times, people recognized that some parts of the world were best left alone. These places were described as “forbidden”, “haunted”, or “possessed” and rumored to be the domains of unseen spirits and mystical powers. Legends would tell of places where visitors would lose a sense of time, places that would slowly make people sick. I have spent a lot of time in some of those places. We know them today as “datacenters”</p>

<p>A data center is a building that is optimized for the comfort of computers and this makes for an environment that isn’t ideal for humans. Data centers are large, cavernous rooms, filled with row after row after row of computers. In most data centers, the rows will alternate between “cold” and “hot”. The computers face the cold rows and exhaust the air into the heated rows. It’s easy to lose track of time when inside a data center because they are lit only by artificial light. Also, because the temperature difference between the cold and hot rows can be so extreme, you can start to feel unwell if you keep moving between 70ºF and 90ºF every few minutes.</p>

<p>My story begins after I had been inside one of these timeless, sickening places. I had been spending several hours performing maintenance on some critical servers. The work I was doing was the critical, yet dull and forgettable kind of system maintenance work that everyone must do from time to time. It was dull enough that I don’t even remember precisely what I was doing. What I do remember is that at one point. I made a critical mistake. Instead of typing:</p>

   <code>dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdd
</code>   
<p>I had typed this instead:</p>

   <code>dd if=/dev/sdd of=/dev/sda
</code>   

<p>Did the mistake pop right out at you? It didn’t to me either. Not until a few seconds later when I was filled with a sharp sense of dread. Instead of making a backup of the boot drive (<code>/dev/sda</code>) to the backup drive (<code>/dev/sdd</code>) I had instead started copying the backup drive to the boot drive. I had canceled the operation fast enough that I knew that the data was still there. But the computer wouldn’t boot because I had overwritten the boot sector. I tried rebooting the machine to check. It didn’t boot. I started to panic. What was I going to do? Would I need to copy the entire hard drive somewhere else to recover the files? Where would I find a drive big enough to do that? How long would that take? I was already exhausted and unlikely to be able to spend several more hours working on the problem. Then it struck me: All of the servers started from the same image, so they all likely had the same boot sector.  All that I would have to do, in theory, would be to copy the boot sector from one machine to the one I had erased. After making some hasty calculations about how many bytes I’d need to copy, I once again used <code>dd</code> (very very carefully) to copy the boot sector of one computer to an external drive, then I used that external drive to copy the boot sector onto the computer that wouldn’t boot. I tried it, rebooted the machine, and waited anxiously. The computer booted just fine. I was free to return to the land of the living this time around.</p>

 Subversion is Maven Me Crazy! 

<p>About 10 years ago, I was performing a release on the Apache Maven Indexer project and I deleted the project. There was an issue with the release, so I rolled it back, in doing so I deleted the remote SVN directories. Don’t worry it’s source control, I could revert the change and push it back up. The problem with this is it would take a long time to copy from my computer. Luckily someone shared some “SVN-fu” with me, and I was able to restore the code with a remote copy within a few seconds.  I felt like a fool, but I learned a ton about Subversion that day, so it was a fair trade.</p>

  <p>The CEO of Australia's national science agency knows that innovation is the key to a post-pandemic future. COVID-19 accelerated&nbsp; digital business and transformed working habits.</p>
<p>“Australia has been at least 10 years behind the U.S. in digital,” said Dr. Larry Marshall, Chief Executive of CSIRO, <a href="https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2020/business-must-reinvent--not-just-recover.html">in a recent article</a>, “but I would argue that because of COVID, Australia has accelerated at least five years in the last five months.”</p>
<p>Despite the challenging environment, many organizations are capitalizing on changes made during COVID-19 to<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/"> reset long-held habits</a>, chase new opportunities or redesign their businesses.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>The 2020 Gartner CEO Survey showed that CEO priorities shifted this year due to the current climate, but<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ceos-look-for-growth-opportunities-in-2019-ceo-survey/"> growth remains at the top</a>. Technology is now seen as one of the key levers that CEOs will use to recover and grow in 2021.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scale up the digital mainstream, but don’t push experimental extremes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The majority of CEOs are expecting revenue levels to recover in 2021 or 2022,” said<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18594"> Mark Raskino</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst and Gartner Fellow, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/apac/symposium-australia/">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>“Even if demand for some products or services has risen as a result of the crisis, it’s often not the kind of growth that’s needed for stability, to reinvest or to give people raises. CEOs want to restore growth that delivers a good profit margin,” Raskino said.</p>
<p>CIOs can help their CEOs achieve their top priority in three ways.</p>
 No. 1: Accelerate smoothly 
<p>The Gartner CEO Survey found that the crisis has led 65% of CEOs to focus more on accelerating digital business transformation. However, they no longer aspire to be digital pioneers. Instead, they will focus on mainstream digital initiatives like e-commerce, e-service, digital payments and digital working.</p>
<p>“Scale up the digital mainstream, but don’t push experimental extremes,” said Raskino.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cios-ask-3-questions-before-updating-strategy-post-pandemic/"> CIO strategy</a> must also exploit factors that can<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/"> accelerate digital</a> business, including greater customer acceptance of digital, the pool of available dislodged talent; and more amenable workforces that are flexible to change.</p>
 No. 2: Nurture people 
<p>Keeping, developing and retaining the workforce is a top priority for 58% of surveyed CEOs to enable a strong recovery. CIOs must introduce agile learning into their organizations and invest time and resources in allowing people to grow.</p>
<p>CIOs should also empathetically help executive team colleagues to deliver on CEO demands. That means supporting:</p>
 
 The CFO by timing technology spend to aid cash flow 
 The COO with technology to improve productivity 
 The CHRO to develop a digitally savvy workforce 
 The CMO to execute technology-driven marketing campaigns 
 
 No. 3: Rebuild better 
<p>Sixty-four percent of CEOs surveyed will use the pandemic as an opportunity to redesign the business. CIOs need to know which path their CEO is on — restore or redesign — and ensure the IT strategy supports the new vision.</p>
<p>“Reappraise which new technologies matter most as you plan a different future,” said Raskino.</p>

  <p>In this keynote we are looking at practically moving existing infrastructures towards the Decentralized Identity world – widely known as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Leveraging the Credential-based Access Control (CrBAC) paradigm, implementing SSI in an enterprise is easier than most people think. We will learn why and how SSI is such a bright way out of the complex and interwoven IAM world still predominant today, more than 11 years after “Dos and Dont´s when Introducing a Compliance Management Tool” in a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) context at EIC 2009.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_22_kudra"></a>

 Celebrating early-adopter suppliers of data from health, IoT, AI, and&nbsp;more <p>Ocean Market is now live, offering new opportunities for data owners to monetize their data while preserving privacy and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Whether personal data such as browser history data or latent business data that companies have accumulated over time, Ocean Market helps unlock and monetize it in a secure&nbsp;fashion.</p><p>As with many emerging technologies, early-adopter data suppliers in Ocean Market stand to&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>First, assets registered early will attract more buyers and stakers since the Ocean Market still has a relatively small amount of inventory.</p><p>Being part of the first batch of data suppliers on Ocean Market increases the chances that the suppliers’ data assets will be discovered for consumption and/or staking. This in turn will improve the overall asset ranking (by stake) and could lead to an increase in the overall value of the dataset now and over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Second, early stage data providers will be among the first to gain insights and track data consumption and value patterns.</p><p>Early stage data providers will start earlier on the path in gaining a deep understanding of this new breed of data monetization.

<p>Enterprises across the globe have been trying to minimize and remove passwords for years. Security is an obvious reason why, as attacks featuring lost or stolen credentials account for<a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/2020/results-and-analysis/"> 80% of breaches</a>. Productivity also is a factor, since the amount of time your employees spend each year entering, resetting and keeping track of passwords wastes time and drains resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite such valid concerns, for many companies getting rid of passwords has been more a stretch goal than a reality—but that’s about to change. Passwordless adoption no longer requires a significant hardware investment to get started, with advancements in multi-factor authentication (MFA) device-level biometrics like facial and fingerprint recognition providing alternatives to passwords. And many employees who are familiar with these technologies outside of work are aware of their speed and ease-of-use benefits, and therefore are more receptive to using them in the workplace.</p>

  <p>WebSockets is a technology for communicating between the client and the server in a web application, where an open socket creates a persistent connection between the client and the server. This method of communication works outside of the HTTP request/response paradigm that has existed since the earliest days of the internet. Since sockets don’t use HTTP they can eliminate the overhead that comes with HTTP for low latency communications.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a small chat room web application that will keep track of the users in the room and send messages using WebSockets. For the server, you will use Express on Node.js. Node.js is an event-driven JavaScript runtime that has made JavaScript one of the most popular back end languages. Express is the most popular web framework for Node.js. You will also learn how to set up Okta for authentication. To authenticate the socket communication, you will issue a JSON Web Token (JWT) to the client, and validate it when the client attempts to open the socket.</p>

 Create Your Okta App 

<p>To use Okta for authentication, you will first need to set up a new application. (You will need a free <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer account</a> if you don’t already have one.) Head to the Okta Developer Console and select Applications then Add Application. On the next page, select Web and click Next. On the Application Settings page, give your application a meaningful name. I called my SocketDemo. For this application, you can leave everything else the same, as you will use port 8080 in your application. Click Done and you will be redirected to the settings page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make note of your Client ID and your Client Secret, since you will need this in your application.</p>

 Create Your Node.js Application 

<p>Start by opening your favorite IDE and use the command <code>mkdir</code> to create a folder for your project. Navigate to that folder and enter the command <code>npm init</code>. You will need to walk through the instructions that follow. Next, you will want to install your dependencies.</p>

<p>First, you will need Okta’s Node.js SDK and the OIDC middleware. These two packages make integrating Okta’s authentication into your application simple. It’s easy to configure the middleware, but you will do that later. For now, install the packages with the following commands.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/oidc-middleware@4.0.1
npm i @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@4.1.0
</code>   

<p>Next, install <code>dotenv</code>, which will store and retrieve sensitive configuration without pushing this information to your source code repository.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to install Express.</p>

   <code>npm i express@4.17.1
</code>   

<p>You will also need <code>express-session</code> to help manage your session state.</p>

   <code>npm i express-session@1.17.1
</code>   

<p>Next, install <code>jsonwebtoken</code> to help create JWTs that you will issue to your client.</p>

   <code>npm i jsonwebtoken@8.5.1
</code>   

<p>To manage the sockets, you will use <code>socket.io</code>. For validating the JWT in your socket management, you will use <code>socketio-jwt</code>. You will see later how these two connect to authenticate your socket requests.</p>

   <code>npm i socket.io@2.3.0
npm i socketio-jwt@4.6.2
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will need <code>pug</code>. Pug is a view engine that was previously known as Jade.</p>

   <code>npm i pug@3.0.0
</code>   

<p>Once you are all set up, add a new file to your root directory called <code>.env</code>. Add the following code to it. You can change your <code>JWT_TOKEN_KEY</code> to something more fitting if you wish.</p>

   <code>OKTA_BASE_URL={yourOktaUrl}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
APP_BASE_PORT=8080
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
JWT_TOKEN_KEY=someverylongandveryrandomandverysecretkey
</code>   

 Write Your Server Code 

<p>Now you are ready to begin writing your server-side code. First, add a file to your root called <code>index.js</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

require( "dotenv" ).config();

const server = require( "./server" );

const port = process.env.APP_BASE_PORT;

server.start( {
  port: port
} ).then( app =&gt; {
  console.log( "Application is now running on port " + port );
} );
</code>   

<p>This file serves as your entry point for the application. It starts the server by listening to the port defined in your <code>.env</code> file. It also calls the <code>config()</code> function on <code>dotenv</code>, which should be called as early as possible in your application.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>rooms.js</code>.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

module.exports = function () {
  let rooms = [];

  rooms.push( {
    name: "General",
    users: []
  } );

  rooms.push( {
    name: "Sports",
    users: []
  } );

  rooms.push( {
    name: "Music",
    users: []
  } );

  return rooms;
};
</code>   

<p>This file is just in-memory storage for your chatrooms. In a production application, you would want to connect this to some sort of persistent storage but this solution works fine for this demo. You start by providing three default rooms—General, Sports, and Music. Each room consists of a name and a list of users. The lists are empty when the application first starts but they will be populated as users visit each room. You could also keep a list of messages here so that new users could view the history.</p>

<p>Next, you can define your routes. Create a new file called <code>routes.js</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

module.exports = function ( app, opts ) {

  function ensureAuthenticated ( request, response, next ) {
    if ( !request.userContext ) {
      return response.status( 401 ).redirect( "/account/login" );
    }

    next();
  }

  app.get( "", ( request, response, next ) =&gt; {
    return response.render( "home" );
  } );

  app.get( "/dashboard", ensureAuthenticated, ( request, response, next ) =&gt; {
    return response.render( "dashboard", {
      user: request.userContext.userinfo,
      rooms: opts.rooms
    } );
  } );

  app.get( "/chat/:room", ensureAuthenticated, ( request, response, next ) =&gt; {
    return response.render( "room", {
      jwt: opts.jwt.sign( { user: request.userContext.userinfo, room: request.params.room }, process.env.JWT_TOKEN_KEY ),
      room: opts.rooms.filter( ( r ) =&gt; r.name == request.params.room )[0]
    } );
  } );

  app.get( "/account/logout", ensureAuthenticated, ( request, response, next ) =&gt; {
    request.logout();
    response.redirect( "/" );
  } );

  app.get( "/account/login", ( request, response, next ) =&gt; {
    return response.render( "home" );
  } );
};
</code>   

<p>As you can see we are defining a few routes here. First is the home page, second is the Dashboard page which will be the landing page for authenticated users. To ensure a user is authenticated you add the <code>ensureAuthenticated</code> middleware function to the route. This function is defined above and simply returns a 401 for unauthenticated users and redirects them to the login page. The chat route looks for a route parameter called <code>room</code>. This means a user who navigates to <code>~/chat/General</code> will land in the general chat room. This route also creates a JWT and passes it to the client, using the <code>jsonwebtoken</code> object that was injected into the routes. There is also a logout route for logging out. (The login route will be configured using Okta in the server setup later.)</p>

<p>Next, you need to set up your <code>socket.js</code> file to handle the socket communications. Create the file in your root and add the following code.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

const socketioJwt = require( "socketio-jwt" );

module.exports = function ( io, opts ) {

  io.sockets.on( "connection", socketioJwt.authorize( {
    secret: process.env.JWT_TOKEN_KEY,
    timeout: 15000 // 15 seconds to send the authentication message
  } ) ).on( "authenticated", function ( socket ) {
    socket.on( "entered", () =&gt; {

      let user = socket.decoded_token.user.name;
      let room = socket.decoded_token.room;

      opts.rooms.filter( ( r ) =&gt; r.name === room )[0].users.push( user );
      socket.join( room );

      io.to( room ).emit( "user entered", user );
    } );

    socket.on( "message sent", ( message ) =&gt; {
      let user = socket.decoded_token.user.name;
      let room = socket.decoded_token.room;

      io.to( room ).emit( "message received", user, message );
    } );

    socket.on( "disconnect", () =&gt; {
      let user = socket.decoded_token.user.name;
      let room = socket.decoded_token.room;

      opts.rooms.filter( ( r ) =&gt; r.name === room )[0].users.splice( user, 1 );

      io.to( room ).emit( "user exited", user );
    } );

    let users = [];

    users.push( {
      user: "test"
    } );

    socket.emit( "welcome", users );

  } );

};
</code>   

<p>Here you are using <code>socketio-jwt</code> to decode the JWT you passed to the client when the user enters the room. A JWT is a token whose payload holds some information representing claims to be sent to the server. The JWT can be signed or encrypted and then validated by the server to ensure their validity. Once established, the server can read the claims from the token and decide the proper course of action. You can send the JWT with the request to the server to ensure the sender of the request is authorized to perform the requested action.</p>

<p>(Note, you can read more about <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/07/17/secure-node-api-with-koa">an alternative approach using Okta as an authentication server a</a>, where you authenticate the user when they reach a room.)</p>

<p>The <code>socket.js</code> file also has the logic for receiving and sending messages as well as handling users entering and leaving the room. When a user enters or leaves, you add or remove them from the room’s user list and broadcast to the room that the user has left. The client side is responsible for displaying that information to the user.</p>

<p>Finally, to tie it all together you need to add a <code>server.js</code> file.</p>

   <code>"use strict";

const express = require( "express" );
const bodyParser = require( "body-parser" );
const path = require( "path" );

const ExpressOIDC = require( "@okta/oidc-middleware" ).ExpressOIDC;
const session = require( "express-session" );
let jwt = require( "jsonwebtoken" );

const routes = require( "./routes" );
const sockets = require( "./socket" );

const start = function ( options ) {
  return new Promise( function ( resolve, reject ) {
    process.on( "unhandledRejection", ( reason, p ) =&gt; {
      console.log( "Unhandled Rejection at: Promise", p, "reason:", reason );
    } );

    if ( !options.port ) {
      reject( new Error( "no port specificed" ) );
    }

    const app = express();
    const http = require( "http" ).createServer( app );
    const io = require( "socket.io" )( http );

    var rooms = [];

    app.use( express.static( "public" ) );
    app.set( "views", path.join( __dirname, "/public/views" ) );
    app.set( "view engine", "pug" );

    app.use( bodyParser.urlencoded( { extended: false } ) );

    app.use( function ( error, request, response, next ) {
      console.log( error );
      reject( new Error( "something went wrong" + error ) );
      response.status( 500 ).send( "something went wrong" );
    } );

    const oidc = new ExpressOIDC( {
      issuer: process.env.OKTA_BASE_URL + "/oauth2/default",
      client_id: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET,
      appBaseUrl: process.env.APP_BASE_URL,
      scope: "openid profile",
      routes: {
        login: {
          path: "/users/login",
        },
        callback: {
          path: "/authorization-code/callback",
        },
        loginCallback: {
          afterCallback: "/dashboard",
        },
      },
    } );

    app.use(
      session( {
        secret:
          "asd;skdvmfebvoswmvlkmes';lvmsdlfbvmsbvoibvms'dplvmdmaspviresmpvmrae';vm'psdemr",
        resave: true,
        saveUninitialized: false,
      } )
    );

    app.use( oidc.router );

    var rooms = require( "./rooms" )();

    routes( app, {
      rooms: rooms,
      jwt: jwt
    } );

    sockets( io, {
      rooms: rooms
    } );

    const server = http.listen( options.port, function () {
      resolve( server );
    } );
  } );
};

module.exports = Object.assign( {}, { start } );
</code>   

<p>This file does a lot of the legwork getting the application set up. When the server is started, it registers your various middleware and dependencies. This includes the Okta middleware, which uses the variables in your <code>.env</code> file. It will register the route <code>/users/login</code> as the login page. This page is hosted by Okta and will manage the authentication for you.</p>

 Create Your Pages and Client-Side JavaScript 

<p>With the server code complete, it’s time to turn your attention to the client. You will have three distinct pages and one layout page. First, you can add your <code>layout.pug</code> page to the <code>public/views</code> folder.</p>

</code>   

<p>You are importing Bootstrap because it is nice and easy to work with. There’s a login button that checks the view model for a <code>user</code> object. That object is populated on the server and passed to the view. If it doesn’t exist then the user is shown the login button.</p>

<p>Next, you can provide a landing page for your users. Add a new file to the <code>views</code> folder called <code>home.pug</code>.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Chat about Things'

block content

    p Hey there, in order to access this page, please
      a(href="/users/login") log in here.
</code>   

<p>Next, add a page called <code>dashboard.pug</code> to the <code>views</code> folder for authenticated users. This page will display a list of available rooms to the users.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Let's chat about something'

block content
  .row
    .col-lg-3
      h3 Chat Rooms
      ul.list-group
        each room, i in rooms
          li.list-group-item
            a(href="chat/"+room.name ) #{room.name}
    .col-lg-9
      .jumbotron
        h1 Join a chat room
        p.lead You can check out our chat rooms on the left
</code>   

<p>Finally, add your <code>room.pug</code> file to the <code>views</code> folder. This page will have the chat room itself along with any JavaScript you need.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Chat'

block content

  script(src="..\\js\\room.js")
  script.
    start('!{jwt}')
</code>   

<p>You are using two JavaScript scripts on this page. The first is the <code>socket.io</code> client library. The second is a file named <code>room.js</code>. Add <code>room.js</code> to <code>public/js</code> and insert the following code.</p>

   <code>const socket = io.connect( window.location.origin );

function start( jwt ) {

  socket.on( "connect", () =&gt; {
    socket
      .emit( "authenticate", { token: jwt } ) //send the jwt
      .on( "authenticated", () =&gt; {

        socket.on( "user entered", ( user ) =&gt; {
          $( "#chat-table" ).append(
            "&lt;tr class=\"bg-info\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;" + user + " has entered the chat room. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"
          );

          let li = "&lt;li class=\"list-group-item\"&gt; " + user + " &lt;/li&gt;";
          $( "#users-list" ).append( li );

        } );

        socket.on( "user exited", ( user ) =&gt; {
          $( "#chat-table" ).append(
            "&lt;tr class=\"bg-warning\"&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;" + user + " has left the chat room. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"
          );

          $( "#users-list &gt; li:contains(\"" + user + "\")" )[0].remove();
        } );

        socket.on( "message received", ( user, message ) =&gt; {
          $( "#chat-table" ).append(
            "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=\"width:20%\"&gt;" + user + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;" + message + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"
          );
        } );

        $( "#chat-button" ).on( "click", function () {
          let message = $( "#chat-message" ).val();
          socket.emit( "message sent", message );
          $( "#chat-message" ).val( "" );
        } );

        window.onunload = window.onbeforeunload = () =&gt; {
          socket.close();
        };

        socket.emit( "entered" );
      } )
      .on( "unauthorized", ( msg ) =&gt; {
        console.log( `unauthorized: ${ JSON.stringify( msg.data ) }` );
        throw new Error( msg.data.type );
      } );
  } );
}
</code>   

<p>This file manages all the user connections and messages between clients. When a remote client performs an action in the room, it’s broadcast to each other client. <code>socket.on</code> will take care of these messages and manipulate the client in whatever way you see fit. When you want the server to be made aware of an action this client took, you use <code>socket.emit</code> to broadcast the message back to the server. Of course, right when the page loads, you are authenticating the user with the JWT you supplied earlier. This ensures the socket communication is secure.</p>

 Test Your Application 

<p>Your application is complete and ready for the first test. Use the command <code>node index.js</code> to start your server and navigate to localhost:8080 to see your home page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log in using Okta and navigate to a room of your choice. You can open another instance of the browser and log in to see your second user enter the chat room. You can send messages back and forth and see how each room will handle them.</p>

<p></p>

 Summary 

<p>WebSockets provide exciting new opportunities for web applications by bucking the age old request/response paradigm. But with this new technology, developers need to continue practicing secure coding techniques. By combining JWT with Okta’s secure and easy single sign-on ecosystem, you can ensure the safety of your users without inflating your development time.</p>

  <p>Around the world, corporate offices sit empty. In 2019, Gartner predicted that by 2023, fewer than one-third of digital workers would select the corporate office as their preferred place to work. Now, surveys show that 48% of employees will work remotely some or all the time post-COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will not return to pre-COVID ways of working</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Empty office space is a stark example of the long-term impact that COVID-19 will have on workplaces globally, said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/38244/Gavin-Tay">Gavin Tay</a>, Gartner VP, Analyst during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/apac/symposium-australia">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“We will not return to pre-COVID ways of working,” said Tay. “CIOs need to decide what the future digital workplace will look like and ensure that their organization has the technology foundation to support it.”</p>
<p>The future of work demands our attention in three interconnected areas.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-trends-on-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-the-digital-workplace-2020/">6 Trends on the Gartner Hype Cycle for the Digital Workplace, 2020</a></p>
 The hyperautomation of routine work 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021/">Hyperautomation</a> is the idea that any processes that can be automated should be automated.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has accelerated the notion of using algorithms or "<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/robobosses-enhance-management-capabilities/">robobosses</a>" to automate management activities including task assignment, collecting feedback determining performance ratings. Gartner predicts that 69% of what a manager currently does will be fully automated by 2024.</p>
<p>Ride-sharing platforms like Uber, Grab and DiDi already allocate tasks to drivers and collect customer ratings to measure performance, automatically determining rewards or sanctions if required.</p>
<p>“In the future only two sets of tasks will remain for managers: Strategy setting, which requires creativity; and advanced team management, which requires social skills,” said Tay.</p>
<p>Unilever has been<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/25/unilever-saves-on-recruiters-by-using-ai-to-assess-job-interviews"> hiring entry-level employees using artificial intelligence</a> (AI) to analyze responses to preset interview questions using keywords and body language, saving more than 100,000 hours of interviewing time and roughly $1 million in recruitment costs.</p>
 Digital dexterity becomes critical 
<p>Many employees prefer to use familiar tools like email. They know how to create documents using an office suite of tools and store them on their local drive. New systems cause them stress, so they often end up using old tools to solve new problems.</p>
<p>Continuous technology change leaves workers no time to learn new systems. AI can help to bridge the digital dexterity gap with just-in-time learning on the job.</p>
<p>In 2015,<a href="http://www.hitachi.com/rev/archive/2016/r2016_06/pdf/r2016_06_106.pdf"> Hitachi introduced AI in its warehouse operations</a> to guide workers and aid continuous personal improvement, a concept known as "<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/kaizen">kaizen</a>" in Japan.</p>
<p>“If you understand how employees like to learn, you can reduce stress and increase productivity, which has a direct impact on corporate revenue,” said Tay.</p>

 The on-demand workforce becomes the norm 
<p>Circumstances have made remote work a basic requirement for almost all organizations, whether they planned to embrace it or not. In the future of work, CIOs will need to consider how technology can sustain a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/master-a-distributed-workforce-for-digital-transformation/">distributed workforce</a> model that reaches beyond the restrictions of a traditional office environment and may be dispersed across geographies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaders must be prepared to change hard-wired processes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of taking weeks or months to find the right skills, organizations will need the ability to dynamically assemble teams at short notice, matching tasks with the required knowledge, experience, skills and competencies. Samsung, for example, piloted the use of online freelancing platforms to assemble project teams in as little as two days.</p>
<p>“An on-demand workforce will become the norm,” said Tay. “Leaders must be prepared to change hard-wired processes to derive maximum value.”</p>

  <p>Earlier in 2020, the European Union published “A European Strategy for Data” outlining its vision for a connected single digital market where the benefits of the digital economy could enhance the lives of its citizens, residents and trade partners.</p>
<p>However, we now find ourselves at a very real crossroad. A post-pandemic world will be a new type of normal. Amidst the tragic loss of lives there have been breakthroughs in science, new ways of working along with embracing new digital tools.</p>
<p>We are at the beginning of a new design and architectural phase where just because technology can, doesn’t mean it should. Personal data linked to identity, fuelled by AI sits at the centre of these decisions.</p>
<p>Enabling citizens, students, patients, passengers and consumers to more equitably join the value chains fuelled by data will ultimately lead to greater trust and personalisation, resulting in a more prosperous society. However, this will require new commercial models, enforceable regulation and the digital tools to transform our connected society.</p>
<p>This session will focus on the implementation of real-world case studies including standards, commercial models and technology choices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_21_dow"></a>

<p>At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Province of New Brunswick in Canada needed to enable digital access to COVID-19 test results. Simeio, working with New Brunswick’s Provincial healthcare arm MyHealthNB delivered a digital identity solution. This enabled secure access which was validated against authoritative data sources to proof identity. This also allowed New Brunswick citizens to stay safe and practice social distancing by obtaining results securely and confidentially. <br> <br> COVID-19 has driven healthcare organizations to enable virtual support and digital tools in a short window. For the foreseeable future in a world of physical distancing, the need for digital services will drastically increase. Digital Identity is at the core of enabling this shift as it facilitates secure access.</p>




<p>Healthcare organizations are the most vulnerable from a modernization perspective due to years of lack of investment and focus. The COVID-19 pandemic has put added strain for hospital organizations to modernize and shift their mode of delivery to virtual care. This session will speak about a use-case that highlights challenges a Canadian Province faced and what tools and solutions were developed to deliver expedited access the COVID-19 test results in 18 days.</p>
<p><br> Participants will learn:<br> 1. How COVID-19 has driven healthcare organizations to enable virtual support and digital tools <br> 2. How the Province of New Brunswick in Canada enabled digital access to COVID-19 test results<br> 3. How Simeio worked with the Province to deliver a digital identity solution which deployed secure access to COVID-19 results in 18 days</p>

  <p>With the July 2020 decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the „Privacy Shield“ called framework that allowed personal information to be transferred between the EUC und the US; had been invalidated with immediate effect. The only remaining justification to keep on exchanging such information have been the „Standard Contractual Clauses“ (SCC, although they do not fully replace the Privacy Shield. Therefore, the questions now are:</p>
 
 Where do Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) come into the game? 
 Can SCC fully replace the Privacy Shield? 
 Are there Alternatives? 
 Do I need to perform an immediate Risk Assessment?&nbsp; &nbsp;

   A Flexible, Adaptable Architecture Framework to Meet the Accelerating Demands of a Digital Enterprise 
<p>Consumer identity and access management (CIAM) has arrived in the business processes of digital enterprises. Customers, prospects, devices, things and their relationships are becoming increasingly important. At the same time, the innovation cycles for customer-oriented applications are becoming shorter and shorter. And CIAM itself is facing continuously changing challenges.</p>
<p>The service-oriented paradigm of the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric provides the perfect foundation for a steady evolution. This applies both to the CIAM system itself and to CIAM as a building block of a company-wide identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>Thus the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric serves as the umbrella for an entire IAM architecture. It supports distinctive features for CIAM where required, while ensuring efficiency and reuse wherever possible.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_22_reinwarth"></a>

<p><br>Many solutions in CIAM focus on authentication, while others have their strengths in integrating with marketing automation. However, there is an additional angle, relevant for both highly regulated industries but also any other industries. It is the onboarding process, regardless of whether specific KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements must be formally met or not.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger will talk about the role and approaches of Identity Verification in the context of CIAM and how this maps to the entire onboarding process as well as recurring authentication. He will look at new technologies such as DID (Decentralized Identity), but also discuss how registration can be simplified if lesser requirements apply – e.g. by rethinking the flow and putting registration and verification to the end (or even further back – think about using the first successful shipping as part of verification).</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_21_kuppinger"></a>

 The GiD Report#132 — Facebook antitrust, the fight against end-to-end encryption, and crypto goes mainstream <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-131-filecoins-launch-what-the-original-iphone-teaches-us-about-innovation-a29d7bbe3584">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p>  Facebook antitrust lawsuit&nbsp;incoming  The fight against end-to-end encryption  Crypto goes mainstream in&nbsp;2020  Stuff happens   1. Hot on the heels of the Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google, state and federal investigators are now setting their sights on Facebook. <p>The Washington Post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/23/facebook-ftc-states-lawsuit/">reports</a>:</p><blockquote>State and federal investigators are expected to file antitrust charges against Facebook as soon as November, according to four people familiar with the matter, embarking on a massive legal challenge against the tech giant and its perceived ironclad grip over social&nbsp;media.</blockquote><blockquote>The timing reflects a frenzy of recent activity on the part of the Federal Trade Commission, which met privately Thursday to discuss the probe, and state attorneys general, who under the leadership of New York’s Letitia James have been scrutinizing Facebook for potential threats to competition, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a law-enforcement matter.</blockquote><p>Some context:</p><blockquote>Federal officials initiated their antitrust probe into Facebook last year after the company agreed to pay $5 billion to settle a government probe over a series of privacy scandals. The FTC, one of the country’s two competition enforcement agencies, specifically set its sights on Facebook’s purchase of its past rivals — Instagram, a photo-sharing app, and WhatsApp, a messenger service — and the extent to which the tech giant’s sprawling corporate footprint has come to violate antitrust laws.</blockquote><blockquote>State investigators revealed their own plans last October: James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, said at the time she would lead 46 other states and territories in a bipartisan, wide-ranging antitrust inquiry targeting Facebook. James said in a statement then that state enforcers had grown “concerned that Facebook may have put consumer data at risk, reduced the quality of consumers’ choices, and increased the price of advertising.”</blockquote><blockquote>Since then, Facebook has faced a slew of criticism from regulators nationwide who believe it brazenly has sought to expand its digital empire in a way that undermines competition and leaves its billions of users with worse service, including fewer privacy protections. A probe conducted by House lawmakers, concluded earlier this month, appeared to furnish fresh evidence of the company’s brass-knuckled tactics — illustrating for members of Congress the extent to which Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had sought to neuter potential rivals before they could mount a serious challenge.</blockquote><p>In our current divisive political landscape, Big Tech is becoming bipartisan low hanging fruit, <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201023&amp;instance_id=23425&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=42074&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fe82c0355-0059-55c1-8125-cef5ea7c4ef8&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">per the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/business/us-economy-coronavirus/reactions-to-google-news-what-business-leaders-policymakers-and-antitrust-experts-are-saying?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201026">applauded the Justice Department’s lawsuit</a> this week accusing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201026">Google of illegally protecting its monopoly</a> over search and search advertising. And members of a House committee on both sides <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/technology/congress-big-tech.html?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201026">mostly agreed</a> that Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple had grown too muscular and were abusing their&nbsp;power.</blockquote><p>All of which means we can expect more headlines like:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-judiciary-committee-authorizes-subpoenas-for-twitter-and-facebook-ceos-11603374015?mod=hp_lista_pos1&amp;utm_campaign=%5BTI-AM%5D+The+Informat&amp;utm_content=1002248&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=1000293">Senate Judiciary Committee Authorizes Subpoenas for Twitter and Facebook&nbsp;CEOs</a>  <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2020/10/21/fccs-authority-interpret-section-230-communications-act">The FCC’s Authority to Interpret Section 230 of the Communications Act</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebooks-oversight-board-for-content-wont-play-role-in-november-election?utm_content=article-4977&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_source=sg&amp;utm_medium=email">Facebook’s Oversight Board for Content Won’t Play Role in November&nbsp;Election</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/united-states-v-google/?utm_source=Memberful&amp;utm_campaign=4f47e7defc-weekly_article_2020_10_21_free&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-4f47e7defc-110987421">United States v.&nbsp;Google</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/us-vs-google-antitrust-suit-siege-begins-3864ba3a-9a85-476c-b2a1-f342df75a644.html">U.S. vs. Google — the siege&nbsp;begins</a>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-google-suit-were-all-anti-monopolists?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzEzNiwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTM1NTU3NjAsIl8iOiJUK05jLyIsImlhdCI6MTYwMzI5OTI3OCwiZXhwIjoxNjAzMzAyODc4LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTE1MjQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.Upl4m42ma6Me8O-aRGnRRqO5rf5j9L0hJ0cVRqC2Hio">The Google Suit: We’re All Anti-Monopolists Now</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/news-publishers-gain-political-support-in-fight-with-google-facebook">News Publishers Gain Political Support in Fight With Google,&nbsp;Facebook</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-to-prevent-social-medias-editorial-role-from-becoming-censorship-of-speech">How to Prevent Social Media’s Editorial Role From Becoming Censorship of&nbsp;Speech</a>  <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/is-facebook-too-big-to-know-the-markup-has-a-plan-and-a-browser-to-wrap-its-arms-around-it/">Is Facebook too big to know?

Big Tech has gotten so big and powerful and has swallowed up so many rivals and upstarts that we’re going to need some government action to help ensure a more competitive and innovative digital landscape. But it’s also not the type of thing we can completely rely on the government for. <p>For one, the solutions aren’t very obvious and getting to any sort of constructive outcome will be a long, embattled process.</p><p>Then we have to consider why governments are ticked off at Big Tech in the first place. On the one hand, there are good intentions. We want to ensure fair competition and marketplaces and we want to create an environment that fosters real innovation.</p><p>On the other hand, this is also a question of power and who wields it. Because in some ways, it’s about Big Tech stepping on Big Government’s toes.</p><p>We’re seeing this kind of dynamic play out in the government’s fight against end-to-end encryption.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">the EFF</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/ctomc">/ctomc</a>):</p><blockquote>The last few months have seen a steady stream of proposals, encouraged by the advocacy of the FBI and Department of Justice, to provide “lawful access” to end-to-end encrypted services in the United States. Now lobbying has moved from the U.S., where Congress has been largely paralyzed by the nation’s polarization problems, to the European Union — where advocates for anti-encryption laws hope to have a smoother ride. A series of leaked documents from the EU’s highest institutions show a blueprint for how they intend to make that happen, with the apparent intention of presenting anti-encryption law to the European Parliament within the next&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>The public signs of this shift in the EU — which until now has been largely supportive toward privacy-protecting technologies like end-to-end encryption — began in June with a speech by Ylva Johansson, the EU’s Commissioner for Home&nbsp;Affairs.</blockquote><blockquote>Speaking at a webinar on “Preventing and combating child sexual abuse [and] exploitation”, Johansson called for a “technical solution” to what she described as the “problem” of encryption, and announced that her office had initiated “a special group of experts from academia, government, civil society and business to find ways of detecting and reporting encrypted child sexual abuse material.”</blockquote><p>Which goes back to the problem of there being no obvious solutions — since much of the discussion around a “technical solution” essentially amounts to a backdoor.</p><p>(There have been some more creative solutions discussed during our open mic sessions such as the inclusion of bots in certain Group&nbsp;chats.)</p><p>But this is generally the classic type of situation that we already see in the world of money laundering and terrorist funding — whereby efforts to tackle really bad problems end up hurting the general populace (in this case, sacrificing their right to privacy on mainstream platforms) while doing little to catch the bad guys (who will find alternative solutions anyway).</p> 3. The public narratives about Bitcoin went mainstream this year (in a positive&nbsp;way) JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Photo:&nbsp;Fortune<p>Now just to be clear, this isn’t really the type of place where we talk about crypto prices and whether they’re going up or down. There’s plenty of outlets for that elsewhere.</p><p>The main point here is how the narratives have truly shifted in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Wall Street’s biggest banks have been long term skeptics of cryptocurrency with JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon a notable naysayer not many years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Here’s JPMorgan — one of Wall Street’s premier institutions — <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-gold-millennials-jpmorgan-price">now</a>:</p><blockquote>Writing to clients in “Flows &amp; Liquidity,” one of JPMorgan’s flagship publications, the authors said that characterizing bitcoin as a “risk” asset rather than a “safe” asset is “more appropriate” based on the leading cryptocurrency’s increased positive correlation with the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index since&nbsp;March.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoin’s function as a risk asset is “likely more of a reflection of a need for an ‘alternative’ currency rather than a need for a ‘safe’ asset or ‘hedge’.”</blockquote><blockquote>“To some extent, this is also true with gold,” the authors add, although the yellow metal’s volatility is notably lower than bitcoin’s.</blockquote><blockquote>How investors currently perceive bitcoin’s value implies that it could “compete more intensely” with gold as an “alternative” currency over the coming years, the analysts wrote. Bitcoin’s role as a gold competitor is amplified by millennial investors’ interest in cryptocurrency, according to the note, and the inevitability of the younger investor demographic becoming “over time a more important component” of the investor universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoin’s market capitalization would have to increase by a factor of 10 before it could match the total private sector investment in gold, the author’s note, adding that “even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from&nbsp;here.”</blockquote><blockquote>“In other words, the potential long-term upside for bitcoin is considerable.”</blockquote><p>So yeah, the tune has&nbsp;changed.</p><p>And unlike gold, this is something young people are excited about. It’s not just about Bitcoin. It’s about what it represents and the innovative potential of the blockchain space at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Young people are particularly attuned to the concept that our lives will become increasingly digital and crypto is really the next step in that evolution in terms of digital value. (The same could be said about digital identity, self-sovereign identity, and digital&nbsp;trust.)</p><p>In any case, another company pledges to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/uk-listed-firm-mode-putting-10-of-cash-reserves-into-bitcoin">hold a portion of its cash reserves in&nbsp;crypto</a>:</p><blockquote>In a press release on Wednesday, the fintech group said it will convert up to 10% of its cash reserves into the cryptocurrency as part of a long-term strategy to “protect investors’ assets from currency debasement.”</blockquote><blockquote>With interest rates in the U.K. at a record low of 0.1%, Mode said it would also seek to diversify away from low-interest money market instruments to maximize the value of returns from its recent initial public offering.</blockquote><blockquote>“Faced with the challenges of COVID-19 and with U.K. interest rates at the lowest level in the Bank of England’s 326-year history, our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin has only increased,” said Jonathan Rowland, Mode’s executive chairman.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency">PayPal Launches New Service Enabling Users to Buy, Hold and Sell Cryptocurrency</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-new-york-conditional-bitlicense-paxos-cryptocurrency">PayPal Embraces Crypto, Igniting Market as Mainstream Adoption Inches Closer — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/uk-listed-firm-mode-putting-10-of-cash-reserves-into-bitcoin">UK-Listed Firm Mode Putting Up to 10% of Cash Reserves Into Bitcoin — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fedtakes-cautious-approach-to-possibly-issuing-digital-currency-11603132490?mod=hp_lista_pos2">Fed Takes Cautious Approach to Possibly Issuing Digital&nbsp;Currency</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/new-bretton-woods">Does the IMF Want a New ‘Bretton Woods’ Moment? — CoinDesk</a>   4.

<p>Being able to use Ceramic directly from the convenience of your web browser is one of the core functionalities required to fulfill the vision of a permissionless dataweb. <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> enables this by providing a sandboxed IdentityWallet instance which users can authenticate to using any of their existing Ethereum wallets, and soon other Blockchain wallets as well. This tutorial will show you how to combine 3ID Connect with Ceramic in order to start building your app using dynamic, tamper resistant documents!</p> Using Ceramic on the&nbsp;web <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Typescript Ceramic implementation</a> provides two main ways to interact with the ceramic network, Ceramic Core and Ceramic http-client. The former implements the entire protocol and relies on a js-ipfs instance to be available, the latter relies on a Ceramic Daemon which you can run from your terminal. Both of these implementations consume a DID Provider which is used to communicate with a wallet with DID support (see <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP2844</a>). In the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Building on Clay tutorial</a> we described how to use the http client together with an instance of <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a>. This is good if you want to dive into fundamentals, but 3ID Connect enables us to connect to a DID directly from the comfort of your Ethereum wallet. This DID will also be linked together with the ethereum address using&nbsp;<a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>.</p><p>In this tutorial we will be using Ceramic Core, which means that we’re running the entire Ceramic protocol inside of the&nbsp;browser!</p> Setup 3ID Connect with&nbsp;Ceramic <p>First let’s install the needed packages. Currently the 3ID Connect version with Ceramic support is available using the next flag. In the example we will be using ceramic-core, but you can use ceramic-http-client as&nbsp;well.</p> $ npm install --save 3id-connect@next @ceramicnetwork/ceramic-core <p>Using 3ID Connect to authenticate to Ceramic is fairly straight forward once the basic flow is setup. In the example below we use an “injected ethereum provider” that’s available on window.ethereum. You can of course use any ethereum provider that you&nbsp;like.</p> import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'  const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()  // Usually the following three steps are taken when<br>// a user choose to connect their wallet<br>const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()<br>// Create 3id connect instance<br>const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])<br>await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)  // create a Ceramic instance<br>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-core'<br>import IPFS from 'ipfs'  const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()<br>const ipfs = await IPFS.create()<br>const ceramic = await Ceramic.create(ipfs, { didProvider })  Create documents in the&nbsp;browser <p>We can now start using Ceramic directly in the browser! Below are just some examples that you can also try out on the <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">Web Playground</a> which comes with 3ID Connect and Ceramic already set up. First, open the developer console and then click connect. The 3ID Connect modal will appear, and once approved, you will see “Connected with DID: did:3:&lt;yourDID&gt;” in the console. Once this appears, then you can run the below commands directly in the console. Note, if you’d like to reset the 3ID Connect iFrame state, clear application data for 3idconnect.org from localStorage.</p> const jsonSchema = {<br>  "type": "object",<br>  "$schema": "&lt;http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#&gt;",<br>  "required": [<br>    "title",<br>    "description"<br>  ],<br>  "properties": {<br>    "title": {<br>      "type": "string"<br>    },<br>    "description": {<br>      "type": "string"<br>    }<br>  },<br>  "additionalProperties": false<br>}  const doc1 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', { content: jsonSchema })  // This will throw an error because it's missing the "description":<br>const doc2 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', {<br>  metadata: { schema: doc1.id },<br>  content: { "title": "Client Document" }<br>})<br>// Uncaught Error: Validation Error: data should have <br>// required property 'description'  // We can create the document if we provide all required fields:<br>const doc3 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', {<br>  metadata: { schema: doc1.id },<br>  content: {<br>    title: "Client Document",<br>    description: "A Ceramic Document created from the browser."<br>  }<br>})  // Now we can of course also update the document:<br>await doc3.change({<br>  content: {<br>    title: 'Client Document',<br>    description: 'This document has now been updated from the browser'<br>  }<br>}) <p>That’s it for this tutorial!

			<p>At ForgeRock we take the security and protection of our customer’s personal data seriously. We know staying abreast of shifting <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">privacy </a>laws can be challenging, which is why we have a dedicated team of experts monitoring the landscape to ensure our services help you stay compliant.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>An area we continue to watch closely is the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling from July 16, 2020 regarding the transfer of personal data. As part of the ruling, the court confirmed that the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses (SCCs) remain a valid and lawful method for transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States and other countries. At the same time, it decided to invalidate the EU-US Privacy Shield framework.</p>

			<p>The Swiss data protection regulator has followed the CJEU’s ruling and deemed the Swiss-US Privacy Shield framework inadequate for protecting Swiss/US data transfers.&nbsp;</p>

			 What is the impact?&nbsp;&nbsp; 

			<p>For ForgeRock customers, none. The continued support of SCCs means there is no disruption to the way we do business with you.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>ForgeRock was never certified under the EU-US or Swiss-EU Privacy Shield frameworks. We have always relied on SCCs to safely and legally transfer customer’s personal data from the EU and Switzerland to our services.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>This means our customers can be assured that they may continue to use ForgeRock’s services by relying on the SCCs that are currently in our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/99022421/legal-document/ForgeRock%20Data%20Protection%20Addendum.pdf">Data Protection Addendum</a>.</p>

			 What are SCCs?&nbsp; 

			<p>The SCCs are a set of standard contractual terms providing sufficient safeguards for the protection of personal data of EU individuals, when transferred from Europe to the US and other countries. The ruling supports our belief that SCCs stand up to our 'cast-iron' commitment to the security and protection of our customers’ data.</p>

			 Need more information?&nbsp; 

			<p>Please reach out to ForgeRock’s Privacy team (<a href="mailto:privacy@forgerock.com">privacy@forgerock.com</a>) with any questions you may have on ForgeRock’s data protection practices or the impact of the CJEU’s ruling in this case.</p>

 Ocean V3 Is Now&nbsp;Live  One Step Closer to an open Data&nbsp;Economy <p>Ocean Protocol was conceived in 2017 as a trustless, decentralized data and AI sharing service. We took all our learnings from four years in blockchain and melded the concepts of big data and AI to paint a vision of how a new Data Economy could arise if data could be shared freely, while protecting privacy and giving the data owners control. From 2017 until now, we worked tirelessly to realize the vision outlined in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/tech-whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> and adhere to the timelines and scope of the&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/roadmap">roadmap</a>.</p><p>Today, with the release of Ocean V3, we celebrate another milestone in the journey to give people back power and control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Ocean V3 is a core piece needed to unlock a new Data Economy. The logic and functionality for access control for Ocean V3 has been rebuilt from the ground up to simplify the on-boarding for Web3 natives, leverage the Ethereum network’s decentralized trust architecture, removing technical complexity inherent in a Proof-of-Authority network and integrate with state-of-the-art tooling for decentralized finance (#DeFi) that has appeared and matured during&nbsp;2020.</p><p>A core component of Ocean V3 is the datatoken. Datatokens are ERC20 tokens that represent both the value of the data asset and provide the access control to the data asset. We proposed the idea of a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-tokens-1-data-custody-1d0d5ae66d0c">datatoken in November 2019</a>, and since then we have made it the heart of Ocean V3 because it radically simplifies the user interaction for data sharing, while leveraging existing Web3 mental models for custody, wallets, liquidity, staking and&nbsp;farming.</p><p>With Ocean V3, we also introduce Ocean Market, an open data marketplace for the community. It is built on the foundation of datatokens. As a first example of Ocean V3’s composability, Ocean Market directly leverages Balancer DEX technology for staking, automatic pricing of data, and data curation.</p><p>Leading up to Ocean V3, we explained various relevant concepts:</p>  the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/should-product-market-fit-come-before-tokens-6c542a75c8dc">interplay</a> between product/market fit and&nbsp;tokens,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">verification</a> of token models using Token Engineering concepts,  impetus for the Ocean <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-swap-completed-new-contract-live-f0768423b3e1">token&nbsp;swap</a>,  the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">Ocean token</a>&nbsp;model,  the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">sustainability loop</a> for Web3 projects, including Ocean,  the simplified technical <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-architecture-overview-9f2fab60f9a7">architecture</a> in Ocean&nbsp;V3,  how to re-purpose <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">#DeFi building blocks</a> for data (datatokens)  an introduction to the community-targeted <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>  Ocean <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data&nbsp;Farming</a>,  the role of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">staking</a> on&nbsp;data,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-selling-data-in-ocean-market-9afcfa1e6e43">selling</a> data in the Ocean&nbsp;Market.  <p>We opened up our channels to guest contributors, to hear broader perspectives about an emerging Data&nbsp;Economy:</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-data-economy-alex-svanevik-daos-as-business-a43cd6f5dcd7">Alex Svanevik</a> and his perspective as a data scientist,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-data-economy-silvan-jongerius-gdpr-ce14db0ff2d">Silvan Jongerius</a> — GDPR and&nbsp;data,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-the-data-economy-robert-miller-healthcare-data-be78e2c19c84">Robert Miller</a> — healthcare data,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/a-privacy-preserving-public-private-statistics-ecosystem-for-europe-cdc3b67a6614">Andreas Fauler</a> — governments and&nbsp;data.   A Call to Action — Ocean V3 is now fully available to the community <p>Ocean V3 takes to heart the start-up and Web3 principles to launch products early and incorporate the feedback of users as soon as possible. The team has contracted security audits, updated the libraries, updated documentation, revamped the website and tested the user flows in the Ocean Market. Now the community can play an even more active&nbsp;role.</p><p>Ocean V3 is fully functioning, but there’s a lot of work to be done to improve the user flows and add features in the Ocean Market, dozens of integrations are needed to weave Ocean into the fabric of business, and vulnerabilities may exist and need to be&nbsp;fixed.</p><p>The Ocean Market is a blank slate. It needs to be filled with valuable and relevant data that can be shared and monetized. For this, we ask the community to step in and find new data to fill the Ocean. The upcoming Data Economy Challenge will have a special emphasis — where teams and individuals can earn bounties and grants on filling the Ocean with high-quality data.</p> Looking Ahead <p>The final milestone to be accomplished from our original vision is to increase the control of the community over the protocol. For this, we will activate the OceanDAO and reduce the ability of the Ocean core team to intercede into the Ocean token contract, the Ocean smart contracts and community funding.</p><p>In 2021, all community efforts will be on raising awareness and encouraging adoption of Ocean Protocol as the de facto standard for the Data Economy. We will be asking for community support with integrations with other Web3 tools and services, porting Ocean smart contracts to other L1 technologies such as Polkadot, xDAI, Binance Smart Chain and others, and of course filling the Ocean with data and AI services.</p><p>We would like to thank all the community members for joining into the vision and helping to make it your own and to the countless contributors throughout this four year journey that have made Ocean Protocol, a community project for everyone. With our foundation of state-of-the-art technology and the rapidly growing Ocean community, let’s spread the message that it’s now possible to truly own our&nbsp;data.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Ocean Protocol Network Deployments Past, Present, and&nbsp;Future <a href="http://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> *&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean</a> One-Liner <p>Ocean Protocol V3.0 is now deployed to Ethereum mainnet. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/tree/master/docs/deployments">Here</a> are the addresses.</p> Summary <p>Towards a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-data-economy-b6fd8ecac4c4">Web3 Data Economy</a> for the planet, we envision Ocean deployed as a thin data asset layer for many blockchain networks. It starts with a single deployment, and expands pragmatically. Here’s the&nbsp;summary.</p><p>Ocean V1 (and V2) was deployed decentralized and permissioned:</p>  Network. Ocean smart contracts run on a dedicated <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">permissioned</a> <a href="https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e">EVM</a>&nbsp;network.  Contracts. A small group of people can <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/making-ocean-protocols-smart-contracts-and-it-s-governance-unstoppable-45cf99dc1b65">upgrade the smart contracts</a>, in a multi-sig setting.  <p>As of Ocean V3.0, Ocean will be decentralized and permissionless:</p>  Network. Ocean smart contracts are deployed to <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a> — the leading permissionless smart contract network. For testing, they’re also on Rinkeby. Specific deployment addresses are listed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/tree/master/docs/deployments">here.</a>  Contracts. The aim is to move away from a small handful of gatekeepers. Here’s how: contracts will not have upgradeability built in. Therefore the only way to upgrade contracts is by community consensus to use a new set of smart contracts. Sometimes, less is&nbsp;more.  <p>Then, Ocean V3.x will deploy to one EVM-compatible chain as a “sister” deployment to Ethereum mainnet. Thus, users can choose between low gas costs (sister chain) or high security (Ethereum mainnet).</p><p>After that, we envision community-driven Ocean deployments to many more chains. The rest of this article elaborates.</p> Decentralized, Consistent, Scalable. Pick Any&nbsp;Two. <p>The ideal blockchain network is Decentralized, Consistent, and Scalable&nbsp;(D,C,S):</p>  Decentralized means no single point of failure, the ideal version being permissionless (no gatekeepers)  Consistent means prevents double-spends, and sufficiently secure.  Scalable means it can serve planet-scale needs.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.bigchaindb.com%2Fthe-dcs-triangle-5ce0e9e0f1dc">We discovered in 2016</a> that it’s hard to get all three (D,C, S) at once. You can get two, but not three. A bit later, others <a href="https://github.com/taoeffect/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/c375e1f42f871463c80daa68ca0120993936a8c4/topics-and-advance-readings/Slepaks-Triangle.pdf">also</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311180536/https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ">realized</a> this. This challenge is now commonly known as the Scalability Trilemma.</p> Ocean V1 &amp; V2: Decentralized &amp; Permissioned <p>In fall 2018, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">underwent a process</a> to decide where to deploy Ocean contracts. At the time, no network in production met all three (D,C,S). Therefore, something would have to hold us over until full D,C,S solutions came&nbsp;along.</p><p>These were the most realistic options:</p>  <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>. It’s permissionless-Decentralized and Consistent. Scalability was our biggest concern, especially for data science users who expect performance. Nonetheless, we test-deployed Ocean contracts to Ethereum mainnet. Ocean V1 contracts were complex, so it took about 2 days to successfully deploy them 😬. This would have been a recurring problem, as we had a steady stream of upgrades planned. Second, each data purchase involved several wallet confirmations, which would have been painful for&nbsp;users.  <a href="https://www.poa.network/">POA Network</a>. While Consistent and Scalable, it was permissioned (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_authority">Proof-of-Authority</a>), not permissionless Decentralized. It has a sneaky ninja trick to avoid extra layer of legals to bound liability for node operators: each node operator must be a <a href="https://www.poa.network/features/known-validators">US public notary</a>, and US public notaries have sworn to be “of public service”. The engineer in me adores the elegance of this. However it also means that each operator must be in the US. Being confined to a single jurisdiction — and one without great regulatory clarity — was a showstopper for&nbsp;us.  Dedicated Ocean network, to start. Like POA Network, it would be Consistent and Scalable, and only permissioned Decentralized. It meant extra devops work and legal work. But there were no showstoppers.  <p>Given the tradeoffs of the other choices at the time, we selected “Dedicated Ocean network”. We created a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">permissioned</a> EVM network called <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/pacific-network/">Pacific</a>, and deployed Ocean smart contracts to it. For security, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN tokens</a> live on <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>, and connect to Pacific with an <a href="https://medium.com/poa-network/introducing-the-erc20-to-erc20-tokenbridge-ce266cc1a2d0">ERC20 Token Bridge</a>. Creating and maintaining this dedicated network and bridge was a lot of extra devops work and legal&nbsp;work.</p> Ocean V3.0: Permissionless <p>Ocean V3 contracts are <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-architecture-overview-9f2fab60f9a7">much simpler</a> than the V1 and V2 contracts due to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837?source=---------3----------------------------">datatokens</a> architecture. This includes lower gas usage, and fewer Ethereum transactions for equivalent actions. Finally, we have realized that data scientists are accustomed to some latency with Web2 payments; we don’t need to be radically better than that. (Ethereum mainnet latency is within those&nbsp;bounds.)</p><p>In short, the constraints that prevented us from deploying Ocean to Ethereum mainnet for Ocean V1 and V2 are no longer&nbsp;present.</p><p>We can deploy Ocean to Ethereum Mainnet now. So, we are. Ocean V3.0 is deployed to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>This means that Ocean V3 also meets the Ocean “V5” target of being permissionless, specified in the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-roadmap-setting-sail-to-2021-70c2545547a7">Ocean</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">roadmap</a>. We’ll also be retiring Pacific, and rescinding pause in Ocean&nbsp;tokens.</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN tokens</a> remain on <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>; therefore no bridge to Ethereum mainnet is needed for utility of Ocean smart contracts.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that Ethereum’s scale issue is solved, of course. It just means that it’s finally feasible for Ocean to be on Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p> Ocean V3.x Deployment to a Sister&nbsp;Chain <p>In the months leading up to Ocean V3 release (during Q3 2020), Ethereum gas costs have greatly risen with the rise of&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://trent.st/content/2014-10-28%20mcconaghy%20-%20blockchain%20big%20data.pdf">Since 2014</a>, we’ve been interested in blockchain scalability. We built <a href="http://www.bigchaindb.com">BigchainDB</a> as a scalability solution for database-style blockchains. I wrote the <a href="https://blog.bigchaindb.com/the-dcs-triangle-5ce0e9e0f1dc">DCS article</a>. And we’ve kept a close eye on scalability solutions.</p><p>We’ve been especially interested in ones that minimize changes to Ethereum mainnet. There are several EVM-compatible chains that solve DCS now. These include <a href="https://www.xdaichain.com/">xDai Chain</a> (via <a href="https://forum.poa.network/t/posdao-white-paper/2208">POSDAO</a>), <a href="https://www.parity.io/substrate-evm/">EVM on Substrate</a>, and <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698">rollups</a>. They can all be viewed as a “sister” chains to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>We plan a “sister” deployment of Ocean to xDai Chain for Ocean v3.x. This will likely be V3.1, depending on priority to other&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Each chain has a way to connect to Ethereum mainnet, for a flow of OCEAN token and datatokens to and from the sister chain. For example, xDai uses <a href="https://docs.tokenbridge.net/amb-bridge/about-amb-bridge">Arbitrary Message Bridge</a>&nbsp;(AMB).</p><p>It’s acceptable if the sister chain has a lower security, since users would have the choice between higher security (Ethereum mainnet) or lower gas costs (the sister, at potentially lower security). Then:</p>  Data assets that start high value or need high security can continue to deploy directly to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.  And, lower-value data assets can first get deployed to the sister network, then “graduate” to Ethereum mainnet if they increase sufficiently in value&nbsp;[1].  Ocean bridge.&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.pickpik.com/baltic-sea-bridge-denmark-sea-bridge-sunset-abendstimmung-93785">Image</a>] Multi-Network Deployment <p>Over time, we envision every blockchain network to have an Ocean-powered data resource permissioning layer. We envision them being interconnected with datatokens and OCEAN flowing everywhere.</p><p>We envision Ocean as an add-on library in <a href="https://www.parity.io/substrate/">Parity Substrate</a> and <a href="https://cosmos.network/sdk">Cosmos SDK</a>, making it only an “import” away for <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> and <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> blockchain families respectively [2]. It would support EVM, and eventually WASM directly. We’re particularly excited about <a href="https://www.parity.io/substrate-2-0-is-here/">Substrate 2.0</a>’s support for off-chain data integration.</p><p>We see integrations with <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698">rollups</a> technologies, including <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK variants</a> and optimistic variants (e.g. <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/optimistic-virtual-machine-alpha-cdf51f5d49e">OVM</a>). Each can be seen as a layer 2 solution. Or it can be seen as its own chain, that happens to inherit Ethereum mainnet’s security (but with other tradeoffs).</p><p>We expect to see deployment to other EVM-based networks such as <a href="https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain">Binance Smart Chain</a>, <a href="https://matic.network/">Matic Network</a>, <a href="https://skale.network/">SKALE Network</a>, <a href="https://near.org/">NEAR Protocol</a>, and <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>; each with their respective bridges.</p><p>We envision deployment onto federated networks for consortia like <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Energy Web&nbsp;Chain</a>.</p><p>Finally, we eventually see deployment to non-EVM blockchains, especially ones that can hold a lot of data like <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">arweave</a>, or ones with built-in oracles like <a href="https://aeternity.com/">aeternity</a>.</p><p>Going onto all these networks will be a process that will take multiple years. But over time, Ocean will become a ubiquitous access control layer across the entire Web3 ecosystem, aka the new internet. We see this as crucial towards global data sovereignty for individuals, companies, cities and&nbsp;nations.</p><p>In all these deployments, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN tokens</a> will remain on <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>, and bridged to other networks.</p><p>We will be encouraging the broader community to do each of these deployments, with funding from <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">OceanDAO</a> or the respective chain’s grant mechanisms.</p><p>In each of these deployments, with the interest of Ocean sustainability (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">as described here</a>), there will be <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3?source=user_profile---------0-----------------------">small transaction fees</a> that go to the Ocean community via a&nbsp;bridge.</p>Each network is its own island. We envision a future where every network has Ocean — and they’re all connected.

For V3.x, Ocean will get a “sister” deployment. Beyond, it will deploy to even more networks, towards ubiquity.</p>Ocean, covering everything.

<p>“COVID-19 has transformed how people are spending their money, and many businesses such as airlines, cruiselines and cinemas simply have no choice but to cut costs,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/88332">Chris Ganly</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner, during his presentation at virtual<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/apac/symposium-australia/"> Gartner Symposium IT/Xpo® 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Difficult times call for difficult actions</p>

<p>“When faced with the challenge of immediate cost savings, CIOs need to determine how to approach cost cutting in the least damaging way to the mid- and long-term health of the business,” said Ganly.</p>
<p>[swg_ad] </p>
<p>Gartner recommends taking a structured and programmatic approach to<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-cios-can-optimize-it-costs/"> cost optimization</a>. Research shows that organizations that continue to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-gartner-2020-cio-agenda-winning-in-the-turns/">invest strategically in tough times</a> are more likely to emerge as leaders. But sometimes, difficult times call for difficult actions. </p>
<p>Cutting or stopping projects or services where costs have already been spent or incurred are of limited value. Cutting things that can’t be restarted, that have already been invested in or are ready to deliver will hurt when the organization is<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/act-now-to-fund-innovation-and-growth/"> ready to accelerate again</a>.</p>
 10 rules for rapid IT cost reduction 
<p>Assess your <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-kick-off-initiatives-for-cost-optimization/">IT cost reduction</a> options with these rules in mind.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 1: Target immediate impact 
<p>Eliminate, reduce or suspend items that will impact in weeks or months, not in years. Examples include expenses that are incurred and paid monthly or quarterly on a “pay as you go” basis, rather than annually.</p>
 No. 2: Reduce, don’t freeze 
<p>Focus on costs that can truly be reduced or eliminated, not just frozen for the current period, only to reappear again further down the line.</p>
 No. 3: Cash is king 
<p>Target those items that will have a real cash impact on the profit and loss statement rather than noncash items like depreciation or amortization. For example, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/best-practices-for-cloud-negotiation/">cost savings in cloud services</a> have a real cash impact, as opposed to reducing on-premises software licenses or owned assets like hardware. Selling and leasing back assets can provide real cash savings as well.</p>
 No. 4:&nbsp;Plan to do it once 
<p>Most organizations don’t cut deeply enough the first time, which means they often need to revisit costs and do it again. This creates a destructive and unproductive cycle of uncertainty, effort and lost productivity. This is particularly relevant for staff cuts, where cycles of ongoing reductions can be especially dangerous.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz0zMzQ2ZGRhMDEzMWMxMWViYjBiZTBhYWYwODQ4M2M2Yg=="></a> </p>
 No. 5:&nbsp;Carefully inspect accounts 
<p>Work with your finance partner to obtain a solid view of the expense-level detail, such as expense accounts, and key balance sheet accounts, including expense accruals and prepayments. Use this view to identify specific cash reductions that will immediately have an impact.</p>
 No. 6:&nbsp;Target unspent and uncommitted expenses 
<p>Unless payments (or commitments) can be recovered or prepayments returned, the most immediate impact will be on unspent or uncommitted payments. Evaluate contracts for renegotiation and termination clauses.</p>
 No. 7: Address capital 
<p>Typically, operating expenditures (opex) are the easiest to impact, but capital expenditures (capex) can also be reduced. Gartner IT Key Metrics Data shows that 25% of the average IT budget is spent on capital, so ensure that the complete range of IT spend is considered for rapid reductions.</p>
 No. 8: Sunk costs are irrelevant 
<p>When it comes to saving money, it is commonly said that “sunk costs are irrelevant,” meaning that future spend should be considered without relation to past spending or “sunk costs.” From a rapid cost reduction standpoint this is true, but it’s still worth considering whether the saving will be more than the benefit that can and will be delivered by continuing.</p>
 No. 9: Address discretionary and nondiscretionary cost 
<p>Discretionary spending, such as for new projects, additional capability or services, is often a seemingly easier place to cut. However, even nondiscretionary “run the business” expenses such as IT infrastructure and operations can be cut by reducing usage or service levels.</p>
 No. 10: Tackle both variable and fixed costs 
<p>Fixed costs are expenses that remain constant, regardless of activity or volume, such as office rent, subscriptions and payroll. For fixed costs, focus on elimination. Variable costs change with activity or volume; for example, telecommunications, contractors and consumables. For variable costs, focus on both reduction and elimination.</p>

  <p>By 2024, more than 45% of IT spending on system infrastructure, infrastructure software, application software and business process outsourcing will shift from traditional solutions to cloud. This evolution makes cloud computing one of the most continually disruptive forces in IT markets since the early days of the digital age.</p>
<blockquote><p>The proportion of IT spending that is being allocated to cloud will accelerate even further in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis</p></blockquote>
<p>Organizations are increasingly <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-trends-impacting-cloud-adoption-in-2020/">using cloud services for new initiatives</a> or to replace existing systems, meaning that spending on traditional IT solutions is being reallocated to cloud. The result is what Gartner calls cloud shift, and it is happening more often due to a growing preference for “cloud-first.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“Gartner’s cloud shift data reveals that enterprises are demonstrating continued preference for public cloud services compared with traditional non-cloud alternatives,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/41344">Ed Anderson</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “The proportion of IT spending that is being allocated to cloud will accelerate even further in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, as companies look to improve operational efficiencies.”</p>
<p>For example, the latest Gartner IT spending forecast shows that spending on data center systems is projected to be $188 billion in 2020, a 10% decrease from 2019. In contrast, spending on cloud system infrastructure services is expected to grow from $44 billion in 2019 to $63 billion in 2020, reaching $81 billion by 2022.</p>
 Cloud shift enables digital business opportunities 
<p>Cloud shift is not just about cloud. As organizations pursue new IT architectures and operating philosophies, they create a foundation for new opportunities in <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/avoid-these-9-corporate-digital-business-transformation-mistakes/">digital business</a>, including next-generation IT solutions.</p>
<p>Organizations embracing dynamic, cloud-based operating models are primed for increased competitiveness, especially in today’s rapidly changing business environment. These organizations not only recognize the short-term benefits of cloud, but also position themselves to be early adopters of the disruptive innovations that will define the future. </p>
<p>The next major wave of technology disruption is already emerging in the form of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), IoT, edge computing and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-trends-in-data-and-analytics-for-2020/">advanced data analytics</a>. These innovations are almost always tied to a cloud foundation as part of an organization’s digital business technology platform.</p>
<blockquote><p>Infrastructure and operations leaders responsible for cloud investment decisions must be wary of 'cloud washing'</p></blockquote>
<p>However, infrastructure and operations leaders responsible for cloud investment decisions must be wary of “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-top-10-cloud-myths/">cloud washing</a>,” or a tendency to call things cloud that are not. IT organizations and vendors may cloud wash to gain funding, make sales, or meet cloud demands and strategies, which can result in the misconception that an IT product or service must be cloud to be good. </p>
<p>Consider shifting from a “cloud first” approach, which prioritizes cloud adoption and legacy modernization above all else, to a “cloud-smart” approach, which balances cloud adoption with the organization’s unique circumstances and goals, and business value.</p>
<p>Cloud shift represents both a risk and an opportunity for IT leaders. As cloud becomes increasingly mainstream through 2024, it will dominate ever-increasing portions of enterprise IT decisions.</p>

					  26.10.2020. In diesem Jahr ist alles anders. So fand auch das Digital Trust &amp; Identity Forum des bitkom heute virtuell statt. Mehrere hundert Teilnehmer verfolgten die spannenden Diskussionen und Vorträge rund um alles was in den Themen digital Identity, Vertrauensdienste und die Umsetzung der eIDAS-Verordnung als Basis für eine europaweite, elektronische Kommunikation und sichere Identifizierung aktuell wichtig ist. <p>Dominik Deimel engagierte sich mit dem Vortrag “comuny Trust Service Ecosystem – die Zukunft liegt in der Kollaboration!”. Er beschrieb, warum digitale Services von Unternehmen in regulierten Märkten verifizierte Kundendaten benötigen – egal ob bei Kontoeröffnung, Zugang zur elektronischen Patientenakte oder auch beim voll digitalen Abschluss eines &nbsp;Versicherungsvertrags. Die Anzahl der Use Cases steigt kontinuierlich und für Unternehmen zählt Flexibilität in der Prozessgestaltung und Einfachheit in der Umsetzung als Top Prio bei der Auswahl passender Lösungspartner. Doch aktuell ist kein Dienstleister in der Lage, diesen Anspruch übergreifend zu erfüllen ohne klassische Lock-In Effekte.</p><p>Die Antwort auf dieses Dilemma heißt Kollaboration der Anbieter in Ecosystemen, die ausreichend Spielraum für eigene unternehmerische Freiheitsgrade und gleichzeitig Transparenz bei der Anbieterauswahl für den Kunden gewährleisten. Über einen solchen Ansatz lassen sich sehr flexibel Use Cases und Branchenlösungen erzeugen, die dann optimalerweise als in sich gekoppelte As-a-Service-Leistung zum attraktiven Preis am Markt angeboten werden. In dem Vortrag wurde das Geschäftsmodell und die technische Lösung des comuny Trust Ecosystems Ansatz und die Möglichkeiten der Use Case Generierung am Beispiel des Gesundheitswesen aufgezeigt und diskutiert.</p><p>#eIDAS #bitkom #speaker #event #comuny #Kollaboration #future-of-trust #ecosystems #trust-services</p><p><a title="https://eidas-summit.de/eIDAS-Summit-Programm" href="https://eidas-summit.de/eIDAS-Summit-Programm">https://eidas-summit.de/eIDAS-Summit-Programm</a></p>

<p>If you’re a Java developer like me, you like to crank out code and get shit done. I like many things about IntelliJ IDEA, but I thought it’d be fun to write about the ones that make me most productive. First, a bit of my development history.</p>
 
 
<p>When I first started doing Java development in the late 90s, I used HomeSite as my editor. HomeSite was an HTML editor initially developed by Nick Bradbury. I liked it because it defaulted to a view of your code rather than being WYSIWYG like Dreamweaver and FrontPage. It’s funny to look back now and laugh about how inefficient I was: I used to google for import statements, then copy/pasted them into the editor.</p>
 
 
<p>In the early 2000s, I tried a few other IDEs, but they always seemed to be memory hogs and never felt quite as good as HomeSite to me. Then, along came Eclipse. When I first used it, I fell in love. Not only did it have a native look-and-feel, but it was fast and efficient.</p>
 
 
<p>I stayed in love with Eclipse until I started migrating AppFuse to Maven in 2006. IntelliJ IDEA’s Maven support for multiple modules was so much better than Eclipse’s m2e, I switched. In 2008, I started doing more web development and found that IDEA had excellent HTML, JavaScript, and CSS support. I haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: as a Java Champion, I get a free license to IntelliJ IDEA. If I didn’t, my company would gladly pay for it.</p>
 
 






I used IDEA 2020.2.3 (Ultimate Edition) for this blog post.



 
 
 

 
 
 
 Run Your Java Apps from IntelliJ IDEA 
 
 
<p>I used to prefer running my apps from the command line with Ant or Maven. Then, along came Spring Boot. Spring Boot is a plain ol' Java application with a <code>public static void main()</code>. This makes it a lot easier for Java IDEs to run apps since this is a standard part of any Java app.</p>
 
 
<p>In fact, if you go to File &gt; New &gt; Project, you’ll see IDEA supports many popular Java frameworks like Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, and MicroProfile.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you select any of these frameworks, a multi-step wizard will guide you through options.</p>
 
 
 Run Spring Boot Apps in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
<p>If you select Spring Boot, it’ll even create a run configuration for you with the name matching your main <code>Application</code> class. In the screenshot below, the buttons are as follows:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
<p>The hammer icon on the left will build your project</p>
 
 
<p>The play icon will run your project</p>
 
 
<p>The bug icon will run your project in debug mode</p>
 
 
<p>The far-right icon will run with code coverage</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>If you’re doing microservices with Spring Boot, there’s also a run dashboard you can use to start/stop/monitor all your services. To demonstrate what it looks like, you can clone the example code from <a>Secure Reactive Microservices with Spring Cloud Gateway</a> and open it in IDEA:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/spring-cloud-gateway
idea .</code> 
 
 
 
<p>After downloading dependencies and initializing the project, you’ll see a Services popup in the bottom right corner.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Click on it and it’ll expand to give you a couple of options. Click on the first one to show run configurations.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>This will show the run dashboard and you’ll see all your apps listed. You can click on the Not Started element and click the play icon to start them all.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Pretty cool, eh?!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Run Micronaut Apps in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
<p>Micronaut is similar to Spring Boot in that it has a <code>public static void main()</code>. When I created a new app using IDEA’s Micronaut wizard, it did not generate any run configurations for me. However, when I clicked on the play icon next to the <code>main()</code> method, it allowed me to easily create one.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Run Quarkus Apps in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
<p>Quarkus is a bit different—it has no <code>main()</code> method. You have to run the <code>quarkus:dev</code> Maven goal to start the app. The good news is you can create a run (or debug) configuration from this by right-clicking on the goal in the Maven tool window and selecting the second option.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Configure Environment Variables 
 
<p>You might be wondering, "why do I need a run configuration?" First of all, it’s nice to click a button (or use a keyboard shortcut) to start and re-start your app. Secondly, it provides a way for you to configure JVM options and environment variables.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, if you’re using Spring Boot with Okta’s Spring Boot starter, you’ll want to use environment variables rather than putting a client secret in your source code.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Debug Your Java Apps 
 
 
<p>Setting breakpoints in apps and debugging them is a valuable skill for software engineers, regardless of language.</p>
 
 
<p>In IntelliJ IDEA, you can click in the left gutter next to the line you want to debug. Then, run your app with a debug configuration, and it’ll stop at your breakpoint. Then you can step into, step over, etc.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 Debug via Maven in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
<p>If you start your app with Maven, you can debug it too. Let’s use Micronaut in this example. If you run <code>mvnDebug mn:run</code>, it’ll wait for you to attach a remote debugger on port 8000. To create a remote debugging configuration in IntelliJ IDEA, go to Add Configuration &gt; + &gt; Remote and give it a name. Then change the port to <code>8000</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Debug via Gradle in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
<p>Gradle has a similar ability. For example, if you created a Spring Boot app with Gradle, you could start it with the following command to run in debug mode.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gradle bootRun -Dorg.gradle.debug=true --no-daemon</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In this case, Gradle will listen on port 5005 by default, so you’ll need to modify your remote configuration to listen on this port.</p>
 
 
<p>Confession: I was a Java developer for over five years before I learned <a href="https://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/remotely_debug_your_app_in">you can remotely debug any Java application</a>. All it takes is starting your Java app with some extra arguments, and it’ll wait until you attach to it. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005 -jar path/to/jar.jar</code> 
 
 
 






IntelliJ IDEA also supports <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-javascript-debugger.html">debugging JavaScript apps</a>.



 
 
 
 
 
 Run Your Java Tests from IntelliJ IDEA 
 
 
<p>When I run tests from the command line with a Java build tool, I often run all the tests.</p>
 
 
 
 <code># Maven
mvn test
# Gradle
gradle test</code> 
 
 
 
<p>When a test fails, I know I can run it as an individual test by adding extra parameters to the command, but I prefer to iterate on tests in IDEA.</p>
 
 
<p>IntelliJ has excellent testing support. When you open a Java test in the editor, there will be a play icon next to your test class and individual methods. Click it and you’ll get the option to run, debug, run with coverage, or edit the configuration.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>I use this support a lot to run and debug individual tests.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also run them at a package level by right-clicking on the page and selecting the Run Tests option.</p>
 
 






You might notice I’m using <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> for my JDK installation. IDEA pairs well with SDKMAN (which is very useful when testing with different vendors/versions).



 
 
 
 
 My Favorite Keyboard Shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA 
 
 
<p>I’m a big fan of keyboard shortcuts because leaving my hands on the keyboard makes me more efficient. Since I do a lot of presentations and use keyboard shortcuts, I use <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7345-presentation-assistant">Presentation Assistant</a> for showing commands during presentations (and learning Windows/Linux commands).</p>
 
 
<p>I also recommend using <a href="https://www.shortcutfoo.com/">ShortcutFoo</a> to learn and practice shortcuts for your favorite IDEs. I learned about this site from <a href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s">Venkat Subramaniam</a> a few years ago.</p>
 
 
<p>Below are some of the IntelliJ IDEA keyboard shortcuts I use daily.</p>
 








macOS Shortcut
Windows/Linux
Purpose




<p>⌘+Shift+N</p>
<p>Ctrl+Shift+N</p>
<p>Find files</p>


<p>⌘+E and ⌘+Shift+E</p>
<p>Ctrl+E and Ctrl+Shift+E</p>
<p>Recent files and Recent locations</p>

<p>Press Ctrl twice</p>

<p>Run Anything (e.g., <code>mvn compile</code>)</p>



 






How cool are Asciidoctor’s <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#ui-macros">UI Macros</a> for keyboard shortcuts?!



 
 
<p>You can also use ⌘+Shift+A to pop an actions dialog and search for commands. Heck, you can even create your own shortcuts!</p>
 
 
<blockquote><p>Assign shortcuts to frequently used actions, menu items or features, if they don't already have one. Use Project Settings -&gt; Keymap, or Find Action -&gt; Alt+Enter. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IntelliJTopShortcut?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IntelliJTopShortcut</a> <a href="https://t.co/uv8Joj2fHT">pic.twitter.com/uv8Joj2fHT</a></p>— JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (@intellijidea) <a href="https://twitter.com/intellijidea/status/1318461975844724736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2020</a></blockquote> 
 
 
 
 
 IDEA’s Command-Line Launcher 
 
 
<p>Did you know you can install a command-line launcher (Tools &gt; Create Command-line launcher) and open projects from your terminal? For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># Maven
idea pom.xml
# Gradle
idea gradle.build
# Figure it out for me
idea .</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-the-ide-features-from-command-line.html#arguments">IDEA CLI has other commands</a> like <code>diff</code> and <code>format</code> too, but I’ve never used them.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Markdown and AsciiDoc Support 
 
 
<p>I write blog posts like this one as much as I write Java code. I was a big fan of writing HTML until I spent a year writing mostly Markdown. Now, I prefer Markdown over HTML, and
AsciiDoc is even better!</p>
 
 
<p>I like AsciiDoc because it supports things like table of contents, code blocks with callouts, admonitions (tip, note, etc.), and I used it (along with Asciidoctor) to write the <a href="http://www.jhipster-book.com/">JHipster Mini-Book</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>IntelliJ IDEA bundles Markdown support, and it works "good enough" when I have to write in Markdown.</p>
 
 
<p>I use the <a href="https://intellij-asciidoc-plugin.ahus1.de/">IntelliJ AsciiDoc Plugin</a> for AsciiDoc authoring. This plugin has gotten so good over the past few years, I do almost all my authoring in IDEA and only render it via build tools as a QA process.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Local History is Fantastic! 
 
 
<p>IntelliJ’s Local History support can be a lifesaver. I try to edit all text-based files in IDEA because of this feature. If things crash or I want to go back to what I’d written before, local history works excellent for that.</p>
 
 
<p>Simply right-click on a file or directory and go to Local History &gt; Show History.</p>
 
 
 
 
 IntelliJ Live Templates 
 
 
<p>An awesome way to pre-record code snippets for demos and increase your productivity is to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-live-templates.html">Live Templates</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>For Java, some built-in ones are <code>sout</code> and <code>fori</code>. You type those characters, hit tab, and it expands to the code you want.</p>
 
 
<p>I use live templates for almost all my screencasts and keep them updated at <a href="https://github.com/mraible/idea-live-templates">github.com/mraible/idea-live-templates</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, here’s my <code>ss-resource-config</code> shortcut that configures Spring Security to be an OAuth 2.0 resource server.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import com.okta.spring.boot.oauth.Okta;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        // @formatter:off
        http
            .authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        // @formatter:on

        Okta.configureResourceServer401ResponseBody(http);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To add new live templates, select the code you want to save, then go to Tools &gt; Save as Live Template. You can also use variables in your template that you can tab to change after you expand it.</p>
 
 






Make sure you test your templates before doing a demo because sometimes they get saved for the wrong context!



 
 
 
 
 Web Framework Support 
 
 
<p>If you’re a hard-core Java developer, you might not care about web framework support. That is, unless your web framework requires Java code, like Wicket or GWT. Personally, I’m a fan of JavaScript and don’t trust Java developers to write my JavaScript for me. I’m a full-stack developer, and I ❤️ <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a>! 🤓</p>
 
 
<p>I first switched to IntelliJ IDEA in 2006 because of its Maven multi-module support. I stuck with it because I switched to mostly front-end development in 2009. I found that IDEA’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript support is excellent. It picks up my ESLint settings automatically and just works.</p>
 
 
<p>Support for Angular is bundled, and there are lots of React plugins. I’ve never installed any because I haven’t had a need. As far as Vue is concerned, there’s a <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9442-vue-js">Vue.js plugin</a> from JetBrains.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn More About Java and IntelliJ 
 
 
<p>I’ve heard from many developers that they prefer to use Eclipse or NetBeans because they’re free. If you were a carpenter, would you look around for free tools, or would you buy new fancy tools that make you a better carpenter? 😏</p>
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed reading about why I love IntelliJ! If you’re curious about IDEA’s support for specific Java frameworks, see the following links. Note that these are all features of the Ultimate edition.</p>

<p>We are often asked by prospects evaluating open source identity and access management platforms about the difference between the Gluu Server and Keycloak.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, we have not deployed or operated Keycloak. However, at a high level, we can offer a few points of differentiation between the two platforms.</p>
 Product vs. Project 
<p>There is a big difference between a project and a product. There are long term and short term projects, but by nature projects are temporary and are often not suitable for mission critical production environments. Products, on the other hand, need to live in production for many years.</p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the Keycloak website (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RH-SSO product derives from a specific version of the Keycloak community and is maintained, patched, and supported by Red Hat commercially for as long as the terms of your support contract. The Keycloak community project, on the other hand, is never patched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, by RH’s own admission, Keycloak open source offering is a bleeding edge project that is never patched.</p>
<p>The Gluu Server Community Edition, on the other hand, is a product that is in production at many organizations.</p>
 Niche vs. Pure Play 
<p>Choosing an IAM platform is a long term decision. Once you start building the platform into your larger enterprise architecture, the switching costs become extremely high.</p>
<p>Keycloak and RH SSO contribute no meaningful amount to RH’s bottom line, and RH may or may not continue to invest in the software. We’ve seen in the past RH say “the liability of the product exceeds the revenue opportunity.” It’s not enough to patch a server. The SSO market is moving fast as new vulnerabilities and application development paradigms emerge. Is RH committed for the long term to not only support, but to innovate?</p>
<p>Gluu’s whole business is built around the Gluu Server. Gluu will never stop innovating (or end of life) our flagship product.</p>
 Support 
<p>Red Hat does not provide commercial support for Keycloak. They instead derive product offerings (i.e. RH SSO) from community projects (i.e. Keycloak) which are branded and maintained separately.</p>
<p>Gluu, on the other hand, makes a large investment in supporting our customers and the open source community alike. We do not hold back features for a commercial version. Everyone gets the same Gluu Server software bits.</p>
<p>We rely on large organizations with mission critical requirements to <a href="https://gluu.org/pricing">pay for support</a>, but that doesn’t stop us from helping the open source community of DIYers and small (and large!) businesses adopt and use this critical security tool.</p>
 OS specific 
<p>Gluu is committed to building packages for many popular Linux distributions, currently Red Hat, Centos, Ubuntu, and Debian.</p>
 Team vs. Company 
<p>Our experience is that developers ask a lot of hard questions, the criticality of support is high, and a fast response time is critical. As Keycloak / RH SSO is a small part of RH’s business, it may take time for Redhat to get the right team engaged on a production (or development) issue.</p>
<p>Gluu’s whole company is focused on the Gluu Server, and our business, support and developer staff is engaged in supporting and extending the product each and every day.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>As a pure play IAM vendor, Gluu will never end-of-life the Gluu Server, or waver from its commitment to support and innovate our open source platform.</p>
<p>Options are good for consumers, and we like to see other organizations offer open source identity and access management tools to the community. In fact, we make use of the good ones (like Shibboleth) in our stack!</p>
<p>Our recommendation: use Keycloak at your own risk… you may be locked into an obscure, end-of-lifed product in the not too distant future.[:]</p>

 The future of Web3 identity has&nbsp;arrived <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a brand new SDK for building with decentralized identity and user-centric data from the 3Box Labs team. IDX is in alpha but if you’d like to start experimenting, <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">join our discord</a> and jump into the&nbsp;<a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">docs</a>.</p> A new era for Web3 development <p>The Web3 vision for an internet that is open and interoperable, where users control their information requires a decentralized, cross-platform identity system. To this end, IDX is an open source JavaScript/TypeScript library that exposes high-level developer APIs to various meta-protocols and standards for decentralized identity. Not only is IDX powerful and flexible enough to meet all of your user and data management needs, but it wraps everything in an easy-to-use package that makes decentralized identity accessible to all Web3 developers.</p><p>Designed to be cross-platform and highly configurable, IDX is compatible with all blockchains, wallets, and a wide variety of user and application data storage options including <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, <a href="https://textile.io">Textile</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org">OrbitDB</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://sia.tech">Sia</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/">Secure Data Stores</a> — so you can seamlessly integrate decentralized identity with the rest of your Web3 tech stack. With IDX, developers can now build much more sophisticated and powerful Web3 applications that rival and even exceed what’s currently possible on&nbsp;Web2.</p> Why decentralized identity? <p>If you’ve ever asked yourself any of these questions, then you should definitely consider adding a decentralized identity system to your development stack.</p>  How can I create a universal identifier to associate data resources from a variety of platforms to a single&nbsp;user?  How can I improve my user experience with decentralized social profiles?  How can users create a unified Web3 identity that links many different accounts within and across various blockchain platforms?  How can users establish trust and reputation by connecting their Web3 identity to existing Web2 social accounts (i.e. Twitter), various anti-sybil systems (i.e. <a href="https://brightid.org">BrightID</a>), domain names (i.e. DNS, <a href="https://ens.domains">ENS</a>, <a href="https://handshake.org/">Handshake</a>), and identity verification services (i.e.&nbsp;KYC)?  How can users create a universal and portable social graph of followers, friends, and contacts?  How can I store user and application data in various centralized and decentralized data storage technologies in a way that isn’t siloed to my application, gives users ultimate control and portability over their data, and works with all of their existing wallets/accounts?  How do I discover and import data that a user has created on another application, platform, or network so that I can use it inside my&nbsp;app?   IDX: An open identity framework for&nbsp;Web3 <p>Decentralized identity and user-centric data management are complex, broad-ranging capabilities that touch almost every other aspect of your app architecture. IDX removes the all of the guesswork from implementing these in a scalable and future-proof way.</p> Build with unified digital identities <p>Using IDX, all applications can access a shared, globally-available identity layer that contains unified users identities. Built 100% on permissionless protocols, IDX enables users and their most important information to seamlessly flow and interoperate across platforms, while giving users the ownership and control they demand. In a way, the identity capabilities offered by IDX sort of function as a decentralized Keybase but with much greater flexibility and decentralization.</p>A unified digital footprint!<p>The core of each identity consists of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> which acts as a globally-unique ID and an <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/cip/idx/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">identity index</a> which keeps track of an identity’s information. IDX allows developers to deploy identities as well as create, read, update, and delete a variety of metadata and information related to the identity, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Multiple user profiles for different contexts or applications  Portable social graphs, from followers to contacts and&nbsp;family  Links to multiple blockchain accounts from different protocols (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, NEAR, Flow,&nbsp;etc)  Links to existing social accounts (Twitter, Github, Discord, Matrix,&nbsp;etc)  Links to domain names (DNS, ENS, Unstoppable, Handshake, etc)  <p>All DIDs, identity indexes, and metadata are securely stored on Ceramic’s permissionless document management network. Because all information is publicly available (but optionally encrypted) and linked via the identity index, any bit of information can be cross-resolved by querying based on any other information. For example you could lookup a user’s profile based on their DID, their Ethereum account, or their Twitter handle; or you could lookup a user’s Filecoin account based on their Polkadot account. We are working with <a href="https://thegraph.com">The Graph</a> on indexing these identity structures which will open up many new opportunities in this&nbsp;realm.</p> Integrate with data storage solutions <p>Unified identities are the gateway to a world of additional functionality for your application. If you also need a way of storing and managing user data, you have three main&nbsp;options.</p>  Use the IDX library to directly store documents on the Ceramic Network and add references to those documents in the user’s index. For this option, no additional software is needed; it works out of the box with&nbsp;IDX.  Store data in alternative data storage systems such as Filecoin, IPFS, Sia, Arweave, Textile, OrbitDB, Secure Data Stores, or Ethereum contracts and use IDX to add references to this data in your user’s index. For this option, you would need to separately install these technologies in your app alongside IDX.  Use a combination of the different data storage solutions above for your application, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, while mapping everything in your user’s&nbsp;IDX.  <p>Whichever data storage configuration you choose, IDX allows all data to be controlled by the user, discoverable by others, and portable across platforms. This is true regardless of where the data resides (servers or decentralized networks) or which application first created the&nbsp;data.</p>The identity index contains mappings to various data&nbsp;sources Share data across applications and&nbsp;silos <p>As described above, the key aspect of IDX that de-silos information, promotes interoperability, and enables user control is the identity index. It provides a standard interface which allows any application or developer to set and query all available data that belongs to a user so that they might make use of it within their application. The identity index serves as the information root for each user and makes everything discoverable.</p><p>To further promote interoperability, the identity index allows developers to:</p>  Publish schemas, names, and descriptions for data points they are adding to the index, so others can more easily consume this information  Publish endpoints for where this information can be found, whether a DocID on Ceramic, a CID on IPFS/Filecoin, a contract on Ethereum, or an endpoint for a hosted&nbsp;service  Request permission to access encrypted data points in the&nbsp;index   Developing with&nbsp;IDX <p>The following section outlines how to get started building with IDX. For more supporting materials, <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">read the&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> Installation <p>First, we’ll need to install the main IDX library and associated dependencies:</p> npm install @ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client @ceramicstudio/idx @ceramicstudio/idx-constants  Query an&nbsp;identity <p>Then we can use these libraries to connect IDX to a Ceramic network and interact with the documents associated to a given DID. This example shows how to simply query the basic profile for a given&nbsp;user.</p> import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client'<br>import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'<br>import { definitions } from '@ceramicstudio/idx-constants'  // Use Ceramic devnet<br>const ceramic = new Ceramic('&lt;https://ceramic.3boxlabs.com&gt;')  // Use IDX-provided definitions aliases<br>const idx = new IDX({ ceramic, definitions })  // Get the basic profile of a known DID supporting IDX<br>async function getProfile(did) {<br>  return await idx.get('basicProfile', did)<br>}  Save data <p>More advanced examples involving authentication and setting content can be found in the <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/guide-authentication">IDX documentation</a>.</p><p>Remember, IDX is still in alpha. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on what we’ve built or how to use it, please <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">reach out on&nbsp;Discord</a>.</p> About <p>IDX is an open source library that is built and maintained with 💜 by the 3Box Labs team, creators of <a href="https://github.com/3box/3box-js">3Box.js</a>, a leading decentralized identity and data storage solution for Ethereum that has been used by 30,000+ users and 1,000+ projects. IDX is a smarter, mature evolution of 3Box.js. All DIDs and profiles created using 3Box.js will be automatically migrated to IDX once the library goes into production. We are working on various solutions to migrate user data that has been saved in spaces and threads to other IDX compatible data storage systems including Ceramic, Textile, and OrbitDB.

<p>We are delighted to announce that we are building on <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot,</a> a sharded blockchain that seamlessly connects multiple chains together in a single network with the aim of accelerating the integration of both ecosystems and increasing levels of trust and data sovereignty for users across the industry. Parity Technologies, one of the drivers behind the Polkadot ecosystem, will provide Ontology with technical support to integrate its Decentralized Identity (DeID) solution, making it available on a range of other blockchains within the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>The integration of Ontology’s DeID is part of a wider effort for Ontology to build a parachain on Polkadot. We envision that the parachain will provide a series of credit-based services on decentralized identity and cross-chain communication. These credit services will include OScore as well, our newly launched credit scoring system designed to seamlessly accelerate the potential to borrow or lend based on a user’s cryptocurrency transaction and asset management history.</p><p>In addition, this parachain will bring cross-chain liquidity to the Polkadot network. Through this, we wish to further accelerate the development of the DeFi ecosystem and lower the barrier of entry for developers. An example of how this is implemented in the DeFi space is the recently launched Wing platform — a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi platform purely dedicated to the practices of lending digital assets governed by the Wing DAO community. This will in turn boost the liquidity of digital assets such as ONT, ONG and DOT. Ontology plans to bid on a parachain slot and create one of Polkadot’s first Initial Parachain Offerings (IPO).</p><p>Eric Wang — the Ecosystem Development Lead at Parity, stated that “Ontology is an industry leader in the development and deployment of decentralized identity solutions. We look forward to working closely with the Ontology team to increase the use of ONT ID 2.0 through Polkadot to realize the benefits of digital identity, privacy for DeFi projects and&nbsp;beyond”.</p><p>Parity’s Head of Engineering in Asia, Yaoqi Jia said “the Parity Asia team consists of talented engineers who are very excited to provide support to help guide Ontology in creating a truly impactful parachain.”</p><p>Developed over the past couple of months, the Ontology <a href="https://github.com/siovanus/DID-substrate">parachain</a> currently consists of a DID Substrate pallet, with plans for further integration of other custom components. Further plans for the Ontology parachain include:</p>  Ontology OScore — an off-chain DID authorization mechanism to manage wallet-identity relationships and provide ID-based credit scores for on-chain actions related to digital&nbsp;assets.  The integration of Ontology’s distributed data exchange framework (DDXF), permitting both token association and data tokenization.  Expanding DID’s use cases from users to also include data and resources, providing authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for DID based resource instances via on-chain data access control with data-tokens (tokenization), and association of its value. DDXF provides on-chain AAA for data interoperability cross&nbsp;systems.  <p>Through the integration of our bespoke digital identity and credit-based solution into the Polkadot ecosystem, along with the help of Parity’s leading engineering team, this collaboration will further accelerate user trust, privacy, and data sovereignty, as well as empower the development of the broader DeFi sector. Ontology looks forward to joining forces with more ecosystem allies to redefine trust and connect the missing pieces of a decentralized financial ecosystem.</p><p>About Polkadot</p><p>Polkadot is a sharded blockchain that seamlessly connects multiple diverse chains together in a single network, allowing them to exchange data securely and process transactions in parallel. In this way, Polkadot solves major scalability issues that have impeded blockchain development. Polkadot has also introduced a highly advanced open governance system that will allow the network to innovate and grow at a much more rapid pace than legacy networks. Applications from decentralized finance and energy to IoT and gaming will thrive on Polkadot, challenging the centralized platforms of Web 2.0.

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language">Security Assertion Markup Language</a>, more commonly known as SAML, is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties. Most commonly these parties are an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider_(SAML)">Identity Provider</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_(SAML)">Service Provider</a>. The primary use case for SAML has typically been to provide single sign-on (SSO) for users to applications within an enterprise/workforce environment.</p>

<p>Up until the past few years, SAML was considered the industry standard—and proven workhorse—for passing an authenticated user into applications while allowing these applications to defer authentication to a centralized identity solution. However, with the introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect">OpenID Connect</a>, which is an authentication layer built on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0">OAuth2</a>, SAML has become outdated. Furthermore, every year seems to bring new issues with SAML – in the form of newly discovered exploits – which is giving it a reputation of not being the most secure option. That being said, SAML is still considered a relevant option for single sign-on and there are still requirements for developers to support it in modern environments. If OpenID Connect is not an option, and SAML is a requirement, this blog will cover a simple approach to add SAML 2.0 support to an ASP .NET Core 3.1 application so that it can accept authenticated users from an Identity Provider and track that users authenticated state within the .NET middleware.</p>

 Prerequisites 

<p>Install <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1">.NET Core 3.1</a></p>

<p>Install an Editor/IDE such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> or <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a></p>

<p>Learn about <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/">Basic SAML Concepts</a></p>

 Getting Started 

<p>First, create an application to function as a SAML Service Provider. Open a command shell, <code>cd</code> to a preferred directory to create the project in and enter the following command:</p>

   <code>dotnet new webapp -o Okta_SAML_Example
</code>   

<p>This command will create a new web app from a template and put it in a directory called Okta_SAML_Example.</p>

<p>If this is your first-time using .NET Core, you may need to trust the development certificate. To do this, use the following command and enter your admin password if prompted:</p>

   <code>dotnet dev-certs https –trust
</code>   

<p>Next, enter the Okta_SAML_Example directory:</p>

   <code>cd Okta_SAML_Example
</code>   

<p>Finally, run the sample application to make sure that it works:</p>

   <code>dotnet watch run
</code>   

<p>Once the application has started, navigate to <a href="https://localhost:5001">https://localhost:5001</a> in your preferred web browser. Using <code>watch run</code>, instead of <code>run</code> by itself, allows the compiler to detect changes in the code and recompile every time it sees them. This is very helpful when iterating on the code. Type <code>CTRL + C</code> in shell to terminate.</p>

<p>Unlike .NET Framework, .NET Core is missing some XML and cryptology libraries that are very important when implementing SAML. Thankfully, there are some great open source solutions that exist for .NET Core 3.x, which reimplements these concepts and others to make supporting SAML easy. After evaluating multiple such solutions, I have found that working with <a href="https://github.com/ITfoxtec/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2">https://github.com/ITfoxtec/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2</a> was the most enjoyable experience for me.</p>

<p>Add the required packages by running the following commands:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2 --version 4.0.8
dotnet add package ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.MvcCore --version 4.0.8
</code>   

 Login With SAML 

<p>The first step is to configure the application to use SAML for authentication. Open <code>Startup.cs</code>. Start by adding the following using statements:</p>

   <code>using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2;
using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.Schemas.Metadata;
using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.MvcCore.Configuration;
</code>   

<p>Next, find <code>ConfigureServices()</code>, and add the following code below <code>services.AddRazorPages();</code>:</p>

   <code>public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRazorPages();

    services.Configure&lt;Saml2Configuration&gt;(Configuration.GetSection("Saml2"));

    services.Configure&lt;Saml2Configuration&gt;(saml2Configuration =&gt;
    {
        saml2Configuration.AllowedAudienceUris.Add(saml2Configuration.Issuer);

        var entityDescriptor = new EntityDescriptor();
        entityDescriptor.ReadIdPSsoDescriptorFromUrl(new Uri(Configuration["Saml2:IdPMetadata"]));
        if (entityDescriptor.IdPSsoDescriptor != null)
        {
            saml2Configuration.SingleSignOnDestination = entityDescriptor.IdPSsoDescriptor.SingleSignOnServices.First().Location;
            saml2Configuration.SignatureValidationCertificates.AddRange(entityDescriptor.IdPSsoDescriptor.SigningCertificates);
        }
        else
        {
            throw new Exception("IdPSsoDescriptor not loaded from metadata.");
        }
    });

    services.AddSaml2();  
}
</code>   

<p>Find <code>Configure()</code> and add the following after <code>app.UseRouting()</code>;</p>

   <code>app.UseSaml2();
</code>   

<p>Still within <code>Configure()</code>, find the <code>app.UseEndpoints()</code> method and add the following new code below <code>endpoints.MapRazorPages()</code>;</p>

   <code>app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
{
    endpoints.MapRazorPages();

    endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
        name: "default",
        pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
});
</code>   

<p>The application will now use SAML for authentication. Next, add a controller to handle the authentication routing. Create a new file in the root project folder called <code>AuthController.cs</code> and start by adding the following:</p>

   <code>using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2;
using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.Schemas;
using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.MvcCore;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Okta_SAML_Example.Identity;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;
using System.Security.Authentication;

namespace Okta_SAML_Example.Controllers
{
    [AllowAnonymous]
    [Route("Auth")]
    public class AuthController : Controller
    {
        const string relayStateReturnUrl = "ReturnUrl";
        private readonly Saml2Configuration config;

        public AuthController(IOptions&lt;Saml2Configuration&gt; configAccessor)
        {
            config = configAccessor.Value;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you have created the foundation of your authentication controller by referencing the required dependencies, adding the basic controller layout, and bringing in the configuration object for your routes to use.</p>

<p>The next step is to create a route for <code>Login()</code>. Add the following code right after the <code>AuthController()</code> method.</p>

   <code>[Route("Login")]
public IActionResult Login(string returnUrl = null)
{
    var binding = new Saml2RedirectBinding();
    binding.SetRelayStateQuery(new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; { { relayStateReturnUrl, returnUrl ?? Url.Content("~/") } });

    return binding.Bind(new Saml2AuthnRequest(config)).ToActionResult();
}
</code>   

<p>This route handles a user initiating login from your application directly. In SAML, this is called <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#planning-for-saml">SP Initiated</a> because the authentication request is starting from your Service Provider application. You will eventually call this route from a login button in your nav. During this process, a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#planning-for-saml">SAML Request Assertion</a> is generated and sent to the Identity Provider via a redirect to an Identity Provider URL. This assertion is just XML with basic information about the request. In SAML there is also a concept called <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#planning-for-saml">IDP Initiated</a>. This is when the user starts in an Identity Provider and clicks a link to get into your Service Provider application. The IDP Initiated flow simply bypasses the login route, and SAML Request, entirely.</p>

<p>Next, you will need an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#planning-for-saml">Assertion Consumer Service</a>. This is the route that your Identity Provider will send the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#planning-for-saml">SAML Response Assertion</a> to. Right after the <code>Login()</code> route, add the following:</p>

   <code>[Route("AssertionConsumerService")]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; AssertionConsumerService()
{
    var binding = new Saml2PostBinding();
    var saml2AuthnResponse = new Saml2AuthnResponse(config);

    binding.ReadSamlResponse(Request.ToGenericHttpRequest(), saml2AuthnResponse);
    if (saml2AuthnResponse.Status != Saml2StatusCodes.Success)
    {
        throw new AuthenticationException($"SAML Response status: {saml2AuthnResponse.Status}");
    }
    binding.Unbind(Request.ToGenericHttpRequest(), saml2AuthnResponse);
    await saml2AuthnResponse.CreateSession(HttpContext, claimsTransform: (claimsPrincipal) =&gt; ClaimsTransform.Transform(claimsPrincipal));

    var relayStateQuery = binding.GetRelayStateQuery();
    var returnUrl = relayStateQuery.ContainsKey(relayStateReturnUrl) ? relayStateQuery[relayStateReturnUrl] : Url.Content("~/");
    return Redirect(returnUrl);
}
</code>   

<p>This route is the meat and potatoes of your SAML implementation. This code receives the SAML Response from the Identity Provider, validates its signature via a signing certificate, decodes it, validates claims, creates an authenticated session with the middleware, and parses claims for later use.</p>

<p>Last, you will need a logout route to allow the user to logout from your application and kill the session with the middleware. Add the following below the Assertion Consumer Service route.</p>

   <code>[HttpPost("Logout")]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Logout()
{
    if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        return Redirect(Url.Content("~/"));
    }

    var binding = new Saml2PostBinding();
    var saml2LogoutRequest = await new Saml2LogoutRequest(config, User).DeleteSession(HttpContext);
    return Redirect("~/");
}
</code>   

<p>This route will be mapped to a logout button in your nav and it will delete the user’s session, logging them out. This is not a Single Log Out route, which could also be supported, that would also log the user out of the Identity Provider. Often it is not desired to log a user out of the Identity Provider when logging them out of the Service Provider, because the user may be using it for other applications.</p>

<p>In the Assertion Consumer Service route, there is a class called <code>ClaimsTransform</code>. This is a helper class that we need to implement to help parse the claims out of the SAML Response. Create a new file in the root directory of the project called <code>ClaimsTransform.cs</code>. Add the following:</p>

   <code>using ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.Claims;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Claims;

namespace Okta_SAML_Example.Identity
{
    public static class ClaimsTransform
    {
        public static ClaimsPrincipal Transform(ClaimsPrincipal incomingPrincipal)
        {
            if (!incomingPrincipal.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return incomingPrincipal;
            }

            return CreateClaimsPrincipal(incomingPrincipal);
        }

        private static ClaimsPrincipal CreateClaimsPrincipal(ClaimsPrincipal incomingPrincipal)
        {
            var claims = new List&lt;Claim&gt;();

            // All claims
            claims.AddRange(incomingPrincipal.Claims);

            // Or custom claims
            //claims.AddRange(GetSaml2LogoutClaims(incomingPrincipal));
            //claims.Add(new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, GetClaimValue(incomingPrincipal, ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)));

            return new ClaimsPrincipal(new ClaimsIdentity(claims, incomingPrincipal.Identity.AuthenticationType, ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, ClaimTypes.Role)
            {
                BootstrapContext = ((ClaimsIdentity)incomingPrincipal.Identity).BootstrapContext
            });
        }

        private static IEnumerable&lt;Claim&gt; GetSaml2LogoutClaims(ClaimsPrincipal principal)
        {
            yield return GetClaim(principal, Saml2ClaimTypes.NameId);
            yield return GetClaim(principal, Saml2ClaimTypes.NameIdFormat);
            yield return GetClaim(principal, Saml2ClaimTypes.SessionIndex);
        }

        private static Claim GetClaim(ClaimsPrincipal principal, string claimType)
        {
            return ((ClaimsIdentity)principal.Identity).Claims.Where(c =&gt; c.Type == claimType).FirstOrDefault();
        }

        private static string GetClaimValue(ClaimsPrincipal principal, string claimType)
        {
            var claim = GetClaim(principal, claimType);
            return claim != null ? claim.Value : null;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to modify your nav to show the login/logout buttons. You also want to add a nav button to take the user to a secured page which will display their SAML claims. Open <code>_layout.cshtml</code> and find the Home button:</p>

   <code>&lt;ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"&gt;
    &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
            &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Index"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
    ~
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code>   

<p>Remove everything in the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> after the Home button. Between the <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code>, at the spot above indicated by the <code>~</code> in the snippet above, replace the existing code with the following:</p>

   <code>@if (((System.Security.Claims.ClaimsIdentity)User.Identity).IsAuthenticated)
{
    &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Claims"&gt;SAML Claims&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        @if (User.Identity.Name != null)
        {
            &lt;span class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello, @User.Identity.Name!&lt;/span&gt;
        }
        else
        {
            &lt;span class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;
        }
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;form class="form-inline" asp-controller="Auth" asp-action="Logout"&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
}
else
{
    &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-controller="Auth" asp-action="Login"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
 }
</code>   

<p>This code shows the login button and hides the logout and claims buttons when the user is not logged in. It shows the logout and claims button, hiding the login button, when the user is logged in.</p>

<p>The next step is to create the Claims page, which is a secure page that can only be accessed once a user has authenticated.</p>

<p>Create two new files in the <code>Pages</code> folder of the project. <code>Claims.cshtml</code> and <code>Claims.cshtml.cs</code>.</p>

<p>Claims.cshtml:</p>

   <code>@page
@model ClaimsModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
}

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;The users Claims (Iteration on User.Claims)&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            @foreach (var claim in User.Claims)
            {
                &lt;strong&gt;@claim.Type&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="padding-left: 10px"&gt;Value: @claim.Value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
            }
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Here you are simply iterating on User.Claims, which will contain all claims from the SAML Response.</p>

<p>Claims.cshtml.cs:</p>

   <code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Okta_SAML_Example.Pages
{
    [Authorize]
    public class ClaimsModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;ClaimsModel&gt; _logger;

        public ClaimsModel(ILogger&lt;ClaimsModel&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public void OnGet()
        {

        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This is the base model for your Claims page. The most important part here is the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute before the class initialization that indicates that this page will require a user to authenticate. If you navigate to the claims page directly before authenticating, you will be redirected to authenticate first.</p>

<p>Lastly, add your configuration settings to <code>appsettings.json</code>. This is where you are pulling your SAML configuration settings from. Open <code>appsettings.json</code> and add the following code before <code>"AllowedHosts": "*"</code>:</p>

   <code>"Saml2": {
    "IdPMetadata": "{IDP MetaData URL}",
    "Issuer": "Okta_SAML_Example",
    "SignatureAlgorithm": "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256",
    "CertificateValidationMode": "ChainTrust",
    "RevocationMode": "NoCheck"
  },
</code>   

<p>In this example, you are pulling your SAML settings from the IDP’s metadata. This is a great feature of SAML that allows you to pull a config from the source rather than having to copy each setting, and the signing certificate, into your code.</p>

 Configure An IDP 

<p>You have added all of the code that is required to implement SAML support to your Service Provider application. To test, you will need an Identity Provider. <a>Okta</a> is the single best identity platform on the market and supports SAML, as well as OpenID Connect and other standards. If you have not created a free Okta developer tenant, do so at <a>developer.okta.com</a>.</p>

<p>Log in to your Okta tenant, switch to the admin portal, and switch to the classic UI if you are in the developer UI.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Applications, Add Application, Create New App, and select the SAML 2.0 radio button before clicking Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Give your app a name and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In Single Sign on URL, enter <code>https://localhost:5001/Auth/AssertionConsumerService</code></p>

<p>In Audience URI, enter <code>Okta_SAML_Example</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select the I’m an Okta customer adding an internal app radio button and click Finish.</p>

<p>You will be taken to the Sign On tab of the newly created app in Okta. Click the hyperlink under View Setup Instructions that says Identity Provider metadata. This will open a new tab to your metadata. Copy the URL from this hyperlink and add it to your <code>appsettings.json</code> file in the IdpMetadata attribute. This will save you from having to copy all of the settings from Otka into your code.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Last, you’ll need to make sure that your user is allowed to use this app in Okta. Click on the Assignments tab, click the Assign button, and click Assign to People.</p>

<p>Click the Assign button next to your user, and then click Save and Go Back.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You are now ready to test your application.</p>

 Try It Out 

<p>Return to your command shell, type:</p>

   <code>dotnet watch run
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Navigate to <a href="https://localhost:5001">https://localhost:5001</a> in a private browser window once the application is running.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Login and login with your user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once redirected back to your application, you will see that your nav shows that you are logged in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Claims to see your claims within the secure page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Logout.</p>

<p>Close the browser and open a new private window.</p>

<p>Attempt to navigate directly to <a href="https://localhost:5001/claims">https://localhost:5001/claims</a> to ensure that you are forced to login before being allowed to access the page.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>You now have an, ASP .Net Core 3.1 web application functioning as a SAML Service Provider using Okta as the Identity Provider. As new secure pages are created, using the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute in the page model, or in a controller route, will ensure that only authenticated users are allowed access. The complete project code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/nickgamb/Okta_SAML_Example">GitHub</a>.</p>

   Nearly half of CIOs say they now employ artificial intelligence (AI) or intend to within the next 12 months. But how to make AI a core IT competency still eludes most organizations.

  <p>Nearly half of CIOs say they now employ artificial intelligence (AI) or intend to within the next 12 months. But how to make AI a core IT competency still eludes most organizations. Boards of directors, CEOs and customers want to use AI to power real improvements in customer and employee experience.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It might sound counterintuitive, but do as few proofs of concept (POCs) as possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Promoting positive habits to get the best value from the technology is an important way to make it more commonplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37038"]</p>
<p>“The idea that your habits are intentional is key to understanding how to address AI in this modern capacity,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/16534/Whit-Andrews">Whit Andrews</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during his session at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/symposium-us">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo 2020®</a>. “Think about these habits in a way that is strategic; it’ll make a huge difference.”</p>
 Habit No. 1: Use mixed-role AI teams for every AI project&nbsp; 
<p>Organizations that have the highest effectiveness in making AI an integral part of business strategy use mixed-role AI teams for all AI initiatives. These organizations strongly believe that aligning AI to business initiatives is a way to deliver value. Both the diversity of the team and how that variety is applied across all initiatives is key.&nbsp;</p>

 Habit No. 2: Invest in variety for the mixed-role teams (train members if you have to)&nbsp; 
<p>Organizations where AI has “significant value” have 14% more roles on AI teams. It’s most common to have roles like AI researchers and data scientists because AI always originates with data. Plus, it is key to have the technical acumen those roles bring on an AI team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, roles like project managers, strategists, application designers and others are vital to the diversity of thought and background this type of work requires. Different backgrounds and perspectives on AI will improve <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-prevent-ai-dangers-with-ethical-ai/">AI ethics</a>, an understanding of the value of AI to customers, how it should be used and where it can have the biggest impact. This will enable the team to deliver significant business value.&nbsp;</p>
 Habit No. 3: Include top executives in strategy and funding 
<p>Organizations that assign <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-budget-planning-hacks-for-ai-projects/">AI budget</a> to a corporate function at the C-level are almost two times more likely to reach maturity level 4. Associating the budget with a sponsor at a high corporate level means the executive offers a sense of what the organization needs, so the AI team can address that and be the voice that explains the value AI has for the organization. They are able to communicate, at a C-suite level, how data aligns to business strategy and corporate goals.&nbsp;</p>
 Habit No. 4: Do AI with a purpose and measure it&nbsp; 
<p>Organizations that measure financial or risk impact for AI projects are more likely to be successful than those that don’t. Embracing metrics enables organizations to showcase how AI can be used across the enterprise by highlighting its benefits and risks in certain areas. For example, the ability to analyze videos or images might start in the security realm, but with some maturity could be used to analyze organizations’ brand presence or understand how customers react to products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">The CIO's Guide to Artificial Intelligence</a></p>
<p>This is not to say that every project must guarantee a positive ROI, but regardless of outcome, it must be measured to see what is possible.&nbsp;</p>
 Habit No. 5: Limit the number of POCs 
<p>It might sound counterintuitive, but do as few proofs of concept (POCs) as possible. In past years, one of the key messages organizations heard surrounding AI was to try everything and see what works, then focus on maturing what worked. However, organizations now increasingly understand what AI can do for them and when the technology should be avoided.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations that are now exploring AI in their operations do about 20% fewer POCs than organizations that only plan to employ it. A deliberate approach to POC selection and deployment will deliver substantial benefits.</p>

[Image: <a href="https://techthelead.com/lab-grown-baby-corals-might-just-save-the-great-barrier-reef-from-climate-change/">AIMS</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en">CC-BY-3.0 AU</a>] Summary <p>The upcoming <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">Ocean Market</a> app enables people and organizations to earn by staking / curating on data and by selling data. This article focuses on staking on data. (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-selling-data-in-ocean-market-9afcfa1e6e43">This one</a> focuses on selling.)</p><p>In staking, you earn a cut of the transaction fees as a liquidity provider (LP). Staking is a curation signal tending towards higher quality datasets. Stakers will earn additional rewards from <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Ocean Data Farming</a> program, when it launches.</p><p>Staking incurs these risks, which cannot be&nbsp;ignored.</p>  Staking incurs the risk of impermanent loss (IL) — when the pool’s ratio of OCEAN to datatokens changes, compared to when you initially staked.  Staking also has the risk of a rug pull. This is is typically when a datatoken publisher pulls out their stake, in OCEAN. Therefore, remaining stakers’ OCEAN holdings in the pool drops, causing a&nbsp;loss.  <p>The rest of this post elaborates.</p> Datatokens &amp; Ocean&nbsp;Market <p>Each data service gets its own Ocean datatoken. A datatoken is an ERC20 token that wraps access to a dataset or a compute-to-data service. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">This blog</a> introduces Ocean datatokens.</p><p>The Ocean Market app makes it easy to create a datatoken for a given data service, and to consume a datatoken to access that service. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">This blog</a> introduces Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> Automated Market Makers&nbsp;(AMMs) <p>An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a robot that’s always ready to buy or sell. An AMM is a pool holding two assets, let’s say TOK1 and TOK2 tokens. Anyone can add TOK1 or TOK2 tokens to this pool. If you buy TOK1 tokens from the pool, its price (in terms of TOK2) is the based on the ratio of # TOK1&nbsp;: # TOK2 tokens. And, vice versa for buying&nbsp;TOK2.</p><p>AMMs are the heart of modern decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like <a href="http://www.balancer.exchange">Balancer</a> and <a href="http://uniswap.exchange">Uniswap</a>. To learn more about AMMs, <a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/background">here’s</a> a&nbsp;start.</p> OCEAN-Datatoken Pools <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/lets-talk-about-data-pricing-part-i-bbc9cf781d9f">Pricing</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/value-of-data-part-two-pricing-bc6c5127e338">data</a> is traditionally hard; automated price discovery promises to make this&nbsp;easier.</p>  An order book approach to auto-pricing requires many actors to place bids and asks, which would not be feasible when launching a new data&nbsp;asset.  AMMs also do auto-pricing. Unlike order books, they don’t many actors to function well. Due to this, Ocean Market uses AMMs to auto-price datasets.  <p>Ocean Market makes it easy to create an OCEAN-datatoken AMM pool, and to buy and sell datatokens for OCEAN. True to form, the AMM auto-adjusts the price as datatokens are bought and&nbsp;sold.</p> Staking in Ocean with OCEAN-Datatoken Pools <p>OCEAN-datatoken pools are the basis for staking in&nbsp;Ocean:</p><blockquote>OCEAN staking is the act of adding liquidity to an OCEAN-datatoken AMM pool. By staking, you become a liquidity provider&nbsp;(LP).</blockquote> Staking Rewards from Transaction Fees <p>When you stake on a datatoken pool, you earn staking&nbsp;rewards:</p>  From transaction fees for sales (buying &amp; selling datatokens) in that&nbsp;pool  From Ocean Data Farming rewards (when it launches).  <p>This section elaborates on (1); the next section on&nbsp;(2).</p><p>The creator of the OCEAN-datatoken pool sets the transaction fee going to stakers. This fee is a percentage of sales volume. The higher the sales volume, the more you earn. The default fee is 0.1%, but it could be 1% or 5% or&nbsp;more.</p><p>Stakers get paid proportional to how much liquidity they have provided, compared to other&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>For more revenue, a good strategy is to stake on data assets with high sales volume, especially “undiscovered gems” with little stake so far by others. This will give you a greater cut of the transaction fee&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>Staking rewards from transaction fees flow immediately into the pool. Therefore all the pool’s stakers collectively get more OCEAN liquidity with each&nbsp;sale.</p><p>You can always increase or decrease the total amount staked in a pool, via the “add liquidity” and “remove liquidity” actions. You can un-stake anytime; the funds enter your wallet immediately. Withdrawal includes the portion of staking&nbsp;rewards.</p> Staking Rewards from Data&nbsp;Farming <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Ocean Data Farming</a> is an upcoming program to reward stakers further. The amount of rewards will be a function of stake in the pool, amount of consumption of a data asset, and likely more factors. Time is a possible factor. We will release more information when the program launch&nbsp;nears.</p> Risk: Impermanent Loss <p>Staking in OCEAN-datatoken AMMs has potential to earn transaction fees and data farming rewards. However, like all AMMs, there is also the risk of impermanent loss (IL). IL occurs whenever the ratio of (# OCEAN)&nbsp;: (# datatokens) diverges from when you initially staked (value of&nbsp;1.0).</p><p>So, if OCEAN goes up relative to the datatoken value, or if the datatoken goes up compared to the OCEAN value, then you have impermanent loss.</p><p>The image below illustrates.</p>  The blue curve is the value of your holdings in the OCEAN-datatoken AMM, as a function of price&nbsp;ratio.  The orange curve is the value of your holdings if you simply held OCEAN and datatoken separately, without them being in AMMs. (With all else being equal, and with zero fees and rewards.)  [Image: University of&nbsp;Orleans]<p>The loss is called impermanent because if the ratio reverts to 1.0, then IL = 0.0. But don’t let this lull you into a false sense of security: that 1.0 ratio may never come back, and loss becomes permanent as soon as you withdraw.</p> Rug Pulls <p>A rug pull is an attack that results in stakers losing funds. Here are some ways it might&nbsp;happen:</p>  A pool publisher creates a pool and adds initial liquidity (thereby having 100% initial stake), waits for others to stake in OCEAN, then withdraws their stake as&nbsp;OCEAN.  A pool exists and many have staked OCEAN into it. The publisher mints a lot more datatokens into the pool, thereby gaining a much larger % stake, then withdraws their stake as&nbsp;OCEAN.  <p>Here’s the mechanics.</p>  If one stakes just in datatokens, part of those datatokens are swapped for OCEAN already in the pool. Similar for OCEAN: if one stakes just in OCEAN, part of that OCEAN is swapped for datatokens already in the pool. The pool maintains its weight ratio (e.g. 10% OCEAN - 90% datatokens or <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1322134558121336837">50%-50%</a>).  In both cases, the staker receives BPT tokens, which represent % stake in the pool’s holdings (of datatokens and OCEAN). BPT tokens don’t represent % stake in just OCEAN or just datatokens; they represent stake in both according to the pool’s weight&nbsp;ratio.  It’s the publisher who tends to have more supply of datatokens (at first, as well as the potential to mint more later). Others only initially start with OCEAN because they have to purchase datatokens, or stake into the pool to get both. But when they stake, they get BPTs which represent ownership in both&nbsp;tokens.   A Quirk of OCEAN-Datatoken Pools <p>This is a quirk that is neither good nor bad, but useful to understand. When an OCEAN-datatoken pool is first created, the only person able to add datatoken liquidity to the pool will be the publisher of the datatoken. Anyone else can then add OCEAN. For the non-publisher to add liquidity, someone needs to first buy the datatoken and then they be able to add liquidity for that datatoken.</p><p>This means that we can expect that when a new OCEAN-datatoken pool is first released, with OCEAN staked by others, the price of the datatoken will go up at first (as denominated in&nbsp;OCEAN).</p> On Being Profitable <p>To put it all together:</p><blockquote>profit = (transaction fees) + (farming rewards) - (impermanent loss) - (rug pull&nbsp;loss)</blockquote><p>Rug pulls can be viewed as a special case of IL, but to make the risk more clear, we provide it as a separate term. Risk of rug pull is&nbsp;real.</p><p>We want profit to be &gt;0, of course. What can help is to increase transaction fees, and to reduce IL. Let’s explore each&nbsp;further.</p><p>Here are tactics to increase transaction fees:</p>  Choose OCEAN-datatoken pools to maximize (# sales transactions) * (% fee in pool). This means finding ways to increase sales transactions, or simply increasing % fee. For the latter, fees that are too high may hurt transaction volume; but we do not yet know the sensitivity of fee to&nbsp;volume.  <p>Here are key tactics to reduce impermanent loss (IL) and rug&nbsp;pulls:</p>  First, improve your understanding of AMMs, IL, and rug pull mechanics. This will help you to better understand the risk-reward tradeoff and tactics. We link to some starting points&nbsp;below.  Second, avoid OCEAN-datatoken pools with a high chance of rug pull. You need to use your own judgement on this. Reputation is a key factor. Higher-reputation parties may be less likely to do a rug pull because they’ll want to maintain their reputation. Pseudonymous accounts will be less trustworthy and will need to build up a reputation over time. There are opportunities for the Ocean community to collectively build up knowledge of actors’ behavior over time and make assessments of reputation, to help in decisions of where to&nbsp;stake.  Another tactic to address IL is to monitor the price ratio, then pull out if the ratio changes by more than 10% or so. The exact number depends on the tradeoff to earning potential by transaction fees.  <p>Here are a couple more&nbsp;things.</p>  OCEAN-datatoken pools are powered by Balancer tech. This tech only lets LPs withdraw 1/3 of liquidity in any given transaction. This softens potential rug pull effects, but only a bit since an attacker could do several transactions in a row to remove most liquidity.  Finally, builders of AMM technology are working on various mechanisms to reduce the ill effects of impermanent loss. Balancer V2, Bancor V2, Uniswap V3 and others will have mechanisms to help. These will be released in coming&nbsp;months.  <p>Everyone using this technology must understand that they are using it at their own risk. And there are risks. Some may be uncomfortable adding liquidity due to the risk of impermanent loss or rug pulls. That’s ok. There’s definitely a risk-reward tradeoff. For those who with lower risk tolerance, another way to earn in Ocean is by finding and selling data itself. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-selling-data-in-ocean-market-9afcfa1e6e43">Here’s more info</a>. Second, we anticipate that tools and monitoring will improve over time, to make staking easier and less&nbsp;risky.</p> Learning More <p>To learn more about AMM pools, here are a couple places to&nbsp;start:</p>  Balancer documentation on AMMs&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/background">here</a>.  Uniswap documentation on AMMs&nbsp;<a href="https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works/">here</a>.  <p>To drill more into impermanent loss, these references are&nbsp;useful:</p>  “What is Impermanent Loss?” video at finematics.com, <a href="https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/">here</a>.  Cointelegraph article&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-impermanent-loss-on-uniswap-and-other-amms-is-always-permanent">here</a>.  Bancor article&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22">here</a>.  <p>Finally, there’s nothing like actually using the tools to gain intuition. We encourage you to play with adding liquidity on Balancer and Uniswap, e.g. to add and remove liquidity on OCEAN-ETH pools. Pay particular attention to the transaction fees earned, the liquidity mining earnings (BAL via <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-liquidity-mining-begins-6e65932eaea9">Balancer’s program</a>, <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/">UNI via Uniswap’s</a>), and the Impermanent Loss.</p>  <a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xa6cf0a736fbb441b3cd39a476699eeec4737f28e/">Here’s</a> the OCEAN-ETH pool on Balancer.  <a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x9b7dad79fc16106b47a3dab791f389c167e15eb0">Here’s</a> the OCEAN-ETH pool on&nbsp;Uniswap.   Conclusion <p>This brief post described how staking in Ocean Market: balancing the earning opportunities with the risks towards profitability.</p><p>AMMs are powerful tools with pros and cons.

Privileged accounts have traditionally been given to administrators to access critical data and applications. But changing business practices and upgrades to IT including cloud and other trends has meant that users of privileged accounts have become more numerous and widespread. An area in sharp focus is agile development teams such as DevOps and others that need secure access to privileged resources in the cloud; support for these has become essential to many organizations. Such teams need rapid access to privileged accounts, credentials and protected data, and PAM vendors are responding to this demand.</p>

  <p>In this post, I’m going to show you how to set up a light that will turn on when you’re in a Zoom call. The color of the light will show your mute status, red will indicate that you’re muted, and green if you are not muted.</p>





<p>Because Zoom doesn’t provide a native interface for determining mute status, I will instead use a tool called Hammerspoon to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Note: Unlike most software for macOS, Hammerspoon requires a bit of effort to get working. Be ready to use of your terminal and favorite text editor to get Hammerspoon configured.</p>

 What is Hammerspoon? 

<p>If you aren’t familiar with Hammerspoon, it can be a bit hard to describe. I think of it as a programmer’s multi-tool for modifying the behavior and extending the capabilities of macOS. Hammerspoon does this by exposing a large variety of macOS functionality via a clean <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a> interface.</p>

<p>The malleable nature of Hammerspoon gives it a lot of power, but it also makes it hard to describe. You can use Hammerspoon to configure hotkeys, act as a window manager, set timers, track your time, automate tasks, create desktop widget and more. I learned how to use Hammerspoon via the excellent blogs posts “<a href="https://prodtyping.com/blog/hyperkey-hammerspoon">Give your computer superpowers with a Hypekey and Hammerspoon</a>” and “<a href="http://evantravers.com/articles/2020/06/08/hammerspoon-a-better-better-hyper-key/">Hammerspoon: A Better, Better Hyper Key</a>”. I recommend these posts if you want to learn more about Hammerspoon after you read this blog post.</p>

 How to install Hammerspoon 

<p>If you use Homebrew, you should be able to install Hammerspoon via brew:</p>

   <code>brew cask install hammerspoon
</code>   

<p>Otherwise, review <a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/#how-do-i-install-it">“How do I install it?” on hammerspoon.org</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve installed Hammerspoon, you’ll want to make sure that you have a configuration file for it.</p>

<p>Do this by making sure that you have a <code>~/.hammerspoon</code> directory with a file named <code>init.lua</code> in it using these commands:</p>

   <code>mkdir ~/.hammerspoon
touch ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua
</code>   

 Install the Zoom Spoon 

<p>The next thing that you’ll need to do is install the unofficial Hammerspoon plug-in I wrote for Zoom. Hammerspoon calls plug-ins “Spoons” so I call this unofficial plugin the Zoom Spoon.</p>

<p>Spoons are installed into their own sub-directories in the <code>~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/</code> directory.</p>

<p>The code for my unofficial Zoom Spoon is stored on GitHub, so we’ll be using <code>git</code> to install the Zoom Spoon for Hammerspoon.</p>

<p>Start by making sure that you have a <code>Spoons</code> directory in your Hammerspoon configuration directory:</p>

   <code>mkdir -p ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons
</code>   

<p>Next, use <code>git</code> to check out a copy of my unofficial Zoom Spoon:</p>

   <code>cd ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons
git clone https://github.com/jpf/Zoom.spoon.git
</code>   
 Getting Familiar with Hammerspoon and Testing Out the Unofficial Zoom Spoon 

<p>At this point, you should have Hammerspoon and my unofficial Zoom Spoon installed. So now I’m going to show you how to test out your setup and make sure it’s working.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is to launch Hammerspoon. Note that Hammerspoon is a GUI app, so navigate to where you installed the Hammerspoon app and launch it.</p>

<p>After launching Hammerspoon, make sure that it has the “Show menu icon” preference selected. Do this by opening Preferences for Hammerspoon and selecting Show menu icon, or by running this command:</p>

   <code>defaults write "org.hammerspoon.Hammerspoon" "MJShowMenuIconKey" '1'
</code>   

<p>At this point, you should see a new icon that looks like a hammer with a spoon handle in your menu bar. You may need to restart Hammerspoon if you don’t see this icon.</p>

<p>When you can see the icon, click on the icon and select Open Config from the menu. This will open up the <code>~/.hammerspoon/init.lua</code> configuration for Hammerspoon in your favorite text editor.</p>

<p>Once the <code>~/.hammerspoon/init.lua</code> configuration file is open, use your favorite text editor to add the following lines to the file:</p>

   <code>hs.loadSpoon("Zoom")
spoon.Zoom:start()
</code>   

<p>Save the file, then click on the Hammerspoon menu icon, and select Reload config, then click on the the Hammerspoon menu icon again to select Console.</p>

<p>At this point, should see the Hammerspoon console, and it should look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, at first glance, this console appears to be just a message log. Not so! You can also interactively run Lua in this console, which is exactly what we’re going to do now.</p>

<p>To test out the unofficial Zoom Spoon, run this command in the Hammerspoon console:</p>

   <code>spoon.Zoom:inMeeting()
</code>   

<p>If Zoom is already open, and in a meeting, this command should return <code>true</code> otherwise, it’ll return <code>false</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>If the command returned <code>false</code> like in the image above, then quit and reopen Zoom, start a meeting, and re-run the command. This time around, it should return <code>true</code></p>

<p>If this doesn’t work, it probably means that you need to give Hammerspoon permission to control your computer. To do this, open System Preferences, and go to 
Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy &gt; Accessibility,
unlock the preference pane to make changes, then select the checkbox next to “Hammerspoon” to allow Hammerspoon to inspect the state of Zoom.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you get the <code>spoon.Zoom:inMeeting()</code> command working, two others for you to try are <code>spoon.Zoom:mute()</code> and <code>spoon.Zoom:unmute()</code> try out both while you have a live Zoom meeting running and see what happens!</p>

 Configure Hammerspoon to use the Zoom Spoon 

<p>At this point, you should be able to run the <code>spoon.Zoom:mute()</code> and <code>spoon.Zoom:unmute()</code> commands to mute and unmute a Zoom meeting. However, this isn’t really any more useful than what you can already do with Zoom, so in this section I’ll be showing you how to set up a mute indicator in your menu bar.</p>

<p>Note: Zoom provides a global mute and unmute hotkey out of the box! If all you care about is a global mute and unmute hotkey, I suggest using that!</p>

<p>Because I assume that most people don’t have a <a href="https://blink1.thingm.com/">blink(1)</a> USB LED already, I’m going to show you how to do the next best thing which is to simulate this LED in your menu bar.</p>

<p>To get this set up, use the Hammerspoon menu icon and select “Open Config” to open the <code>~/.hammerspoon/init.lua</code> file in your favorite text editor, then edit the file to look like this:</p>

   <code>-- This lets you click on the menu bar item to toggle the mute state
zoomStatusMenuBarItem = hs.menubar.new(nil)
zoomStatusMenuBarItem:setClickCallback(function()
    spoon.Zoom:toggleMute()
end)

updateZoomStatus = function(event)
  hs.printf("updateZoomStatus(%s)", event)
  if (event == "from-running-to-meeting") then
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:returnToMenuBar()
  elseif (event == "muted") then
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:setTitle("🔴")
  elseif (event == "unmuted") then
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:setTitle("🟢")
  elseif (event == "from-meeting-to-running") then
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:removeFromMenuBar()
  end
end

hs.loadSpoon("Zoom")
spoon.Zoom:setStatusCallback(updateZoomStatus)
spoon.Zoom:start()

hs.hotkey.bind('', 'f5', function()
  spoon.Zoom:toggleMute()
end)
</code>   

<p>After you’ve finished editing the configuration file, save it, then use the Hammerspoon menu icon to select Reload Config.</p>

<p>Now it’s time to test it out. After selecting Reload Config from the Hammerspoon menu icon, reload Zoom and start a meeting. Shortly after the meeting starts, you should see a new menu icon appear in your menu bar. The icon will be green if you are unmuted and red if you are muted. Pressing the <code>F5</code> key will toggle between the muted and unmuted states and then update the menu icon as appropriate.</p>

<p>Note: The status indicator light will only change if you use the Hammerspoon key (<code>F5</code> in this case). It should be possible soon to keep it in sync no matter how Zoom is muted or unmuted, just not at the time that I’m writing this.</p>
 Setting up a blink(1) USB LED (and a giveaway!) 

<p>Now that we’ve gotten a menu icon to show the mute status for a Zoom meeting, let’s take it one step further and set up a physical light to be a mute status indicator!</p>

<p>The light that I’m using is called a <a href="https://blink1.thingm.com/">blink(1)</a> and is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ThingM-Blink-USB-RGB-BLINK1MK3/dp/B07Q8944QK/">available on Amazon for about ~$30</a>. The nice thing about this light is that it doesn’t require any special drivers to get working, you just plug it in and start using it.</p>

<p>Win a blink(1) USB LED light! I’m raffling off three blink(1) USB LED lights. To enter the raffle follow <a href="https://twitter.com/oktadev">@oktadev</a> on Twitter and then post a tweet mentioning this blog post. On October 31st, I will search for tweets that mention this blog post that were made by people who also follow @oktadev on Twitter. Of those people, I will select three people at random and give each one a blink(1) USB LED.</p>

<p>Now, there are many ways to interface with the blink(1) light, but my programming language of choice is Python, that’s what I’m going to use in this post.</p>

<p>To use the blink(1) light from Python, you’ll need to install the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/blink1/"><code>blink1</code> Python SDK</a>. I use <code>virtualenv</code> to keep my Python packages tidy, so let’s start with that.</p>

<p>Start by creating a directory for this project. I’m suggesting a directory name in the command below, but you should change it to something that makes sense for you.</p>

   <code>mkdir ~/blink
</code>   

<p>Next, <code>cd</code> to the directory you just created and make a new virtualenv for Python.</p>

   <code>cd ~/blink
virtualenv venv
</code>   

<p>At this point, the virtualenv should be activated. Your prompt will contain <code>(venv)</code> if so. If you don’t see <code>(venv)</code> in your prompt, try running:</p>

   <code>source venv/bin/activate
</code>   

<p>Now you’re ready to install the Python SDK for the blink(1) light:</p>

   <code>pip install blink1
</code>   

<p>With the blink1 package installed, we’re ready to write some code that uses it. Below is the source code for a small Python program that I wrote to control the blink(1) light from the command line:</p>

   <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
from blink1.blink1 import Blink1
import sys
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("-r", "--red", default=0, type=int, help="Value for red (0 - 255)")
parser.add_argument("-g", "--green", default=0, type=int, help="Value for green (0 - 255)")
parser.add_argument("-b", "--blue", default=0, type=int, help="Value for blue (0 - 255)")
parser.add_argument("-d", "--delay", default=50, type=int, help="Light shift time in milliseconds")
args = parser.parse_args()

b1 = Blink1()
b1.fade_to_rgb(args.delay, args.red, args.green, args.blue)
</code>   

<p>Copy the code above into a file named <code>blink.py</code> and then try running it from the command line:</p>

   <code>python blink.py --green 128
</code>   

<p>This should turn the light green at about half brightness.</p>

<p>Turn it off with this command:</p>

   <code>python blink.py
</code>   

 Connecting Hammerspoon to the blink(1) USB LED 

<p>Now that you have a working Hammerspoon setup and a working Python script to control the blink(1) light, it’s time to tie them together!</p>

<p>Start by selecting Open Config from the Hammerspoon menu icon, then edit the <code>~/.hammerspoon/init.lua</code> file to look like the code below. Make sure to replace the path to the Python scripts with the path for your system!</p>

   <code>updateZoomStatus = function(event)
  hs.printf("updateZoomStatus(%s)", event)
  if (event == "from-running-to-meeting") then
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:returnToMenuBar()
  elseif (event == "muted") then
    hs.execute([["/Users/joel/Projects/mute/venv/bin/python" "/Users/joel/Projects/mute/blink.py" "--red" "128"]])
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:setTitle("🔴")
  elseif (event == "unmuted") then
    hs.execute([["/Users/joel/Projects/mute/venv/bin/python" "/Users/joel/Projects/mute/blink.py" "--green" "128"]])
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:setTitle("🟢")
  elseif (event == "from-meeting-to-running") then
    hs.execute([["/Users/joel/Projects/mute/venv/bin/python" "/Users/joel/Projects/mute/blink.py"]])
    zoomStatusMenuBarItem:removeFromMenuBar()
  end
end
</code>   

<p>Once you’ve finished modifying the <code>updateZoomStatus()</code> function, save the file, then use the Hammerspoon menu icon to select the Reload Config menu item.</p>

<p>Try it all out by reloading Zoom and starting a meeting. If it’s all set up correctly, the blink(1) light should turn on shortly after the meeting starts!</p>

 Note for Zoom employees 

<p>If you are an employee of Zoom, I have a special message for you: I wish I could have made a mute indicator light without Hammerspoon.</p>

<p>My ideal way to integrate with Zoom would be to configure it to call a command line application every time the state changed inside of Zoom. In this dream scenario, I imagine opening up the Zoom preferences and putting the path to an executable file into a field somewhere. From then on, Zoom would call that executable file passing the event over the command line. In essence, I’d like to turn the <code>updateZoomStatus()</code> Lua function in my Hammerspoon configuration into a command line script.</p>

   When a department store in China realized customers would not be able to access its brick-and-mortar location during the COVID-19 quarantine, it partnered with an outside organization to focus on a new channel — social marketing. Using its own employees and sales clerks to host, the organization reported that one livestream event generated the same revenue as pre-coronavirus weekly in-store sales.

<p>Essentially all businesses were affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Those that demonstrated innovation increased business model resilience and adapted to the new business environment.</p>
<p>“Under such challenging circumstances, China provides some great examples of business model resilience among companies within traditional industries,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/87462">Daniel Sun</a>, VP Analyst, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/symposium-us">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Two types of Chinese organizations demonstrated strong <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/create-a-resilient-business-model-in-the-face-of-covid-19/">business model resilience</a>: Those that leveraged digital giants in their business plan successfully and those with a strong automation foundation.&nbsp;</p>
 Partner with digital giants&nbsp; 
<p>With movie theaters closed during the coronavirus outbreak, a media company risked losing millions of dollars on a soon-to-premiere movie. The company partnered with a digital media platform to distribute the movie. As a result, the media company earned $91 million and a share of advertising.</p>
<p>More than 40% of CIOs and IT leaders consider their relationship with <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-become-a-digital-dragon/">digital dragons</a> to be tactical and view them solely as technology providers. Less than 2% of businesses think of the digital giants as strategic business partners. These large enterprises can help scale cloud or provide payment and digital business platforms, but CIOs must first identify how they can be used to modify current business models.</p>
<p>It’s likely CIOs might shy away from partnering with their competition, but the reality is that many of these partnerships have proven successful for both parties.</p>
<p>Organizations can partner with digital dragons in five different ways:</p>
 
 No relationship: Organizations may choose to have no relationship with digital dragons for a number of reasons, including that the dragons are direct competitors, they don’t see the need for the benefits the dragons can provide or they deem the risk too high.&nbsp; 
 Customer-supplier relationship: This is the most common type of relationship. The organization is a customer of the dragon’s products and services.&nbsp; 
 Channel/platform relationship: Organizations use the dragon’s demand-side platforms and ecosystems, marketplaces and connections to the customer to increase reach. 
 New customer value partnership: The organization works with a dragon, each partner contributing specific assets and capabilities to provide new disruptive value to customers that neither could easily deliver alone.&nbsp; 
 Investment partnership: The organization invests alongside a dragon in researching and building new opportunities. 
 
 Leverage automation successfully&nbsp; 
<p>The loan application process can be cumbersome and complicated, which is not ideal for organizations looking for loans to fund the business during a pandemic. A bank in China invested heavily in automating its loan application process, leading to a supply chain product with online application review, verification, online lending and automated approval. This reduced the approval process time to 30 minutes, making it an attractive offering for businesses.</p>
<p>It’s not possible to automate every piece of the business, but look for vulnerable areas with frequent human error, slow completion time and tedious manual work. Once these areas are identified, work with business stakeholders to match them with the key automation technology. Focus on the three key technologies of robotic process automation (RPA), intelligent business process management suites (iBPMS) and integration platform as a service (iPaaS).</p>
<p>CIOs should consider several common areas of automation, including accounts payable, travel experiences, accounting, invoice delivery, sales operations, contract management and even payroll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For organizations looking to establish automation during COVID-19, recognize that hiring an entirely new team isn’t feasible. Instead, look to current employee skill sets. Focus on minimum viability automations over fully comprehensive automation and keep stakeholders looped into the process so the end result focuses on key business priorities.</p>

 Passwords are a burden on businesses and consumers. They’re expensive, insecure and difficult to manage — they must be eliminated. <p>Since the world went into lockdown, <a href="https://www.teiss.co.uk/covid-19-related-phishing-attacks-grew-by-600-worldwide/">hacking and phishing threats rose by over 600%</a>. With threats caused by compromised and weak credentials still rising by the day, one thing is clear: passwords are no longer able to fulfil the simple role they were designed&nbsp;for.</p> The problem with passwords  1. Stolen passwords are a top attack&nbsp;vendor <p>Stolen and weak passwords are one of top tools that criminals use when attempting to breach corporate networks. According to Verizon, stolen credentials and phishing attacks were the top cyberattack vendors last year, with at least <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/80-of-hacking-related-breaches-leverage-compromised-credentials/">eight in ten hacking incidents being tied back to compromised credentials.</a></p>Research from the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report 2020 found that stolen credentials and phishing attacks are still one of the top methods used by hackers to launch attacks on businesses. 2. Complex password policies are disregarded <p>To make matters worse,<a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/infographic-95-percent-share-6-passwords-with-friends.html"> employees often disregard password policies altogether,</a> with password sharing and reuse rampant in organizations. Unsprisingly, password sharing makes malicious actors coming across a set of company credentials extremely likely, giving them the power they need to launch large-scale attacks.</p> 3. Password costs skyrocketing <p>Organizations spend millions every year in a futile attempt to bolster the password. According to the World Economic Forum, a company with just 15,000 employees will spend <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">$5.2 million per year</a> for password resets alone, or a shocking $346 per employee.</p> There is good news: 99% of all hacks can be eliminated with multi-factor authentication — <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/">Microsoft</a> <p>Yet according to a study by LastPass, only <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/57-percent-of-businesses-use-multi-factor-auth-mfa-says-lastpass/">57% percent of companies have implemented some form of multi-factor authentication.</a></p> Why are companies resisting strong authentication? <p>Multi-factor authentication solutions are not as widely adopted as they should be because legacy market solutions are too cumbersome on users and/or too expensive to deploy at scale. Making things even more complicated is the fact that there’s also major security red flags with some legacy multi-factor authentication solutions.</p><p>Legacy MFA solutions combine memorized secrets (passwords, PINs, secret answers), which are easily compromised, with secondary devices like (smartcards, hardware tokens or one-time codes sent via text to the user’s&nbsp;device).</p><p>While some MFA methods are indeed secure, others like those that rely on SMS-tokens, are not. For example, The Telegraph reports that over a five year period, UK customers<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/30/bank-customers-lose-91-million-five-years-sim-swap-scams/"> lost over £9 billion in sim swapping&nbsp;attacks.</a></p><blockquote>According to Verizon, human error is a top contributing factor to breaches and&nbsp;hacks.</blockquote><p>It should go without saying that human error and diligence play a major role in the effectiveness of legacy multi-factor authentication solutions. However, how diligent can a business expect its employees and users to be when attacks are becoming ever more sophisticated, and employees are under unprecedented amounts of pressure?</p> A simple, secure and passwordless alternative. <p>Keyless provides a simple, secure and interoperable authentication solution that allows organizations to solve the trade-offs between security, privacy and convenience.</p> Seamless user-experience combined with powerful&nbsp;security <p>At Keyless we combine seamless authentication with unparalleled security by providing a frictionless, passwordless solution for the workforce that is multi-factor by&nbsp;design.</p><p>Instead of relying upon memorized secrets to authenticate users, Keyless leverages advanced biometrics to authenticate a user in mere milliseconds — and all the user has to do is look into the camera of their trusted&nbsp;device.</p>The 3 authentication factors — knowledge (something you know), possession (something you have), inherence (something you&nbsp;are).<p>Replacing passwords with something the user is (their unique biometrics) not only greatly reduces friction during the authentication experience, but also eliminates threats caused by poor password management and human&nbsp;error.</p><p>Our solution is not dependent on third party vendors, which means it can be rolled out regardless of what platform and operating systems are being used, or what device a user&nbsp;owns.</p> Multi-factor by&nbsp;design <p>By leveraging the user’s device as a built-in second factor, Keyless provides seamless multi-factor authentication without the user needing to remember anything or carry additional devices (hard tokens, smart cards) with&nbsp;them.</p> Unparalleled privacy  Keyless is the only biometric, passwordless solution that combines the security of distributed systems with privacy-enhancing technology to store and process authentication data. <p>Keyless builds upon novel cryptographic techniques that allow our network to compare encrypted biometric templates — without decrypting them — in a matter of milliseconds. Because templates are never decrypted, they can be safely stored in the cloud where no personal information about the user can be extracted.</p><p>Storing encrypted, biometric data on our distributed network ensures that sensitive information is never stored on a user’s device, where there is risk of it being linked to a user’s identity if the device is lost or&nbsp;stolen.</p> Universal solutions for a global workforce <blockquote>True privacy, security and convenience can only be achieved with universal solutions that work from anywhere in the world, on any device, at any&nbsp;time.</blockquote><p>Our biometric multi-factor authentication solutions can be quickly integrated and deployed to a globally distributed workforce to enhance security and privacy — no matter what devices or operating systems employees use on their personal&nbsp;devices.</p><p>To ensure seamless and fast deployment, Keyless is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing identity management systems like ForgeRock, Okta and Ping Identity.</p><p>Since Keyless Solutions are device-agnostic and designed to integrate with existing systems, companies can save on costly and unnecessary overhauls to their current security infrastructure — meaning they can offer strong authentication quickly, at an affordable cost.</p><p>Keyless workforce multi-factor authentication solutions can be used&nbsp;for:</p> <a href="https://docsend.com/view/jcgqd8ppz8jzeuw3">Want to learn more about our workforce authentication solutions?

   Learn why the backbone of your IT stack may be overdue for an upgrade before it slows down productivity 

<p>The beautiful thing about IT is that it just runs. You open up your laptop, access your applications, and stay productive and focused throughout your day. The technology that goes on behind the scenes is somewhat irrelevant to your average user.</p>

<p>So when I say “directory services,” you may be tempted to move on and watch some cat videos on YouTube. Stay with me, humble reader, for herein lies an important message.</p>

 What are directory services? 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/directory-services">Directory services</a> are the databases that store some of the most essential information you need to do your job. They are often referred to as data stores, LDAP, and directories. The information stored in these vessels include your username, password(s), authentication preferences and enrollments, user preferences, application data and, more recently, information on devices such as mobile and Internet of Things (IoT). As you can see, much of this information is identity related.</p>

<p>What happens when you fire up an application? Whether it’s a cloud, mobile, or traditional application, and whether you’re using it for work or otherwise, the application is going to reach out to the one definitive source of identity truth in your organization – the directory. This is to validate that you’re still a legitimate user of the organization, that you’re authorized to access the application and to find out what you can do with it. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>But these days, directory services are under siege. Many organizations deployed their directory services many years ago, in the pre-cloud years, so they are running what we call “legacy” directories. While they still “work” in the traditional sense, there are reasons – both technical and non-technical – to believe we’re headed for a directory slow down.</p>

<p>The first reason is that the amount of information being put into directories is multiplying exponentially. Consider the “Things” in the Internet of Things (IoT). Estimates are that, in 2020 alone, the number of deployed Things will reach <a href="https://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/01/13/The-IoT-Rundown-for-2020.aspx?Page=1">31 billion</a>! That’s at least four times the number of people on the planet. And all this <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">IoT</a> data is being registered in directories.</p>

<p>The second reason directories are slowing down has to do with the ubiquitous nature of our work and home environments. Where do you work? If you’re like me, your work is anywhere you are. It’s certainly no farther away than your mobile phone or laptop in our hyper-connected world. This reality means directory services need to be distributed and highly available so that you can access the apps and services you need quickly. A slow link or an overwhelmed legacy directory sifting through millions of entries means you’ll wait to be authenticated and connected. Waiting is costly. Waiting is time. The result? Lost customers, decreased productivity for your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce</a> users, unhappy application owners, and a situation that will only get worse if not addressed quickly.</p>

<p>Directory services – the old iron of the business – need to go the way of the mainframe and green screen applications. They need to modernize!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that’s easier said than done. Modernizing directory services is probably not high on the list of projects for your IT database administrator this year. Or next year.</p>

<p>But there is a pathway, and real ROI to be realized by modernizing your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a> (IAM) solutions. It doesn’t have to be painful. ForgeRock has Accelerator toolkits that help organizations upgrade <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">legacy IAM</a> solutions in a prescribed way, so they can go at their own pace. Accelerators are a complete kit of everything you need to get started. They include documentation, reference architecture, and step-by-step processes that allow you to migrate one app at a time or 10 at a time, or many more.</p>

<p>Using a coexistence or just-in-time (JIT) strategy, you can run ForgeRock IAM alongside your existing directory to make sure there is no loss of data or lack of availability to applications. When you’re ready to cut the cord and move to modern IAM, you can disengage your legacy directory and say goodbye to those hefty maintenance costs.</p>

<p>ForgeRock has one of the few directory services on the market today that offers a deployment option to run in containers. A container is a ready-to-run software package that includes everything you need to run your directory service in a Kubernetes or Docker pod. They can run any cloud (or on premises) and use vastly fewer IT resources in your data center.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock</a> also natively supports all the apps you want, provides greater security, offers more fine-grained access control, and works both within and across your data centers.</p>

<p>For organizations to stay agile and productive, your directory services need to keep up with the growing needs or your users and customers. To learn more visit us online<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam"> at https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam</a>.</p>

  <p>2021 needs a reset.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/8-macro-factors-that-will-shape-the-2020s/">COVID-19 pandemic </a>disrupted businesses and global economies in unprecedented ways, but it also forced organizations to consider a different type of future. It became clear that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">businesses need a reset</a>, not only due to the pandemic, but because technological advances demand it.</p>
<p>“Technologies are being stretched to their limits,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/7521/Daryl-Plummer">Daryl Plummer</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/symposium-us">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>. “Nontraditional approaches will enable the next rebound of innovation and efficiency.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37663"]</p>
<p>Plummer presented these Gartner top strategic predictions for 2021 and beyond.</p>
 Traditional technology tanks 
<p>By 2025, traditional computing technologies will hit a digital wall, forcing the shift to new computing paradigms such as neuromorphic computing.</p>
<p>As conventional silicon processors approach performance, economic and sustainability limits, they will limit digital initiatives and innovation, thereby limiting the growth of the business. New computing technologies, like neuromorphic computing — a computer that thinks and acts more like the human brain — will begin to take their place. As these new technologies mature, they will become increasingly available and more affordable for businesses to begin experimentation.</p>

 DNA storage becomes a reality 
<p>By 2024, 30% of digital businesses will mandate DNA storage trials, addressing the exponential growth of data poised to overwhelm existing storage technology.</p>
<p>People are collecting exponential amounts of<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/data-sharing-is-a-business-necessity-to-accelerate-digital-business/"> data</a>, more than has ever been collected before. Increasingly, the main challenge is not collecting the data — it’s storing it long term in a safe way. Right now, most data can be stored for a maximum of 30 years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of human knowledge could be stored in a small amount of synthetic DNA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DNA storage enables the storage of binary digital data in the double helix, taking binary coding and turning it into coding that fits in the human DNA strand. It would mean a year’s worth of human knowledge could be stored in a gram of synthetic DNA for thousands of years. In fact, all of human knowledge could be stored in a small amount of synthetic DNA.</p>
<p>Digital data (i.e., music, video, statistics) would be encoded in the nucleic acid base pairs of synthetic DNA strands. It sounds complex, but the technology is actually well-established and understood.</p>

 Physical experiences expand 
<p>By 2025, 40% of physical-experiences businesses will improve financial results and outperform competitors by extending into paid virtual.</p>
<p>As the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual and augmented reality, digital twins and other technologies evolve, immersive experiences are now more affordable, and more fun. Businesses that provide physical experiences, like rock climbing or white-water rafting, must extend into paid virtual reality, offering virtual experiences that rival the physical ones.</p>
<p>At the same time, COVID-19 transformed attitudes about physical versus virtual, and changed the discussion about what people can do without physically being present or putting their safety at risk.</p>
<p>For example, a virtual bike ride through the mountains from the safety of your home gym or a roller coaster ride from your living room is more appealing to a larger audience. Beyond that, these immersive experiences enable people to relive in-person experiences long after they’re over or even share those experiences in real time with people who can’t join them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Farms and factories face automation 
<p>By 2025, customers will be the first humans to touch more than 20% of the products and produce in the world.</p>
<p>Currently, a lot of people touch products and produce before they reach their ultimate destination, but automated factories and farms will soon do most of the work, including farming, picking, packing and shipping. New technologies are automating most processes, and that ability to automate will change how businesses operate and how they think about their business models.</p>
<p>Again, COVID-19 has acted as an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/prioritize-digital-business-initiatives-to-accelerate-into-the-future/">accelerator</a>, driving the industry to find new and improved ways of getting food and products to consumers. Additionally, as the technology continues to evolve, offering better automated factories — maybe ones that don’t squash the grapes — will one day act as a competitive advantage.</p>
 CIOs become chief operating officers (COOs) 
<p>By 2024, 25% of traditional large-enterprise CIOs will be held accountable for digital business operational results, effectively becoming “COO by proxy.”</p>
<p>A large percentage of end-user businesses do not have a COO, a vital role in digital acceleration. This is someone who understands the business and ecosystem and how to implement technology for greater impact.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has highlighted how CIOs can drive digitalization across the organization — and how CIOs who work across the business on digitalization instead of just focusing on IT are effectively working as COOs.</p>
<p>As a “COO by proxy,” the CIO will take on the organizationwide role and begin to close the gaps between what the technology can do, what the business can do and what the business wants to do. As they close these gaps, they can create business value and selectively create <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable/">composability in the business</a>.</p>
 Record work conversations drive change 
<p>By 2025, 75% of conversations at work will be recorded and analyzed, enabling the discovery of added organizational value or risk.</p>
<p>Every piece of technology, from smart speakers to virtual meetings to messaging platforms, now records conversations. Privacy is an illusion. Organizations need to begin to think about how to collect that data, how to analyze it and how to use it to improve the employee experience.</p>
<p>For example, it might be possible to measure — and work on improving — overall employee satisfaction. However, all this data collection comes at a risk. Create a board of ethics to ensure that the data is used responsibly,<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-principles-for-employee-privacy/"> people’s privacy</a> is respected and an opt-out option is included.</p>
 Freelance customer service experts increase 
<p>By 2025, customers will pay a freelance customer service expert to resolve 75% of their customer service issues.</p>
<p>Everyone has experienced the frustration of a bad customer service setup, and many turn to outside help (Google, YouTube, Facebook) to navigate tricky situations. In fact, Gartner predicts that through 2021, there will be a 15% rise in customers seeking outside help after being frustrated by traditional support channels.</p>
<p>The good news is that this means organizations will have reduced costs in certain customer service areas. The bad news is that more instances of outside help removes an important company-consumer touchpoint.</p>
<p>The best outside help will cost money, which means paying for a faster solution. Organizations should look to build a network of experts to help their customers, but also take the time to understand the legal ramifications of using third-party experts.</p>
 Voice of society metric matters 
<p>By 2024, 30% of major organizations will use a new voice of society metric to act on societal issues and assess the impacts to their business performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “voice of society” is the shared perspective of people in a community — one that works toward acceptable outcomes for all by advocating for fair and equal representation and adherence to ethical values.</p>
<p>Organizations must consider how society affects the performance of the business, and they have a responsibility to reduce or eliminate tone-deaf or insensitive racial and ethical concerns. Failure to do so can be damaging to the business.</p>
<p>Sentiment analysts, media metrics figures and contributions to society measurements will matter in 2021, and opinion metrics are now as reliable as click-through analysis. Organizations need to be able to measure what people are saying, and use composable solutions to react quickly.</p>

 On-site childcare entices employees 
<p>By 2023, large organizations will increase employee retention by more than 20% through repurposing office space as on-site childcare and education facilities.</p>
<p>Worker demand for childcare is still an unmet need, and the impact of COVID-19 on the number of available childcare centers is not to be underestimated. Gartner predicts that by early 2021, 20% of private childcare centers will have closed permanently, leaving a dearth of qualified providers. The impact of this will be especially hard on women in the workforce.</p>
<p>Accessible on-site childcare can increase retention, employee engagement and productivity. Plus, not having to choose between childcare and a job may result in more women in leadership positions over the long term. Organizations with on-site childcare will attract more candidates. This is also an effective way to use empty office space as businesses move toward more remote workers.</p>
 Malicious content takes over 
<p>By 2024, content moderation services for user-generated content will be surveyed as a top CEO priority by 30% of large organizations.</p>
<p>Any organizations that have an online presence, from social media to retailer platforms, face the challenge of how to deal with malicious content. Brand advertisers must neutralize polarizing content, and at the very least, show a balance between views. Eventually, industry standards for content moderation will emerge, but in the meantime, CIOs must invest in content moderation services, enforcement and reporting.<br>

<p>Digital identity innovation transpires in mysterious ways – and none seem as interesting as the recent conclusion of the 90-day experiment that the National Basketball Association ran to complete its season, popularly termed the “bubble”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some individuals (namely, fans of a historic franchise‚ it marked the joyous celebration of its first championship in ten years; for others, it was a somber day (i.e. game 5 Jimmy Butler hopefuls). For this OWI writer, it was mainly an opportunity to reflect upon the unique way in which the NBA chose to leverage digital identity — in particular, physical identity and access management (PIAM) — as well as the broad impact that the bubble will have on the sports industry and digital identity practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/07/16/nba-2020-return-disney-world-bubble-safety-aided-technology/5448594002/">A host</a> of <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/national-sports/sns-nyt-nba-bubble-life-coronavirus-20200806-qrby36mvffhlnkyot45hk7hqha-story.html">technologies</a>, designed to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spreading amongst the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29320883/inside-nba-100-page-safety-plan-big-questions-key-details">814 or so</a> NBA players, staffers, and coaches holed up in Orlando, were crucial to the bubble’s success. While among these, the most eye-catching tech may have been Oura, a $300 smart ring, (with a purported <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-bubble-oura-smart-ring-used-by-quarter-of-campus-2020-8">25%</a> of players, coaches, and staff wearing it), the wearable only acted as a small, optional asset to the larger system of physical identity and access management the NBA had set up in conjunction with Disney. In fact, I’d argue that the more important (and overlooked) technology, with broad ramifications for digital identity in everyday life, were the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2020/07/10/phoenix-suns-monty-williams-explains-essential-gadget-functions-orlando-bubble/5418966002/">Disney MagicBand </a>systems. Not only was it mandatory for every individual in the bubble to possess one, the bands were synchronized against <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/07/16/nba-2020-return-disney-world-bubble-safety-aided-technology/5448594002/">an individual’s health readiness</a> (i.e. forgetting to fill out symptom self-assessment denies entry) to allow entry to different access points. In essence, the NBA bubble created a stunningly successful PIAM system that managed and protected sensitive information and physical resources with appropriately tiered access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There and Back Again: Mapping OWI Predictions to the Present Moment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of our <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/product/the-perimeter-is-dead-148b-physical-access-market-to-lead-iam-growth/">predictions in 2018</a> about the PIAM market — including that border protection and terrorism/physical security would be tantamount as drivers for the market — may persist in being important for the general market. However, one might fairly conclude that during a pandemic seemingly without end in sight, PIAM’s future more closely resembles the NBA bubble: with digital credentials and wearables increasingly being leveraged against physical characteristics to broker access. Part of this shift has already happened with the introduction of old technologies in familiar places, such as <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2020/4/20/21228219/temperature-checks-coronavirus-testing-nyc-restaurants-reopening">temperature checks</a> for restaurants. Other parts of this shift have instead synthesized familiar products with newer contexts, including the use of <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/investigations/nbc-7-responds/artificial-intelligence-is-helping-usd-fight-the-pandemic/2424230/">facial recognition</a> alongside temperature checks to monitor mask usage and to <a href="https://www.usar.army.mil/News/Article/2381059/new-terminal-scanner-screens-temperatures-faces-to-improve-safety-at-usarc-fors/">trace the disease</a> across people to a limited capacity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, such a conclusion willfully ignores what is arguably the largest factor in determining PIAM’s growth – privacy. This concern is especially evident when observing the two technologies that have emerged as predominant modalities for access management: facial recognition and location/contact tracing. Facial recognition has long been somewhat of a hot-button topic for PIAM, and will likely be a bellwether for lasting change to PIAM adoption and public sensitivity. When, for example, Ticketmaster announced in 2018 that it had <a href="http://s1.q4cdn.com/788591527/files/doc_financials/2018/Q1/1Q18-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf">invested</a> in startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17329196/ticketmaster-facial-recognition-tickets-investment-blink-identity">Blink Identity</a> — which claims to be able to identify people walking by in “half a second” — musicians and fans alike were outraged. Numerous of the former called for a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/59n9yb/musicians-demand-ticketmaster-ban-facial-recognition-at-concerts">ban on the technology</a> at live events. &nbsp;Taylor Swift made headlines that same year for leveraging <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/13/taylor-swift-facial-recognition-stalkers-rose-bowl-concert">facial recognition</a> of concert attendees against a database of her known stalkers to administer stadium access. In the present moment, for school systems such as New York, <a href="https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/blog/data-privacy/2020/08/20/new-york-state-suspends-use-of-facial-recognition-in-public-schools">facial recognition technology</a> was placed under a moratorium to preserve privacy where possible. Similarly, contact tracing – spearheaded by nearly four dozen countries and large tech corporations to mitigate COVID-19 spread — has <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/17/contact-tracing-privacy-coronavirus-google-apple/">received significant backlash</a> in the United States for what some perceive to be privacy concerns around the government tracking their location or improper use of collected data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OWI Take</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve noted in our previous analysis that privacy will likely be an enduring issue for both vendors and regulators alike, and we anticipate this to persist even in light of COVID-19. The pandemic shift towards remote onboarding and digitized access has not offset any consumer sensitivity around data misuse or location tracking that have persisted with traditional PIAM products. With the bubble, residents were locked into participating for a few months and were more willing to shed concerns around potential privacy loss. PIAM enhancements were more easily accepted because residents bought into the integrity of the system and into the belief that the system was necessary as the best way to mitigate risk. And for those 90 days, the experiment worked to a tee. For many consumers in their day to day lives, however, the benefits aren’t as clear; some may even feel that because of their perceived ability to choose to engage with high risk environments (e.g. the grocery store), they don’t need enhanced PIAM as the best way to mitigate risk. As a result, consumers will likely continue to be guarded when it comes to their privacy, and the risk-benefit tradeoff for physical access — even during the pandemic — will not shift significantly.</p>

<p>By Jesús Salas, Associate, Responsible Technology</p><p>American consumers are increasingly concerned about privacy and data security when purchasing new products and services, which may be of a competitive advantage to companies that take action towards these consumer values, a new Consumer Reports (CR) study&nbsp;finds.</p><p>The new <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/downloads/CR_PrivacyFrontAndCenter_102020_vf.pdf">study,</a> “Privacy Front and Center: Meeting the Commercial Opportunity to Support Consumers Rights,” from CR’s Digital Lab with support from Omidyar Network, looks at the commercial benefits for companies that differentiate their products based on privacy and data security.</p><p>The report lays out a succinct timeline for the evolution of consumer attitudes toward privacy that culminates with a clear call to action for innovators. Through their comprehensive research methodologies, CR has been able to draw out the nuance around when, why, and how much privacy and security features matter for individuals looking to use and buy security cameras, connected cars, smart speakers, and other products. The report also contextualizes the role that both rule-making through regulation and the supply of better products can have to meet the growing market&nbsp;demand.</p><p>“This study shows that raising the standard for privacy and security is a win-win for consumers and the companies,” said Ben Moskowitz, the director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. “Given the rapid proliferation of internet connected devices, the rise in data breaches and cyber attacks, and the demand from consumers for heightened privacy and security measures, there’s an undeniable business case for companies to invest in creating more private and secure products.”</p><p>Here are some of the key findings from the&nbsp;study:</p>  According to CR’s February 2020 nationally representative survey, 74% of consumers are at least moderately concerned about the privacy of their personal&nbsp;data.  Nearly all Americans (96%) agree that more should be done to ensure that companies protect the privacy of consumers.  A majority of smart product owners (62%) worry about potential loss of privacy when buying them for their home or&nbsp;family.  The privacy and security conscious consumer class seems to include more men and people of&nbsp;color.  Experiencing a data breach correlates with a higher willingness to pay for privacy, and 30% of Americans have experienced one.  Of the Android users who switched to iPhones, 32% indicated doing so because of Apple’s perceived privacy or security benefits relative to&nbsp;Android.  <p>The study draws from a nationally representative CR survey of 5,085 adult U.S. residents conducted in February 2020, a meta-analysis of 25 years of public opinion studies, and a conjoint analysis that seeks to quantify how consumers weigh privacy and security in their hardware and software purchasing decisions.</p><p>Omidyar Network is honored to support this endeavor to both understand and inform the commercial case for investments in security and privacy-enhancing technology. While privacy should not be turned into an out-of-reach luxury, these findings do present an opportunity for companies to be among the first to differentiate and capture market share or leverage consumer’s willingness to pay in the short-term. Over time, we expect many privacy and data security features to become “table stakes,” in which case first movers will innovate and raise standards further.</p><p>Supporting efforts like this is key to our vision of enabling responsible technology that promotes well-being and individual liberty. To accomplish this, we support different levers that drive competition and innovation while safeguarding to manage risks and unintended consequences.</p><p>CR also recently launched an updated and expanded website for the <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard</a> with Omidyar Network joining as a strategic partner. The Digital Standard is an evolving, open source framework used by independent testing organizations, researchers and product teams to evaluate how technologies respect consumers’ privacy and security interests.

  <p>COVID-19 demonstrated how costly a fragile supply chain can be for organizations. When the pandemic became a global issue, organizations shut down, as did borders and governments, which left businesses scrambling for alternate supply chain options. Much of the challenges came from the speed at which things were delivered, with 51% of CIOs reporting a decrease in basic IT equipment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaders don’t expect that COVID-19 will be the last major disruption</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although slow speeds are not a trend CIOs expect will continue in 2021 — 51% foresee&nbsp; an increase in supply chain delivery speed — leaders also don’t expect that COVID-19 will be the last <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-digital-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming-in-the-next-5-years/">major disruption</a>. Moving forward, they are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/">preparing their organizations</a> and bracing for other potential hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1hYzcwNjQwYjEyZjcxMWViOWQ1OWU3ZTMxYjdiODBmYw=="></a></p>
<p>Top-performing companies are revamping supply chains to be more resilient; 40% say they will duplicate key suppliers to create more redundancy. Top performers are also bringing more businesses in-house as well as more sales and delivery. This is a shift from past years, when enterprises focused on developing the lowest-possible-cost supply chains to remain competitive.</p>
<p>Duplicating suppliers creates a more expensive supply chain, but also a more resilient one. Further pulling all those pieces back into the business, whether it’s sales, delivery or anything else, requires major business model changes — from talent shifts to contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line is that organizations don’t know what the future holds, but aggressive changes to business models at top performers reflect a desire to create an organization that can respond to whatever happens in the world. The goal is no longer the cheapest or highest-quality suppliers, but rather what will allow organizations to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">survive the next disruption</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 What to do 
<p>Creating a resilient supply chain will add cost, but CIOs can highlight technologies that will help mitigate some new expenses. For example, hyperautomation can enable manufacturers to locate factories closer to markets, yet remain competitive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider how other organizations are changing their supply chains and use crowdsourcing to create a platform where supply chain executives can submit their bold ideas. This will produce a diverse group of opinions, and reduce groupthink and tunnel vision.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>If you are familiar with any sort of real-time communications over the internet such as GoToMeeting, Google Meet, or Discord then chances are you have used WebRTC.  WebRTC is an open framework for handling real-time communications.  It supports video, voice, or any data between peers.  WebRTC is supported by Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, and many others.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a web application that allows a user to broadcast their video and voice in their room.  This room will be available for other users, called viewers, to join.  The viewers will be able to interact with the broadcaster via a chat functionality that will deliver messages to the entire room.</p>

<p>To create this application you will use Node.JS and Express for the server framework.  Web Sockets will handle the communication between peers in each room.  Okta will manage the authentication and identity for each user.  Finally, WebRTC will manage the broadcasting of the video and voice.</p>

 Create Your Okta Application 

<p>First, navigate to your Okta admin dashboard.  If you don’t have an Okta account yet you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up here</a>.  Once you’ve logged into the admin dashboard navigate to Applications and select Add Application.   On the next page select Web and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, on the Application Settings page, give your application a meaningful name.  You can leave the URLs as they are since you will configure your application to use port 8080 for development.  Click Done and Okta will create your application and bring you to the application page.  On the General tab make sure you note the Client ID and Client Secret as you will need these in your application.</p>

<p></p>

 Build the WebRTC Video Chat Application 

<p>You can now begin to build your application.  Open your favorite terminal and run the command <code>npm init -y</code> to initialize your node application in a folder where your application will live.  You will need some dependencies for your application.</p>

<p>First, Express will be the backbone of your application.  Express is one of the most popular web application frameworks for Node.js.  Also, you will want to install Express-Session at this time for session management.</p>

   <code>npm i express@4.17.1
npm i express-session@1.17.1
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need the Okta OIDC middleware and the Okta Node SDK.  Using these libraries you will be able to easily and quickly implement Okta’s sign-on provider.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@4.1.0
npm i @okta/oidc-middleware@4.0.1
</code>   

<p>You will use socket.io to manage the connections between peers.</p>

   <code>npm i socket.io@2.3.0
</code>   

<p>Pug will be the template engine for your views.  Pug is simple and easy to use.  Pug was previously known as Jade but has since rebranded so if you are familiar with Jade then you should have no trouble adapting.</p>

   <code>npm i pug@3.0.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, dotenv will store sensitive environment variables to keep out of your repository.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

 Create Your Node Server 

<p>Your server will consist of 4 files.  First, add a new file (if one hasn’t been created yet) called <code>index.js</code>.  Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>'use strict'

require('dotenv').config();

const server = require('./server')

const port = process.env.APP_BASE_PORT;

server.start({
    port: port
}).then(app =&gt; {
    console.log('Application is now running on port ' + port);
})
</code>   

<p>The index file serves as an entry point for your entire application.  Dotenv recommends you call require on the package as early in the app as possible.  The only other job of the index file is to start the server, which you will build shortly.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>routes.js</code>.  This file will contain the route definition for your application.</p>

   <code>module.exports = function (app, opts) {
  function ensureAuthenticated (request, response, next) {
    if (!request.userContext) {
      return response.status(401).redirect("/account/login");
    }

    next();
  }

  app.get("", (request, response, next) =&gt; {
    return response.render("home");
  });

  app.get("/dashboard", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {
    return response.render("dashboard", {
      user: request.userContext.userinfo,
      rooms: opts.rooms
    });
  });

  app.get("/broadcast", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {

    return response.render("broadcaster", {
      user: request.userContext.userinfo,
    });
  });

  app.get("/view/:room", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {
    return response.render("viewer", {
      user: request.userContext.userinfo,
      room: request.params.room
    });
  });

  app.get("/account/logout", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {
    request.logout();
    response.redirect("/");
  });

  app.get("/account/login", (request, response, next) =&gt; {
    return response.render("home");
  });
};
</code>   

<p>The routing information contained here includes handlers for logging in and out as well as providing routes for the views that you will display to users.  For routes that are under authentication, you are using the <code>ensureAuthenticated</code> middleware function at the top.  If the user isn’t authenticated they will be redirected to the login page.  The view route will take a parameter for the <code>room</code> that the user is joining.  The room will be named after the broadcaster.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>socket.js</code>.  This file will contain the bulk of your logic for managing the connection between the broadcaster and the viewers.</p>

   <code>module.exports = function (io, rooms) {
  io.sockets.on("connection", (socket) =&gt; {
    socket.on("broadcaster", (room, user) =&gt; {
      rooms.push({
        broadcaster: socket.id,
        room: room,
        user: user,
      });

      socket.join(room);
      socket.broadcast.emit("broadcaster");
    });

    socket.on("watcher", (room) =&gt; {
      var broadcast = rooms.filter((r) =&gt; r.room === room)[0];

      socket.join(room);
      socket.to(broadcast.broadcaster).emit("watcher", socket.id);
    });

    socket.on("disconnect", () =&gt; {
      var room = rooms.filter((r) =&gt; r.room === room)[0];

      if (room) {
        socket.to(room.broadcaster).emit("disconnectPeer", socket.id);
      }
    });

    socket.on("offer", (id, message) =&gt; {
      socket.to(id).emit("offer", socket.id, message);
    });

    socket.on("answer", (id, message) =&gt; {
      socket.to(id).emit("answer", socket.id, message);
    });

    socket.on("candidate", (id, message) =&gt; {
      socket.to(id).emit("candidate", socket.id, message);
    });

    socket.on("message-sent", (room, message, user) =&gt; {
      var broadcast = rooms.filter((r) =&gt; r.room === room)[0];
      io.to(broadcast.room).emit("message-received", user, message);
    });

    socket.on("end", (room) =&gt; {
      var broadcast = rooms.filter((r) =&gt; r.room === room)[0];
      rooms.splice(broadcast, 1);

      io.to(room).emit("end-broadcast");
    });
  });
};
</code>   

<p>There are three primary roles for the sockets.  First is managing the lifecycle of peer connections.  The broadcaster will create the room and admit viewers to the room.  When a viewer enters they should receive an SDP offer for the RTC connection.  An SDP offer contains information about the tracks already attached to the WebRTC session.  The broadcaster should also be informed if the user is leaving or entering.  Finally, the sockets will manage the chat functionality.  When a viewer wishes to communicate with the broadcaster they can type a message in their browser and it will appear on all clients.</p>

<p>Tying it all together you will need the server file.  This is the file that <code>index.js</code> runs when you first start the application.  The role of <code>server.js</code> is to register middleware, start the server, and delegate responsibility to the <code>socket.js</code> and <code>routes.js</code> files.  Add a new file called <code>server.js</code> and put in the following code.</p>

   <code>'use strict';

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const path = require('path');

const ExpressOIDC = require('@okta/oidc-middleware').ExpressOIDC;
const session = require('express-session');

const routes = require('./routes');
const sockets = require('./socket');

const start = function (options) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, p) =&gt; {
      console.log('Unhandled Rejection at: Promise', p, 'reason:', reason);
    });

    if (!options.port) {
      reject(new Error('no port specified'));
    }

    const app = express();
    const http = require('http').createServer(app);
    const io = require('socket.io')(http);

    var rooms = [];

    app.use(express.static('public'));
    app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, '/public/views'));
    app.set('view engine', 'pug');

    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

    app.use(function (error, request, response, next) {
      console.log(error);
      reject(new Error('something went wrong' + error));
      response.status(500).send('something went wrong');
    });

    const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
      issuer: process.env.OKTA_BASE_URL + '/oauth2/default',
      client_id: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET,
      appBaseUrl: process.env.APP_BASE_URL,
      scope: 'openid profile',
      routes: {
        login: {
          path: '/users/login',
        },
        callback: {
          path: '/authorization-code/callback',
        },
        loginCallback: {
          afterCallback: '/dashboard',
        },
      },
    });

    app.use(
      session({
        secret:
          'asd;skdvmfebvoswmvlkmes";lvmsdlfbvmsbvoibvms"dplvmdmaspviresmpvmrae";vm"psdemr',
        resave: true,
        saveUninitialized: false,
      })
    );

    app.use(oidc.router);

    routes(app, { rooms: rooms });
    sockets(io, rooms);

    const server = http.listen(options.port, function () {
      resolve(server);
    });
  });
};

module.exports = Object.assign({}, { start });
</code>   

<p>The <code>server.js</code> file does most of the work for the server-side of the application.  First, it creates a new instance of Express.  It also creates a new instance of socket.io for web sockets.  This file will also register the sockets class you wrote earlier.  To manage the rooms you are passing an array from this file into your sockets and routes.  You will set the view engine to pug and register any routes you may need.  Finally, you will need to register the Okta middleware for authentication and authorization.</p>

<p>One last thing you want to do is add a file called <code>.env</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>OKTA_BASE_URL={yourOktaDomain}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
APP_BASE_PORT=8080
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>Remember to add this file to your <code>.gitignore</code> file so you don’t push sensitive data into your source control.</p>

 Add Client Code to the Video Chat Application 

<p>Now it’s time to add the client-side code.  Create a new folder called <code>public</code>.  In that folder add two more folders, <code>views</code> and <code>js</code>.  First, start with the views.</p>

<p>The first file you want to add is called <code>layout.pug</code>.  Add this file to the <code>views</code> folder and insert the following code.</p>

   <code>block variables

</code>   

<p>The layout file is pretty simple. First, you are including any of your required javascript or style.  For this project, you are using bootstrap because it is nice and simple.  The layout also provides a header and footer for common elements that the entire site will use.  The header checks if the user is populated from the server and displays a login button if there is no user and a logout button if there is.</p>

<p>Next, add a view for <code>home.pug</code> in the <code>views</code> folder.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Home'

block content

    p Hey there, in order to access this page, please
      a(href="/users/login") Login here.
</code>   

<p>The home view extends the layout page you just created and delivers a message to the user that they must log in.</p>

<p>Add another view called <code>dashboard.pug</code>.  This view will simply give the user a list of available rooms to join and allow the user to start their broadcast.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Welcome to Broadcaster'

block content
  .row
    .col-lg-3
      h3 Broadcasters
      if rooms.length == 0
        span there are no broadcasters online
      else
        ul
          each room, i in rooms
            li
              a(href="view/"+room.room ) #{room.user}
    .col-lg-9
      .jumbotron
        h1 Broadcast yourself
        p.lead You can broadcast your own videos here.
        hr.my-4
        p.lead Give it a try
        a(href="Broadcast")
          button.btn.btn-primary Start Broadcasting
</code>   

<p>Finally, you can add the <code>broadcaster.pug</code> and <code>viewer.pug</code> views.  First, add the following code to <code>broadcaster.pug</code>.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Broadcast yourself'

block content
  div#message
  div#broadcast
    .row
      .col-lg-12.align-self-center.text-center
        video#localVideo(playsinline autoplay muted)
    .row.mb-2
      .col-lg-12
        table#chat-table.table.table-striped
          tr

  script(src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.3.0/socket.io.js")
  script(src="https://webrtc.github.io/adapter/adapter-latest.js")
  script(src="..\\js\\broadcaster.js")
  script.
      broadcaster('!{JSON.stringify(user)}')
</code>   

<p>The view has a local video that the user can see themselves on.  There is also a table that will display the chat messages as they appear from the viewers.  You will be including scripts for socket.io’s client library as well as webRTC’s adapter.  You will also include a file called <code>broadcaster.js</code> that you will add later.</p>

<p>The <code>viewer.pug</code> view looks similar.</p>

   <code>extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Chat'

block content
  div#message
  div#broadcast
    video#remoteVideo(playsinline autoplay)
    .row.mb-2
      .col-lg-12
        table#chat-table.table.table-striped
          tr
    .row
      .col-lg-10
        input#chat-message(type=text placeholder="enter a message").form-control
      .col-lg-2
        button#chat-button.btn.btn-primary Send

  script(src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.3.0/socket.io.js")
  script(src="https://webrtc.github.io/adapter/adapter-latest.js")
  script(src="..\\js\\viewer.js")
  script.
      viewer('!{room}', '!{JSON.stringify(user)}')
</code>   

<p>Of course on this file, you are including <code>viewer.js</code> instead of <code>broadcaster.js</code>.  This view also includes a form for inputting the chat message and a button for sending it.</p>

<p>To bring these two views to life, you need to create the JavaScript files for each.  First, you can start by adding <code>broadcaster.js</code> to the <code>public/js</code> folder.  The code there follows.</p>

   <code>function broadcaster(data) {
  var socket = io();

  var user = JSON.parse(data);

  const peerConnections = {};
  const localVideo = document.getElementById("localVideo");

  const config = {
    iceServers: [
      {
        urls: ["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"],
      },
    ],
  };

  navigator.getUserMedia(
    { video: true, audio: true },
    (stream) =&gt; {
      if (localVideo) {
        localVideo.srcObject = stream;
        socket.emit("broadcaster", user.sub, user.name);
      }
    },
    (error) =&gt; {
      $('#broadcast').remove();
      $('#message').append('&lt;h3&gt;We were unable to detect a webcam&lt;/h3&gt;');
      console.warn(error.message);
    }
  );

  socket.on("watcher", (id) =&gt; {
    const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(config);
    peerConnections[id] = peerConnection;

    let stream = localVideo.srcObject;
    stream
      .getTracks()
      .forEach((track) =&gt; peerConnection.addTrack(track, stream));

    peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) =&gt; {
      if (event.candidate) {
        socket.emit("candidate", id, event.candidate);
      }
    };

    peerConnection
      .createOffer()
      .then((sdp) =&gt; peerConnection.setLocalDescription(sdp))
      .then(() =&gt; {
        socket.emit("offer", id, peerConnection.localDescription);
      });
  });

  socket.on("answer", (id, description) =&gt; {
    peerConnections[id].setRemoteDescription(description);
  });

  socket.on("candidate", (id, candidate) =&gt; {
    peerConnections[id].addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate));
  });

  socket.on("message-received", (name, message) =&gt; {
    console.log(name, message);
    $("#chat-table tr:last").after(
      '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="width:20%"&gt;' + name + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;" + message + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"
    );
  });

  socket.on("disconnectPeer", (id) =&gt; {
    peerConnections[id].close();
    delete peerConnections[id];
  });

  window.onunload = window.onbeforeunload = () =&gt; {
    socket.emit('end', user.sub)
    socket.close();
  };
}
</code>   

<p>This file does all the heavy lifting for the broadcaster.  First, it captures the stream from the client’s machine.  This will require the user grant permissions to your site.  It sends a message using the socket connection back to the server which initiates the room creation and lets the dashboard know that there is a new room available.  It also handles the incoming requests as viewers enter the room.  When a viewer enters the room, this sends a message to the server which then sends it back to the broadcaster letting the broadcaster know a new user is there.  The broadcaster page then handles the event by sending an offer to the viewer with the broadcaster’s streaming tracks.</p>

<p>The broadcaster file also handles the messages that are displayed in the chatbox.  When a viewer enters a new message this goes again, to the server then back to the broadcaster.  The broadcaster page then takes the name of the viewer and the message and adds a row to the table so the broadcaster can see the message.</p>

<p>Finally, this page handles what happens when the broadcaster leaves the page.  The <code>window.onunload</code> event is handled by sending a message to the server than the broadcaster has ended the stream.  The server will relay that message to the server.</p>

<p>Finally, you can add the <code>viewer.js</code> file.</p>

   <code>function viewer(room, data) {

  var user = JSON.parse(data);
  const socket = io.connect(window.location.origin);

  let peerConnection;
  const config = {
    iceServers: [
      {
        urls: ["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"],
      },
    ],
  };

  const video = document.getElementById("remoteVideo");

  socket.on("offer", (id, description) =&gt; {
    peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(config);
    peerConnection
      .setRemoteDescription(description)
      .then(() =&gt; peerConnection.createAnswer())
      .then((sdp) =&gt; peerConnection.setLocalDescription(sdp))
      .then(() =&gt; {
        socket.emit("answer", id, peerConnection.localDescription);
      });
    peerConnection.ontrack = (event) =&gt; {
      video.srcObject = event.streams[0];
    };
    peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) =&gt; {
      if (event.candidate) {
        socket.emit("candidate", id, event.candidate);
      }
    };
  });

  socket.on("candidate", (id, candidate) =&gt; {
    peerConnection
      .addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate))
      .catch((e) =&gt; console.error(e));
  });

  socket.on("broadcaster", () =&gt; {
    socket.emit("watcher", room);
  });

  socket.on("disconnectPeer", () =&gt; {
    peerConnection.close();
  });

  socket.on("end-broadcast", () =&gt; {
    $("#broadcast").remove();
    $('#message').append('&lt;h2&gt;This stream has ended&lt;/h2&gt;')
  });

  socket.on("message-received", (name, message) =&gt; {
    $("#chat-table tr:last").after(
      '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="width:20%"&gt;' + name + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;" + message + "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"
    );
  });

  $("#chat-button").on("click", function () {
    var message = $("#chat-message").val();
    socket.emit("message-sent", room, message, user.name);
    $("#chat-message").val("");
  });

  window.onunload = window.onbeforeunload = () =&gt; {
    socket.close();
  };

  socket.emit("watcher", room);
}
</code>   

<p>Like <code>broadcaster.js</code>, this file will manage the connections between the server and this page.  It includes some logic for sending chat messages as well.</p>

 Run Your WebRTC Video Chat Application 

<p>To start your application you can run <code>node index.js</code>.  You should see a message in your console that the application is running on port 8080.  You can then navigate to localhost:8080 and see the home page.  Use the login button to log in with Okta.  From your dashboard you can click Start New Broadcast which will bring you into the Broadcast room.  To test the viewer I used chrome and opened a new incognito window.  Again login and, from the dashboard, select the room with your username.  Once you enter the <code>view</code> page you should see yourself, but that video is being streamed from your original browser window.  Send a message through the chatbox and switch back to see it.</p>

<p>The MATTR team is excited to announce a critical new addition to our product capabilities. We’re continuing to build out an extensive suite of features to support the exchange of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs), leveraging the best efforts of the open-source community along with a number of distinct product innovations. These innovations include our recent work related to using <a href="https://mattr.global/using-privacy-preserving-zkp-credentials-on-the-mattr-platform/">BBS+ signatures for privacy-preserving selective disclosure</a> and our earlier work on the<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/"> OIDC Credential Provider spec.</a> We’ve also been busy sharing new tools for <a href="https://mattr.global/new-to-json-ld-introducing-json-ld-lint/">checking the syntax of a JSON-LD credential</a> during development.</p><p>In this product release, we are focused on one of the fundamental capabilities in any credential-based system: the ability to provably revoke a credential when it’s no longer valid. Using verifiable data in combination with open standards not only improves the quality of the data exchanged in an ecosystem, it also enables the authority (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer">issuer</a>) on any piece of information to maintain that data throughout its lifecycle. In practice, this means that credential issuers can manage the status of a credential directly, using the same general mechanism as the one used for issuing&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Credentials are typically stored by the user (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject">subject</a>) in some kind of digital wallet where they are able to manage their credentials and control when and how to share their data. When accessing services, the user may consent to present their VCs to a relying party (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifier">verifier</a>). The relying party needs to be able to be able to verify the credential is genuine and tamper free. They also need to be able to easily validate whether a presented credential has been revoked or&nbsp;not.</p><p>For example, say you’re issued a digital driver’s license, then you go and get several speeding tickets. The department that issued your license determines you have breached the terms of your license and consequently, suspends your license. In doing so, the credential status is changed, and next time a relying party checks the status they will be able to see that you are no longer entitled to drive. If a car rental office is checking your driving status in order to loan you a vehicle, they’d like to be able to verify if the digital license is still valid and legitimate.</p>User journey viewing a credential &amp; presentation request with a revoked credential.<p>In general, we want to accomplish all of these goals while minimizing the burden on data issuers and verifiers, and preserving the autonomy of credential holders in deciding how to store and disclose their data. We also want to remain flexible around where the revocation list is stored and managed, so we opted to implement an approach that’s extensible to different types of infrastructure supported by the issuer. The resulting solution contrasts with others that have tended to be tightly coupled with a particular kind of infrastructure such as a distributed ledger. We believe revocation should be built in a simple, transparent, and standardizable manner, which is why we built our approach on the W3C CCG’s <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-rl-2020/">Credential Revocation List</a>.</p><p>Practically, the information regarding whether a credential has been revoked is represented in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status">credential status</a> property of a VC, as defined in the W3C spec. When a credential is first created, the issuer can include in the credential status field a reference to a publicly available revocation list. This list can be updated by the issuer at any time, so resolving this reference will always get you the latest revocation status. The retrieved revocation list is in the form of a <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> based verifiable credential, making it straightforward to validate. Holders and verifiers can simply check this revocation list to determine if a specific VC has been revoked or not. Since the revocation list contains the revocation status of many credentials, credential subjects get “herd privacy” with regards to the issuer, meaning the issuer doesn’t know where an issued credential is being used. This protects the holder against one form of surveillance and potential leakage of their personal data. Some use cases will require solutions that offer an even greater level of privacy for credential subjects, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(cryptography)">cryptographic accumulators</a>. We are actively working on a number of improvements in this area which will offer enhanced privacy for credential holders when it’s required and simplify the process of relying parties validating a credential’s status.</p><p>We’ve implemented this functionality using a simple optional flag on our VC issuance API, allowing issuers to toggle between credentials that support revocation and those that don’t. On the holder side, our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet App</a> automatically checks the revocation status when opened, alerting the user of any changes and giving them a warning if it’s revoked. For verifiers, validating credential status is a standard part of our VC verification API, so validation will automatically fail if the credential is&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>Integrating revocation into our platform brings us one step closer to building a fully realized verifiable data ecosystem, an environment where verifiers can have more confidence and trust in the decisions they’re making and people can participate in the sharing and exchange of information without eroding their basic privacy. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the community and gathering feedback from industry to enhance and extend different ways to accomplish revocation while respecting users’ digital rights. <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">Sign up</a> on our website to get access to our platform and check out <a href="http://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/revocation/revocation-overview">MATTR Learn</a> to start issuing revocable credentials.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-support-for-revocation-of-verifiable-credentials-2342b66b0997">Adding support for revocation of Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Omidyar Network’s Statement on US v. Google, Filed Today by the US Department of&nbsp;Justice <p>Today marks a new chapter in the long history of US enforcement of antitrust law. The filing of this lawsuit is recognition that digital platforms, namely Google, have used illegal and improper means to maintain their dominance.</p><p>Over many years, Google has exercised tremendous control over the marketplace of online search. This complaint makes a strong case for how Google manipulated the online search market by paying billions to secure default positions on browsers and mobile handsets to exclude rivals, by denying interoperability to challengers, and by preferencing its own products and services in search&nbsp;results.</p><p>The DOJ did not sue Google because it has grown large or successful. Rather, the investigation yielded sufficient <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">evidence</a> to show Google has violated US antitrust law — a set of rules that apply to everyone, and are designed to make sure all of us benefit from free markets and fair competition.</p><p>The ideal outcome of this lawsuit is the restoration of competition and safer, more innovative choices for consumers in the online search market. We know that Google’s profit motive influences the content they deliver. Google searches often lead people to Google’s own goods and services, to those who pay Google for our attention, and down rabbit holes of misinformation, hate, and extremism. All of these “results” bolster time spent on the platforms and Google’s revenues. Surely, other search engines, if not excluded from the market, could design algorithms that were safer and more consistent with society’s values.</p><p>Today’s filing is an important first step in enforcing existing laws governing Google’s improper past conduct. But this journey is not over; the legal process could take many years to resolve, and other concerns will need to be addressed. For example, Google also used its online search dominance to develop another illegal monopoly in the digital advertising market. Americans deserve and expect that Google will be held accountable for all of its anti-competitive and otherwise harmful conduct as well as prevented from engaging in similar abuses in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Consumers, competition, our economy, and our democracy have already paid too high a price for what are seen as “free” services. Undoubtedly, Google has provided valuable, innovative services that have become essential to everyone’s lives, creating the foundation for how we live, work, and play. And like other necessities that are embedded in our lives — power, water, cars — technology companies should be held to the highest standards. However, if left <a href="https://omidyar.com/uncheckedpower-the-root-of-big-tech-issues/">unchecked</a>, Google’s practices will continue to create serious consequences for advertisers, publishers, foreclosed technological rivals, and the&nbsp;public.</p><p>To that end, and alongside this case, we call for federal attention toward the ad-tech stack and support for state-level antitrust cases directed at other aspects of Google’s sprawling businesses. Because antitrust action alone will not restore competition to these markets, Congress should also continue to pursue the development of <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3429">new laws and&nbsp;rules</a>.</p>

Stay tuned for a full&nbsp;recap!</p>#IIW31 with nearly 250 participants from around the&nbsp;world  Filecoin launch  WIRED on online&nbsp;parks  What the original iPhone teaches us about networks and innovation  Satya Nadella on Microsoft’s SSI initiative  Stuff happens   1. Filecoin’s hotly anticipated mainnet launched last week on Oct.&nbsp;15. Filecoin and IPFS creator Juan Benet, Photo: Protocol&nbsp;Labs<p>If you’ll recall, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> was one of the hottest ICOs of 2017, raising $205 million in its token sale. The vision was a decentralized storage alternative to centralized cloud solutions like Amazon Web Services built around the Interplanetary File System or IPFS protocol.</p><p>And though there were some early hiccups since the launch <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-price-first-trading-futures">around price volatility</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-miners-go-on-strike-one-day-after-mainnet-launch-prompting-early-reward-release">mining economics</a>, as you might expect with a much hyped release, Filecoin is now&nbsp;live!</p><p>If you’re curious about how IPFS works, Hacker Noon <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f">has a useful beginner’s guide</a>.</p><p>First off, the way we manage our data hasn’t really changed much since the birth of the&nbsp;Web:</p><blockquote>HTTP is great for loading websites but it wasn’t designed for the transfer of large amounts data (like audio and video files). These constraints possibly enabled the emergence and mainstream success of alternative filesharing systems like Napster (music) and BitTorrent (movies and pretty much anything).</blockquote><blockquote>Fast forward to 2018, where on-demand HD video streaming and big data are becoming ubiquitous; we are continuing the upward march of producing/consuming more and more data, along with developing more and more powerful computers to process them. Major advancements in cloud computing have helped sustain this transition, however the fundamental infrastructure for distributing all this data has remained largely the&nbsp;same.</blockquote><p>IPFS looks to change&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>IPFS attempts to address the deficiencies of the client-server model and HTTP web through a novel p2p file sharing system. This system is a synthesis of several new and existing innovations. IPFS is an open-source project created by Protocol Labs, an R&amp;D lab for network protocols and former Y Combinator startup. Protocol Labs also develops complementary systems like IPLD and Filecoin, which will be explained below. Hundreds of developers around the world contributed to the development of IPFS, so its orchestration has been a massive undertaking.</blockquote><p>The end&nbsp;result?</p><blockquote>IPFS provides high throughput, low latency, data distribution. It is also decentralized and secure. This opens up several interesting and exciting use cases. It can be used to deliver content to websites, globally store files with automatic versioning &amp; backups, facilitate secure filesharing and encrypted communication.</blockquote><p>Where Filecoin comes into&nbsp;play:</p><blockquote>Filecoin is a separate protocol designed to add economic incentives to file storage on IPFS, and foster a distributed storage market that rivals enterprise cloud storage (like Amazon S3, etc). Instead of centralized infrastructure with fixed pricing, IPFS + FileCoin offers storage on a global network of local providers who have the freedom to set prices based on supply and demand. Instead of a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm like Bitcoin, Filecoin uses Proof-of-Storage to ensure security and reliability. So anyone can join the network, offer unused hard drive space on their computing device, and get rewarded in Filecoin tokens for data storage and retrieval services.</blockquote><p>All of which is really neat and a reminder that there is a ton of really cool innovation continuing to happen in the space. What also sets Filecoin apart is how successfully they’ve been at getting the word out and drumming up interest in the project. At the time of this writing, their newly launched token has a market cap north of around $600&nbsp;million.</p><p>And as Greg Kidd has noted, you could see a future where GlobaliD employs Filecoin for our self-sovereign storage solution.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-mainnet-launch">Filecoin Confirms Long-Awaited Mainnet Launch for Next Month — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f">A Beginner’s Guide to IPFS | Hacker&nbsp;Noon</a>   2. So Filecoin is a really cool idea with a ton of potential. And in time when more and more of our lives happen online, we need more cool ideas. WIRED’s idea? We need more and better online&nbsp;parks. <p>It’s how we could fix the “broken internet,” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/to-mend-a-broken-internet-create-online-parks/">WIRED suggests</a> (via&nbsp;Mitja):</p><blockquote>We need public spaces, built in the spirit of Walt Whitman, that allow us to gather, communicate, and share in something bigger than ourselves.</blockquote><p>And private parks won’t do the&nbsp;trick:</p><blockquote>MUCH OF OUR communal life now unfolds in digital spaces that feel public but are not. When technologists refer to platforms like Facebook and Twitter as “walled gardens” — environments where the corporate owner has total control — they’re literally referring to those same private pleasure gardens that Whitman was reacting to. And while Facebook and Twitter may be open to all, as in those gardens, their owners determine the&nbsp;rules.</blockquote><blockquote>Venture-backed platforms make poor quasi-public spaces for three&nbsp;reasons.</blockquote><blockquote>First, as the legendary venture capitalist Paul Graham put it, “startups = growth.” The focus on growth — of users, of time spent, and then of revenue — is the defining trait that has made Facebook a $750 billion company. And the key to rapid growth is optimization to create a “frictionless” experience: The more relevant the content you see, the likelier you are to click, return to Facebook, and bring your&nbsp;friends.</blockquote><blockquote>But friction is essential to public space. Public spaces are so generative precisely because we run into people we’d normally avoid, encounter events we’d never expect, and have to negotiate with other groups that have their own needs. The social connections that run-ins create, social scientists tell us, are critical in binding communities together across lines of difference. Building a healthy community requires the careful generation of this thick web of social ties. Rapid growth can quickly overwhelm and destroy it — as anyone who has lived in a gentrifying neighborhood knows.</blockquote><p>Also, the challenges (the first of which is funding):</p><blockquote>Second, there’s a talent and research problem. People outside of tech generally underestimate how hard it is to build something seamless, intuitive, and irresistible that allows millions of people to interact. We need to rally a diverse, representative generation of builders to this cause. And given that digital products live and die by metrics, we need to identify signals that correspond to flourishing public digital&nbsp;spaces.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, there’s a problem of public imagination. Fixing our ability to connect and build healthy communities at scale is arguably an Apollo mission for this generation — a decisive challenge that will determine whether our society progresses or falls back into conspiracy-driven tribalism. We need to summon the creative will worthy of a problem of this urgency and consequence.</blockquote><p>Sounds like a potential use case for SSI and GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups.</p>  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/to-mend-a-broken-internet-create-online-parks/">To Mend a Broken Internet, Create Online&nbsp;Parks</a>   3. Apple unveiled the latest iPhone last week and it’s a reminder that for innovation to flourish, we need to push back against the networks and platforms that rule over&nbsp;us. <p>In the case of the iPhone, it was the cell phone companies — <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201015&amp;instance_id=23165&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=41130&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2F76e3cce1-c376-51de-9279-d23bd7ece429&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">from the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>In the pre-iPhone age, we had years of clunky mobile devices, and phone providers like AT&amp;T deserved a lot of the&nbsp;blame.</blockquote><blockquote>Phone companies dictated almost everything about flip phones and early smartphones, including their features, look and speed. People had to put up with crummy software from the phone company to surf the web or download songs and ringtones. (Remember ringtones?!) It&nbsp;stank.</blockquote><blockquote>One of the secrets to the iPhone’s success is Apple simply said no to all of that. Apple’s chief executive at the time, Steve Jobs, gave wireless phone companies an ultimatum: Stay out of every decision about the iPhone or lose a shot at selling a potential blockbuster.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple got its way, the iPhone was eventually a success and phone companies got rich from it alongside Apple.</blockquote><p>How times have changed as we now find Apple on the other side of the equation.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/apple-at-a-crossroads-an-interview-with-m-g-siegler-5d3fc71ac48e">Apple at a Crossroads: An Interview With M.G.&nbsp;Siegler</a>   4.

 What prevents public statistics to be a competitive advantage for the&nbsp;EU? <p>Statistics and research are relying on huge amounts of data from different sources. Being able to provide current, detailed, segmented and broadly supported statistics is a key source of evidence-based research and decision&nbsp;making.</p><p>Sources can vary from public administrations, businesses or any organization or individual aggregating data of public or collaborative interest.</p><p>Currently the “statistics departments” of public administrations are creating reports based on limited data and detail (e.g. in regards to segmentation) periodically with longer timeframes. Data collection is in part mandatory and data providers do not have intrinsic motivation to provide data. The whole reporting structure is pretty static and is not very adaptive to growing needs and possibilities for data consumers.</p><p>Examples for reporting “services” provided by public administrations are statistics about economy and trade, environment, government and labour. And there are some statistics around currently important topics like on COVID-19.</p><p>That means there are existing structures and expertise in public administrations and research that have data science capabilities and procedures that are providing value to the&nbsp;public.</p><p>Our goal is to expand these data capabilities (especially unlock more data) and better enable collaboration with private players (serve their needs and make it a competitive advantage), be it as data providers or data consumers. We believe the untapped potential in this space is huge and could be quite easily unlocked.</p><p>With this post we want to present an approach that could unlock the full potential, foster focussed collaboration between public and private bodies and create a self-governing ecosystem on the Ocean Protocol Open Source Web3 Platform.</p><p>We start with the main unsolved challenges we believe prevent mentioned actors so far from better collaboration.</p> Challenge 1: Confidentiality, privacy and fear of&nbsp;misuse <p>Making data available for the purpose of state-curated statistics and reporting is pretty difficult today as required data might be confidential or there might be concerns of sharing data permanently due a fear of misuse, data leaks or permanent loss of control. This is true for understandable reasons and there should be no compromise of data privacy, data confidentiality and data availability. We should not reduce the level of data privacy regulation and enforcement for the purpose of making data more available. And we should empower citizens, businesses, public administrations and any organization to become as data sovereign as possible. Especially in this area Europe is in the lead from a regulatory, mindset and technology perspective.</p> Challenge 2: Lack of incentives and difficulty to bootstrap the data ecosystem <p>Even if challenge 1 can be solved, which is the biggest hurdle, there needs to be incentives for organizations to participate in a broader data exchange. As we expect data network effects in many areas, we are presented with a typical bootstrapping problem. In this case a critical mass of data is needed, not money. Once the ecosystem has achieved this critical mass, it is providing more value to the members in the form of compute outcomes and insights than they put into the system. Bootstrapping could be orchestrated or at least supported by public administrations providing data.</p> Challenge 3: Lack of participatory decision making and user-inspired continuous innovation <p>Data providers and other actors who add value should have a say in what happens with the data they provide access for public authorities or any entity making sense of decentral datasets. In addition in many cases data providers can also be data consumers of compute outcomes (reports, statistics, forecasts or benchmarks). But how can it be decided what kind of outcomes are of value? This points to a coordination problem that should involve and engage the whole data ecosystem for decision making, especially the private “users” of the compute outcomes. As one purpose of public statistics is to form a valuable source of better decision making in the whole ecosystem and whole&nbsp;society</p> Establishing a Public-Private Data Ecosystem with Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Besides mandatory reporting obligations of public administrations, businesses and organizations, we believe — with the right level of privacy and incentivisation — there is a chance to bootstrap a public-private data ecosystem to cater joint statistical, reporting, forecasting and benchmarking requirements for the good of the whole ecosystem and society. There are three steps on the journey to a public-private data ecosystem that address the main challenges.</p> Step 1: Compute-to-data <p>Organisations could opt-in to the service and provide datasets for statistical analysis and&nbsp;beyond</p>  without ever losing control about the data&nbsp;and  without anybody getting direct exposure to the&nbsp;data  <p>via the privacy-preserving compute-to-data approach of Ocean Protocol. That means data resides on the system of the data provider and the data provider keeps control about the data at any time. Ocean Protocol orchestrates the compute needed to leverage the data for e.g. statistical, data science for AI purposes.</p><p>Since, data providers never have to give access to their data (but only provide access to compute resources that use these data internally and within the data provider’s premises), data privacy and data ownership issues are solved. Also, data providers get to validate the algorithms before they can be allowed to train on the private&nbsp;data.</p><p>The data providers would <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/setup/compute-to-data/">setup compute infrastructure</a> using Ocean Protocol. This setup enables data providers to allow the data consumer (or any non-trusted third party) to get access to compute on their data. In this case data is still sitting in the data provider’s database or data repository, but the data consumer can now send their algorithms to train on these datasets.</p><p>This approach is not only GDPR compliant but even fully preserves privacy of the input data. No data pooling or data transfer is needed which would require other mostly organizational measures to keep as much privacy as possible but would mean the data provider to effectively lose control. For more information on Ocean Protocol Compute-to-Data Approach please have a look at this <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/v2-ocean-compute-to-data-guide-9a3491034b64">Blogpost</a>.</p> Step 2: Compute Outcomes as Incentivisation <p>To allow access to compute on these datasets, data providers may also be incentivized using Ocean Protocol’s data incentivisation features.</p><p>Incentivisation can be established in the form of preferred access to compute outcomes, e.g. governed by datatokens. In the case of this scenario compute outcomes can be aggregated data, statistics, forecasts and benchmarks. Even monetizing access and marketing specific compute outcomes to the public or specific target groups would be possible when conforming to the chosen data governance.</p><p>In addition to incentivizing data providers for giving privacy-preserving access to their data there is also the possibility to provide scientists and developers with incentives for providing algorithms like prediction models or forecasting algorithms</p><p>Fair Incentivization of every actor in the data value chain is crucial to unlocking more data. Establishing an incentivisation mechanism is a prerequisite to create a positive feedback loop (flywheel) and to grow the ecosystem in members and depth of&nbsp;data.</p> Step 3: Collaborative Data Governance <p>Data governance in the described context currently is done centrally by public administrations and is pretty static. Giving especially data providers the opportunity to also become preferred data consumers to fuel benchmarking and their own planning and decision processes would be a huge advantage for the ecosystem. In addition letting these participants jointly decide what kind of input data and compute outcomes are of interest for them would be helping to continuously advance the ecosystem and adapt to external and internal change based on members’ preferences and&nbsp;needs.</p><p>The governance bodies could be established as data trusts, data cooperatives or as DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organisation). In general every decision that is related to the jointly created data assets could be taken by this entity, including decisions about what compute outcomes should be public and what are available exclusively only to members or groups of members. But it could also include decisions about which kind of additional compute outcomes should be jointly&nbsp;created.</p> A phased approach to implementing a Public-Private Statistics Data Ecosystem <p>The three Ocean Protocol functionalities described above are functional independently and can be implemented subsequently.</p><p>Compute-to-Data is the foundation. In addition the level of change of an implementation is&nbsp;limited.</p><p>Growing to Incentivization would be a logical second functional implementation step being able to especially fuel availability of data by creating additional value for the data ecosystem.</p><p>Fostering a sustainable data ecosystem requires not only effective and fair incentization but also participatory governance mechanisms. So data governance would mark the third implementation step. However achieving this will require new forms of collaboration and significant change to the status quo. Of the numerous initiatives attempting to solve this two of the most promising include the EU Data Strategy and&nbsp;GAIA-X.</p> EU Data Strategy and&nbsp;GAIA-X <p>The EU Data Strategy aims to create industry data spaces as a basis for better collaboration within industries. This could mean any data that is of relevance for industry participants and especially aims at supporting the data hungriness of AI and data science. There is the goal to experiment in that space and gain important insights in the area of how to make data available while keeping high levels of data privacy e.g. by establishing data intermediaries like data trusts or data cooperatives. The focus is on data regulation that effectively supports data-related values and goals of actors in the EU. In other words, finding the “EU way for&nbsp;data”.</p><p>GAIA-X starts from three perspectives: (1) use cases or business challenges of users and (2) a technology foundation which includes standards, APIs and other building blocks in order to allow for composability and compliance and (3) a regulatory framework. So GAIA-X brings together all kinds of actors to create an ecosystem of technology providers, technology adopters and the regulatory authorities. There are many projects ongoing to implement use cases on the basis of the GAIA-X framework.</p><p>Both are aiming for more digital and data sovereignty not only for businesses.</p> Innovating with immediate impact — Four possible MVEs (Minimal Viable Ecosystems) <p>Bootstrapping data ecosystems is a two-sided challenge, as data providers are required to provide data and data consumers are needed to make sense out of data. As soon as these two roles are separated, coordination is required and it becomes more difficult to bootstrap such an ecosystem. In our example scenario in some cases data providers providing their datasets could be incentivized by (1) receiving access to compute outcomes and (2) a voice in governing the data ecosystem. Making a one-sided ecosystem out of the originally two-sided ecosystem.</p><p>This structure simplifies bootstrapping, but still requires a minimal set of initial participants (critical mass) to form the minimal viable ecosystem (MVE).</p><p>We think the below mentioned use cases might be a good starting point for this reason, but also because they are purpose-led (purpose-defined) data ecosystems, that align a diverse group of members to a joint&nbsp;goal.</p><p>In addition we expect an immediate high impact, existing structures to build on and/or first steps already undertaken in the direction of data ecosystem thinking.</p> MVE 1: COVID-19 Protection and Relief Data Ecosystem <p>COVID-19 remains a challenge for our societies, both from a health perspective as well as an economic perspective. Protecting citizens effectively is a joint effort from different countries but also many different actors in the health sectors, public sector, research institutions and businesses. Allowing for better data collaboration and making as much relevant data available as possible could be making a difference.</p><p>There are already COVID-19 statistics available by Eurostat. With the outlined approach these could be extended e.g. by the questions of effectiveness of health protection, curation and of economic stimulus programs. In order to really increase the effectiveness of these measures much broader and much more granular information of healthcare providers, public administrations and businesses would be&nbsp;needed.</p> MVE 2: Enriched Economic Forecasting <p>Assessing the economic situation and economic forecasting is a regular and extensive task done by governments but also to some extent for every business. Having access to more data sources would be a game changer for providing more accurate and granular information.</p><p>Joining forces not only on providing and consuming data but also on governance of the process and content would unleash the joint power of data and talent. Businesses and public administrations would not only provide data but also would consume the jointly created aggregated views and datasets. These could feed in decision making and insights on every level of hierarchies.</p> MVE 3: “Digital made in de”&nbsp;V2 <p>The German Federal Government has shipped a service called “digital made in de” recently. It is a dashboard about the progress of digital transformation mainly aggregating data from public administrations and governments. It is very comprehensively showing statistics, project stati and explainers on the presented information. This dashboard could be subsequently enriched with more reports and a higher granularity of reports. What would you like to see in such a dashboard?</p> MVE 4: Interplanetary People Data Cooperative <p>Workforce and people data resides with businesses and organizations, public labour and education administrations and the workers itself. Data exchange is limited to mandatory processes and there is no oversight or systematic approach to improving workforce and labour decisions at all of these entities based on evidence and data. If you compare this to how financial reporting and decision making is professionalized within organisations and with finance, tax and other administrations we are sure there is huge potential for businesses, individuals and economy and society as a whole. Workforce data offers a high level of standardization and is relevant for everybody and every organisation, with better accuracy, timeliness and segmentation a people data cooperative could lead to better evidence- and data-based work-related decisions</p><p>Besides workforce and educational data, there might be citizens and other data to be included at a later&nbsp;stage.</p> Conclusions <p>Most of the currently most successful businesses are bigtechs championing the aggregation and consumption of data (via data science and AI) in a web2 setup at the same time. This not only means data providers losing control and sometimes privacy of the data permanently but also that they are not fairly participating in the value creation by the data consumers.</p><p>Therefore the above mentioned initiatives aim to create new forms of data consumption that guarantee data sovereignty and fair value sharing and at the same time make more data available for the right usage. What the “right usage” is should be decided by the data providers and other value creating participants in the data value chain (e.g. data curators) via a governance mechanism. These decisions should be in full control of the governance mechanism the data providers have chosen and should be self-enforcing ideally without the need of any institution or intermediary. In addition data providers should be fairly participating in the value creation resulting from the data consumption. This could be monetary incentives or exclusive access to outcomes of the data consumption process. In our case the compute outcomes are statistics, reports, forecasts and benchmarks.</p><p>We believe the potential of these community-owned data ecosystems is similar if not bigger than the one big techs have created. And we believe the time is now to bootstrap the first EU-style data ecosystems to showcase the power for the members of these ecosystems.</p><p>We suggest to further investigate the above mentioned “privacy-preserving private-public statistics ecosystem” as we are sure it can unlock value immediately and could grow consistently based on concrete requirements of ecosystem members. Public administrations could be integral in data bootstrapping this ecosystem but also should be complemented with data from any business or organization soon after an initial&nbsp;release.</p><p>Terms:</p><p>Data Provider: An individual or organization in legitimate control of data, that shares this data under specific conditions.</p><p>Data Curator: An individual or organization that adds value to a dataset e.g. by assessing, labelling or enriching the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Data Consumer: An individual or organization making sense of datasets, e.g. by leveraging data science or AI techniques to create aggregated data (data outcomes) or simply consuming the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Privacy-Preserving Compute: Making use of data without exposing data itself to the data consumer, which means preserving the privacy of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Compute Outcomes: Substrates of newly created data and datasets by applying “compute” (algorithms) that do not allow to determine back the original data inputs, but are based on all of input data. These could be compute outcomes like statistics, repotts, benchmarks and forecasts, but also more sophisticated outcomes like AI-trained neural networks.</p><p>Datatokens: Datatokens are a new asset class, technically they are fungible tokens that provide rights about datasets. These rights could be access rights or the right of participating in the monetization by the dataset. But these rights are not limited to that, especially based on the composability of the ethereum blockchain datatokens might also be used as a collateral for a loan, may be traded on exchanges or act as a right to vote in a DAO or other form of decision making or&nbsp;voting.</p><p>Bootstrapping: In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input at some point in time. In some cases this process needs to be consciously planned e.g. by acquiring early members or customers. We use it in the context of the data ecosystems, where there needs to be “enough” data available to really be able to create value for data consumers. We assume once critical mass is achieved positive data network effects allow for non-linear/exponential value creation.</p><p>Minimal Viable Ecosystem (MVE): We have created this expression in the context of the term minimal viable product (MVP). This refers to a first version or release of a software that is only providing the minimal functionality needed to create “enough” value for the users to make them adopt the software permanently. Typically the functionality and value increases over time attracting more and more users. At the same time MVE resonates with the idea of experimentation and the goal of feedback in order to continuously improve the system. Including technological, organisational and regulatory aspects.</p><p>Sources and References:</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/v2-ocean-compute-to-data-guide-9a3491034b64">Ocean Protocol V2 Compute-to-Data</a></p><p><a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/_node.html">Statistics of the Statistische Bundesamt in&nbsp;Germany</a></p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/covid-19/overview">Eurostat Statistics about&nbsp;COVID-19</a></p><p><a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Dossier/economic-development.html">Economic situation and cyclical development in Germany in October&nbsp;2020</a></p><p><a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/">GAIA-X — A federated Data Infrastructure for&nbsp;Europe</a></p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en">European Data&nbsp;Strategy</a></p><p><a href="https://www.digital-made-in.de/">Digital made in&nbsp;de</a></p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

					 <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) has largely developed and matured thanks to the rich conversations at the semi-annual <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW)—one of the most important user-centric digital identity events on earth. Not only does IIW act as a place to iron out specs and bring communities together, but it acts as a forcing function for implementors to demonstrate the solutions they’ve built over the last six months. IIW’s unique focus on community drives vendors to emphasize interoperability in their demonstrations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxi-31-2020b-tickets-113035646662">IIW #31</a> starting this morning, it’s the perfect time to reflect on how IIW continues to be a part of the interoperability story of the SSI community.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Trinsic's interoperability story 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Interoperability has always been of paramount importance to Trinsic. That story begins at an <a href="https://vonx.io/how_to/iiwbook">IIW #28 demo</a> with the Government of British Columbia where we demonstrated the first mobile app and enterprise SSI platform to comply with the Hyperledger Aries RFCs, achieving interoperability with the open source ariescloudagent-python. This was the first time two separate codebases demonstrated true interoperability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the Trinsic Wallet has been a standard tool for Aries developers to test the agents they’re building. In the Aries community, Trinsic became a leader of interoperability efforts, helping others debug when their implementations didn’t work with our wallet. In our view, spending time helping others in the community achieve interoperability was time well-spent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But this ad-hoc interoperability testing done via direct messages in RocketChat wasn’t scalable. As the number of Aries-based implementations grew, so too did the burden of maintaining and promoting interoperability. We are happy to say that only three IIW’s after the community’s first display of interoperability, a growing group of SSI vendors have convened to collaborate and hold each other to a high standard of interoperability through the formalization of vendor-to-vendor solution testing.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Formalizing interoperability between vendors 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>We are proud to work with the tremendous teams in our community to <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2020/10/19/trust-over-ip-foundation-introduces-a-new-tool-for-interoperable-digital-trust/">formalize vendor-to-vendor solution testing</a> according to test suites and interoperability profiles in the Technical Stack Working Group at the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a>. This group has been meeting weekly for several months, and we look forward to this group continuing to improve the interoperability requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meeting weekly for the last several months, we’ve formally tested the Trinsic platform with the products developed by the following projects. That means any developer that uses the Trinsic platform—including <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">Trinsic’s APIs</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>, and the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>—will inherit interoperability with solutions built using the following products:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a>  <a href="https://esatus.com/?lang=en">esatus AG</a>  <a href="http://doc.ibmsecurity.verify-creds.com/whats_new/">IBM</a>  <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a>  <a href="https://idramp.com/">idRamp</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Aries Cloud Agent Python</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .Net</a>  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you plan on attending IIW #31 this week, be sure to attend the session on ToIP interoperability profiles to learn more. As always, we encourage other vendors to join the cause with us so that three IIW’s from now, we will see dozens of interoperable SSI implementations that comply with the ToIP interoperability profiles.</p>

					 <p>Our current and future interoperability efforts expand beyond the amazing work happening at the ToIP Foundation. We’re actively engaged in developing next-generation technologies including new zero-knowledge proof capabilities at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF), support for additional DID methods, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> compliant JSON-LD credentials. We will be leading a session this week at IIW #31 on some of our next-generation interoperability efforts, so stay tuned!</p>

Wallet API:&nbsp;An API for creating and managing cloud wallets on behalf of credential holders. It’s the backend of our Mobile SDK, which you can read more about in our recent&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-wallets-3-decisions/">post</a>&nbsp;about building your own SSI wallets. Get started with the API by checking out the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/">documentation</a>.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Focusing on interoperability has been at Trinsic’s core since we began, because we want to ensure that verifiable credentials are as accessible and useful as possible to people everywhere. Making sure that SSI vendors’ solutions are interoperable with one another is one of the major steps to achieving that vision.</p>

 A framework to help uncover&nbsp;trends <p>Around the world, people and small businesses are working and selling in new ways, using digital platforms. News reports, heated policy debates, and perhaps especially our daily interactions with gig workers, freelancers, and virtual e-commerce storefronts all underscore a growing awareness that there is something essential and different about finding one’s way and earning a living in the platform&nbsp;economy.</p><p>This year, Caribou Digital has been working with <a href="https://qhala.com/">Qhala </a>and with the support of the <a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/">Mastercard Foundation</a> on a project exploring the “<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/segment-insights/">Quality of Youth Digital Livelihoods</a>” in Kenya. That research, with its particular focus on how young women in Kenya experience platform work and platform sales, is well underway.</p><p>As a way to connect to the ongoing research and policy discussions, and to help create our interview guide, we read everything we could — 75+ primary research studies of platform work and platform sales in the Global South. We excited to report that Caribou Digital and Qhala have just released v1.0 of that review in a <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QYDEL-v1.1.pdf">PDF</a>, and in a searchable, filterable, online resource in the form of an <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/evidence-gap-map/#tab-egm">evidence&nbsp;map</a>.</p><p>Underpinning these new resources is an emerging overarching framework for understanding platform livelihoods, our term for the broad umbrella encompassing both platform work and platform sales. This post, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">also a page on the platform livelihoods website</a>, is our most succinct (October 2020) version of the platform livelihoods framework.</p><p>More specifically, we define platform livelihoods as</p><blockquote>active human efforts, sometimes combined with tools or assets, deployed to create value outside of the constructs of a stable employer-employee relationship, mediated by the infrastructure and accompanying logic of digital platforms.</blockquote><p>From this definition, and drawing on that detailed literature review of 75 studies of platform livelihoods in the Global South, this framework addresses three broad questions for the digital development community:</p> What are the experiences of people with platform livelihoods? <p>We identify twelve elements — the kinds of experiences that individuals share and value when discussing their livelihoods with friends, family, and even the occasional researcher. They are a mix of economic, subjective, and broader human development experiences.</p>Platform Livelihood Experience Elements What are similarities and differences between platform livelihood types? <p>In the review, we offer a landscape of nine illustrative types of platform livelihood. Note that these are roles that individuals or small enterprises can fill, rather than “business models” or the names of specific platforms.</p><p>These are not the only roles that platforms are transforming or enabling, but these nine represent enough of the diversity in platform livelihoods to make two key distinctions. These types mix local and global (digital only) markets. Some of these roles are for individuals seeking work and offering their labor. Some of these roles are for small enterprises and even small farms, looking for new sales channels and new ways to connect with&nbsp;markets.</p><p>The early research and policy literature has been concentrated in platform work, especially ride-hailing, freelancing, and microwork. We feel strongly that platform work needs continued research and policy attention, as millions turn to platform labor amidst changing economies and a global pandemic.</p><p>At the same time, and in the longer run, platform sales (whether via marketplaces, social commerce, or search and discovery) may end up altering the livelihoods of millions&nbsp;more.</p><p>This lens suggests that these two growing domains, platform work and platform sales, are supported by overlapping affordances of platformization — indeed it is often the same platforms supporting job seekers and microentrepreneurs alike. The lens invites synthesis of insights for policy and practice that draws on both domains, while retaining space for more comparative or specific inquiry into one livelihood type at&nbsp;time.</p>Platform Livelihood Types What kinds of technologies and business models support platform livelihoods? <p>Individuals and small enterprises use a mix of platform services and approaches to pursue their livelihoods.</p>  The most easily recognizable way via formal digital marketplaces — the formal “multi-sided markets” in labor, goods and services, though with individuals and small firms can find customers.  Informal social commerce — selling goods, services and even ‘influence’ via personal Facebook pages, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. is also growing in popularity and impact, even if the research literature here is still&nbsp;sparse.  And there is often (still), search and discovery. Millions of small businesses pay for advertising on Facebook and Google and other social media platforms, Many work to refine how they appear on maps or other digital databases and apps. Some have websites or social media pages or storefronts of their own. These activities, too, support platform livelihoods.  <p>These activities and services blur and intersect as digital platforms continually slice and recombine, mediating the connections between sellers and their markets in ever-changing ways.</p><p>One the one hand, the digitalization and platformization of economies seems to reward sellers and workers who have developed capabilities in more or more of these than one approaches.</p><p>On the other hand, it is simultaneously a critical matter for inclusive digital development policy that these mediated connections do not divide, dissuade, or discriminate against small scale sellers and the self-employed.</p><p>In the longer run, we may update the online evidence map and accompanying discussion with a per-technology filter to better reflect differences and similarities (in practice and in policy) across these technological approaches.</p>Platform Livelihood Practices How to use this framework <p>By providing a common language framework, and a map of several kinds of platform livelihoods, this framework can help uncover many trends and cross cutting issues. For example, In this first iteration of the literature review we used the framework to explore four durable themes: <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">gender</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/rurality/">rurality</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/youth/">youth</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19/">COVID-19</a>. We also outline four emergent dynamics worthy of scrutiny: <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/fractional-work/">fractional work</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/amplification/">amplification</a>, <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/hidden-hierarchies/">hidden hierarchies</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/contestation/">contestation</a>.</p><p>We hope that you might and use this framework in your own research, design, or policymaking activities.

 Get your OScore&nbsp;today! <p><a href="https://ocredit.io/">OScore</a>, the first credit score for the decentralized world built with Ontology’s Decentralized Identity has officially launched. For simplicity, consider OScore an on-chain reputational system that supports cross-chain interaction with verifiable credentials on the Ontology blockchain, hence eliminating third-party verification programs from the process. Once a user authorizes their digital financial data, Ontology’s OScore system automatically generates a quantifiable credit score while ensuring a user’s privacy is fully protected and controlled by themselves.</p><p>To begin, your OScore will be available once you log in and have connected your digital wallets and exchanges — this will allow the system to give you a real-time assessment of your OScore. Within the minimal and clean dashboard, users can authenticate assets to maintain a consistent OScore in accordance with their historical holdings, transactions, and current collection of&nbsp;assets.</p>Your Dashboard<p>In the world of Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, a credit-based scoring system that is both transparent and accurate has the potential to revolutionize not just individual users’ interactions amongst each other, but also the sector as a&nbsp;whole.</p><blockquote>“…These perks may include things like being able to under-collateralize assets…”</blockquote><p>A credit-based system in the DeFi space will bridge services with users by authenticating a certain level of trust so everyone can enjoy dApps, and DeFi projects with an ease of mind. Users with a higher OScore will enjoy positive externalities as a result. These perks may include things like being able to under-collateralize assets, therefore allowing for higher levels of liquidity and a more matrix-like decision tree for users who have consistently upheld their credit&nbsp;score.</p><blockquote>“…users can earn WING tokens as rewards for punctually returning borrowed assets or&nbsp;loans…”</blockquote><p>In addition, users can earn WING tokens as rewards for punctually returning borrowed assets or loans, as extra WING tokens will be distributed to reinforce positive behavior. This type of reinforcement can easily be replicated for other DeFi projects or tokens as well as long as they have OScore integrated into their systems. To take things even one step further, users can withdraw any assets which are connected through their wallet directly from the dashboard as well, removing a tedious step from the user journey for those who wish to withdraw assets. All of the features of OScore can be enjoyed through logging in the web browser, or through a user’s ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><blockquote>“…users can withdraw any assets which are connected through their wallet directly from the dashboard as&nbsp;well…”</blockquote><p>A user’s OScore will also allow for the refinancing and restructuring of mortgages and credit lending where users who demonstrate proper behavior in their lending and repayment practices may also be rewarded with lower interest rates and more generous financing options. A second key component of OScore is the underlying Decentralized Identity solution which protects not just the user’s identity but also their data — granting them full control over who may or may not access it. Users can bind their OScore to their ONT ID just as they could with their real names. We have previously written about the drastically wide array of use cases for ONT ID, so we won’t go into too many details&nbsp;here.</p><p>When combined, an OScore becomes a powerful indicator of a user’s trust variable — which essentially is what a credit score is designed for. Just like traditional finance, DeFi can’t reach its full potential without credit. The good news is that with OScore, DeFi platforms like Wing.Finance can improve their underlying market mechanisms to provide users more usability, ultimately leading to a more mature and transparent market for the borrowing, lending, and insuring of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The goal behind this launch is to redefine trust in the age of blockchain and elevating hundreds of millions of users to reach new financial heights. Not only will the OScore protect a user’s data privacy while providing full credit histories, but it will also be applicable across an array of real-life applications both offline and on-chain.</p><p>With the launch of OScore, Ontology’s mission to change the way we manage and transfer data while increasing security and protection will be realized one step further. As stated by our founder, Li Jun — “Ontology is providing a solution that connects users’ assets to their identity, providing increased security and trust to all parties, connecting the missing pieces of decentralized finance’s ecosystem.” A credit score, tied in with ONT ID and the ONTO Data Wallet, exemplifies the commitment that we envision.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="https://ont.io/?source=post_page---------------------------">Ontology website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">Ontology GitHub</a> / <a href="https://onto.app/?source=post_page---------------------------">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases?source=post_page---------------------------">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Telegram (English)</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/lower-your-collateral-requirements-loan-interests-with-oscore-fb2c835a9998">Lower Your Collateral Requirements &amp; Loan Interests with OScore</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Selling Your Proprietary Data, Others’ Proprietary Data, and Value-Adds to Open&nbsp;Data Ocean worker.&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.pikist.com/free-photo-spnja">Image</a>] Introduction <p>The upcoming <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">Ocean Market</a> app enables people and organizations to earn by staking / curating on data and by selling data. This article focuses on selling data. (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">This one</a> focuses on staking.)</p><p>Publishing and selling data in Ocean Market takes more effort than staking, but has more earning potential. In selling data, one is earning the sale value of the data asset itself, rather than a cut from transaction fees like in&nbsp;staking.</p><p>Here are three types of data that you might&nbsp;sell:</p>  Your proprietary data  Others’ proprietary data that you’ve acquired the rights&nbsp;to  Open data that you’ve added value&nbsp;to  <p>The rest of this article explores each in more&nbsp;detail.</p> 1. Selling Your Proprietary Data <p>Here, you create or dig up your own datasets, then post them for sale on Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>What might that data&nbsp;be?</p>  As an individual, it can be of personal data, such as your location data, browser history, or data you’ve exported from Facebook or&nbsp;23andme.  As a business, nonprofit, or city, it can be data that your organization has accumulated over time, which might be of value yet is sitting&nbsp;latent.  <p>If you’re worried about privacy or control of your data, consider using Ocean <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/how-ocean-compute-to-data-relates-to-other-privacy-preserving-technology-b4e1c330483">Compute-to-Data</a> rather than making the data downloadable.</p> 2. Selling Others’ Proprietary Data <p>A second approach is to sell data that others have the rights to (with their permission, of&nbsp;course).</p><p>Here, you find a data rightsholder, then act on their behalf to sell their data in Ocean Market. Compute-to-data can allay concerns of privacy or control. In this case you are playing the role of data&nbsp;broker.</p><p>A variant here is to create a “remix rights” contract with the data rightsholder, where you would add value to the data in some way, sell this value-added data, and give them a&nbsp;cut.</p> 3. Selling Value-Added Open&nbsp;Data <p>People who want to use open datasets can simply download them directly from a browser. For this variant, there is no need for Ocean! It would simply get in the way. And it would be silly to pay for&nbsp;it.</p><p>However, there is a way for you to earn from open datasets: add value to them, then sell the value-added datasets.</p><p>Here are some ways that you can add&nbsp;value:</p>  Tag or label data. For example, transcribing audio, or assigning bird species to bird photos. This helps for AI “supervised learning”.  Clean the data to make it easier to consume. For example, scrape public websites and put the information into a format that’s easy to for AI &amp; analytics tools to&nbsp;consume.  <p>If you’re a data scientist, you have more opportunities yet, including:</p>  Feature-engineer data to make it more tractable for others to model&nbsp;on.  Sell synthetic data. Get access to private data, use Compute-to-Data to calculate the synthetic data, and sell&nbsp;it.  Sell your trained AI&nbsp;models.   Conclusion <p>This brief post described how to earn by selling data using Ocean Market, with a focus on types of data to sell: your proprietary data, others’ proprietary data, and value-adds to open&nbsp;data.</p> Next Steps / Further&nbsp;Reading   Article introducing Ocean Market: “Ocean Market: An Open-Source Community Marketplace for Data.

<p>When most people think of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en">GDPR</a>, they are reminded of the onslaught of emails they received after it passed. Any company or newsletter they had ever subscribed to–and yes, we really mean ever–was reaching out to them to reconfirm they wanted to stay on the mailing list and sharing their updated privacy policies. Companies they had perhaps long since forgotten about, companies they weren’t sure they had ever even subscribed to. But while most people today are familiar with the term, they don’t fully understand the legislation behind it.&nbsp;<br></p>



 What is GDPR 



<p>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It is a European regulation that was approved by the EU Parliament in 2016 and came into effect in 2018. At its core, it has three main purposes.&nbsp;<br></p>



  Harmonize – data privacy laws across Europe  Protect – and empower all EU citizens’ data privacy  Reshape – the way organizations across the region approach data privacy  



<p>The aim of the GDPR is to help EU citizens have full control over their personal data and to provide more transparency into the data collection and usage processes.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Under the GDPR, businesses must safeguard their customers’ personal data and use the highest possible privacy settings by default. Data must not be processed or made publicly available without the individual’s explicit and informed consent.<br></p>



<p>“Data controller” and “data processor” are the most important terms used in GDPR regulations and it’s important to clearly distinguish one from the other.<br></p>



  A data controller: determines the purpose and means of processing personal data  A data processor: is responsible for processing data on behalf of the data controller  



 Why Does it Matter?&nbsp;<br> 



<p>According to the European Commission, the value of personalized data will be <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/the-value-of-data/">1 trillion euros</a>, almost 8 percent of the EU’s GDP, by the end of 2020. Personal data is incredibly valuable, with many of the tech giants likening it to the new oil. With so much personal data on the internet, and so many companies looking to capitalize on it, the GDPR is a landmark piece of legislation.<br></p>



<p>Personal data can include anything and everything from someone’s full name, birthday, address both physical and IP, geotags, religion, race, political views, passport number, health records, and social media profiles.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>While it is an EU regulation, it has a global reach. The GDPR applies to any business that handles personal data of EU citizens, even if that business is located outside of Europe. Within the GDPR framework, controllers of personal data must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to comply with the seven data protection principles.<br></p>



<p>Oh, and before we get into the principles the fines are significant as well. It has generated an estimated <a href="https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-in-2020/">€114 million in fines in just two years</a>. Under the GDPR, companies can be fined up to €20 million or four percent of their annual revenues, whichever is higher. For less serious violations, the fine is reduced to €10 million and two percent of annual revenues, which is still no laughing matter.&nbsp;<br></p>



 The Seven Key Principles of GDPR 



<blockquote><p>Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency</p></blockquote>



<p>Data must be obtained, stored, and processed on a lawful basis, and the individual must be fully informed regarding the purposes, the means, and the time period of data processing. Data controllers and data processors must stay true to their privacy promises.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Purpose Limitation&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>The purpose of data collection must be specified, explicit, and legitimate. Data must only be used for the purpose for which the individual’s consent was received.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Data Minimization&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>GDPR is designed to reduce data collection to the minimum required to fulfill the purpose. The data collected must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed.</p>



<blockquote><p>Accuracy</p></blockquote>



<p>Personal data must be accurate and up to date. Any old and, or outdated data should be erased.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Storage Limitation&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Personal data must not be kept for longer than required by the legitimate business purpose to which the individual consented.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Integrity and Confidentiality&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Personal data must be handled in a way that ensures appropriate security and is protected against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>Accountability&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>All policies that govern the collection and processing of data must be documented in a thorough manner, and in a way that can demonstrate full GDPR compliance to authorities when called upon.</p>

 Authenteq’s Compliance&nbsp; 



<p>Our compliance with the EU GDPR regulation was created in cooperation with, and is routinely reviewed by, expert legal professionals from the German branch of the global law firm DWF (<a href="http://www.dwf.law">www.dwf.law</a>)<br></p>



<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>



 How to Comply with the GDPR<br> 



<p>GDPR is actually a good thing overall, even if it feels intimidating to tackle. More control over personal data increases the end-users’ confidence in your product and with big data in general. The seven key principles can be translated into a few simple, actionable steps. You can also follow the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist/">GDPR checklist for data controllers</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>



  Gather clear, explicit consent. Keep your terms and conditions and privacy policies readable. Make it easy for anyone to withdraw from your service at any time.<br>  Communicate breaches. Even the world’s largest companies can be hacked, and while the initial reaction to a breach may be to deal with it behind closed doors, breaking this rule and failing to report a breach will result in a fine. According to the GDPR, you have 72 hours to report a breach so build that directly into your security protocols and measures.&nbsp;<br>  Provide access. If a customer or user requests access to their data, which they may do at any time, you must be able to provide them with a clear and detailed copy that outlines which data you have collected, where it has been stored, and how it has been used. And you must provide this for free.&nbsp;<br>  Forget them. Not only can personal data be requested at any time, but people can also request that it be deleted. While there are some specific grounds on which you could deny this request, generally you have one month to honor these requests.&nbsp;

<p>Kotlin is often considered a “better Java” and often becomes an easy, efficient substitution because it has excellent Java interoperability. That allows you to employ the largest ecosystem of existing JVM frameworks and libraries written and designed for Java in your Kotlin application and vice-versa. Kotlin works well with <a>Spring Boot</a>, Jersey, Dropwizard, and many others. “Kotlin-native” frameworks provide first-class language support, provide additional type-safety not available in the Java world, and often give competitive advantages.</p>

<p><a href="https://ktor.io/">Ktor</a> is one of the most prominent “Kotlin-native” web frameworks officially supported by JetBrains, creators of the Kotlin language, and IntelliJ IDEA. It’s an unopinionated highly-customizable modular framework that gives developers full control over implementation while providing sensible defaults.</p>

 Build a Ktor Application with Kotlin 

<p>As with any web application framework, Ktor provides several libraries and imposes some conventions. Don’t worry—it doesn’t tell you how to write your code. The conventions are mostly for the HTTP layer and you’re free to write other lower layers the way you want. A few of the most notable things include:</p>

 
   The web application is a pipeline processing incoming requests through features and route handlers. 
   Request handling is non-blocking; it relies on <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html">Kotlin coroutines</a>. 
   The configuration file format is <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">HOCON</a>. 
   Framework is employing DSL for the top-level declarations, e.g., modules setup, routing, etc. 
   Pluggable features are configured using <code>install(FeatureObject) { config }</code>. 
   Most of the functions and properties you use are <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html#extension-functions">extension functions</a>. 
 

 Ktor Project Structure 

<p>The application in this example depends on several libraries:</p>

 
   Kotlin programming language you use for this project 
   Ktor server with Ktor server CIO - server implementation and coroutine-based HTTP engine core 
   Ktor client with Ktor client CIO - client used to communicate to OAuth2 server 
   Ktor Auth module to handle authorization flow 
   kotlinx.html set of classes allowing to write type-safe HTML generators 
   Okta JWT Verifier library helps to parse and verify access and id tokens 
 

<p>You can bootstrap this tutorial by cloning our Git repository and starting with the <code>initial</code> branch:</p>

   <code>git clone -b initial https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-kotlin-ktor-example.git
cd okta-kotlin-ktor-example
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you want to see the completed app, with Okta already integrated, you can check out the <code>main</code> branch. See the project’s README for instructions on how to configure it to work with your Okta account.</p>

 Start your Ktor Application 

<p>Use IntelliJ runner or type <code>./gradlew run</code> in the command line to start your application, point your web browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>All the messages displayed are from the in-memory database. Note that at this stage, the user can’t log in; hence they can’t post messages.</p>

 Secure Your Ktor Application with Okta 

<p>Real-world applications often require users to log in to perform some actions or access information. User management and security are much more complicated than they might seem and it can be tough to make them right. If you have done it previously, you know what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>User management shouldn’t take much of your time because that problem is solved already, right? In this tutorial, you’ll be using Okta’s OAuth 2.0 authorization service along with OpenID Connect (OIDC). Okta provides many features for both enterprise and personal project needs - MFA, SAML, groups, policies, social media logins, and many more. We offer solutions for different size companies - from pet projects just for yourself to big enterprises such as FedEx, Box, HubSpot, Experian, and <a href="https://www.okta.com/customers/">many others</a>. Okta helps developers implement secure authentication, handles authorization, and can act as an identity provider with a minimum effort and lines of code.</p>

<p>If you haven’t created an Okta account yet, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up</a> first. It’s free, no credit card required.</p>

<p>Login to the Okta admin console. On the top menu select Applications → Add Application:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, configure your Okta application. Don’t worry, if you want to change anything it’s always possible to return to this screen. At the very least, you need to set the following settings:</p>

 
   Name - give it a meaningful name, for instance, <code>My Ktor nano Blogging Service</code> 
   Base URIs - put <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> there. Multiple URI can be provided; you can add more URIs if needed. 
   Login redirect URIs - set it to <code>http://localhost:8080/login/authorization-callback</code>. Upon successful login, the user will be redirected to URI provided with tokens in the query. 
   Logout redirect URIs - value <code>http://localhost:8080</code> allows you to provide a redirect URL on successful logout. 
 

<p>Click Done to finish the initial setup.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Take note of the following three values. You’ll use them in your Ktor application:</p>

 
   
    <p>Org URL: Hover over API on the top menu bar, and select Authorization Servers menu item, copy the value from Issuer URI</p>
   
   
    <p>Client ID and Client Secret as below:</p>
   
 

<p></p>

 Configure Ktor’s OAuth 2.0 Module 

<p>Ktor has an implementation of OAuth Client—it just needs to be configured. It’s always good practice to never insert any keys, tokens, or credentials directly into the code. Even for a demo project. To inject Okta parameters from environment variables, append a new block in <code>resources/application.conf</code>:</p>

   <code>...
okta {
    orgUrl = ${OKTA_ORGURL}
    clientId = ${OKTA_CLIENT_ID}
    clientSecret = ${OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET}
}
</code>   

<p>To start your application from IntelliJ IDEA or any other IDE, these environment variables must be provided. In the Run/Debug Configuration dialog, click on the Environment variables and specify them as I have below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, create a <code>src/auth-settings.kt</code> file to contain all Okta-configuration related functions.</p>

<p>You could also create an <code>okta.env</code> file with the following code:</p>

   <code>export OKTA_ORGURL=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
export OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
export OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
</code>   

<p>Next, run <code>source okta.env</code> before running your app.</p>

<p>If you’re on Windows, name the file <code>okta.bat</code> and use <code>SET</code> instead of <code>export</code>.</p>

<p>Add a generic configuration class for Okta services in <code>src/auth-settings.kt</code>.</p>

   <code>data class OktaConfig(
    val orgUrl: String,
    val clientId: String,
    val clientSecret: String,
    val audience: String
) {
    val accessTokenUrl = "$orgUrl/v1/token"
    val authorizeUrl = "$orgUrl/v1/authorize"
    val logoutUrl = "$orgUrl/v1/logout"
}
</code>   

<p>Create a configuration reader in <code>src/auth-settings.kt</code>. This takes a <code>Config</code> object, reads from it, and creates an <code>OktaConfig</code> object.</p>

   <code>fun oktaConfigReader(config: Config): OktaConfig = OktaConfig(
    orgUrl = config.getString("okta.orgUrl"),
    clientId = config.getString("okta.clientId"),
    clientSecret = config.getString("okta.clientSecret"),
    audience = config.tryGetString("okta.audience") ?: "api://default"
)
</code>   

<p>Finally, the <a href="https://ktor.io/servers/features/authentication/oauth.html">Ktor Auth module</a> is expecting configuration to be passed as <code>OAuthServerSettings.OAuth2ServerSettings</code>. For that, you need a mapping function in <code>src/auth-settings.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>fun OktaConfig.asOAuth2Config(): OAuthServerSettings.OAuth2ServerSettings =
    OAuthServerSettings.OAuth2ServerSettings(
        name = "okta",
        authorizeUrl = authorizeUrl,
        accessTokenUrl = accessTokenUrl,
        clientId = clientId,
        clientSecret = clientSecret,
        defaultScopes = listOf("openid", "profile"),
        requestMethod = Post
    )
</code>   

 Setup a Ktor Authentication Module 

<p>All authentication configuration and handling happen inside the <code>setupAuth()</code> function of <code>src/auth.kt</code> file. Start filling it with configuration. Use <code>oktaConfigReader()</code> to read configuration from the application file. Then, install the <code>Authentication</code> feature and configure it to use OAuth, provide it a redirect callback, the Okta OAuth2 configuration, and a default <code>HttpClient</code> for the Ktor OAuth client features.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demo.ktor
 
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
import com.okta.jwt.JwtVerifiers
import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.auth.*
import io.ktor.client.*
 
fun Application.setupAuth() {
    val oktaConfig = oktaConfigReader(ConfigFactory.load() ?: throw Exception("Could not load config"))
    install(Authentication) {
        oauth {
            urlProvider = { "http://localhost:8080/login/authorization-callback" }
            providerLookup = { oktaConfig.asOAuth2Config() }
            client = HttpClient()
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>To ensure that tokens provided are valid, they need to be verified. This can be done using the<a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-java">Okta JWT Verifier library</a>. Construct access token and ID token verifiers as follows:</p>

   <code>val accessTokenVerifier = JwtVerifiers.accessTokenVerifierBuilder()
    .setAudience(oktaConfig.audience)
    .setIssuer(oktaConfig.orgUrl)
    .build()
val idVerifier = JwtVerifiers.idTokenVerifierBuilder()
    .setClientId(oktaConfig.clientId)
    .setIssuer(oktaConfig.orgUrl)
    .build()
</code>   

<p>Next, configure three login-specific endpoints. Ktor DSL assumes the following structure:</p>

   <code>fun Application.setupAuth() {
    ...
    routing {
        authenticate {
            // Okta calls this endpoint providing accessToken along with requested idToken
            get("/login/authorization-callback") {
                // ⚫ handle authorization
            }
            // When guest accessing /login it automatically redirects to okta login page
            get("/login") {
                // ⚫ perform login
            }
        }
        // Perform logout by cleaning cookies
        get("/logout") {
            // ⚫ perform logout
        }
    }
}
</code>   

 Sign in with the <code>/login</code> endpoint 

<p>It’s the easiest one. Ktor will require user authentication for all endpoints located within the <code>authenticate</code> block. If a user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the authorization URL. Its value is taken from the <code>authorizeUrl</code> property from <code>OktaConfig</code>.</p>

<p>Since the Ktor Auth module is handling this itself, the implementation is a single line. The condition checks if a visitor has a session and, if so, redirects it to the root of the website:</p>

   <code>// When guest accessing /login it automatically redirects to okta login page
get("/login") {
    call.respondRedirect("/")
}
</code>   

 Authorization endpoint <code>/login/authorization-callback</code> 

<p>Upon successful authorization, the user is redirected to this URL. The Okta authorization service provides access and ID tokens as part of the login flow. If unsure, <a>read our Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OIDC</a>.</p>

<p>To extract information (aka, parse the JWT) about the user, you can use Okta’s JWT Verifier. In the code below, the user’s name is taken from the token’s claims and “slugified”, to create a URL-safe alphanumeric username. Finally, a new session is created and the user redirected to the <code>/</code>.</p>

   <code>// Okta calls this endpoint providing accessToken along with requested idToken
get("/login/authorization-callback") {
    // Get a principal from from OAuth2 token
    val principal = call.authentication.principal&lt;OAuthAccessTokenResponse.OAuth2&gt;()
        ?: throw Exception("No principal was given")
    // Parse and verify access token with OktaJwtVerifier
    val accessToken = accessTokenVerifier.decode(principal.accessToken)
    // Get idTokenString, parse and verify id token
    val idTokenString = principal.extraParameters["id_token"]
        ?: throw Exception("id_token wasn't returned")
    val idToken = idVerifier.decode(idTokenString, null)
    // Try to get handle from the id token, of failback to subject field in access token
    val fullName = (idToken.claims["name"] ?: accessToken.claims["sub"] ?: "UNKNOWN_NAME").toString()
    println("User $fullName logged in successfully")
    // Create a session object with "slugified" username
    val session = UserSession(
        username = fullName.replace("[^a-zA-Z0-9]".toRegex(), ""),
        idToken = idTokenString
    )
    call.sessions.set(session)
    call.respondRedirect("/")
}
</code>   

 Logout endpoint <code>/logout</code> 

<p>Users might have reasons to log out from the website—they might even simply erase cookies! Some people may consider that a little bit too technical. You can help them to do so by resetting the session on the server-side:</p>

   <code>// Perform logout by cleaning session
get("/logout") {
    call.sessions.clear&lt;UserSession&gt;()
    call.respondRedirect("/")
}
</code>   

 Start Your Kotlin + Ktor Application 

<p>Run your application, open your browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and click Login from the top menu bar. You will see an Okta login screen. After you type your credentials you’ll be redirected back to the app but as a user this time. Try to send some messages!</p>

<p></p>

<p>🎉 Congratulations, you just added authorization to your service!</p>

 Logout with Okta 

<p>Did you try to t̶u̶r̶n̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶f̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶a̶g̶a̶i̶n̶ logout and login again? You might observe an unexpected behavior. If you checked “remember me” box in the Okta screen, you virtually can’t log out—or at least it looks like that.</p>

<p>From the user’s point of view, they expect to see a login screen inviting to put login/password——not to automatically be logged in:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You might ask yourself: why is it done this way? Why doesn’t the Authorization server purge sessions?</p>

<p>What if you’re using Facebook instead of Okta as an Authorization and Identity Provider service? And you want to logout from some website and that website also destroys your session in Facebook. It doesn’t sound nice, does it?</p>

<p>If you intend to logout users from Okta, as well, you’ll need to use something called RP-Initiated Logout. You can read more about it <a>in this blog post</a>. The basic idea is straightforward - after you remove a session inside your app, the user needs to visit a specially formed <code>logoutUrl</code> with <code>idToken</code> provided as a <code>GET</code> parameter. Update your logout handler in <code>src/auth.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>// Perform logout by cleaning cookies and start RP-initiated logout
get("/logout") {
    val idToken = call.session?.idToken

    call.sessions.clear&lt;UserSession&gt;()

    val redirectLogout = when (idToken) {
        null -&gt; "/"
        else -&gt; URLBuilder(oktaConfig.logoutUrl).run {
            parameters.append("post_logout_redirect_uri", "http://localhost:8080")
            parameters.append("id_token_hint", idToken)
            buildString()
        }
    }

    call.respondRedirect(redirectLogout)
}
</code>   

<p>Restart your application and try to logout. Now the application behaves as you’d expect:</p>

<p></p>

 Manage Users With Okta 

<p>The Nano Blogging Service is more fun when different people can log in! You can create additional users from the Okta Developer Console. From the top menu bar, click on Users, then Add Person. You’ll be presented with a dialog to add a new user:</p>

<p></p>

 Enable User Registration 

<p>Okta also provides a self-sign up service. You can enable it by heading to the Okta Developer Console, hovering over the Users top menu item, and selecting Registration from the sub-menu. Okta will show a single button you need to click to activate the feature:</p>

<p></p>

<p>If desired, tune the default options and save.</p>

<p>Then, when you try to sign in to your service, you’ll see a “Sign up” link:</p>

<p></p>

 Ktor Secure App Code Review 

<p>Now that you have everything working, let’s take a look at the Kotlin code that makes it all possible.</p>

 Ktor Data Layer 

<p>Look at the basic data models of your application in the <code>src/entities.kt</code> file:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demo.ktor
 
import java.time.LocalDateTime
 
data class BlogRecord(
    val userHandle: String,
    val text: String,
    val createdAt: LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now()
)
 
data class UserSession(
    val username: String,
    val idToken: String
)
</code>   

<p>The <code>BlogRecord</code> class contains information about the <code>userHandle</code>, posted <code>text</code> and <code>createdAt</code> timestamp. <code>UserSession</code> is an object which contains information about a currently signed in user; see the authentication section for more details.</p>

<p>The <code>BlogRecordRepository</code> class is responsible for data manipulation. For demo purposes, data is stored in memory and initialized with some dummy records at startup time.</p>

<p>Your data repository is in the <code>src/BlogRecordRepository.kt</code> file:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demo.ktor
 
class BlogRecordRepository {
    private val records = mutableListOf&lt;BlogRecord&gt;()
 
    val all: List&lt;BlogRecord&gt;
        get() = records
 
    fun insert(userHandle: String, text: String) {
        records += BlogRecord(userHandle, text)
    }
 
    fun byUser(userHandle: String) = records.filter { it.userHandle == userHandle }
}
 
val blogRecords = BlogRecordRepository().apply {
    insert("kack", "Hello world!")
    insert("kack", "Keep messages short and sweet! 💬")
    insert("ann", "OMG it's a future unikorn 🦄!")
    insert("rux", "Chronological feed! It's just like the good old days! ")
    insert("kotlin", "Wise language selection")
    insert("whitestone", "We'd like to invest 💰💰💰")
    insert("cat", "🐈🐱🙀😼😻🐾")
}
</code>   

 Ktor Main Application Configuration 

<p>Before you get into the route handling and login flow, the web service itself needs to be configured. As per convention, Ktor services are configured by creating an <code>Application.module()</code> extension function. Look at the configuration sections in <code>src/application.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demo.ktor
 
import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.features.*
import io.ktor.request.*
import io.ktor.sessions.*
import io.ktor.util.*
import org.slf4j.event.Level
import kotlin.collections.set
 
fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;): Unit = io.ktor.server.cio.EngineMain.main(args)
 
@Suppress("unused") // Referenced in application.conf
@kotlin.jvm.JvmOverloads
fun Application.module(testing: Boolean = false) {
    // Sessions are stored in encrypted cookies
    install(Sessions) {
        cookie&lt;UserSession&gt;("MY_SESSION") {
            val secretEncryptKey = hex("00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff")
            val secretAuthKey = hex("02030405060708090a0b0c")
            cookie.extensions["SameSite"] = "lax"
            cookie.httpOnly = true
            transform(SessionTransportTransformerEncrypt(secretEncryptKey, secretAuthKey))
        }
    }

    // Respond for HEAD verb
    install(AutoHeadResponse)

    // Load each request
    install(CallLogging) {
        level = Level.INFO
        filter { call -&gt; call.request.path().startsWith("/") }
    }

    // Configure ktor to use OAuth and register relevant routes
    setupAuth()

    // Register application routes
    setupRoutes()
}
 
// Shortcut for the current session
val ApplicationCall.session: UserSession?
    get() = sessions.get&lt;UserSession&gt;()
</code>   

<p>Your application module configures the session handler to keep data in encrypted cookies and enable logging, which is very useful for debugging. Two of the functions - <code>setupAuth()</code> and <code>setupRoutes()</code>- configure OAuth 2.0 and setup web service routes.</p>

 Ktor Service Routes 

<p>This application registers two routes with Ktor DSL making it very expressive:</p>

 
   <code>POST /</code> takes a <code>text</code> parameter from the body and current <code>actor</code>(user handle) from the session and creates a new nano blog record. Both <code>actor</code> and <code>text</code> must be valid to create a new record; otherwise, an error is thrown. Upon a successful insertion, the user gets redirected to the <code>/</code>. 
   <code>GET /{username?}</code> effectively handles all <code>GET</code> requests and attempts to extract the <code>username</code> URL parameter if present. Then, it renders the main template with either global or requested user’s feed using the <code>feedPage()</code> method. 
 

<p>See <code>src/routes.kt</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.demo.ktor
 
import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.html.*
import io.ktor.request.*
import io.ktor.response.*
import io.ktor.routing.*
 
fun Application.setupRoutes() = routing {
    post("/") { root -&gt;
        val actor = call.session?.username
            ?: throw Exception("User must be logged in first")
        val text = call.receiveParameters()["text"]?.takeIf(String::isNotBlank)
            ?: throw Exception("Invalid request - text must be provided")

        blogRecords.insert(actor, text)

        call.respondRedirect("/")
    }

    get("/{username?}") {
        val username = call.parameters["username"]
        call.respondHtmlTemplate(MainTemplate(call.session?.username)) {
            content {
                val canSendMessage = call.session != null
                if (username == null) feedPage("🏠 Home feed", blogRecords.all, canSendMessage)
                else feedPage("👤 ${username}'s blog", blogRecords.byUser(username), canSendMessage)
            }
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The page-rendering function, <code>feedPage()</code>, takes three parameters: page title, list of the nano blog posts to render, and a boolean flag <code>canSendMessage</code> (if it’s true, the text submission form will be visible). The variable <code>canSendMessage</code> is set to true only when the current user has an active session, that is possible only after login.</p>

 Type-Safe Views with Kotlin 

<p>Kotlin syntax empowers developers to create type-safe DSL. This Nano Blogging Service is using the <code>kotlinx.html</code> library, which provides HTML-like syntax for HTML-rendering. All the views are in the <code>src/views.kt</code> file.</p>

<p>The primary and only template <code>MainTemplate</code> includes Bootstrap CSS library, renders the top navbar menu, and provides a basic layout for the frontend:</p>

   <code>/**
* Generic web page template, contains content placeholder where
* content should be placed
*/
class MainTemplate(private val currentUsername: String? = null) : Template&lt;HTML&gt; {
    val content = Placeholder&lt;HtmlBlockTag&gt;()
    override fun HTML.apply() {
        head {
            title { +"Nano Blogging Service" }
            styleLink("https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css")
            meta(name = "viewport", content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no")
            meta(charset = "utf-8")
        }
        body("d-flex flex-column h-100") {
            header {
                div("navbar navbar-dark bg-dark shadow-sm") {
                    div("container") {
                        a(href = "/", classes = "font-weight-bold navbar-brand") {
                            +"📝 𝓝𝓐𝓝𝓞 𝓑𝓛𝓞𝓖𝓖𝓘𝓝𝓖 𝓢𝓔𝓡𝓥𝓘𝓒𝓔"
                        }
                        div("navbar-nav flex-row") {
                            if (currentUsername != null) {
                                a(href = "/${currentUsername}", classes = "nav-link mr-4") {
                                    +"Hello, $currentUsername"
                                }
                                a(href = "/logout", classes = "nav-link") {
                                    +"Logout"
                                }
                            } else {
                                div("navbar-text mr-4") {
                                    +"Hello, Guest"
                                }
                                div("navbar-item") {
                                    a(href = "/login", classes = "nav-link") {
                                        +"Login"
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            main("flex-shrink-0 mt-3") {
                div("container col-xs-12 col-lg-8") {
                    insert(content)
                }
            }
        }
    }

<p>Confused about plus(<code>+</code>) sign in front of the string inside HTML elements? Don’t worry. It’s just a shortcut for the <code>text()</code> function which sets current tag content.</p>

<p>View blocks such as <code>feedBlock()</code>, <code>sendMessageForm()</code> and <code>feedPage()</code> are extension functions (I know, there’s a lot of them!) on <code>FlowContent</code>. That prevents global scope pollution with enormous HTML DSL elements and provides better encapsulation.</p>

   <code>/**
 * Displays feed block only
 */
fun FlowContent.feedBlock(feedItems: List&lt;BlogRecord&gt;) {
    feedItems.forEach { record -&gt;
        div("entity card m-4") {
            div("w-100 card-header") {
                h4("user font-weight-bold mb-0 pb-0 d-inline-block") {
                    a(href = "/${record.userHandle}") { +record.userHandle }
                }
                span("float-right text-secondary") {
                    +record.createdAt.format(timeFormatter)
                }
            }
            div("card-body") {
                h5 { +record.text }

/**

fun FlowContent.sendMessageForm() {
    form("/", encType = applicationXWwwFormUrlEncoded, method = post) {
        div("mb-3") {
            div("input-group") {

                }

        }

<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4068">Human-centric Data &amp; Identity Management – Implementing Real World Case Studies</a><br><br>Earlier in 2020, the European Union published “A European Strategy for Data” outlining its vision for a connected single digital market where the benefits of the digital economy could enhance the lives of its citizens, residents and trade partners.<br><br>However, we now find ourselves at a very real crossroad. A post-pandemic world will be a new type of normal. Amidst the tragic loss of lives there have been breakthroughs in science, new ways of working along with embracing new digital tools.<br><br>We are at the beginning of a new design and architectural phase where just because technology can, doesn’t mean it should. Personal data linked to identity, fuelled by AI sits at the centre of these decisions.<br><br>Enabling citizens, students, patients, passengers and consumers to more equitably join the value chains fuelled by data will ultimately lead to greater trust and personalisation, resulting in a more prosperous society. However, this will require new commercial models, enforceable regulation and the digital tools to transform our connected society.<br><br>This session will focus on the implementation of real-world case studies including standards, commercial models and technology choices.

Data Sovereignty Now: unleashing the benefits of data in line with European values<br>Webinar: Thursday 22 October 2020 – 14:15:15 CET




 




On behalf of ourselves and our partners, <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org/2020/09/30/event-webinar-datasovereignty-now-political/">we are pleased to invite you to our webinar </a>debate on ‘Data Sovereignty Now: unleashing the benefits of data in line with European values’. The webinar is especially interesting for politicians and their staff in Europe.



It is the aim of the European Commission and local governments to unleash the full benefits of data usage for everyone in Europe in line with European values. Data sovereignty holds the key to achieving that.<br><br>It is a worthy ambition, but one that also raises a number of questions, such as what exactly is data sovereignty, how does it support European values, and how can organisations in the public/private sector help to accomplish this ambition?<br><br>These questions will be addressed in the webinar on 22 October.<br><br>Featuring:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arief-ernst-hühn-1721bb40/">Arief Hühn</a>, researcher at&nbsp;FreedomLab, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericpol/">Eric Pol</a>, founder of A New Governance and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a>, CEO &amp; Founder of Meeco.<br><br>Followed by panel discussion featuring&nbsp;the following experts: Eric Pol, Katryna Dow, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsinipuro/">Jaana Sinipuro</a> (project director at Sitra), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerardvdhoeven/">Gerard van der Hoeven</a> (director of&nbsp;the iSHARE Foundation) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/douwel/">Douwe </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/douwel/">Lycklama</a> (founder of&nbsp;INNOPAY).<br>

 An educational resource to learn about the Ocean toolkit — for the community, by the community <p>Ocean Academy is a community initiative created by four passionate Ocean Ambassadors. They aimed to have the broadest reach possible, including AI practitioners, data scientists and data owners, who may not yet be familiar with blockchain and smart contracts.</p><p>As the team started working on the project, it became clear that this project could go beyond credentialing, and serve as an outreach platform for Web3 and Ocean Protocol. And so, Ocean Academy came to fruition.</p> An Introduction <p><a href="https://oceanacademy.io?ref=oann">Ocean101</a>, the first educational module in Ocean Academy, consists of 23 chapters providing a beginner’s friendly introduction to blockchain technology. It focuses on how Ocean Protocol enables new forms of value creation and how it transforms data science workflows for practitioners.</p><p>Ocean101 is for anyone who is interested in learning how to monetize data and analytic services using blockchain technology. It was designed to provide a practical and interactive introduction to blockchain and Ocean Protocol, at no cost for the&nbsp;users.</p><p>The Ocean Academy team wants to spark the interest of the AI/data science community, with the <a href="https://oceanacademy.io?ref=oann">Ocean101</a> module, and join the open future for data science movement.</p> What to&nbsp;Expect <p>In the first few chapters of Ocean101, participants install their own Ethereum wallet, become familiar with the basic concepts of blockchain, and receive play tokens to experience first hand how Web3&nbsp;works.</p><p>Next comes a deep dive into smart contracts, and how they are used in the context of data science. Ocean Protocol’s infrastructure is presented, with a focus on how one can create value from data and algorithms.</p><p>At the end of <a href="https://oceanacademy.io?ref=oann">Ocean101</a>, a completion certificate is awarded! The module also provides new mental models and tools to enable the open future for data&nbsp;science.</p> The Future is&nbsp;Here <p>More modules are envisioned going forward, tackling more technical aspects of how Ocean Protocol can liberalize data, with its future releases.</p><p>Building a strong community is important in all blockchain networks. If you want to be an active member of the data economy, make Ocean Academy the first step in your&nbsp;journey.</p><p><a href="https://oceanacademy.io">Give it a try</a> and let us know what you think!

					  16.10.2020. Die EU-Datenstrategie fordert verantwortungsvolle Ökosysteme für personenbezogene Daten – MyData-Operatoren sind die Antwort.  comuny ist nun offiziell eines dieser richtungsweisenden Systeme.<br> <p>Eine weltweite Bewegung führender Unternehmen und Experten stellt sich auf für das neue Normale beim Datensharing und zeichnet das Produkt Trust Data Operator des deutschen Security-Startups comuny GmbH mit dem bemerkenswerten Status “MyData Operator 2020” aus.</p><p>Die Auszeichnung wurde am 14.10.2020 an sieben weltweit führende Unternehmen aus sieben Ländern verliehen, die sich alle für einen ausgewogenen Umgang mit persönlichen Daten einsetzen. “Wir sind überglücklich und bekommen mit dieser Auszeichnung eine weitere Bestätigung dafür, wie innovativ und wertvoll der Einsatz unseres Produktes ist”, so Beatrix Reiß, die zusammen mit ihrem Geschäftspartner Dominik Deimel comuny zu diesem Erfolg geführt hat. “Dominik und ich kommen aus dem eHealth-Markt und wissen aus langjähriger Erfahrung, vor welchen Hürden Modelle für neue Services, Versorgung und Zusammenarbeit stehen. Das wollten wir ändern.”</p><p>comuny erhält diese Auszeichnung für den Nachweis, wie verifizierte Daten zwischen Unternehmen und Kunde, Diensten und Lösungspartnern unter Einbeziehung und zum Vorteil aller Beteiligten übergreifend fließen. Der comuny Trust Data Operator beweist als B2B-Komponente hier das enorme Geschäftspotenzial, welches aus dem verantwortungsbewusstem Umgang mit Daten durch einen Operator entsteht.</p><p>“Viele sehen heute einfach nicht die Chancen, die eine wertschätzende digitale Beziehung mit sich bringt: bessere digitale Prozesse, Kosteneinsparungen, höhere Kundenzufriedenheit und nicht zuletzt das positive digitale Image für’s Geschäft. Deshalb unterstützen wir Unternehmen hier und lösen quasi nebenbei ihre dringenden Probleme im Kundendatenmanagement” freut sich Dominik Deimel. Das beweist comuny gerade mit ersten Kunden, so ist über den comuny Operator der Zugang zur elektronischen Patientenakte oder die Ausgabe der elektronischen Gesundheitskarte nach PDSG komplett digital möglich. Für die elektronische Patientenakte arbeitet comuny mit einer der größten Krankenkassen Deutschlands zusammen, um die Nutzung der ePA für ihre Versicherten so komfortabel wie möglich zu gestalten. comuny wurde außerdem ins aktuelle Batch#20 des InsurLab Germany berufen – das ist wie ein Ritterschlag der deutschen Versicherer.</p><p>Die 7 Organisationen, denen der Status “MyData Operator 2020” verliehen wurde, repräsentieren verschiedenste Länder und Serviceangebote. Einige bieten breit gefächerte Dienstleistungen direkt für Einzelpersonen an, einige haben fokussierte Angebote in nur einer Branche, während wieder andere Technologien und Infrastruktur für Dritte bereitstellen, um stärker auf Bedürfnisse von Kunden ausgerichtete Dienste zu ermöglichen. Sie alle dürfen ab sofort das Logo “MyData Operator 2020” verwenden und erklären, dass ihnen “der Status MyData Operator 2020 von MyData Global in Anerkennung ihres Wirkens für eine menschenorientierte Infrastruktur zur Datenverarbeitung und -nutzung verliehen wurde”.</p><p>Einzigartig an MyData-Operatoren ist auch ihr Wille zur radikalen Zusammenarbeit für sichere Datenflüsse ohne Lock-In-Effekt. Die Preisträger arbeiten untereinander zusammen, um ein erfolgreiches, interoperables Ökosystem für personenbezogene Daten zu schaffen. Joss Langford, Co-Leiter der thematischen Gruppe MyData-Operatoren gratuliert den Preisträgern “für ihre Integrität, ihren Einsatz und ihre Offenheit bei diesem beispiellosen Informationsaustausch, der weit über die Anforderungen jeglicher Gesetzgebung hinausgeht.”</p><p>“Wir glauben, dass offene Ökosysteme, die den Menschen echte Wahlmöglichkeiten zwischen guten Alternativen bieten, die neue Norm für persönliche Daten und darauf gestützte digitale Dienste sind. Die gegenwärtige Situation ist sowohl aus menschlicher als auch aus Marktperspektive unhaltbar”, erklärt Teemu Ropponen, Geschäftsführer von MyData Global.</p><p>Weitere Information</p>  Diese Organisationen wurden jetzt mit dem Status “MyData Operator 2020” ausgezeichnet: <a href="https://mydata.org/operators/">org/operators/</a>  Weißbuch “Understanding MyData operators” herunterladen oder Neuigkeiten aller MyData Operatoren verfolgen: <a href="https://mydata.org/operators/">https://mydata.org/operators/</a>  MyData Global beitreten: <a href="http://www.mydata.org/join/">mydata.org/join/</a>  MyDataGermany LinkedIn-Gruppe beitreten: <a href="https://lnkd.in/dF_Jrxf">https://lnkd.in/dF_Jrxf</a>  Was ist der <a href="https://www.comuny.de/produkt/">comuny Trust Data Operator</a>?  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>#MyData #MyDataOperator #PersonalData #DataEconomy #future-of-trust #ecosystems #trust-services #operator #collaboration #MyDataGlobal #MyDataGermany #humanTec</p> Materialien <p>Pressemitteilung</p><p>Download als PDF <a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/20201016_MyData-Operator_awards_COMUNY_press-release_dt.pdf">20201016_MyData Operator_awards_COMUNY_press release_dt.pdf</a></p><p>Download als docx <a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/20201016_MyDataOperator_awards_COMUNY_press-release_dt.docx">20201016_MyDataOperator_awards_COMUNY_press release_dt.docx</a></p><p>Übersicht Preisträger PDF <a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/List-of-all-the-awarded-MyData-Operators.pdf">List of all the awarded MyData Operators.pdf</a></p><p>Übersicht Preisträger docx <a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/List-of-all-the-awarded-MyData-Operators.docx">List of all the awarded MyData Operators.docx</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bildmaterial &amp; Logos </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Logos aller am 14.10.2020 ausgezeichneten Operatoren weltweit</p><p></p><p>Logos aller bisher anerkannten MyData Operatoren weltweit</p><p>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bild von MyData mit Joss Langford (Co-Leiter der Themen Gruppe MyData-Operatoren und leitender Redakteur des Weißbuchs “Understanding MyData Operators)</p><p></p><p>Logo der MyData Themengruppe “Operatoren”</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Logo comuny GmbH</p><p></p>

<p>Couchbase, the creator of the enterprise-class, multi-cloud NoSQL database, today announced at the Connect Conference that Gluu was acknowledged with the Couchbase Independent Software Vendor Partner of the Year Award. Guest judges for the Couchbase Community Awards included Carl Olofson, Research Vice President at IDC, and Jon Reed, Co-Founder of Diginomica.</p>
<p>Open to Couchbase’s network of more than 300 partners, the award recognizes partners’ work in bringing differentiation and innovation to customers, and leading them to successful outcomes.</p>
<p>The Couchbase database is used for Gluu Server authentication and authorization requirements that requires extreme concurrency and “active-active” multi-datacenter replication. “Couchbase and cloud native technology has enabled Gluu for the first time to achieve true horizontal auto-scaling,” said Michael Schwartz, CEO of Gluu. “It’s a great honor to win this award, because it recognizes the sustained efforts of our combined engineering teams to make this accomplishment a reality. Couchbase has enabled Gluu to make performance into a competitive advantage. We’re crushing the competition in both transactions per second and total cost of ownership. You can’t do this stuff with ancient LDAP servers, no matter how much lipstick you put on them.”</p>
<p>Learn more from Gluu and Couchbase’s previous joint press release: <a href="https://www.gluu.org/resources/documents/articles/billion-authentications-per-day/"><br>Open Source Gluu Server and Couchbase Shatter Billion-Login-Per-Day Threshold</a></p>
<p>“We are excited to not only continue, but to strengthen our long-standing partnership with Gluu,” said Matt McDonough, Vice President of Business Development at Couchbase. “Through Couchbase and Gluu’s cloud native approach, we’ve been able to split services and workloads to support auto-scaling easily enough to surpass the 1B authentications in a single day milestone. Together, we will continue to optimize the Couchbase platform along with Gluu’s robust, industry-proven solution for single sign-on and two-factor authentication to deliver the next billion authentications in a day.”</p>

<p>The problem of trust over a network is longstanding. It has been addressed in a variety of ways since the internet blossomed, but never as yet solved.</p>



<p>Take, for example, Certificate Authorities (CAs), the organizations with the power to issue certificates to websites so browsers will recognize them as legitimate. These certificates function as a primitive identification for websites, where the CA is attesting to the identity of the website and the website can use this certificate to identify itself to browsers – because all browsers trust the CAs.</p>



<p>The flaw here though is obvious: what if a CA is compromised and begins issuing false certificates? No set of keys can be considered absolutely immune to compromise, no matter how powerful the controller.</p>



<p>The central problem here is that of trustless key distribution and attribution (more specifically, the implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/dkms-recommendations.md">Distributed Key Management System (DKMS)</a>. That is, how do we know that a key is truly controlled by an identifier and, given an identifier, how can we know which keys it controls? (It’s important to note here that CAs are not trustless mechanisms, but that browsers rely entirely on trusting that a CA has not been compromised.)</p>



<p>Decentralized digital identity using the technology of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) appears to remedy the issue. However, this <a href="https://mattr.global/overview-of-decentralized-identity-standards/">collection of related specifications</a> only defines a consistent interface for different DID methods to implement a DKMS in any way they see fit, as well as associated semantics to make them very flexible and useful.</p>



<p>The exact way that key distribution and attribution is addressed is different between DID methods. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and blockchains have proven effective for the purposes of designing decentralized DID methods and even centralized trust-requiring systems, such as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/github-did">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://github.com/did-twit/did-twit/blob/master/spec/index.md">Twitter</a>, have been used.</p>



<p>Most DID methods are still fairly young, but they often share certain characteristics:</p>



  Central registry-based: the infrastructure might be decentralized (e.g. a blockchain or other DLT), however the DID method is informationally centralized, i.e. registration and resolution involve the updating or reading of the shared state of a single network or infrastructure.  Canonicity: the central registry is considered to be the single trustworthy source of truth.  Availability provision: the central registry’s entire state can be queried at any time from anywhere (with a network connection).  



<p>The logical centralization of these kinds of methods provides an important, arguably more fundamental property: conflict resolution. The underlying consensus mechanism of these DID method implementations (e.g. the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">Bitcoin blockchain for did:btcr</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver/blob/develop/README.md">Ethereum blockchain for did:ethr</a>) prevents any conflicting states from being propagated on the network. And if this sounds similar to a cryptocurrency, that’s because it is.</p>



<p>Blockchain consensus mechanisms were and are designed to maintain some kind of invariant about the current state of the chain. In Bitcoin and other currency chains, this invariant is the amount of existing coins: the mechanism is designed to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spend problem</a>. It seemingly makes sense, then, to use this property of blockchains for identity. Or does it?</p>



<p>Interestingly, it actually does not. The invariant of single-spend leads to slow consensus time because it must be applied to the globally-shared state of the chain. In identity, however, we do not have a double-spend problem.</p>



<p>The invariant we care about in identity is different. It is only that an update to the state of the keys and other metadata associated with an identifier be valid. The crux here is that the state of accounts (i.e. identifiers) never overlap or depend upon each other.</p>







 So, where does KERI fit into this? 



<p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. It was initially conceived by Dr. Samuel Smith, distributed systems pioneer and founder of <a href="https://www.pro-sapien.com/">ProSapien</a>, and is now being worked on and implemented under the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). In a nutshell, KERI is a flexible, secure, minimal and privacy-preserving trustless DKMS.</p>



<p>In contrast to blockchain or central registry-based trust systems, KERI is based on a hash-chain data structure called a ‘key event receipt log’ (KERL). Conceptually, it’s similar in some ways to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DID Method specification</a>, except that its data model is a KERL rather than a DID document. And while KERI can be used as a DID method, it is fundamentally not reliant on any of the DID specifications and can be used in many other contexts as well. In particular, it is also useful for Internet of Things (IoT) networks and other security-conscious, low-resource use cases.</p>







System design trade space. (visual rework of the original graphics by <br><a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM">Samuel Smith</a>)



 Exploring events 



<p>A KERL is composed of a list of key events and witness receipts – more on these later. A key event, however, is a transaction signed by the controller of the identifier and indicates an update in the state of the identifier’s keys or other semantics. There are a few basic kinds of key events.</p>



  Inception: this event signals the creation of an identifier, and it cryptographically binds some information to the identifier. The result of an inception event is an identifier with two sets of keys: one for signing, another for controlling. The signing key set can be used to authenticate as the identifier, while the control key set (which is hashed and not visible in the event) can be used to create rotation events.  Rotation: this event signals the change of signing and control keys for the identifier. KERI relies upon a rule called pre-rotation for post-quantum security. Rotation events maintain this rule. Upon rotation, the control keys (used to sign the rotation event) become the new signing keys, while a new set of control keys is added. This ensures that no attacker can ever compromise the control keys because they are never used (or perhaps never even existed in the first place) until they sign the transaction which makes them no longer the control keys. A rotation event which has an empty set for the control keys is equivalent to abandoning the identifier (as no new control events are possible).  Interaction: these events simply contain a commitment to a piece of data. Within KERI they can be used by a delegator to commit to – and thus finalize – a delegated inception or rotation event.  Delegated inception: this event signals adding a new set of delegated keys to the identifier. Similar to the inception event, this new key set has an identifier created by cryptographically binding its inception data, and as such can be referenced by a “path” from the main identifier, e.g. identifier#delegated_identifier.  Delegated rotation: this event signals the rotation of a delegated key set, similarly to the rotation event. Much like the main identifier, the delegated identifier does not change when the underlying key set is rotated.  



 State update rules 



<p>Along with these event types, there is a set of rules for validating a list of these events. The result of applying these rules is an identifier and a set of keys which are proven to be controlled by the identifier. In simple terms, these rules are:</p>



  There can only be one inception event, and it must come first.  Each rotation event must be signed by the control keys established by the previous events and must set the new signing keys to be the previous set of control keys.  Each delegated inception or rotation event must be signed by the signing keys established by the previous events.  All events must have a monotonically-increasing counter.  All events must contain the hash of the previous event.  



<p>These rules, when applied to the key events, provide the conflict resolution mechanism which enables KERI to work independently of a central registry. A key event log or KEL (i.e. a log containing only events with no receipts) which is being updated will reject an incorrect event. By appending the first valid event, all other valid events for that place in the KEL are rendered invalid (i.e. the counter or backhash or some other semantic detail will be deemed incorrect).</p>



<p>The key event log validation rules provide a way to know the correct key state for an identifier, just as the consensus rules of the Bitcoin blockchain provide a way to know the correct balance of an account. In this sense, a KEL can be thought of as a “single-account blockchain” or micro-ledger. This is perfect for knowing a KEL is valid — but when presented with multiple different KELs for a single Identifier, how can one know which is the “true” KEL?</p>



 Witnesses 



<p>The witness system is the conflict resolution mechanism for KERLs (remember, a KERL is a KEL plus witness receipts), the same way that the validation rules serve as the conflict resolution mechanism for key events. In an inception event, the creator of the event can list several “witness” identifiers. Upon creation of a key event (every kind, not just inception), the entity must present the event to its witnesses and in return the witness gives a signature of that event. These signatures are compiled into a witness receipt for each event in the KEL. In the case of divergent conflicting KELs being detected, a validator can collect the KEL and the witness receipts into a KERL and prove which is correct via an algorithm called KAACE (KERI’s Agreement Algorithm for Control Establishment, see section 11 of the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI white paper</a> for more details).</p>



<p>The security mechanism here is subtle but very effective:</p>



  The witnesses are cryptographically bound to the identifier in the inception event.  The witnesses are assumed to be trusted (or at least not known to be malicious) by the creator of the identifier and give signatures which cannot be repudiated.  Any attacker must compromise both the control keys of the identifier (very difficult already because of pre-rotation) and all of the signing keys used by the witnesses. If there is more than one event, they will have to compromise the entire key history of each current and previous witness and the identifier. This is much more difficult than, say, compromising the single key pair used to secure a Bitcoin account.  



<p>With these security properties, a KERI-based identifier is at least as hard to compromise as most blockchain accounts, equivalent to compromising a single private key. What’s more, a KERI-based identifier is more difficult to attack, being equivalent to reversing several hash functions and compromising an arbitrary number of private keys held by different parties.</p>



<p>This makes KERI an incredibly flexible and powerful way of managing identifiers and keys without recourse to, reliance on, or vulnerability through any centralized or decentralized service or infrastructure.</p>



<p>KERI can even act as a bridging account, whereby key pairs for different ledger networks can be managed and linked under a single Identifier, due to its cryptographic flexibility. This is because KERI currently supports five signature schemes and can be extended to add more.</p>



<p>Ultimately KERI’s core value propositions are:</p>



  Enforced pre-rotation: ensures that the recovery keys are never exposed prior to use, so that even an attacker with a quantum computer can not crack the recovery key set.  Ambient verifiability: events being verifiable without reliance on a global state which must be kept synchronised allows for KERI to be effective on any scale and in any deployment environment, networked or not.  Flexible trust structures: the two-layer multisig combined with the rotatable witness set provides support for any imaginable arrangement of trust, or none at all.

   Demand for Online Voter Registration and Voting Doubles During the Pandemic 

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic made people – perhaps for the first time – consider if it is really worth it to leave their homes for many activities. Is picking the right apple at the grocery store worth the risk? As we near the U.S. presidential election, this same question remains, although the stakes are much higher. Constituents shouldn’t have to agonize between choosing their health&nbsp;over casting a vote, or vice-versa, because there’s a better solution. It’s time for the U.S. to bring e-voting to the American people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what’s stopping the U.S. from implementing e-voting? Creating a national system of voting online is very much within the realm of possibility today. We have all the tools and technologies available at our disposal today. Below, we address common myths and objections.&nbsp;</p>

 
 


 Myth #1: People don’t want to e-vote. 

<p>As the world remains in the grips of a global pandemic, people’s preferences towards digital activities are changing rapidly across industries. In fact, findings from ForgeRock’s <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/112194411/industry-brief/forgerock-consumer-behavior-report-the-new-normal.pdf">New Normal Report</a> show consumer preferences for online voting doubled across all regions. Almost two-thirds of consumers prefer to register to vote online as well. Inarguably, most voters want a modern and secure way to cast their ballot, which means the end of the paper ballot’s exclusivity is likely near.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At ForgeRock, we believe that <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">digital identity</a> has a huge part to play in this. Digital identity technology can be essential in securing registration, user identification, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">authentication</a> – all key steps in ensuring a trustworthy and accurate vote count.</p>

   Myth #2: E-voting will enable voter fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Today, verification of votes is utterly archaic. It relies on polling volunteers to compare signatures on voter cards, which seems absurdly low tech, given the digital world we live in. That said, it is challenging to compromise in-person voting at scale. Fraudsters would have to send pretend “voters” one by one to the polls to pass off the false votes – and that’s a federal felony. For the risk, the reward just isn’t there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>E-voting, on the other hand, would introduce a much stronger root of trust than we have in the existing voting system. Identity verification technologies, which are widely available on the market today, can quickly validate the authenticity that people are who they say they are. They use a variety of methods that are much stronger than today’s simple signature match. Technologies such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network#trust-network-bb">biometrics</a>, device reputation, behavioral signals, and other digital identity capabilities offer a much more accurate validation of a voter’s identity and avoid widespread voter fraud. These digital identity technologies would transparently put every voter through multiple layers of validation that would provide much greater security without adding friction to the voter experience. The Real ID system that has now been adopted in all 50 states in the U.S. is one step forward toward a minimum standard of identity information. Real ID state licenses are required to provide a core set of security and validation features that make state licenses a very strong level of identity validation.</p>

 Myth #3: E-voting will create a new attack vector for hackers and invalidate election results.&nbsp; 

<p>One of the reasons that the U.S. voting system is resistant to manipulation today is its decentralized nature. Town to town, state to state, voting methods vary. To create an e-voting system that is resistant to an external digital attack, it, too, must be distributed or decentralized. Blockchain, which is already being utilized for online voting in several countries, is one technology that could be critical. By making it difficult to manipulate individual votes, through containerizing the voting information, utilizing encryption, rotating keys, and leveraging distributed ledger technology, hackers will face a similar challenge to paper ballots – the effort to access a single vote means it would require too much effort to impact the larger voting pool.&nbsp;</p>

 Myth #4: There is no way to maintain anonymity in voting digitally.&nbsp; 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">Identity and access management</a> (IAM) solutions are used by the biggest brands every day with a need to balance both <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">privacy </a>and data integrity. A decentralized, blockchain-based recording of votes could be held as an unchangeable backup, similar to the paper backup approach used today, while the information aggregated and shared outside that blockchain removes personally identifiable information (PII).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital voting would likely need to be decoupled into several steps to maintain <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security</a> and anonymity simultaneously. A user would need to be strongly authenticated. A record that an individual voted would need to be stored in an immutable way that can’t be linked to their actual vote. The individual’s vote would need to be deposited in a different immutable system so that votes can be easily counted and never changed. Maintaining this strict separation ensures that the vote can’t be traced back and linked to the individual who cast it.&nbsp;</p>

 Myth #5: Online voting will disenfranchise those who do not have access to smartphones or computers.&nbsp; 

<p>With voters at risk of exposing themselves to COVID-19, or the potential risk of future pandemics increasing the need for voting alternatives, e-voting should replace in-person voting. While the vast majority would benefit, there would still be measures in place for those who can’t cast an e-vote. New approaches should be introduced to ensure that no one is left behind in the voting process, but providing an e-voting option quickly will give U.S. citizens an opportunity to balance the risks they face between health and patriotism without having to stand in historically long lines, which have already become an issue in the 2020 election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we move towards an e-voting future, the disenfranchised cannot be left behind. Rather, our focus should be on re-enfranchising these communities while ensuring alternative solutions are in place so that every voice is heard and the digital divide doesn’t become the civic divide. These efforts will be well worth the investment in the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At ForgeRock, we have a big hammer in our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>, but voting is a nail-shaped problem that is rooted in identity. The capability to securely identify a person, anonymize and secure their session, and then record their vote is, at its core, digital identity. While identity can't entirely make e-voting 100% viable, as lots of other factors will contribute to its ultimate success, e-voting can’t exist without identity. To create a safe option for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/government">citizens</a> to exercise their right and responsibility to vote, the U.S. must make e-voting a reality, starting with the 2024 election. The good news is that the technology is already here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The evolution of cybersecurity protection demands a more nuanced response to providing access to a company’s sensitive resources. Policy-based access control (PBAC) combines identity attributes and context variables to enable sophisticated granting of access to corporate systems and protected resources based on centrally managed policies that ensure consistent access control decisions across the enterprise. Advancement in both business requirements and technology (such as growing use of micro-services), require a better way to control access. In a way that is consistent across all silos, dynamic enough to react to change in risk, and provides better control for the application business owners.</p>
<p>PBAC facilitates the application of consistent policy across all applications that use the PBAC authorization service. Furthermore, policies are evaluated in real-time against current attributes rather than having to wait for a nightly update of identity attributes before access control policy is correctly applied. PBAC also facilitates a risk management approach to access decisions. If access outside business hours represents a greater risk the authorization service could prompt for an additional authentication factor before access is granted.</p>

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director, Responsible Technology</p><p>Today our grantee, WaitWhat, launched the second season of <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">Should This Exist?</a>, which earlier this year was nominated by the prestigious Webby Awards for best tech podcast in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>We put Should this Exist? on the “must listen” list! It stretches your understanding about radically new technology and its implications on our lives — both the promising and perilous. The storytelling is riveting, the topics are supremely well chosen, and the show’s host — Internet serial entrepreneur and investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a> — masterfully guides listeners on unforgettable journeys alongside the inventors of our times. In each episode, Caterina engages with a groundbreaking technology — from contact tracing, to a robot caregiving, to deepfake video production — to ask the important questions. The show surrounds you with ideas and interpretations, but ultimately leaves it to you to decide if the tech should exist, and how it&nbsp;should.</p><p>We’re excited to support this show because the world is hungry for this kind of conversation, as we’ve seen with interest in <a href="https://ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer</a> and in Netflix’s recent The Social Dilemma. We want to imagine and guide technology to its greatest potential and help technologists navigate around unintended consequences that are so hard to anticipate.</p><p>After you subscribe <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">here</a> to the podcast, you might want to sign up to the <a href="http://eepurl.com/gnZTf9">weekly newsletter</a>.</p><p>Here’s a <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">custom link</a> to today’s show if you’d like to share, and below, you can read more about our first three episodes.</p><p>LISTEN: <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar</a></p><p>Premieres Wednesday, October 14:<br>The deepfake detective<br>Chances are, you’ve seen a “deepfake” video. But did you know it? A new breed of tech detectives are building tools to spot these hyper-realistic videos — built with AI — where people say things they didn’t say or do things they’d never do. Some of these clips are just good, fanciful fun. But a deepfake deployed at the right moment could sway an election, or wreck a life. That’s why UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid is working on a “deepfake detective” — a tool to help media outlets know what’s real and what isn’t. But the same program could also give deepfakers a blueprint for how to make their work undetectable. Deepfake technology already exists. This episode asks: What should we do&nbsp;now?</p><p>Premieres Thursday, October 15:<br>Contact tracing: So promising. So invasive. <br>It’s one of the best weapons we have to contain a pandemic. But can it defeat the disease without spying on people who might carry it? MIT’s Kevin Esvelt has a bold idea: Let’s try a new form of contact tracing that could more than double the program’s impact. Bi-directional tracing looks both forward and backward from a known transmission, building a chart of the “undiscovered branches of the viral family tree” and identifying potential spreaders other systems can’t see. But how much of our data are we willing to give the government, even if it’s to fight Covid-19?</p><p>Premieres Wednesday, October 21:<br>Grandma, here’s your robot<br>Is it the loneliest idea you’ve ever heard? Or an ingenious hack that helps human caregivers be more attentive and empathetic? You might have these questions when you meet the robot caregivers who roam the halls at retirement homes, doing basic tasks for residents and keeping them connected. Is elder care something we want a robot to do? Roboticist Conor McGinn from Trinity College Dublin actually moved into a retirement home in Washington, DC, to gain a deeper understanding of what residents might want from a robot. The answer surprised him, and it prompts deeper questions: As humans, what responsibility do we have toward our elders? When we fail them, should robots close the gap? And is that the future we want for ourselves?</p>

 Robert Miller, Director of Project Management and Strategy at ConsenSys Health, on healthcare data and its challenges <p>In the seventh episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we spoke to <a href="https://bertcmiller.com/about/">Robert Miller</a>, Director of Product Management and Strategy at <a href="https://consensyshealth.com/">ConsenSys Health</a>. In a conversation with us, he spoke about the uniqueness of healthcare data; the relationship between federated learning, blockchain in the context of healthcare data; challenges in the standardization of healthcare data, and more. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> Why is healthcare data considered unique? <p>Healthcare data is some of the only data that we have that is not autobiographical, but it's biographical. For example: when you write a social media post or you're on Amazon searching a product- you took an action and that generated some information. But in the context of healthcare, at least in traditional context, it is a physician actually, that is taking down notes. It is through their lens of the world of your action, their interpretations that generate your healthcare information. Even though it's a super-sensitive, intimate information about you -- it's always generated through the lens of another person. It's biographical, not autobiographical. And that generates all sorts of interesting problems from it. Traditionally, people think of it as their medical records or the kind of information that gets taken down in a physician's office or maybe an insurance company, but you can almost see any information in some way as health information if you dig deep enough. It's not just your CT scan, but you might be able to use somebody's social media activity and their text messages to get a proxy of how social they're feeling. This could be an indicator of how mentally well they are or not. There's an increasingly expansive view that not only are your health records or health data, but all of your data is health data in some sense or the&nbsp;other.</p> Sovereign identity in healthcare doesn't exist to&nbsp;die <blockquote>I don’t think that identity really exists in healthcare to die the way that it does in other domains. Health data is very unstandardized but the situation is getting better. Let’s say there are two hospitals- If you were to walk in and go up to the desk of each and sign up for them, they will probably record your identity in two different ways. It is very difficult to take a person’s identity in one context in one part of the healthcare system and match it to a person’s identity in a different context, because there aren’t standardized ways of doing this. Not only do we not have self-sovereign identity, we just don’t have a good sense of identity at all in&nbsp;health.</blockquote><p>Standardization is a very important problem that needs to be solved in order for us to have data sovereignty. We're getting better all the time at standardizing data and people are slowly converging on some standards. Machine learning algorithms are getting better at matching people's identities or like learning the sort of quirks but there is a long way to&nbsp;go.</p><p>The reason why there is no national standard patient identity in the United States like there is in other places is a long-standing worry on part of our lawmakers.</p> What is Federated learning and privacy-preserving AI <p>Federated learning is a way of training machine learning algorithms in a collaborative privacy-preserving manner. That allows for a network of participants to train an algorithm without any individual participant needing to share their data. In a traditional machine learning context, you send the data to a centralized repository. And in that centralized repository, you train an algorithm. But in federated learning, you send the algorithm to the data stored in its home location. Participants in the network after they receive the algorithm, improve it on their local data, which creates an updated better algorithm before passing on to the next participant in the federated Learning Network. And it's only this updated algorithm and not the underlying data which is shared. A federated learning network can have 30 parties training the same algorithm or a million parties even at scale, without anybody sharing their underlying information. It is a way of training a decentralized AI. And in all likelihood, you've benefited from and contributed to a federated learning network without ever knowing&nbsp;it.</p><p>Federated learning originated from a team at Google, who created it as a way of improving typing suggestions on your device without people having to give up their privacy. The basic way that it works is that you have an algorithm on your phone from Google. And this algorithm updates based on what you're typing, and sort of proves the algorithm improves predictions based on the way that you type in those improvements on the autofill or the texting predict algorithm are aggregated together by Google, which formed the basis of a new algorithm that is then distributed to your phone, the way that you tied improves it a little bit, those improvements, then get aggregated again, and so forth. This lets you preserve individual privacy and your texts are never shared, only the improvements in the algorithm autocorrect. This type of technology can be used in other contexts as well, like enterprise health data settings.</p><blockquote>Right now, federated learning in a healthcare context is only being used by enterprises. I think that there are about 10 different federated learning networks that are running on health data today on varying levels of sophistication.</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>1:28-5:30: Introduction by Robert Miller and background</p><p>5.35-8:20: Why healthcare data is&nbsp;unique</p><p>8:20-16:30: Sovereign identity in healthcare</p><p>16.38-29:59: federated learning and healthcare data</p><p>30: 00-end: The role of DAOs in standardization of data, healthcare data on the blockchain and&nbsp;beyond</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 A Decade of Digital Public Goods: Holding Up the Digital Economy, Preventing Monopolies, and Safeguarding Freedoms for&nbsp;All <p>By CV Madhukar, Managing Director, Responsible Technology</p>Long lines form with South Africans waiting to receive COVID relief&nbsp;funds.<p>Digital platforms, such as <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/the-open-source-identity-platform-mosip-hits-a-new-milestone-ff9137610bed">digital identity</a> and interoperable <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">payment systems</a>, form the scaffolding that holds up our entire digital economy, improving the delivery of basic services to millions.</p><p>While not visible, this digital architecture has the power to enhance many different aspects of our lives, wherever we live on the globe. Identification enables people to open new bank accounts and access public services like education and health. While interoperable payment systems have the ability to drive down transaction costs for consumers.</p><p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen just how essential digital infrastructure can be. South Korea and Singapore were able to use theirs to track and trace who had contracted the virus — and to whom they had been in close proximity with. India used its digital infrastructure to send more than $200 million in emergency aid directly to more than 340 million citizens in a matter of days. Estonia, meanwhile, used its digital infrastructure to create digital immunity passports, which allow those who have recently tested negative for the novel coronavirus to return to work in person. <br> <br>The problem is that this kind of digital infrastructure is only present in a few countries around the world — which leaves the rest of us to depend on slower, less reliable systems. Even in countries as wealthy as the US, unemployment benefits, which could be paid in seconds via digital infrastructure, can take months to process due to antiquated technology and processes. And when it comes to countries with far fewer resources, especially in Africa, the lack of digital infrastructure can create even bigger impediments to access even basis services. For example, the lack of formal identification is one of the biggest barriers for financial inclusion. And even if governments and philanthropists have every intention of supporting vulnerable people, these will remain mere intentions without a mechanism through which they can get people the resources they need. <br> <br>That’s why Omidyar Network is working to make sure countries have the technical resources to build the digital infrastructure that is powering so much of the developed world — and to do it in a way that is cost-saving, open-sourced, and empowering to local entrepreneurs who will no longer have to be dependent on big technology companies.</p><p>To be clear, digital infrastructure must also be accompanied by rigorous laws and policies to protect individual privacy and prevent harms. Digital infrastructure must be built so people have control over how their data are used, and data privacy must be built-in, not opt-in. It should be seen as a public good that enables private-sector growth, prevents digital monopolies, and safeguards the rights and freedoms of&nbsp;all.</p><p>On September 18, New America organized a virtual event, “<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/events/un-general-assembly-2020/">2030: A Decade of Digital Public Goods for Effective Institutions</a>,” on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Philanthropists, heads of state, government regulators, civil society leaders, and startups gathered to launch a decade of work to develop digital goods for the public sector. Several speakers pointed to the shortage of public investment in building such infrastructure.</p><p>We urgently need philanthropists to not only bring development assistance to the countries that need it, but to also invest in the infrastructure that makes it possible to get there. We need governments to own this agenda and build tech so the management of large-scale, digital infrastructure lies within the country’s elected institutions. And in an era where data has become a key factor of economic development, we need to focus on empowering individuals with agency, thereby generating the greatest benefit to the&nbsp;people.</p><p>That’s not to say the private sector won’t reap any rewards from these investments, on the contrary. In the same way companies benefit from public works like roads, bridges, and tunnels, they will also be able to innovate on top of this foundational layer of digital infrastructure — and reach customers they never could have found otherwise. Likewise, this technology will be able to multiply returns on philanthropic investments by exponentially expanding the universe for people across the world. <br> <br>Put simply, digital infrastructure is a first-mile necessity for an equitable digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>This could have a positive, transformative impact on the global economy and global development. But it’s going to take all of us to install safe and inclusive, digital infrastructure all over the world. If we make this kind of investment, we can begin to build a world where gaps in technology never limit the programs governments can implement, the progress they can make, or anything people do to improve their own&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Watch the full <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/events/un-general-assembly-2020/">event recording</a> online to hear how others in the conversation proposed advancing the #DigitalDecade to support public institutions.</p>

 The GiD Report#130 — It’s no accident that Big Tech are monopolies <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-129-what-we-learned-about-digital-identity-from-onlyfans-445b5eb8a875">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies  Justice Department could charge Google this&nbsp;week  Microsoft allows app store users to choose their own&nbsp;payments  Americans have hated monopolies for centuries  How Facebook screwed up by trying to get TikTok&nbsp;banned  The fintech&nbsp;wave  Stuff happens   1. Guess what? Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies according to the House Judiciary Committee. Photo Suzy Hazelwood<p>That much is outlined in their 450 page report, <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf">which you can check out&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>“No surprises here,” Greg Kidd <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1313876886796156928">tweeted</a>. (Also not a surprise if you’ve been following this newsletter.)</p><p>He added:</p><blockquote>“It’s the world we live in now. It didn’t happen by accident. We need to change the way antitrust and anticompetition law works so that it works for rather than against innovation, inclusion and neutrality.”</blockquote><p>Which is more or less spiritually aligned with the intentions of the report. These are some of the changes tol antitrust law proposed — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-5f6b5b5f-e83e-4615-8503-5317ba2c1e59.html">via&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p>  limiting companies’ ability to compete unfairly against third parties on their own platforms by either requiring online marketplaces to be independently run businesses or establishing rules for how such marketplaces can be organized;  blocking online platforms from giving themselves preferential treatment or playing favorites with other content providers;  requiring social networks to be interoperable so that people can communicate across platforms and carry their data over from one platform to&nbsp;another;  directing antitrust enforcers to assume that an acquisition by a dominant tech firm is anticompetitive unless proven otherwise; and  allowing news publishers to team up to negotiate against tech platforms looking to carry their&nbsp;content.  <p>Of interest here, the 16 month investigation outlined specifically how Apple and Facebook achieved and continues to wield its monopoly power — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-5f6b5b5f-e83e-4615-8503-5317ba2c1e59.html">via&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Apple: The report says Apple exerts monopoly power over software distribution to more than half the mobile devices in the U.S. It accuses the company of exploiting rivals by levying commissions and fees and copying apps, and says Apple gives preference to its own apps and services.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook: The social media network has monopoly power in the social networking space, the report finds, and takes a “copy, acquire, kill” approach to would-be rivals such as WhatsApp and Instagram, both of which it bought in the early&nbsp;2010s.</blockquote><p>First, we should just acknowledge that the conclusions of the report and various proposals are all an incredible validation of the work we’ve been doing here at GlobaliD the past few years. There will always be two ways to fix a systemic issue — from the top down and from the bottom up. Ideally, you have both happening in&nbsp;concert.</p><p>GlobaliD has been working on the bottom-up solution to the problem. Now the top-down approach is coming, and it’s great to&nbsp;see.</p><p>Ideally, regulations are timely but in practice, they are lagging indicators. Consumer preferences and demands are already changing.</p><p>(Anecdotal: My sister was telling me this morning that she doesn’t really use Instagram anymore or sees as much value in it for her personally. And isn’t that how these things usually go? Long before lawmakers jump through all the hoops in order to break up Facebook, the kids will have already found a new shiny&nbsp;toy.)</p><p>A bit of reality: This is really just the start of a potentially long and drawn out process. We’re talking about the titans of industry, and they won’t go down without a fight. (They’ve all already denied the findings of the report, denying that they are monopolies or violate antitrust law. Unsurprisingly, Big Tech thinks the competitive landscape is healthy.)</p><p>But if we do end up achieving the proposals of the report, it will be game changing — there’s no doubt about&nbsp;that.</p><p>This is politics, though, so you never know. That being said and given the way the current election buildup is panning&nbsp;out:</p><blockquote>If Democrats take the White House and the Senate in November, they could use this report as a blueprint for longer-term legislative and enforcement changes to limit tech giants’&nbsp;power.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theregreview.org/2020/10/01/hovenkamp-antitrust-regulation-over-time/">Antitrust and Regulation Over Time | The Regulatory Review</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/06/technology/house-antitrust-report-big-tech.html">The House Antitrust Report on Big&nbsp;Tech</a>  <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/10/antitrust-isnt-the-solution-to-americas-biggest-tech-problem">Antitrust Isn’t the Solution to America’s Biggest Tech&nbsp;Problem</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/congress-big-tech-monopoly-power.html">House Lawmakers Condemn Big Tech’s ‘Monopoly Power’ and Urge Their&nbsp;Breakups</a>  <a href="https://qz.com/1914446/a-simple-change-to-antitrust-law-that-could-rein-in-big-tech/">The single, simple rule change that could force tech platforms to&nbsp;compete</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/10/07/google-antitrust-and-how-best-to-regulate-big-tech">Google, antitrust and how best to regulate big&nbsp;tech</a>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/congress-gets-ready-to-smash-big">Congress Gets Ready to Smash Big Tech Monopolies</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/house-panel-to-recommend-breakup-of-tech-giants-republican-says">House Panel to Seek Breakup of Tech Giants, GOP Member&nbsp;Says</a>   2. This will be a long drawn out battle but there are already skirmishes abound. The Justice Department could charge Google as early as this week. (Top&nbsp;down) <p>That would amount to the biggest such action against a U.S. tech company in 20 years (since Microsoft).</p><p>It could mean forcing Google to sell off Chrome, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/10/feds-may-target-googles-chrome-browser-for-breakup-428468">reports Politico</a>.</p><p>A bit of context: This particular action is coming from the Trump administration. The point? This is truly a bipartisan issue.</p> 3. Microsoft’s app store now lets users choose their own payments systems. (Bottom&nbsp;up) <p>That’s part of 10 app store principles promoting “choice, fairness and innovation” <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/08/app-store-fairness-caf-interoperability-principles/">the company just published</a>:</p>  Developers will have the freedom to choose whether to distribute their apps for Windows through our app store. We will not block competing app stores on&nbsp;Windows.  We will not block an app from Windows based on a developer’s business model or how it delivers content and services, including whether content is installed on a device or streamed from the&nbsp;cloud.  We will not block an app from Windows based on a developer’s choice of which payment system to use for processing purchases made in its&nbsp;app.  We will give developers timely access to information about the interoperability interfaces we use on Windows, as set forth in our Interoperability Principles.  Every developer will have access to our app store as long as it meets objective standards and requirements, including those for security, privacy, quality, content and digital&nbsp;safety.  Our app store will charge reasonable fees that reflect the competition we face from other app stores on Windows and will not force a developer to sell within its app anything it doesn’t want to&nbsp;sell.  Our app store will not prevent developers from communicating directly with their users through their apps for legitimate business purposes.  Our app store will hold our own apps to the same standards to which it holds competing apps.  Microsoft will not use any non-public information or data from its app store about a developer’s app to compete with&nbsp;it.  Our app store will be transparent about its rules and policies and opportunities for promotion and marketing, apply these consistently and objectively, provide notice of changes and make available a fair process to resolve disputes.  <p>OK, sure, this is mostly a symbolic move (given Microsoft’s market share in the space) in order to get ahead of the news and to take some well-timed jabs at Microsoft’s rivals.</p><p>But it also gives you a sense of how companies in general are reacting to the new vibes of the&nbsp;times.</p> 4. A bit of history. TL;DR — Americans have hated monopolies for centuries. <p>A great longread from Ben Thompson’s Stratetchery — which is essentially<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/anti-monopoly-vs-antitrust/?utm_source=Memberful&amp;utm_campaign=cbfc41228d-daily_update_2020_10_07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-cbfc41228d-110987421"> a historical take on the American view of monopolies (and in turn antitrust)</a>.</p><p>First, here’s Ben quoting William Letwin in<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo3642778.html"> Law and Economic Policy in America: The Evolution of the Sherman Antitrust Act</a>:</p><p>Hatred of monopoly is one of the oldest American political habits and like most profound traditions, it consisted of an essentially permanent idea expressed differently at different times. “Monopoly”, as the word was used in America, meant at first a special legal privilege granted by the state; later it came more often to mean exclusive control that a few persons achieved by their own efforts; but it always meant some sort of unjustified power, especially one that raised obstacles to equality of opportunity.</p><p>And boy does that hatred go way back. Here’s a quick teaser from&nbsp;Ben:</p><p>As Letwin notes, American distrust of monopolies had its roots in England and 1624’s Statute of Monopolies, which significantly constrained the ability of the King to grant exclusive privilege; colonial and state legislatures similarly passed laws restricting grants of exclusive power by governments, and while the Bill of Rights did not have an anti-monopoly provision (contra Thomas Jefferson’s wishes), one of the most divisive political questions for the first several decades of the United States was over the existence (or not) of a national bank, in large part because it was a government-granted monopoly.</p><p>Check out Ben’s full piece:<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/anti-monopoly-vs-antitrust/"> </a><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/anti-monopoly-vs-antitrust/?utm_source=Memberful&amp;utm_campaign=cbfc41228d-daily_update_2020_10_07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-cbfc41228d-110987421">Anti-monopoly vs. Antitrust</a></p> 5. BONUS: How Facebook screwed up by trying to get TikTok&nbsp;banned <p>The <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201009&amp;instance_id=22992&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=40442&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2F3a51c187-cd2e-58cc-a68f-f0ed955b10e7&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">NYTimes tech newsletter:</a></p><blockquote>Instagram’s boss had a message this week for the White House and the world: It was counterproductive for the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/technology/us-appeals-injunction-against-tiktok-ban.html?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012">to try to ban TikTok</a>, the popular video app from&nbsp;China.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s bad for U.S. tech companies and people in the United States, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, <a href="https://www.axios.com/instagram-head-on-tiktok-ban-damage-might-have-already-been-done-e6337b00-d48f-4cb7-a2e6-791937eb233a.html?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012">told Axios</a>, if other countries take similar steps against technology from beyond their borders — including Facebook and its Instagram app. (He and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/zuckerberg-facebook-all-hands-tiktok-ban?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012">Mark Zuckerberg</a> have<a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1306941776733835278?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012"> said this before</a>, too.) “It’s really going to be problematic if we end up banning TikTok and we set a precedent for more countries to ban more apps,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>Mosseri has a point. What he didn’t say, though, was that Facebook has itself partly to blame. The company helped fan the fears about TikTok that Facebook is now worried will blow back on the company. This is&nbsp;bonkers.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook complaining about a bad policy that Facebook helped initiate might seem like an eye-rolling joke, but it’s more than that. It’s the latest evidence that the company’s executives are incapable of foresight. Facebook not predicting how its own actions might cause harm later on is partly why we have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/technology/facebook-qanon.html?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012">sprawling conspiracies</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-azerbaijan-troll-farm?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201012">autocrats harassing their own citizens</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>They weren’t wrong. There are reasons to be worried about TikTok and other Chinese technology operating in the United States. But I don’t believe Facebook was bringing up these concerns out of principled commitment to American values. What Facebook was doing was pure short-term self-interest.</blockquote><p>That sounds about&nbsp;right.</p> 6. BONUS: The fintech&nbsp;wave:  7.

<p>Decentralized identity—also known as self-sovereign identity—is earning a reputation as a silver bullet that can solve all of today’s identity problems. It promises to ensure perfect privacy, informed consent, user independence and control, and the ability to leverage the latest technology and cryptography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for those of us who’ve been in the identity industry for some time, these promises might seem far-fetched. We’ve seen too many other purported magical solutions rise and fall over our careers, and evaluating decentralized identity’s true potential is no easy task. Complicating matters is the fact that if you’re coming from a single sign-on (SSO) background of SAML, OAuth or OpenID Connect, you have likely encountered an entirely new glossary of unfamiliar terminology, often conflicting technical descriptions and a distinct lack of actionable standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s not really too surprising for new technology efforts, though it does make it more challenging to follow. So we thought we’d offer a friendly introduction—mapping concepts you’re already familiar with to the new ones, explaining where there’s a lot of overlap, highlighting some of the differences and demonstrating where decentralized identity is likely to go—without any hype.</p>

 Simplicity and Interoperability via a Datatokens Core  Introduction <p><a href="http://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> aims to equalize the opportunity to access and monetize data. We accomplish this by creating simple tools&nbsp;to:</p>  Publish and consume data as decentralized datatokens. Datatokens can get stored in ERC20 wallets, traded on ERC20 exchanges, managed by DAOs, and more. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">This post</a> has&nbsp;details.  Discover data for sale, and purchase it in Ocean Market, a decentralized exchange (DEX) tuned for data. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">This post</a> has&nbsp;details.  <p>This post describes the architecture for Ocean software, updated for Ocean&nbsp;V3.</p><p>Datatokens allow us to simplify the Ocean V3 architecture compared to Ocean V1/V2, while enhancing interoperability to leverage crypto wallets, DEXes, and more [1]. The figure below illustrates.</p>Ocean Protocol tools architecture, updated for&nbsp;V3.<p>Here’s an overview of the&nbsp;figure.</p>  The top layer is applications like Ocean Market. With these apps, users can onboard data services into crypto (publish and mint datatokens), hold datatokens as assets (data wallets), discover data assets and buy / sell datatokens for fixed or auto-determined price (data marketplaces), and consume data services (consume datatokens).  Below that are libraries used by the applications: Ocean React hooks, JavaScript library, and Python library. This also includes middleware to assist discovery: Aquarius and (3rd party tool) TheGraph.  The lowest level has the smart contracts used by the libraries. They’re deployed on Ethereum mainnet to start, and other networks&nbsp;later.  <p>Left to right are groupings of functionality: tools for datatokens, tools for markets (including pools), tools to consume data services and for metadata, and external ERC20&nbsp;tools.</p><p>The rest of this post elaborates.</p> Datatokens &amp; Access Control&nbsp;Tools <p>The publisher actor holds the dataset in Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, on their phone, on their home server, etc. The dataset has a URL. The publisher can optionally use IPFS for a content-addressable URL. Or instead of a file, the publisher may run a compute-to-data service.</p><p>In the publish step, the publisher invokes Ocean Datatoken Factory to deploy a new datatoken to the chain. To save gas fees, it uses <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167">ERC1167</a> proxy approach on the ERC20 datatoken template. The publisher then mints datatokens.</p><p>The publisher runs Ocean Provider. In the consume step, Provider software needs to retrieve the data service URL given a datatoken address. One approach would be for the publisher to run a database; however this adds another dependency. To avoid this, it stores the URL on-chain. So that others don’t see that URL, it encrypts&nbsp;it.</p><p>To initiate the consume step, the data consumer sends 1.0 datatokens to the Provider wallet. Then they make a service request to the Provider. The Provider loads the encrypted URL, decrypts it, and provisions the requested service (send static data, or enable a compute-to-data job).</p><p>Instead of running a Provider themselves, the publisher can have a 3rd party like Ocean Market run it. While more convenient, it means that the 3rd party has custody of the private encryption/decryption key (more centralized). Ocean will support more service types and url custody options in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Ocean JavaScript and Python libraries act as drivers for the lower-level contracts. Each library integrates with Ocean Provider to provision &amp; consume data services, and Ocean Aquarius for metadata. Ocean React hooks use the JavaScript library, to help build webapps &amp; React Native apps with&nbsp;Ocean.</p> Market Tools <p>Once someone has generated datatokens, they can be used in any ERC20 exchange, centralized or decentralized. In addition, Ocean provides a convenient default marketplace that is tuned for data: Ocean Market. It’s a vendor-neutral reference data marketplace for use by the Ocean community.</p><p>The marketplaces are decentralized (no single owner or controller), and non-custodial (only the data owner holds the keys for the datatokens).</p><p>Ocean Market supports fixed pricing and automatic price discovery.</p>  For fixed pricing, there’s a simple contract for users to buy/sell datatokens for OCEAN, while avoiding custodianship during value transfer.  For automatic price discovery, Ocean Market uses automated market makers (AMMs) powered by <a href="http://www.balancer.finance">Balancer</a>. Each pool is a datatoken — OCEAN pair. In the Ocean Market GUI, the user adds liquidity then invokes pool creation; the GUI’s React code calls the Ocean JavaScript library, which calls the Pool Factory to deploy a Pool contract. (The Python library also does this.) Deploying a datatoken pool can be viewed as an “Initial Data Offering” (IDO).  <p>Complementary to Ocean Market, Ocean has reference code to ease building third-party data marketplaces, such as for logistics (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/dexfreight-ocean-protocol-partner-to-enable-transportation-logistics-companies-to-monetize-data-7aa839195ac">dexFreight</a> data marketplace) or mobility (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-delivers-proof-of-concept-for-daimler-ag-in-collaboration-with-daimler-south-east-564aa7d959ca">Daimler</a>).</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">This post</a> elaborates on Ocean marketplace tools.</p> Metadata Tools <p>Metadata (name of dataset, date created etc.) is used by marketplaces for data asset discovery. Each data asset can have a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">decentralized identifier</a> (DID) that resolves to a DID document (DDO) for associated metadata. The DDO is essentially <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> filling in metadata fields. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/7">OEP7</a> formalizes Ocean DID&nbsp;usage.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/8">OEP8</a> specifies Ocean metadata schema, including fields that must be filled. It’s based on the public <a href="https://schema.org/Dataset">DataSet schema from schema.org</a>.</p><p>Ocean uses the Ethereum mainnet as an on-chain metadata store, i.e. to store both DID and DDO. This means that once the write fee is paid, there are no further expenses or dev-ops work needed to ensure metadata availability into the future, aiding in the discoverability of data assets. It also simplifies integration with the rest of the Ocean system, which is Ethereum-based. Storage cost on Ethereum mainnet is not negligible, but not prohibitive and the other benefits are currently worth the tradeoff compared to alternatives.</p><p>Due to the permissionless, decentralized nature of data on Ethereum mainnet, any last-mile tool can access metadata. Ocean Aquarius supports different metadata fields for each different Ocean-based marketplace. Developers could also use <a href="http://www.thegraph.com">TheGraph</a> to see metadata fields that are common across all marketplaces [2].</p> Third-Party ERC20 Apps &amp;&nbsp;Tools <p>The ERC20 nature of datatokens eases composability with other Ethereum tools and apps, including MetaMask and Trezor as data wallets, DEXes as data exchanges, and more. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837?source=---------3----------------------------">This post</a> has&nbsp;details.</p> Actor Identities <p>Actors like data providers and consumers have Ethereum addresses, aka web3 accounts. These are managed by crypto wallets, as one would expect. For most use cases, this is all that’s needed. There are cases where the Ocean community could layer on protocols like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> or tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://3box.io/">3Box</a>.</p> Implementation &amp; Conclusion <p>This post has outlined the Ocean architecture.</p><p>The code is in private beta with teams building on Ocean. It has undergone a security audit; there were no major issues, and lesser issues have been resolved. In coming weeks we will open up the GitHub repositories, and release updated documentation.</p> Acknowledgements <p>Thanks very much to the following people for reviews: Sarah Vallon, Monica Botez, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrucePon">Bruce Pon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alexcos20">Alex Coseru</a>. Thanks especially to Samer Sallam for his thorough feedback on the access control section. Thanks to the whole Ocean Protocol engineering team for the collaboration in building towards this. Finally, thanks to the broader Ocean community for their ongoing&nbsp;support.</p> Notes <p>[1] Ocean V3 architecture is simpler than Ocean V1/V2 architectures, without losing benefits provided by Ocean V1/V2. Its basis is the simpler mental model, with datatokens at the core. This allows it to better leverage existing infrastructure, and keeps things out of the smart contract layer if not needed there. Some simplifications include:</p>  No custom code for buy &amp; sell access. Instead, use <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC20 transfer()</a> etc.  No forcing use of OCEAN to buy &amp; sell. People can trade datatokens in whatever denomination they like (ETH, DAI, fiat, or&nbsp;OCEAN).  No custom code for logic or service execution agreements (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/exploring-the-sea-service-execution-agreements-65f7523d85e2">SEAs</a>). Instead, “<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/focus-on-productivity-not-efficiency-4ed4fe9a454f">get out of the way</a>” and let people leverage <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/">Solidity</a> for decentralized orchestration.  No overhead to <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-create-an-upgradeable-smart-contract-using-zeppelinos-example-of-fixing-smart-contract-6f6612ed8df4">upgrade smart contracts</a>. Instead, deploy super-simple smart contract code without upgradeability.  No <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/secret-store">Parity Secret&nbsp;Store</a>.  No dedicated Ocean network (Pacific). Instead, deploy to Ethereum mainnet, and beyond. We’ll provide more details in a later&nbsp;post.  <p>[2] We anticipate improved integration with TheGraph in releases after&nbsp;V3.0.</p> Further Reading   “Ocean Protocol V3 Posts: Links to all V3-Related Stories”&nbsp;[<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-posts-413b2dd33e8f">link</a>]  <p>Follow <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> via our <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a>; chat with us on <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GUyxrE0Hi154D0NrlOqLFg">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">Discord</a>; and build on Ocean starting at our&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/developers">docs</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-architecture-overview-9f2fab60f9a7">Ocean Protocol V3 Architecture Overview</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>JSON-LD, based on the ubiquitous JSON technology, is rapidly gaining <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld">adoption</a> on the web. <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> is an innovation relevant to both <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/02/25/why-is-json-ld-important-to-businesses/#565e8546e1bf">business minds</a> and developers alike.

For example, the platform generates credentials using this technology so that they can be inherently understood and referenced.</p><p>Despite it’s growing adoption, the success of standards based technologies like JSON-LD tends to depend on how quickly and easily developers can understand it.

These tools are essential for facilitating developer productivity and education.</p><p>When it comes to JSON-LD, many have observed that there are limited educational tools and resources available.

That’s why we have developed a linter, which we are open-sourcing today.</p><p>Specifically, we are open-sourcing a mono-repo of packages (“JSON-LD Lint”) designed to lint/process JSON-LD documents. These packages&nbsp;are:</p>  JSON-LD Lint Core — A typescript/javascript library containing the core linting engine for JSON-LD documents  JSON-LD Lint CLI — A command line tool for linting/processing JSON-LD documents.    JSON-LD Lint VSCode Extension — A VS Code extension aimed at providing an improved development experience within VS Code when dealing with JSON-LD documents (coming soon to the VSCode marketplace).  <p>We hope that these packages will help more developers to understand and adopt this technology. As always, we appreciate your feedback and welcome your involvement in progressing this project further! Head along to our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-lint">GitHub</a> to get involved. You can also <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">gain access</a> to MATTR’s sandbox platform to issue your own JSON-LD credentials today.</p><p>FAQ</p><p>What is JSON-LD and why is it on the&nbsp;rise?</p><p>The rise in popularity of javascript (due to its natural language monopoly in web-browsers) led to a mass exile from XML and shift over to JSON as the prefered data representation format. In the process, certain valuable features of XML were lost, in particular those that provide a standardised semantic syntax. JSON-LD defines this missing layer of syntax, which improves semantic reasoning around data. This is critical for maintaining data quality and trust in data, which is particularly important as we increase our reliance on digital infrastructure, IOT and&nbsp;AI.</p><p>What is a&nbsp;Linter?</p><p>Developers are renowned for building tools that make their job easier — whether it be through automating previously manual processes or designing tools that help to catch their mistakes. The number of tools available has grown in tandem with the open source movement.</p><p>In general a linter is a tool that analyzes some input (often source code) and flag errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. It provides developers with feedback around detected issues with their code/input and often includes information on how it could be&nbsp;fixed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/new-to-json-ld-introducing-json-ld-lint-2fd689bacccf">New to JSON-LD?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>It’s October and it means that we are having the <a href="https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/">European Cybersecurity Month</a> again. ECSM is the European Union’s annual campaign dedicated to promoting cybersecurity among EU citizens and organizations. To be completely honest, I do not remember it being much of a thing in previous years, but apparently, in 2020, cybersecurity awareness is much more important for the European Commission and not without, ahem, a very big reason.</p>
<p>I have always had mixed feelings about the whole notion of “awareness”. On one hand, raising awareness is basically <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybersecurity_awareness_training">what we analysts do</a> on a daily basis: spreading the word about new security challenges and innovative products that solve them is a major part of our job. On the other hand, it does not really help, does it? We still hear about major data breaches and ransomware attacks every day: I suspect that many people have long become completely desensitized to that news. Well, perhaps learning about <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/09/a-patient-dies-after-ransomware-attack.html">the first death of a patient</a> in a clinic hit by ransomware (in my city of all places!) was a notable and unfortunate exception…</p>
<p>So, what are we doing wrong? Are we not putting enough effort into cybersecurity awareness? Should we do it differently somehow? I wish I had a clear-cut answer to these questions… Alas, I don’t think anybody does. However, there are several points we could address. First and foremost, cybersecurity culture should obviously not be limited to a special month. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble, and if people are not constantly reminded of the dangers, they will forget and focus on more relevant aspects of their daily jobs.</p>
 Awareness should be about solutions, not problems 
<p>Another critical aspect is that awareness alone never amounts to much. People (and organizations) should learn not just about potential troubles: they need to be given concrete solutions for those. For cybersecurity, this includes not only specific security tools but also giving actionable recommendations: how to improve your computer’s security, how to defend against account takeover, how to prepare for a phishing or ransomware attack and where to seek assistance after being hit… Ideally, cybersecurity hygiene has to become a routine part of your daily life like brushing your teeth or locking the front door.</p>
<p>One simple example: how many times have you heard about the dangers of using the same simple password between multiple online services? I’d argue that the public awareness of the issue is very high, and yet, the worldwide most popular password is still “123456”. How about suggesting using a free password manager instead, like <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> or <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a><a></a>? In enterprise environments, of course, one should look for solutions with centralized management and additional capabilities like <a href="https://www.passwordsafe.com/">Mateso Password Safe</a>. Using such a tool completely changes your “password routine”, making re-using an old password more cumbersome that generating a fresh strong one each time.</p>
<p>Even better, of course, is activating multi-factor authentication whenever available. Alas, there is still no single convenient tool to support all online services, but a combination of a hardware security key like <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikey</a> and an authenticator mobile app like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> will have almost all your bases covered. And by the way, forget about changing your passwords regularly and using security questions – these have long been proven useless and are no longer recommended by reputable organizations like <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp800">NIST</a>.</p>
 Awareness in times of Corona 
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic that forced so many people to work from home for months has also completely changed the scope of enterprise cybersecurity. For years, strict segregation of work and personal activities has been enforced by security and compliance policies, even for Bring Your Own Devices. Nowadays, when so many employees resort to using their home PCs for remote work, this approach no longer works.</p>
<p>Even worse: the same devices are often used by remotely schooled children, blending the line between home and work security even further and introducing new, unexpected challenges to corporate security departments. Will raising awareness among elementary school students help? Who is supposed to do this job: Teachers? Parents? Parents’ employers? Governments? Or maybe the companies that develop the software used for remote communications?</p>
<p>One thing is certain though: the situation is not going to sort itself out. I believe, some kind of government-backed incentive is necessary<a></a>, not just for providing consistent guidance and governance across industries, but for supporting private initiatives and sanctioning negligence. Awareness campaigns like ECSM are a useful first step in that direction but other steps must follow soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the only sensible way to secure people working from home (including their families, because malware, like COVID, does not differentiate) is for organizations to expand the focus of their cybersecurity efforts beyond just BYOD. Cybersecurity Awareness Training should be an important and perhaps the first step in that direction. However, it has to focus on concrete, actionable, easily understandable guidance delivered in a way that actually makes people want to participate. A popular example of this approach is gamified phishing training. Not only people learn about the dangers of opening suspicious emails or clicking on unverified links, they are naturally incentivized to compete, learn more and apply their knowledge more often.</p>
 Expanding the scope of cybersecurity 
<p>However, organizations should not stop there. Securing their employees’ home devices should become a part of the corporate cybersecurity strategy. Of course, old-school tools like firewalls and VPNs are not suitable for such scenarios, but this is where security solutions delivered from the cloud come to the rescue. It is obvious that communications security (including not just email, but videoconferencing and online collaboration tools) should not differentiate between company-owned and personal devices. However, the same approach should apply to other fields as well, such as web security or endpoint detection and response. Even though such solutions are more “invasive” in terms of potential privacy issues, modern cloud-native products from companies like Akamai, Cisco or Zscaler offer a range of privacy-enhancing controls to overcome the compliance challenges.</p>
<p>Last but not least, government-issued guidance does not have to be your only source of expertise and best practices. Independent and strictly neutral research from industry analysts can be quite valuable as well, especially when it comes to selecting the most appropriate product for your specific risks and requirements.

<p>This is the fourth and final piece in our series focused on nationalism and its threat to digital identity. If you missed it, read the first three parts (1,2,3), now for the full story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 #ICYMI 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This series was initiated after the E.U. announced it had revoked the Privacy Shield, a transatlantic agreement that enabled the legal transfer of data between itself and the United States (U.S.). Since that ruling, we have also seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/impact-swiss-privacy-shield-inadequacy-decision">Swiss Data Protection Authority</a>&nbsp;conclude the EU-U.S. Swiss Privacy Shield was no longer a valid method of transferring personal data between the two countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This news, and subsequent follow-up, sparked our OWI team to take a step and ask ourselves if there was a broader trend around the rise of nationalism, both political and economical, and its role in disrupting international data sharing agreements. For digital identity enthusiasts like ourselves, we acknowledge that international cooperation and data sharing are essential pillars in furthering inclusive digital identity infrastructures and preventing bad actors from causing undue harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This series intends to capture what the roles and positions of the major economies — the E.U., China, and the U.S. — are in the data economy, and illustrate why the current trend towards centralization is counterintuitive to more effective digital identity strategies. In this finale, we will look at how the U.S.’s inability to lead the international community towards a unilateral digital economy infrastructure — by prioritizing companies’ free will over individual rights over its people — indirectly stifles the possibility for interoperable and secure digital identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, we will examine how, while the CCPA can be seen as a bellwether for future U.S. data privacy policy, it is still insufficient in governing how U.S. companies handle and process personal data. This position stands in stark contrast with countries abroad, who recognize data privacy as a global concern and who take concerted action to prioritize individual privacy protection and develop robust digital identity frameworks. Moreover, these issues are compounded by the fact that the U.S. has taken drastic steps over the past few years to remove themselves from several high-profile trade and political agreements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This retrenchment from the national community has forced countries to implement new mandates or remove existing agreements targeted at U.S. technology companies operating abroad. We believe the rise of nationalistic policies is hurting cooperative approaches to interoperable and inclusive digital identity frameworks. To that end, we will conclude with alternative methods forward and offer some examples of companies pursuing digital identity systems that do not necessitate centralized authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Influence of CCPA 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, October 1st, 2020, the U.S. does not have a central federal level privacy law. Data privacy is instead under the purview of several&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osano.com/articles/data-privacy-laws">industry-specific laws</a>&nbsp;(e.g., HIPAA, U.S. Privacy Act, Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), etc.) and championed by several privacy-forward states, most notably California with the&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Data Privacy Act (CCPA</a>), in addition to&nbsp;<a href="https://rampedup.us/maine-privacy-law-impact/#:~:text=On%20July%201%2C%202020%2C%20Maine,Internet%20Service%20Providers%20(ISPs).">Maine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insideprivacy.com/united-states/state-legislatures/nevadas-new-consumer-privacy-law-departs-significantly-from-the-california-ccpa/">Nevada</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>California’s economic size, political influence, and role as the de facto technology hub of the U.S. have made CCPA a global conversation topic. And it serves as the closest example of what we could expect a federal mandate to reflect. CCPA’s scope and territorial reach are more limited than the GDPR. Additionally, the extent of the Act is restricted to&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1121">two main categorie</a>s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first applies to for-profit businesses operating in California. A business must collect California citizens’ data and determine the&nbsp;purpose and means&nbsp;of their personal data, meaning that they slice and dice it for commercial purposes. Additionally, the law has specific qualifications for these businesses. They must:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Have at least $25 million in annual gross revenue 
 Buy/sell or received the personal information of at least 50,000 California consumers, households or devices annually 
 50 percent of your annual revenue comes from selling California consumers’ personal data 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This data privacy law continues to be contested by several big tech companies in the United States, contending that they are selling access to data instead of selling data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second category encompasses entities that control or are controlled by an entity that meets the first set of criteria or shares common branding with the parent entity. This makes the CCPA targeted as companies are in the personal data business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Users as End-Products&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of a federally-administered data privacy law or of any unified governance over the private-sector’s collection and use of personal data has allowed companies to act at their discretion. This freedom to optimize the user’s experience while maintaining a free business model has made the user the end-product. However, these same business practices are not being received well in countries abroad, creating mounting geopolitical tensions that manifest themselves in events such as the revoking of the Privacy Shield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Countries abroad recognize that their citizens’ personal privacy is being infringed upon for a foreign entity’s monetary benefit. Moreover, countries have legislation maintaining that personal data privacy is an individual human right (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/06/eu-general-data-protection-regulation">GDPR</a>), and U.S. companies are not abiding by that principle. It would be the equivalent of parents not teaching their children any concept of right and wrong, and during a playdate, the friend’s parents having to ask the poorly-acting child to leave their home before they can learn not to smash their face with spaghetti.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. should acknowledge its failure to implement legislation that prioritizes individuals’ rights over company profits; doing so would promote free trade in the digital economy. It is important to note that data privacy issues are not the only issue eroding global cooperation. Not only is the U.S. ineffectively governing private sector companies, but it is also actively reducing the number of formal partnership agreements with allies and trade partners. Over the last several years, the United States has pulled away from several high-profile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/01/trump-has-pulled-out-international-agreements-before-here-list/H9zTo2ctVEQ0b8xkUQ2t9J/story.html">international agreements</a>, including but not limited to the Paris Accords, JCPOA, Open Skies agreement, the U.N. Human Rights Council, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The reluctance for furthering international partnerships is forcing other countries to implement legislation, particularly around data privacy, that keeps U.S. companies accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the retrenchment from global cooperation around technology and data interoperability is closing the window on a possible future where governments successfully coordinate a standardized approach to digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Path Forward&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;<a href="https://id2020.org/digital-identity#:~:text=1.1%20billion%20people%20worldwide%20live,political%2C%20economic%20and%20social%20opportunity.">1.1 billion people</a>&nbsp;in the world without access to a digital identity – and even more people lack a mechanism to transfer or port their digital footprint with themselves outside of their native country. This lack of basic identification and interoperability systems perpetuate ongoing barriers for individuals to access goods and services. Digital identity experts, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/es/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/assets/pdf/Roadmap_for_Digital_Cooperation_EN.pdf">UNDP</a>, argue that the key to solving these issues is ongoing international cooperation and dedicating resources to establish standards for individuals to receive a universally recognized digital identifier. In addition to the lack of U.S. federal standards and frameworks, the rise of nationalism reduces the likelihood of these initiatives gaining meaningful traction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are potential paths forward. There are members of the digital identity community who are working tirelessly to promote alternative systems. Of the initiatives underway, a decentralized identity is a popular option that does not require participation from authoritative sources to maintain digital identities for individuals (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://verified.me/">SecureKey</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>). These systems commonly leverage distributed ledger technology to distribute identity data for users to readily access their sovereignty and leisure. And on the government front, there is still hope. We encourage members of the digital identity, big data, technology, and data privacy communities to keep raising awareness of these issues and garner the attention of more government officials worldwide to the consequences being inflicted on billions of people. Global problems can only be solved together.</p>

What are two things these applications have in common?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Odds are, you are a user of one or more of them.<p>&nbsp;</p>  They now work seamlessly with self-sovereign identity (SSI).<p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In our eternal quest to make SSI easier to adopt, Trinsic partnered with leading workflow automation platform <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> to enable Trinsic’s developer community to integrate self-sovereign identity with 2000+ common applications without coding! While Trinsic specializes in building the world’s best developer toolkit for decentralized identity, we recognize that plenty of non-technical people want to build SSI integrations. Zapier is the best tool we found to connect the APIs of various different services behind the scenes, making SSI more accessible than ever before.</p><p><br>If you’ve interacted with Trinsic much, you know we issue credentials for all sorts of things. Many of those workflows, including the Stripe, Calendly, and Zoom integrations, were done using Zapier and took less than 15 minutes to set up. We even issued our employees an Employee ID credential using Zapier! But we’re not the only ones who love this feature—see how other innovators are using Trinsic and Zapier to make self-sovereign identity a reality.</p>

					 <p>The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> is arguably the most important digital identity gathering there is. It’s happened every year, twice a year, for over 15 years now. Many of the internet’s most important digital identity standards, including Open ID, OAuth, and most recently SSI, were pioneered at this conference.<br><br></p><p>When IIW moved virtual, they wanted to practice some of what their community has been working on for several years. Phil Windley, co-founder of the workshop, set up an Eventbrite integration to enable digital tickets for IIW in the form of verifiable credentials.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Sign up for IIW and get a digital, verifiable ticket credential <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxi-31-2020b-tickets-113035646662">here</a>.</p>

					 <p>Proof Market is a startup working on MedCreds, a personal health wallet that leverages the Trinsic platform. Through its easy-to-use portal, patients can easily &amp; securely collect their COVID test results, fill out medical questionnaires, and more. MedCreds wanted to keep a pulse on the performance of their application, so they set up a Zapier integration between Trinsic and Slack to notify a channel whenever a new registration is made through the platform.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sign up for your MedCreds digital health wallet <a href="https://portal.medcreds.com/register">here</a>.</p>

					 <p>Early-stage startup <a href="https://votechain.app/">VoteChain</a>, led by Marine veteran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertseitzberg/">Robert Seitzberg</a>, is building its first prototype using various no-code tools. With SSI technology, he can ensure that a given voter is eligible to vote.&nbsp;He is using Trinsic and Zapier to automate the credential verification process, so he can demo the working prototype to prospective stakeholders.</p>

					 <p>The magic happens behind the scenes where the Trinsic API is integrated with the Zapier platform using special webhooks. Zapier specializes in creating workflows, or a series of actions across multiple different apps. Through this process, Zapier can pass data from other apps into Trinsic and visa-versa, enabling completely automated credential exchange workflows.</p><p><br>In Zapier, triggers are an event that initiates an automated workflow and actions are the events that occur in that workflow. In the example below, a new registrant in Eventbrite is the trigger of this workflow. In the workflow, the actions that are completed are issuing a credential, registering for a webinar, and sending a confirmation email to the new event attendee.</p><p><br>With integrations to over 2000 other applications, the sky is the limit in terms of integrations. Build an automated credential exchange workflow in less than 15 minutes by following these instructions:<br><br></p>  First, plan out your use case. Maybe you’re following the lead of the Internet Identity Workshop and issuing verifiable credentials as event tickets. Whatever you’re doing, make a plan for how you want the integration to work.<br><br>  Next, head to the <a href="http://studio.trinsic.id">Trinsic Studio</a> and create an Organization. You’ll need the API keys for the Organization in order to use Zapier.<br><br>  Once in the Trinsic Studio, set up a <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/issue-credentials#credential-definition">credential template</a>, verification template, or whatever else you need for your use case.<br><br>  Finally, set up the flow in Zapier and follow the prompts you’re given.  <p><br>Not sure where to start? Try one of the following integrations or check out our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/zapier">documentation</a>:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Build your own integrations 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>While this is indeed a huge step forward for self-sovereign identity adoption, the real adoption is coming from the hundreds of developers who use the Trinsic platform for the applications they’re building. While we plan to continually improve the Zapier functionality, it will never match the power and flexibility of using the APIs directly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With Trinsic’s fully-loaded package of 3 APIs, a front-end Studio, robust documentation, and SDKs in popular languages, your team is equipped with the flexibility and functionality needed to build something extraordinary. What integrations will you build?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Trinsic Studio: An easy-to-use web interface for managing credential exchange with no code. Also serves as the mechanism to acquire API keys and manage billing for paid plans. <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Try it for yourself completely free</a>, and issue a credential in less than 5 minutes!<br><br>  Provider API: Our newest API enables developers to programmatically provision issuer and verifier cloud agents.

<p>Each year, I look forward to reviewing the nominations for the <a>Identity Excellence Awards</a>. It’s a privilege to get a behind-the-curtains look at the many ways our customers and partners continue to raise the bar on identity security excellence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s just one downside: that we can’t give everyone an award for their efforts. Trust me when I say it was no easy feat to choose the winners from among many worthy nominations. But after many hours of review and deliberation, our judging committee narrowed the field to identify the top entries across eight different categories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worthy award recipients were celebrated at our annual user conference, <a>IDENTIFY 2020</a>. Like many events this year, IDENTIFY was held virtually, but that didn’t stop us from rolling out the digital red carpet for these deserving companies. It’s my great honor to announce this year’s Identity Excellence Awards winners as follows.&nbsp;</p>

Zwar bieten diese Plattformen Unternehmen Agilität und beschleunigen Innovation durch neue Services wie Sprachverarbeitung oder konfigurierbare Dialogsysteme, doch oft fehlt es an der erforderlichen Kontrolle, um den Zugriff auf all diese Cloud-Ressourcen ordnungsgemäß zu regeln.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/multicloud_und_digitalisierung"></a>

 Omidyar Network’s Official Statement on Today’s Report Issued by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law <p>The House Judiciary subcommittee’s recommendations released today represent the most comprehensive response from Congress to date on anti-competitive conduct in the tech sector. After a lengthy probe into industry giants Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, we are grateful to see bipartisan understanding of the problems posed by unchecked concentration in this sector, the recognition of how competition policy can improve, and the need for additional resources to enable the DOJ and FTC to enforce existing antitrust laws. We are even more encouraged to see proposals for legislative changes and increased oversight.</p><p>Until now, critical areas of the internet have remained <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/youre-grounded-and-we-re-taking-away-the-keys-to-the-car-b80cf01f527f">unregulated and unchecked</a>, requiring the sort of dedicated investigation that the report reflects. The potentially illegal market dominance of the largest technology platforms, as well as their social and political power, is seriously threatening our individual freedoms, workers’ rights, economies, and democracies. From widespread disinformation and discrimination against vulnerable groups, to questionable tactics to kill competition and pervasive surveillance practices; we have ample <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">evidence</a> that the status quo is creating adverse conditions for individuals and society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>The “<a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/investigation_of_competition_in_digital_markets_majority_staff_report_and_recommendations.pdf">Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets</a>” Majority Staff Report and Recommendations from the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, is a thoughtful roadmap for legislative and regulatory action to reign in the power of big tech, protect Americans, and guide Congress’s work in the coming year. Democrats and Republicans agree that the dominant technology platforms have acquired monopoly power in their respective markets; federal agencies should have more resources for enforcement; interoperability and data portability should be mandated; and the burden of proof in merger cases should be shifted. Democrats go beyond, and propose to mandate structural separation between the technology platforms’ many business units, and the removal of certain barriers to private antitrust enforcement.</p><p>To better steward technology and shape the rules of the road for the future, we believe that all people — including those who use technology, or are directly affected by these companies’ business practices — should have a voice in how these platforms operate. Strong competition policy matched with strong oversight is as important to every entrepreneur looking to innovate and build THE next great company as it is to every household, every worker, and every&nbsp;voter.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR</a> we’ve been busy building the next generation of solutions for verifiable data and digital trust. Earlier this month we introduced<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773"> our platform</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/using-privacy-preserving-zkp-credentials-on-the-mattr-platform-4c9e351a2fc3">added experimental support</a> for a new, privacy-preserving method for selective data disclosure. Today, we’ve reached another milestone that gives our users even more choice and transparency by the addition of a new way to use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs).</p><p>Modularity and extensibility are key design principles underpinning our core platform architecture. The MATTR Platform is designed to support a wide range of distinct pluggable components, providing our customers with confidence that their technology choices will continue to evolve with new innovations as they&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>When it comes to DIDs, there are currently over 50+ <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">DID Methods</a> registered with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>. Each DID Method defines a CRUD model that describes how a particular DID scheme works with a specific <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry">verifiable data registry</a> such as a distributed ledger or blockchain. The initial group of DID methods was quite small, and has expanded significantly over time as more solutions emerge in this space. While all of these new DID methods theoretically adhere to the DID core specification, each method makes a different set of choices that affect the underlying trust model at play. For instance, DID methods have distinct rules about who gets to add new transactions, what input data is required, where DIDs are anchored, who can view or monitor the DIDs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>In short, there are many factors that affect the choice around which DID method to use, and it’s not a trivial decision.</p><p>We believe that DIDs, when deployed responsibly, can be extremely effective at preserving user privacy, enhancing transparency and consent, enabling data portability, and enforcing user control. To learn more about our approach, read our blog, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/intro-to-dids-for-people-5ebe620b5a15">“Intro to DIDs for&nbsp;people”</a>.</p><p>In addition to our current support for <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a> (static key-based identifier) and <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">DID Sovrin</a> (ledger-based identifier), we are now proud to add <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a> (domain-based identifier) to our list of supported DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>DID Web helps to bridge the gap between the way that trust is established on the internet today, namely using domains, and new and emerging ecosystems using DIDs. When using DID Web, rather than anchoring a DID to a decentralized ledger such as a blockchain, the DID is instead associated with a specific domain name, and subsequently anchored to the web host registered with that domain via <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS resolution</a>. Effectively, this allows a DID using this scheme to be resolved as simply as one resolves a web URL, every time they click on a link. For example, we’ve set up a DID Web using our own domain, which can be resolved at <a href="https://mattr.global/.well-known/did.json">did:web:mattr.global</a>.</p><p>Users in the emerging world of DIDs can use this mechanism to bootstrap trust by using the reputation associated with public domains. While this solution may not work in every circumstance and lacks some of the resilience and censorship guarantees afforded by DID methods with less centralized dependencies, DID Web provides a practical and useful pathway to adoption, particularly for entities whose data and identity are already public. When used in parallel with more natively decentralized mechanisms, we can help to ensure that the web remains free and open while providing a path for legacy systems to remain interoperable with the emerging distributed web of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>By adding support for new DID methods such as <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a>, we are creating optionality and choice for our users. Our products will always be ledger-agnostic. We will also continue to offer support for DIDs which are not anchored to any ledger. We aim to bridge the gap between approaches that are built on top of ledgers and those using domains, key registries, and other methods to establish trust.</p><p>We are also actively investigating how to add support for more scalable solutions that use ledgers on an ad-hoc basis, such as DID methods based on the layer two <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree">Sidetree Protocol</a>. This open-source protocol provides an abstract layer that sits on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger">DLT</a> infrastructure.</p><p>The <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/drivers">Platform Drivers</a> part of our architecture provides DID Method support in the form of pluggable integrations that prevent vendor lock-in and enable user choice. To find out more about how the MATTR Platform supports a broad spectrum of DID methods, check out our documentation on <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/core/dids">MATTR Learn</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">sign up</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/did-extensibility-on-the-mattr-platform-14c73c7a798e">DID Extensibility on the MATTR Platform</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Customize many aspects of your Gluu Server identity and access management service.</p>
<p>Interception scripts can be used to implement custom business logic for authentication, authorization and more in a way that is upgrade-proof and doesn’t require forking the Gluu Server code. Each type of script is described by a Java interface — i.e. which methods are required.</p>
<p>In 4.2, we’ve introduced new interception scripts for Post-Authentication Authorization (<a href="https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/admin-guide/custom-script/#post-authn">more details</a>), UMA2 RPT claims (<a href="https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/admin-guide/custom-script/#uma-2-rpt-claims">more details</a>), and application session management (<a href="https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/admin-guide/custom-script/#application-session-management">more details</a>).</p>
<p>Post-Authentication Authorization</p>
<p>For example: a sensitive web application may wish to force users to re-authenticate even if they present a valid session cookie to reduce the risk of a valid user session at an unattended computer being used by another person to access data inappropriately.</p>
<p>After the browser has a session, if a person visits a website, the RP can obtain a code without the user having to authenticate or authorize. In some cases, it is desirable to insert custom business logic before granting the code or tokens from the authorization endpoint. Post Authn script allows to force re-authentication or re-authorization (even if client is “Pre-authorized” or client authorization persistence is on).</p>
<p>UMA2 RPT claims</p>
<p>UMA2 standard is designed to separate the requesting party and the resource owner (where OAuth2 considers them to be only one person). And this differentiation allows us to address more use-cases than OAuth2.</p>
<p>RPT claims is a special script for UMA 2. It allows an admin to code logic for gathering additional claims (required by UMA RPT Authorization Policy).<br>
This script can be used in an oxAuth application only.</p>
<p>Application Session Management<br>
Session management is used to facilitate secure interactions between a user and some service or application and applies to a sequence of requests and responses associated with that particular user. When a user has an ongoing session with a web application, they are submitting requests within their session and are providing potentially sensitive information. The application may retain this information and/or track the status of the user during the session across multiple requests. More importantly, it is critical that the application has a means of protecting private data belonging to each unique user, especially within authenticated sessions.<br>
This script allows an admin to get notification about various session lifetime events. It’s possible to add multiple scripts with this type. The application should call all of them according to the level.</p>

<p>The Gluu Server now supports CIBA. Improve the end-user experience during authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow is an authentication flow like OpenID Connect. However, unlike OpenID Connect, there is a direct Relying Party to OpenID Provider communication without redirects through the user’s browser. CIBA enables a Client to initiate the authentication of an end-user by means of out-of-band mechanisms.</p>
<p>CIBA allows a client application, known as a consumption device, to obtain authentication and consent from a user without requiring the user to interact with the client directly. Instead, the client application can initiate a backchannel request to the user’s authentication device, such as a smartphone with an authenticator app installed, to authenticate the user and consent to the operation.</p>
<p>This specification does not change the semantics of the OpenID Connect Authentication flow. It introduces a new endpoint to which the authentication request is posted. It introduces a new asynchronous method for authentication result notification or delivery. It does not introduce new scope values nor does it change the semantics of standard OpenID Connect parameters.</p>

 The GiD Report#129 — What we learned about digital identity from&nbsp;OnlyFans <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-128-what-the-apple-app-store-backlash-tells-us-about-this-moment-in-time-805a4443f077">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Every company is a messaging company  What we learned about digital identity from&nbsp;OnlyFans  Facebook is worried about messaging (and being broken&nbsp;up)  Trump administration to sue Google next&nbsp;week  The EU and China are getting in on&nbsp;it  This week in the app platform&nbsp;wars  Stuff happens   1. The pandemic lockdown and the resulting era of remote work (and play) has brought to the forefront our platforms for interaction and bringing us together. There was that a16z saying — that every company is a fintech company. Today, it feels like every company is a messaging and groups&nbsp;company. <p>Zoom is <a href="https://zoom.us/feature/messaging">expanding into messaging and groups</a>. Venmo <a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/217042878-Group-Accounts">experimented with groups but is apparently shelving the initiative</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/VS">/VS</a>). Discord is <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035969312-Community-Server-Guidelines">expanding groups and community functionality</a> with <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server">community servers</a>.</p><p>But none of those initiatives move the needle in terms of addressing lessons learned from this last cycle of the internet because none of these platforms address the issue of digital identity in a material&nbsp;way.</p><p>Really, it’s more of the&nbsp;same.</p><p>We need an interoperable, portable identity in order to best enable all people economically and socially around the world. We need a persistent identity in order to restructure incentives for better outcomes and prevent fraud and abuse. And we need an open platform so that developers can experiment and create with those messaging and groups (and payments) building blocks so that real innovation can&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>Fundamentally addressing that remains a huge opportunity.</p> 2. Incidentally, one platform that has addressed the issue of identity more than any other is OnlyFans. (For those out of the loop, OnlyFans has been trending this year as a way premium membership platform for influencers. As you might guess, there’s a lot of “adult”-ish type content&nbsp;there.) <p>In accordance to Rule 34 of the internet, they’ve also <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/lessons-from-the-rise-of-onlyfans">managed digital identity better than&nbsp;most</a>:</p><blockquote>First, OnlyFans offers an example of how the desire to get paid for content online smooths the way to validating user identities. There are three major reasons other social services don’t validate the people who participate in their networks. First, the friction of going through the validation process for new accounts prevents people from signing up. Second, it is expensive and time-consuming for services to validate identities. Third, requiring proof of real-world identity is quite exclusionary, as many people can’t easily make that proof. The desire to get paid for content provides a level of motivation that overcomes at least the first two of these&nbsp;hurdles.</blockquote><blockquote>At a bigger systems level, the lesson might be that the path toward trusted validation of identities will come through payment systems. I very much hope that we never face a world where someone has to prove their identity in order to share content on the internet; however, the financial system is far more structurally locked down. It seems likely that payments will become the wedge that forces people to validate online identities. That could lead to the creation of an internet environment where it is easier to validate the real-world identity (or at least the valid citizenship) of the people you are interacting with&nbsp;online.</blockquote><p>So yeah, it only took OnlyFans to validate GlobaliD’s vision that payments, messaging, and digital identity go hand in hand&nbsp;:)</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/lessons-from-the-rise-of-onlyfans">Lessons From the Rise of&nbsp;OnlyFans</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-29/private-social-app-clubhouse-courts-fresh-controversy?sref=BAcrnccI&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Private Social App Clubhouse Courts Fresh Controversy</a>  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity&nbsp;System</a>  <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/How-self-sovereign-identity-principles-suit-the-modern-world">How self-sovereign identity principles suit the modern&nbsp;world</a>   3. Much has been said about last week’s presidential debate. What’s clear, though, is that the country has never been more divided. What they’re not divided on, however, is the idea that we need to regulate Big&nbsp;Tech. <p>Sure, each side has its own motivations, but the end result is the same. Big Tech is the new Too Big To Fail. They’ve gotten too powerful, stifling competition and innovation. And they’ve gotten too influential, undermining social cohesion. Not even Apple is&nbsp;safe.</p><p>Anyway, Facebook is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-government-breakup-of-instagram-whatsapp-would-be-complete-nonstarter-11601803800">worried about messaging:</a></p><blockquote>The document was produced by staff at Facebook based on work commissioned from lawyers at Sidley Austin LLP. While light on legal citations and technical language, it offers a window into how Facebook may defend itself if it is sued on antitrust grounds and reflects its lawyers’ sense that any attempts to force a divestiture of WhatsApp or Instagram would be fought in both the public square and the courtroom.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 were examined by the Federal Trade Commission, which closed its reviews without issuing an objection. The company made big investments to boost growth on those platforms and they now share numerous operations that are integrated. In the paper, Facebook says unwinding the deals would be nearly impossible to achieve, forcing the company to spend billions of dollars maintaining separate systems, weakening security and harming users’ experience.</blockquote><blockquote>“A ‘breakup’ of Facebook is thus a complete nonstarter,” the paper declares.</blockquote>Tim Wu, Photo: New&nbsp;America<p>Tim Wu, who I interviewed many years ago (incidentally, also Big Tech monopoly related — yeah, we’ve been on this beat for a while), wasn’t impressed:</p><blockquote>Facebook’s contention that past government inaction on the acquisitions should limit current action is “surprisingly weak,” said Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor, tech critic and author who has said Facebook should be broken up. A government antitrust case against the company would likely rely on the argument that Facebook made serial acquisitions to reduce competition, a question that wasn’t considered when the Federal Trade Commission originally chose not to oppose the Instagram and WhatsApp deals, he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“There’s no way a decision on one merger would be preclusive,” he said, noting that the FTC’s reviews of both acquisitions had reserved the right to revisit the deals at a later&nbsp;time.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook’s claim regarding the difficulty of a potential breakup would also be unlikely to carry legal weight. “There is no ‘it’s too hard’ defense,” Mr. Wu&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>The FTC is expected to file a formal complaint by year’s end. Meanwhile, Facebook is racing to integrate its messaging platforms to make it even more difficult to&nbsp;breakup.</p>  <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/new-messaging-features-for-instagram/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Say “hi” to Messenger: Introducing New Messaging Features for Instagram — About&nbsp;Facebook</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-government-breakup-of-instagram-whatsapp-would-be-complete-nonstarter-11601803800">Facebook Says Government Breakup of Instagram, WhatsApp Would Be ‘Complete Nonstarter’</a>   4. Things are happening more quickly for&nbsp;Google. <p>Maybe <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/02/trump-doj-google-antitrust-lawsuit-425617">as soon as next&nbsp;week</a>:</p><blockquote>The Justice Department and state attorneys general are expected to sue Google as soon as next week for alleged antitrust abuses, people familiar with discussions said Friday, marking a dramatic escalation of Washington’s fight to rein in Silicon Valley’s&nbsp;giants.</blockquote><blockquote>The Justice Department — which has been probing Google for 16 months — circulated text of a proposed complaint this week, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. The complaint could come late next week or just after the Columbus Day holiday, two of the people said. All spoke anonymously to discuss an ongoing investigation.</blockquote><p>This suit will mainly focus on search. But the government’s commitment to the cause portends more to&nbsp;come.</p>  <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/02/trump-doj-google-antitrust-lawsuit-425617">Trump administration to launch antitrust suit against Google as soon as next&nbsp;week</a>   5. And I know that we usually speak about things here from a U.S. perspective, but this is apparently a sentiment felt worldwide. <p>The EU, of course, has long been at the forefront of regulating Big&nbsp;Tech.</p>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-tech-antitrust/u-s-tech-giants-face-curbs-on-data-sharing-digital-marketplaces-under-draft-eu-rules-idUSKBN26L293">U.S. tech giants face curbs on data sharing, digital marketplaces, under draft EU&nbsp;rules</a>  <p>But China wants in on it,&nbsp;too.</p>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-china-huawei-tech-exclusive-idUSKBN26L1OH">Exclusive: China preparing an antitrust investigation into Google — sources</a>   6.

<p>As <a href="http://ceramic.Network">Ceramic</a> enters Beta, we’re seeing more and more experimentation in the community, and we’re excited to see the network and <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX library</a> used in increasingly creative ways. If you’re thinking about your your next project — whether that’s a hackathon entry or a new feature for your stable product — here are 10 ideas to get excited&nbsp;about!</p> Using Ceramic in your&nbsp;product <p>1. Manage user identities, information, accounts and&nbsp;data</p><p>The identity index data structure makes it easy to manage identities and user data without any servers or silos — one of the primary use cases Ceramic was created to support. IDX also lets you turn blockchain keys into authentication for a robust identity, with the ability to manage off-chain data, profile info, settings, and more. Partners like Textile for data storage, Fleek for hosting, Magic for authentication and more can be used with&nbsp;IDX.</p><p>2. Index or catalogue content on IPFS and elsewhere</p><p>Use Ceramic as a flexible index for content being stored on IPFS — or anywhere else. Putting this on Ceramic allows easy discovery, as well as definitions and links that make routing to and consuming the content easier over&nbsp;time.</p><p>3. Publish and manage metadata to make data discoverable, linkable</p><p>Publish metadata like schema and tags for privately stored data, making it discoverable and interoperable while preserving privacy and flexibility. This lets you use any data storage option you can imagine — whether centralized or decentralized — while still building on a linked and open&nbsp;web.</p><p>4. Anchor IPFS content onto&nbsp;Ethereum</p><p>Ceramic can be used for any use case that requires blockchain anchoring, including creating scalable and auditable records or signed documents. Every Ceramic document and update is signed with a DID, and these updates are batched and anchored on a blockchain. This provides super scalable verifiable records for things like content feeds, comments, annotations, proposals, votes, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>5. Trusted content publishing</p><p>Use Ceramic to publish content with verified authorship in a platform-independent way. Because Ceramic documents have a permanent ID but are mutable, you can update and version content over time without needing to adjust pointers. This makes it perfect for storing and distributing content to a number of sources. You could use Ceramic as a headless, trusted and open&nbsp;CMS.</p><p>6. Data storage&nbsp;backend</p><p>Ceramic documents offer capabilities similar to your favorite NoSQL document store. Improve information security, ship faster, and eliminate the need to configure and run database servers for storing user and application data.</p> Project Ideas <p>You can use Ceramic and IDX with most applications. Here are a few ambitious ones we know the community would love to&nbsp;see.</p><p>7. DeFi-Wide Trollbox</p><p>One of the most amazing things about DeFi is the ability to move across interfaces and access the same money legos and pools. But right now, it’s just assets and on-chain information that’s shared. We think the social element should be too. Imagine a chatbox anchored to a given pool or smart contract that users across platforms could all be chatting&nbsp;in!</p><p>You could build this today, using IDX for identity (so users still authenticate with the same Ethereum key) and pairing it with p2p chat like Textile, OrbitDB, or&nbsp;others.</p><p>8. DeFi Account&nbsp;Tracker</p><p>Lost track of all your historical accounts (and where you might have airdrops from Uniswap and others)? Use IDX’s crypto-links to create a self-sovereign, portable and privacy-preserving mapping of your various accounts to a single identity. This could be read across DeFi platforms and interfaces too, reducing the need to recreate your watch list on each&nbsp;one.</p><p>9. Profile&nbsp;Plugin</p><p>Create a simple component that gets rid of hex addresses and replaces them with profiles, read from IDX. Help create a web3 experience that is familiar and human. This could be a plugin developers use to replace hex addresses in their interface, or browser extension for users to overlay profile information where it&nbsp;exists.</p><p>10. Ceramic&nbsp;Explorer</p><p>Create a visual explorer for Ceramic documents, making it easy for content to be discovered and shared by applications across web3. This would make it easy for developers to see what documents exist, what standards are emerging, and how to build their data model on&nbsp;Ceramic.</p><p>Bonus: User Notification Service</p><p>Web3 Apps today don’t have a reliable way to get ahold of their users. This means they either have to let the experience end when the app is closed or they end up storing email addresses and preferences in a server. IDX provides a new option. User notification settings can be stored in a Ceramic document, as can contact info like an email address — encrypted and access controlled. A notification service built on this could enable apps to get in touch with users based only on their Ethereum address, without storing user contact&nbsp;info.</p> Our bounties <p>We’re at lots of hackathons in the next month, including EthOnline. Bounties we’re currently offering&nbsp;include:</p>  Best overall use of IDX&nbsp;Library  Best user notifications or chat product using&nbsp;Ceramic  Best tool to help other developers use IDX and&nbsp;Ceramic  <p>We will also be adding bounties in soon, including adding <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils">support for new blockchains</a> for Ceramic and&nbsp;more.</p> Get started <p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a peer-to-peer dataweb for publishing, linking, and querying verifiable information on the open web.

Photo by Shikoh Gitau/&nbsp;Qhala How Jumia and Facebook are competing, even though they’re playing different games <p>Tiffany* sells makeup, and is evaluating a new display shelf where her product would be at eye level with passing shoppers. That visibility could lead to new customers, but she’s not convinced it’s worth the trouble, because almost all of her customers currently find her on Instagram. And actually, that shelf isn’t even in her store — it’s in the front of a retail locker space where she rents a container in the back to hold her inventory. Tiffany keeps some of her most popular products on hand here so that customers can easily drop by and see the merchandise, but otherwise she runs a completely virtual, just-in-time business. And paying for a physical footprint, even if it’s only a few square feet of shelf space, might not give her the return she needs on scarce&nbsp;capital.</p><p>Tiffany is among millions of entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa taking advantage of popular digital tools to transform their business. Formal marketplaces such as Jumia or Takealot have successfully established a traditional model of e-commerce, while new platforms from Paystack, Flutterwave, and others provide the underlying tools for independent sellers. Despite these formal offerings, the vast majority of digitally connected small businesses are using Facebook, WhatsApp, and other consumer platforms to fulfill an increasing number of commercial use cases. This “social commerce” is often heralded as a leveler of the playing field, as even the smallest businesses can typically use social platforms for a low&nbsp;cost.</p><p>To help make sense of this mix of formal and informal, of purpose-built and appropriated, I developed a framework for comparing the range of digital solutions available to today’s entrepreneurs. For those with a commercial interest in this sector, the framework offers a lens for understanding how different solutions solve distinct parts of the value chain, and what this means for the likely addressable market of each solution. For policymakers and those interested in inclusive economic growth, the analysis highlights the implications of fundamentally different operational structures between formal ecommerce and social platforms, and why we should worry about how previously informal economic activity becomes formalized.</p> From analog to&nbsp;digital <p>Small businesses in sub-Saharan Africa looking to sell online have multiple options to consider; which I’ve simplified here into four categories.[<a>1</a>] These are by no means mutually exclusive, but for clarity I have separated them in the analysis.</p><p>Social commerce<br>The most accessible and likely approach for most small businesses is to use those consumer products that are already familiar and ubiquitous, especially Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Instagram. Entrepreneurs can create a page on Facebook and/or Instagram, post photos or videos of products, communicate with prospective customers, respond to customer reviews, and use built-in advertising tools to boost her page or specific product&nbsp;posts.</p><p>E-commerce marketplaces<br>Businesses may also sell on formal marketplaces such as <a href="https://group.jumia.com/">Jumia</a>, <a href="https://www.kilimall.co.ke/new/">Kilimall</a>, or <a href="https://www.konga.com/">Konga</a>. These online marketplaces aggregate supply and demand into a single platform, providing sellers with immediate access to a large audience — for a price. Like Amazon, they offer sales support with payment processing, fulfillment, and delivery, as well as back office business tools such as inventory management and analytics; typically they charge a commission on&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Standalone domains<br>More digitally savvy businesses might go a step further and publish their own standalone website using one of a growing number of e-commerce tools, such as <a href="https://paystack.com/commerce">Paystack Commerce</a> or <a href="https://flutterwave.com/us/store">Flutterwave Store</a>, two new solutions from Nigerian fintechs that combine payment processing and back office functions with a website builder into a single platform (essentially, Shopify for&nbsp;Africa).</p><p>B2B sourcing<br>And another option for FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) retailers are B2B platforms that connect businesses with suppliers and financing, such as <a href="https://www.tradedepot.co/">Trade Depot</a> in Nigeria or <a href="https://sokowatch.com/">Sokowatch</a> in East Africa, both of which aggregate demand from retailers to provide discounted wholesale pricing and deliver consumer products to the retailer.</p> The retail value&nbsp;chain <p>To understand how these digital solutions are reshaping retail in sub-Saharan Africa, it’s helpful to examine the business functions that each solves for. Retail businesses like Tiffany’s have a relatively straightforward value chain: retailers buy goods from upstream suppliers (inbound logistics), manage inventory and resources (operations), engage with customers (marketing), and, when they’re lucky, make sales and deliver product (sales/outbound logistics). Looking at each category of the value chain in turn, we can summarize the benefits different digital solutions provide to offline businesses looking to digitize.</p><p>Figure 1. Where different digitization solutions impact the retail value&nbsp;chain</p><p>Inbound logistics<br>The B2B marketplaces or supply chain solutions that service this part of the value chain are primarily trying to secure better pricing for retailers by aggregating demand. For example, Sokowatch in East Africa promises not only lower pricing but also financing and complete last-mile delivery to its retailers. These solutions are currently limited to FMCG, where high sales volume and commodity products make it easier to aggregate orders.</p><p>Operations<br>All of the e-commerce marketplaces provide warehousing services to eliminate the need for physical storage facilities. This is especially convenient if the retailer also pays the platform to handle fulfillment and delivery, but these services eat into margins, and many smaller businesses prefer to handle warehousing and fulfillment themselves. Businesses that sell on a marketplace are often also selling directly to customers via physical shops or social media, so the platform’s inventory tracking systems will only cover a portion of their business, reducing its&nbsp;utility.</p><p>Marketing<br>This is where digital options far outperform anything offline. A small retailer with no online presence can only market to those prospects who pass in physical proximity of the shop. Although advertising costs are low, the maximum size of the funnel is limited. But once the business starts marketing online, they can easily increase the reach of their advertising by many orders of magnitude. This is especially true of social media, where the smallest entrepreneur can put up a Facebook page and start bootstrapping eyeballs via their personal networks before transitioning to paid ad spend to “boost” their page or&nbsp;posts.</p><p>Marketplace platforms also offer substantial reach given the installed base of customers who use the site, and sellers pay to promote their products higher in the search or browsing results. One could argue that advertising dollars spent on an e-commerce platform should outperform those on social media, as customers on the former are more likely to be closer to a purchase decision, i.e. deeper in the sales funnel. But marketplace platforms can be brutally competitive for many product categories, and the structure of the market doesn’t allow for much retailer branding or other differentiation. You live and die by the transaction, with little opportunity to build a brand and a following — which is exactly what social media excel&nbsp;at.</p><p>Because standalone domains exist on the open web, they rely on driving traffic from other sources — search and social — to the domain, and therefore don’t benefit from any installed base of&nbsp;buyers.</p><p>Sales/ Outbound logistics<br>One of the bigger service offerings from both the marketplace platforms and the independent domain platforms, like Paystack Commerce, is the ability to process different kinds of payments. For some product categories and businesses this is important, but the majority of e-commerce payments in sub-Saharan Africa are still COD (cash-on-delivery).<a>[2]</a> And in markets where mobile money is popular, buyers can make non-cash payments (pre- or post-delivery) directly into mobile money wallets. So the payment processing function is most valuable only for customers who are willing to pay upfront and want to pay with a card or bank transfer.</p><p>Last-mile delivery to the customer is infamously challenging in most markets, and one of the key services that marketplace platforms offer to their sellers. But typically the delivery price is passed on to the buyer, not built into the product price. Many businesses work with local couriers or contract with new logistics platforms like Sendy in East Africa; many retailers let the customer choose a preferred logistics provider. Because most small retailers have less expensive options for delivery, paying the marketplace to handle delivery only makes sense if the retailer has sufficient volume such that the overhead of managing independent deliveries outweighs the cost&nbsp;savings.</p> Follow me for top-line&nbsp;growth <p>One helpful way to think about how each solution solves a different business function is to categorize it as impacting either (a) top-line growth or (b) bottom-line profitability. The latter category includes solutions that streamline procurement; process payments; digitize inventory management; or provide warehousing, fulfillment, and delivery services. Efficiencies in any of these can lower a retailer’s operational costs, but these will be incremental gains, especially for the smallest retailers.</p><p>On the other hand, digital advertising channels enable entrepreneurs to grow their business by reaching many more customers than they would otherwise. Social media platforms in particular allow businesses to substantially and cost-effectively increase their potential customer base, thereby scaling top-line growth and&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>In the language of unit economics, this is about very large reductions in CAC (customer acquisition costs) vs. incremental improvements to COGS (cost of goods sold). Obviously both are crucial metrics to a business, but have different implications at different stages of business maturity. For any business, reducing COGS and thereby improving margins, by say 10% can easily be the difference between break-even and profitability. But for the smallest businesses, where sales numbers are low, improving margins by 10% may not actually translate into anything meaningful in terms of absolute value.<a>[3]</a> On the other hand, if a small business can double or triple sales at a lower CAC, that revenue opens up all kinds of opportunities for staffing up or expanding the business in different ways.</p><p>Using the framing of the value chain analysis above, here’s a simple 2x2 illustrating which types of businesses are most likely to benefit from each type of digital solution. In addition to the maturity or size dimension, which as described above is a primary factor in determining the relative value of increasing reach and top-line sales vs. operational efficiencies, it plots average sales price on the other axis to serve as a proxy for the types of products and income level of the customers buying&nbsp;them.</p><p>Figure 2. The sweet spot for each type of&nbsp;solution</p><p>Social commerce occupies the lower left because it’s essentially free to use (minus paid advertising) and provides the best opportunity for growing the customer base with a lower CAC, the two most important factors for the smallest businesses. Social commerce likely has a ceiling in terms of average sale price, partly because of trust (i.e., consumers tend to place more trust in retailers on formal marketplace platforms, which may have buyer protection programs), but also as a function of how prospective buyers are most likely to search for and purchase products: Higher-income consumers are more likely to use a laptop and web-based search engines to find products, making them more likely to shop from marketplaces and standalone website domains. Lower-income consumers are more likely to only have a mobile device and spend more time within the confines of social media feeds, where social commerce&nbsp;reigns.</p><p>Ecommerce platforms like Jumia and Konga are used as sales channels by all kinds of businesses, but are most helpful to those that have grown to have multiple employees and higher sales volumes, where the operational and logistics services the platforms offer will have a greater impact on efficiency and overall profitability. Because of the additional formality and high transaction fees — Jumia sellers pay a sales commission of 10%-20% depending on the product category — vendors are less likely to focus on really low-value items, keeping the average sales prices higher than what you see with social media businesses.</p><p>Standalone domains supported by e-commerce platforms like Paystack Commerce are most appropriate for the largest businesses with the highest average sales price. Such firms already have established customer bases and are looking to control more of their brand without giving up margin to a marketplace. Because they exist on the open web, they have to drive traffic from search and social, which typically means a higher CAC and thus requires higher average sales&nbsp;prices.</p><p>Finally, B2B sourcing platforms have a hard ceiling on average sale price given that (at least in current incarnations) they are limited to FMCG and other high-volume, commodity products. The economics of bulk ordering and delivery costs mean that smaller shops with lower turnover are less likely to enroll given the expected cost benefits.</p> The future will be formalized <p>A natural question to ask is to what extent online commercial activity will migrate away from the social commerce model and toward the more formal paradigms of e-commerce marketplaces and standalone domains that are dominant in the West. I would argue that while the business logic that has the vast majority of African businesses choosing informal activity on social platforms won’t change anytime soon, those social platforms will increasingly push that economic activity into more structured and legible&nbsp;forms.</p><p>For the most part, social commerce businesses are appropriating tools designed for personal communication to use for business purposes; as such, the platforms don’t have good ways of knowing about these transactions being coordinated through their ecosystem. WhatsApp Pay and the new Facebook Shops are obvious steps toward improving the platforms’ visibility into commercial activity, and much more will come. The goal isn’t necessarily to compete head-to-head with e-commerce platforms with a fully integrated offering, but to capture enough of the activity to develop a completely new purchase behavior dataset that can be monetized via their ad engines.<a>[4]</a> Imagine advertisers being able to target their ads on Facebook to those users who have “purchased a health and wellness product for $10-$20 within the last 30 days from a seller with 5,000–25,000 followers.”</p><p>The result will be an asymmetric, top-down vs. bottom-up competition between the formal marketplaces and social media: Formal marketplaces will try to broaden their value proposition to reach lower to the smallest-scale businesses and spin the network effects flywheel, while social media will attempt to formalize its offerings, not to compete directly as a solution provider, but to develop one of the most comprehensive and valuable datasets on consumer economic activity.</p><p>The competition is asymmetric in that the two platform types have fundamentally different business models. Social media platforms, and for all intents and purposes this means Facebook, are ad-based; they make activity free in order to accumulate eyeball-hours. The marketplaces rely on the transactional revenue of the commissions they charge sellers on each sale. Put another way, the marketplaces have to make the unit economics work for each transaction on the platform, which Jumia has estimated to require something like a 10%-20% margin, a significant cost that is prohibitive to many smaller retailers.[<a>5</a>] Facebook, on the other hand, can afford to offer (a more limited set of) services for free because the resulting activity will substantially increase the value of its ad inventory. That data and resulting value may take a while to accumulate, but as <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-land-where-facebook-loses-money-d850c6593f70">I’ve argued previously</a>, Facebook can use its tremendous cash reserves from its high-ARPU user base in the West to cross-subsidize unprofitable initiatives in the Global South for as long as it needs. In any war of attrition, Facebook doesn’t&nbsp;lose.</p><p>This disconnect between Facebook’s revenue model and its consumer-facing services presents challenges not only for regulation (e.g., antitrust policy based on consumer welfare in the form of pricing), but also assessments of its net benefit to the resource-constrained populations who rely on it. As with Free Basics, its subsidized internet access initiative, Facebook’s commerce offerings provide very real value to millions of individuals with few truly affordable alternatives. Yet the long-term implications of allowing it to continue to envelop and become the de facto provider of adjacent sectors of the digital economy are&nbsp;immense.</p><p>In the context of social commerce, that risk may be under-appreciated, given that most of the commercial activity moving onto the platform was informal and unreported to begin with. The sheer size of the informal sector — an estimated <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_627189/lang--en/index.htm">86% of employment in Africa</a> — makes it a key focus for governments grappling with economic growth policies. And digitized network technology is key in state efforts to make legible the invisible, as large-scale identification and currency initiatives have shown. Yet as more informal trade moves onto and is structured by social media, we may face a future in which the most complete and accurate source of informal economic activity is held not in Abuja, Nairobi, or Pretoria, but in Menlo Park. The future of trade may indeed be formalized, but by a platform logic with a distinctly private&nbsp;agenda.</p><p>The unique market conditions of sub-Saharan Africa mean the dominant model of digital commerce that emerges won’t look like digital commerce in Southeast Asia, China, or the West. Savvy and ambitious entrepreneurs like Tiffany will continue to cobble together the services they need to grow their businesses digitally, but widespread adoption will require solutions that are accessible and affordable to a broader base of sellers. For the vast majority of these micro businesses and solo entrepreneurs, the driver of value is the ability to cost-effectively increase their reach to a wider market of customers. And if this is indeed the race, it is Facebook’s to&nbsp;lose.</p><p>Thanks for input and suggestions from Sammy Muraya (<a href="https://smkollectionz.com/">SM Kollectionz</a>), Winnie Makena (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nairobiluggagecentre/">EGD Luggage Center</a>), Sabina Naamwinbong (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/glammy_accessories/?igshid=9tca1b9naxgk">Glammy Accessories</a>), Bode Oyelami (<a href="https://www.konga.com/merchant/hekmore-systems-ventures">Hekmore Systems</a>), Mavis Dzedu (<a href="https://www.jumia.com.gh/hotfro/">Hotfro</a>), Annabel Schiff, Grace Natabaalo, Stephen Deng, and Jonathan&nbsp;Donner.</p><p>* A fictional persona.

I very much regret this oversight, and have updated the article with a new&nbsp;name.</p> Notes <p>[1] A note on scope: Many other models of digitally-enabled commerce exist, especially in China and Southeast Asia, where platforms like Pinduoduo and Go-Jek have successfully proven different operational models. While there are <a href="https://theflip.africa/newsletter/pinduoduo-social-commerce/">arguments</a> for why group purchasing, influencer-based revenue models, and other “social” practices may gain traction in sub-Saharan Africa, these are currently not widespread and thus not covered here. For simplicity, I also exclude classifieds marketplaces (e.g., <a href="https://jiji.co.ke/">Jiji/OLX</a>), which are lower-cost for the retailer but don’t offer the same range of services as formal e-commerce marketplaces.</p><p>[2] Jumia reports 65% to 95% of orders are COD; social commerce orders are even more likely to be cash <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/mea/press-releases/delivering-cashless-e-commerce-in-africa/">https://newsroom.mastercard.com/mea/press-releases/delivering-cashless-e-commerce-in-africa/</a>.</p><p>[3] This is especially true for solo entrepreneurs, where the nature of the hustle makes it difficult to accurately account for time/labor costs. Yes, opportunity costs are real, but for the smallest shops an inefficient process that takes 50% longer but is free will win out over paid services that automate or streamline the task. The cost calculations change once the business is large enough for paid&nbsp;labor.</p><p>[4] Facebook already buys purchase behavior data (including offline) from external data aggregators in order to inform its user profiling, but this would be first-party data of transactions on its platform and concretely tied to the individual’s account, so infinitely more valuable.</p><p>[5] For reference, Amazon says it averages 8%-15%; <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html#referral-fees">https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html#referral-fees</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-race-to-digitize-commerce-in-sub-saharan-africa-252b2f977c86">The race to digitize commerce in sub-Saharan Africa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Franklyn Odhiambo and Thea Anderson, Responsible Technology, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, the Nigerian government launched a <a href="https://techeconomy.ng/2020/06/fg-inaugurates-steering-committee-for-nigeria-digital-identity-project/">Steering Committee for the National Identity</a> in June, and published the <a href="https://www.nimc.gov.ng/docs/adverts/Advert_for_review_of_Draft_Data_Protection_Bill_2020_for_print.pdf">Data Protection Bill 2020</a> for public comment in August. As a social change venture with a presence across Africa, we as Omidyar Network actively use our voice and partnerships with civil society organizations to reinforce good technology design and policy practices that yield Good ID — equity, inclusion, privacy, security, and transparency.</p><p>To better understand the implications of these developments in Nigeria, we recently spoke with Adeboye (“Boye”) Adegoke, Paradigm Initiative’s senior program manager. Paradigm Initiative is an African social enterprise, focused on increasing transparency and accountability between governments, civil society organizations, grassroots organizers, and the general public, on issues related to digital rights and inclusion. Omidyar Network <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/bringing-data-privacy-and-protections-to-nigerias-id-program-and-digital-economy-why-we-invested-439ad5ba5eef">partnered with Paradigm Initiative</a> in early 2020 to support their advocacy and education efforts with Nigeria’s policymakers and the Nigerian Identity Management Commission, aiming toward securing greater safeguards and transparency in the National Identification Numbers&nbsp;program.</p><p>The commission operates the federal government’s national identity database, and assigns and issues the unique identification numbers that will soon be required for citizens and legal residents ages 16 and&nbsp;older.</p><p>Below Boye discusses these recent announcements and his organization’s vision for increasing digital ID and data protection safeguards, as well as transparency in government decision-making.</p><p>What are your top recommendations to Nigerian policymakers today on the draft Data Protection Bill&nbsp;2020?</p><p>Adegoke: One, the proposed Data Protection Commission must be fully funded, staffed, and operational before there is any further registration, or issuing of [National Identification Numbers] or any other digital ID programs.</p><p>Two, the commission must be truly independent. The overwhelming number of government actors currently proposed for the commission’s advisory board will seriously impact true independence.</p><p>Three, independent members — from civil society, media, and academia — must be included on the advisory board to balance government and private sector representatives equally.</p><p>Four, data protection must never be used as a disguise to deny journalists access to critical information in the interest of the public, especially within journalistic rights.</p><p>Five, vague terms such as “national interest”, “national security”, and “public morality” — which have been used in the past to derogate from citizens’ rights — must be clearly defined in the bill, and not be left open-ended and amenable to different interpretations.</p><blockquote>“Given the work that we do, part of our advocacy objectives is to ensure that the development of digital policy receives quality inputs from us. Our focus is clear in this regard; rights, inclusion, and innovation. We will advocate against draft legislation/policy that seeks to limit rights, stifle innovation or widen access gaps and we will support those who seek to promote access, rights, and innovation.”</blockquote><p>How did Paradigm Initiative come to advocate on digital identity&nbsp;issues?</p><p>Adegoke: Our entry point builds on our existing commitment to digital rights and digital inclusion, alongside our belief in the right to privacy and equity for all Nigerians. When the federal government relaunched and wanted to fast-track the National Identification Number registration process, we were alarmed and had to act. Before a new ID program is even considered, we believe there must be many strong safeguards in place, including a data protection framework. Government-issued ID programs in Nigeria have never been inclusive, starting at the point of registration. They’ve amplified gaps between the “haves” and the “have-nots” that corrupt officials can exploit, especially for Nigerians that are not socially or politically connected, and stateless populations. <br> <br>What issues do feel poorly-managed government-issued IDs create for citizens and residents? <br> <br> Adegoke: There are potential risks depending on how the ID system is instituted. We are mindful of the kind of problems that an [digital] ID for residents can help solve. We are also aware that these can create new problems and amplify old ones. A digital ID may complicate already problematic and non-transparent surveillance activities of repressive regimes. On the other hand, [digital IDs] can ensure state resources are efficiently distributed, and problems, such as eliminating “ghost workers” in government services, can be resolved.<br> <br>What are practical challenges you see with the current National Identification Number process in&nbsp;Nigeria?</p><p>Adegoke: One, poor engagement by the government with the public. The government often assumes they know what is best for people, but have had no engagement with civil society voices or public forums. Two, digital ID vendors and contractors wield a huge influence in the Nigerian [National Identification Number] process, while human rights organizations and civil society voices have been largely ignored. Three, infrastructure challenges, including unstable electricity access and limited internet connectivity. Implementing a transparent and inclusive digital ID program requires not just an internet connection, but a reliable one. In October 2019, for example, it was announced that a [National Identification Number] would be required to write university matriculation Exams. The government was forced to quickly walk back that decision when the [National Identity Management Commission] could not cope with the surge of admission seekers due to the lack of operational [National Identification Number] registration centers. And four, corrupt practices by some [National Identification Number] registration officers. Registering for a [National Identification Number] goes to its highest bidders, weakening the accountability and trust in the government.</p><p>How does Paradigm Initiative engage with Nigerian policymakers to raise these concerns?</p><p>Adegoke: First, we have been at the forefront of the campaign for Nigeria to enact the <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2019/12/03/digital-rights-freedoms-bill/">Digital Rights and Freedom Bill</a> in Parliament since 2016. Second, we engage and educate policymakers on the need for parliament to pass the Nigerian Data Protection Bill (originally introduced in 2011) into law. While the new draft Data Protection Bill 2020 is critical, it only addresses a fraction of our concerns. Third, in 2019 a federal High Court in Abuja recommended the [National Identity Management Commission] put safety measures and a sufficient regulatory framework in place. We led a group of actors to demand that [commission] suspend [National Identification Number] implementation until the government enacts a comprehensive data protection law, and resolves the data security lapses and privacy concerns we identified.</p><p>We [also] facilitate engagement between [the commission] and civil society groups, grassroots advocates, and social media activists. In February, we hosted top officials in two engagement sessions with stakeholders from the Niger Delta region and Uyo. Also, in August, we hosted a virtual conversation between the Director General of [the commission], and civil society, where we received feedback on the [National Identification Number] concerns of our citizens and civil society. This month, we facilitated a virtual <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/pin-host-webinar-on-draft-bill-on-data-protection-launched-report-on-digital-rights-in-nigeria/">public consultation session</a> for feedback and recommendations on the draft Data Protection Bill&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Paradigm Initiative recently released <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/download/digital-rights-and-privacy-in-nigeria/">the Digital Rights and Privacy in Nigeria report</a>, and co-hosted the <a href="https://cipesa.org/fifafrica/">Forum on Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFAfrica</a>) to amplify the voices—and solutions—of African civil society organizations working on digital rights issues. Additionally, just last week, Paradigm Initiative <a href="https://twitter.com/Id4africaE/status/1309010053836480512">represented Nigerian civil society</a> in an ID4Africa panel on Nigeria’s identity ecosystem. The conversation resulted in a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202008/verify-my-life-could-a-nigerian-problem-lead-to-a-global-trust-solution">Biometric Update article</a> on the lack of both accountability mechanisms, and transparency on the ID program, as well as the fees collected when the Nigerian government hires third-party private actors to enroll people in the&nbsp;program.</p>

<p>Too many companies think of privacy as a feature that can be added later. And while, yes, it is true these features can always be enhanced and evolve, when it isn’t baked into your product, it will never be the default. Privacy by Design is an approach to make sure that it is.<br></p>



<p>Originally developed by <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/pbdce/about/ann-cavoukian/">Dr. Ann Cavoukian</a>, Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, the concept of Privacy by Design was formalized in a report on privacy-enhancing technologies in 1995. Having privacy incorporated by design, and by default, means that the product or solution is designed with privacy as a priority—not an afterthought—and that becomes integral to organizational priorities, development objectives, and design processes.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Cavoukian’s main thesis was that the future of security can not and could not be assured with compliance to regulatory frameworks, but that “privacy assurance must ideally become an organization’s default mode of operation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 The 7 Foundational Principles&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://authenteq.com/privacy-by-design-and-electronic-identity-verification/">Privacy by Design (PbD)</a> has seven key principles. This is not a pick or choose, each element is as important as the next.<br></p>



 1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial 



<p>When building any product, service, or tool, companies should anticipate any and all of the ways that privacy breaches could happen before they happen. That means that PbD focuses on prevention rather than resolution. It comes before the fact, not after. This significantly reduces the potential exposure to risk associated with data breaches and also that less data is exposed in the case of a breach.<br></p>



 2. Privacy as the Default Setting 



<p>The burden never falls to the customer or user. That means that no additional steps need to be taken for them to protect their own personal data, the protection is built into the system by default. They don’t need to worry about taking extra steps because they are automatically protected.<br></p>



 3. Privacy Embedded into Design 



<p>It becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. That means the privacy embedded in your product, tool, or service is integral to the system without diminishing functionality.<br></p>



 4. Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum 



<p>There are no trade-offs in PbD. That means it is never privacy or security as if it’s not possible to have both. It also means that having both doesn’t mean that it comes at a cost to the overall functionality.&nbsp;<br></p>



 5. End-to-End Security – Full Lifecycle Protection&nbsp; 



<p>PbD means security, security, security. From start to finish, all data is securely collected, safely stored, and properly destroyed.&nbsp;</p>



 6. Visibility and Transparency in Privacy – Keep it Open&nbsp; 



<p>Accountability, openness, and compliance are required for an effective and secure system. Adding transparency to the where, how, and why of data collection and processing actually improves the overall system. This breeds confidence amongst all stakeholders that the company is following all promised procedures and keeps companies accountable.&nbsp;<br></p>



 7. Respect for User Privacy – Keep it User-Centric 



<p>Above all, the individual’s data-security should be the number one concern. People are rightly worried about their data ending up in the wrong hands. It should always be clear to them what personal information is being collected, for what purpose, and how long it will be stored. Keep their needs top of mind.</p>



<blockquote><p>Did you know?&nbsp;</p>The EU GDPR incorporates Privacy by Design. Companies who follow these principles have a far lower risk of exposure to GDPR violations and associated fines.&nbsp;</blockquote>

   Have you ever had a notification about a suspicious login attempt from a digital destination you’ve never been to? Hopefully it came with the option to say it wasn’t you, allowing you to deny access to that specific place and rebuff the user trying to sneak into your account or information.

<p>Have you ever had a notification about a suspicious login attempt from a digital destination you’ve never been to? Hopefully it came with the option to say it wasn’t you, allowing you to deny access to that specific place and rebuff the user trying to sneak into your account or information. If so, you probably have token revocation to thank for the security measure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token revocation means a token is no longer able to be used for access to a protected digital place, and it’s often behind the scenes in the denying process. It’s similar to session revocation in that you’re blocking access at some level, but there’s a key difference. With session revocation, you can deny one or more sessions and still access protected information. But token revocation is more permanent because it “kills” the token that might otherwise be reused for the duration of the token’s lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokens play a big role in OAuth 2.0, which is designed to protect resources from wandering or malicious hands by using tokens to securely authorize users. You could build your own method of verifying access tokens and get a decent way there with open source packages, but a ready-made solution—token introspection—is easy to use and gives you the ability to offload the work from the app team to the identity platform’s team. PingOne for Customers handles the messy job of building a token verification system by giving you an API endpoint that does the work for you on our backend. In this blog post, I’ll walk you through how to use token revocation in PingOne for Customers.</p>

<p>By Kacie Harold, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the <a href="http://www.ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer Pack</a> — a toolkit designed to help tech workers spark dialogue about the future impacts of their designs, identify early warning signs, and brainstorm positive solutions. This week, we are sharing some additional, practical advice from leading experts on how to mitigate against several of the tech risk zones (or potential downsides) and ensure technology is safe, fair, and compassionate.</p><p>Chris Hughes is the co-founder and co-chair of the Economic Security Project, a group that is working to restructure the economy so that it works for everyone. Prior to this, he co-founded Facebook in 2004, and later worked as a publisher at New Republic for several years. Chris has worked exclusively on economic issues since 2016, focusing on anti-monopoly and antitrust issues, and calling for a guaranteed income and tax&nbsp;policy.</p><p>What motivates you on the issues related to ethics and responsibility within technology?</p><p>I think any systems builder, whether it’s in technology, finance, or the arts needs to think about how their work impacts other people and the world. This is an obligation that we all have as humans first, whether we end up as business people or anything else. Tech in particular has a very important responsibility since so many of the companies that are out there, pioneering and charting new paths for products and services. And each one of those comes with a different set of ethical questions that tech companies need to develop a practice of asking and answering on a regular&nbsp;basis.</p><p>I tend to be an optimist and think that folks in tech now are thinking much more comprehensively and ethically. That said, I don’t think that we should overcomplicate thinking about ethics. Just as parents teach their kids at the playground to think about how their play affects other kids, we do the same thing in schools. We have to do the same thing in business and technology as well. And I don’t think that creating the habit of thinking about how our work impacts others is a particularly tall ask. Part of being human is thinking about how we live in community with other people, what other people provide us and what we’re providing them. If there’s any moment in the past several decades that illustrates that more than ever it’s COVID-19. We can see that we all rely on each other to stay healthy and create the kind of communities that we, have appreciated and want to return&nbsp;to.</p><p>I think that the long arc of history teaches us that we’re all relying on each other and the decisions that we make as individuals affect the greater community. This is true in business. It’s true in politics and in organizing, too.</p><p>How do monopolies hurt entrepreneurs?</p><p>For small business entrepreneurs, the most worrying things about monopolies is their ability to move into a market and effectively shut that market down by either price gouging, copying features or tools, or, hostile acquisitions of companies in that marketplace. From a talent perspective, it is often difficult to compete against monopolies because of their ability to attract and retain&nbsp;talent.</p><p>Increases in market concentration lead to decreases in entrepreneurship and innovation. It becomes harder to enter these markets, and this slows down the pace of innovation. Even before the recession, small business startups were at a near historic low, and one of the chief causes of that is monopoly&nbsp;power.</p><p>My sense is that we’ve lost a vocabulary and a framework to talk about outsized corporate power in the United States over the past 30 or 40 years. Most folks in tech are wary of these conversations, but they are also concerned about the big of the consolidation of power. And so we’re at a transitional moment where folks in tech, like a lot of people elsewhere in the country and even in the world are rethinking what the role of public policy should be to create markets that are fair and create good outcomes for everyone.</p><p>I think another issue is that people have begun to see the large tech monopolies as inevitable and unchangeable. And so they may not think as much about how those monopolies impact their lives or impede their&nbsp;work.</p><p>That’s what the leaders of the large tech companies want you to believe. So if that’s what you’re thinking, they’ve got you right where they want you. The more that they can convince folks that there is no other way, and that this is the best of all possible worlds, then they’ve&nbsp;won.</p><p>I think there are a lot of entrepreneurs out there who are thinking creatively and are skeptical about the role that those large companies are playing. The challenge is less about not buying into what the tech companies are saying — that monopolies are inevitable– and more about believing that government can be a positive force for good in the world. Specifically, that the Federal Trade Commission and the US Department of Justice can create markets that are more dynamic and fair. We live in a time where cynicism about the government runs deep. I think for entrepreneurs, that cynicism is bigger barrier than the tech companies’ talking&nbsp;points.</p><p>If you don’t mind shifting for a moment, I’d like to ask you about something you wrote in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html">op-ed</a> for The New York Times in 2019 about your experience working at Facebook.</p><p>“I’m disappointed in myself and the early Facebook team for not thinking more about how the News Feed algorithm could change our culture, influence elections and empower nationalist leaders.”</p><p>Given your experience of being in the room as decisions like this get made, is there any advice you would give tech developers and teams to identify the key moments where they need to stop and think about what they are creating?</p><p>I can only speak for myself. In the early days of Facebook, it was very hard for me to imagine what a success at scale might look like. These were products that were for college kids in the United States that were largely meant to be fun, about creating connection. We knew that it was more than just fun, but the backdrop was that it was a lighthearted, recreational project that we hoped would bring people closer together. That would have been the way we would have spoken about it at the time. And so for me it was very hard to imagine what this thing would look like when over a billion people were using it, for who knows how many hours a day, and anyone can have access. That difficulty was real, and it isn’t an excuse because we knew that Facebook was a very sticky, very popular product, very early on. And that’s why I wrote what I wrote. Because we should have thought much more seriously about what it could turn into, even at the&nbsp;outset.</p><p>I’m not sure if it would have changed in some of those initial decisions that I made at the time, but it would have created a framework of accountability that we could refer back to as a team and individually. And I think it’s only in the past year or two that Facebook has really come to even understand its responsibility, if it really has. My advice to (tech) teams is, even if you’re working small, think big, and think about what problems could be introduced at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>I think when you are in a company that is growing and doing really well, it’s natural to be excited and want to move quickly, but that speed can make it difficult to predict ways that things could go wrong. Do you have any advice for how tech makers can recognize those pivotal moments where they should slow down and consider the impact of what they are creating?</p><p>You’re always in the moment, and you don’t have to worry about figuring out if you’re in the moment or not. My advice is that you should always be asking that question. Often it will feel theoretical, but it isn’t. I guess that’s my point with the playground analogy at the beginning. Thinking about how your actions impact other people is a basic part of living in a community with other&nbsp;people.</p><p>I realize that interviewing somebody (formerly) from Facebook may be a little counterproductive because people could say, well, my company is not going to become a Facebook, so I don’t need worry about this. But I think everybody should be thinking about it much of the time, whether you’re in the CEO suite or, the most junior customer service&nbsp;agent.</p><p>You can find more of Chris’ thinking on twitter <a href="http://chrishughes/">@chrishughes.</a> The <a href="https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/">Economic Security Project</a> is a grantee of Omidyar&nbsp;Network.</p>

This post complements <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/https-blog-oceanprotocol-com-ocean-tokenomics-ii-faf05854314b">Ocean Tokenomics II</a> by fleshing out the “token utility”&nbsp;aspect.</p><blockquote>Ocean’s core token dynamics are those of a <a href="https://multicoin.capital/2018/02/13/new-models-utility-tokens/">work token</a>, embedded within a loop for growth and long-term sustainability. OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage&nbsp;volume.</blockquote><p>This post is organized as follows. First, it describes the system design for near-term growth and long-term sustainability. It then elaborates on design facets: how value is added to the system (via work, including staking and governance), Ocean Data Farming for growth, OCEAN-datatokens relation, how supply contracts (burning), and how supply expands (minting).</p> Overall Dynamics: Ocean System&nbsp;Design <p>This section recaps the Ocean System design (first presented <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">here</a>). A key question is: How do we grow the Ocean data ecosystem and make it truly self-sustaining? These are questions for the near-term and long-term, respectively.</p> Long-Term Sustainability <p>By examining successful businesses and nations over time, we quickly see that the key is a loop: take a small fee from data ecosystem transaction volumes (e.g. marketplaces), and redirect it to the community projects that grow the ecosystem further. Repeat, repeat, repeat and it will snowball. The image below illustrates.</p><p>A healthier $OCEAN leads to a healthier, more sustainable Ocean data community. There are a few drivers for OCEAN demand. First, OCEAN is used to vote how fee income is allocated. Second, OCEAN is used for staking in the OCEAN data ecosystem drives demand (with more uses here anticipated). Third, some OCEAN is burned as a function of transaction volume. The rest of this post elaborates.</p>A loop for sustainability and growth of the Ocean data ecosystem.<p>To ensure <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">long-term sustainability</a> for the Ocean community, the OCEAN token is designed to increase with a rise in usage volume (all other things being equal). Here’s&nbsp;how.</p>  First, a rise in usage volume (of Ocean tools in the Data Ecosystem) leads to more OCEAN being staked, leading to more OCEAN demand, which then drives $OCEAN. The first example of this is in V3.0: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">staking OCEAN as liquidity for datatoken-Ocean AMM pools</a> for Ocean-powered markets. Publishers are incentivized to stake to get automated price discovery of their data assets, and liquidity providers for the transaction fees.  Second, a rise in usage volume leads to more Network Revenue, which goes to (a) burning and (b) OceanDAO. As of V3.0, the Ocean community gets <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">0.1% of all volume, and an additional 0.1% from volume coming through Ocean Market</a>. Burning OCEAN reduces supply, which drives $OCEAN. Funds go through OceanDAO to workers who have the mandate to grow usage of Ocean&nbsp;tools.   Near-Term Growth <p>Ocean Data Farming is a program to drive near-term growth of the supply of data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>51% of OCEAN is minted over time as “Network Rewards” directed via OceanDAO to community projects. This ensures a baseline of funding regardless of transaction volume. To help near-term growth, more tokens are disbursed in earlier days than later&nbsp;days.</p><p>We elaborate on both Data Farming and OCEAN minting in dedicated sections later in this&nbsp;post.</p> Work: Injecting Value into the&nbsp;System  Summary <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/can-blockchains-go-rogue-5134300ce790">Blockchains are incentive machines</a>: you can “get people to do stuff” with appropriately designed token dynamics. Designing such a system is the realm of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/towards-a-practice-of-token-engineering-b02feeeff7ca">Token Engineering</a> (TE). We want actors to do “work” that add value to the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>Ocean incentivizes for work to happen in several parts of Ocean&nbsp;System:</p>  Ocean Marketplace Tools: Supplying data assets, providing liquidity, and more in the data ecosystem  OceanDAO Governance: voting to collectively direct the flow of resources towards growth and sustainability.  Ocean Workers: building software, outreach, and&nbsp;more.  <p>Overall, this gives Ocean token dynamics like a <a href="https://multicoin.capital/2018/02/13/new-models-utility-tokens/">work token</a>. The next few paragraphs elaborate.</p> (1) Ocean Marketplace Tools <p>There are several ways for the Ocean ecosystem to gain value via “work” inside the “data ecosystem” box of the image&nbsp;above.</p>  More liquidity in datatoken pools gives lower slippage, for a better data buyer experience, which in turn drives volume, and in turn Ocean value. The promise of LP transaction fees incentivizes people to add OCEAN liquidity to OCEAN-datatoken pools.  Curation of assets (=amount staked in the corresponding datatoken pool) allows data buyers to surface the best assets more easily, which in turn drives volume, and in turn Ocean value. To have the best returns, LPs are incentivized to seek datatoken pools with the highest volumes, which tend to be the ones with the best datasets. That is, they’re curating.  Referrals bring new users to Ocean tools, which in turn drives volume, and in turn Ocean&nbsp;value.  More marketplaces with good volumes drives total Ocean volume, and in turn Ocean value. The promise of marketplace fees incentivizes people to run their own marketplaces and grow their&nbsp;volumes.   (2) OceanDAO Governance <p>In Ocean, governance is about directing the flow of resources towards the teams and projects that offer the best chance for growth. OCEAN holders are incentivized to do work to learn more about each team and project proposal, and then use OceanDAO to vote for the most promising teams/projects [1]. There are two criteria:</p>  Is the project’s expected Return on Investment (ROI) &gt; 1.0? ROI is measured over years. (Details&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">here</a>.)  Is the project aligned with <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">Ocean Mission &amp; Values</a>? Or at least not against&nbsp;them.  <p>For a given funding period, if there aren’t enough projects that meet the criteria to use the OCEAN funds available, then remaining OCEAN gets burned [2]. This therefore sets a baseline for the value-add needed. Note that Ocean governance is not about specific decisions for protocols or software, it’s at a higher level and more directly about value creation.</p> (3) Ocean&nbsp;Workers <p>With grants from OceanDAO, these teams do a variety of work, including: improving core software (datatokens, etc), building and improving applications, outreach and community building, and unlocking data for use in&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>These activities aim to drive value to the Ocean ecosystem (on average) precisely because the work has been filtered by OceanDAO towards value&nbsp;add.</p>Ocean worker: restoring coral reefs [Image: <a href="https://www.gbrrestoration.org/">Christopher Brunner, Australian Inst. of Marine Science CC-BY-3.0-AU</a>] Ocean Data Farming for Near-Term Growth <p>Ocean Data Farming is a program to incentivize a supply of relevant and high-quality data assets into Ocean Protocol. It focuses on nearer-term growth.</p><p>Ocean Data Farming aims to maximize the data supply reward function (RF). The RF is a function of liquidity added to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837?source=---------3----------------------------">datatoken</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">pools</a>, dataset usage, and potentially more. In other words, liquidity providers (LPs) can earn extra OCEAN rewards for providing liquidity to data assets that people actually&nbsp;use.</p><p>Data Farming draws inspiration from the successful <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-liquidity-mining-begins-6e65932eaea9">Balancer Liquidity Mining Program</a> [3].The program allows its program managers to start simple, then to quickly learn and improve the RF every week. If this initial pilot is successful, it may be repeated (potentially for a much longer time&nbsp;scale).</p><p>For the pilot, OCEAN will be drawn from the treasury of Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF). Future versions may draw from OPF treasury as well as OceanDAO&nbsp;funds.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">This post</a> has&nbsp;details.</p> OCEAN-Datatokens Relation <p>OCEAN is not involved for any ERC20 transactions on datatokens (transfer, approve, transferFrom, etc). This means that OCEAN “gets out of the way” to give maximum space for DeFi apps to leverage datatokens. It also reduces the opportunity for attack vectors on datatokens.</p><p>Being ERC20 tokens, datatokens may be transferred in return for whatever payment is desired, such as fiat, DAI, or ETH. Community participants may add capabilities like this as they see&nbsp;fit.</p><p>Accordingly, OCEAN can be used as a unit-of-exchange to buy and sell datatokens, but it’s not mandated. OCEAN is the default unit-of-exchange in Ocean Market and in Ocean libraries, for both fixed-price and auto-pricing scenarios (the latter also defaults to staking OCEAN). While Ocean Market transacts in OCEAN, it also displays the price in EUR. Community participants may build data marketplaces that transact in fiat or other crypto-tokens.</p> Shrinking Supply: Burning&nbsp;OCEAN <p>From the above, here we summarize where OCEAN supply shrinks&nbsp;(burns):</p>  First, 5% of all Network Revenue is burned. This ensures that OCEAN holders will always see some deflationary actions, and as Network Revenue increases, deflation increases.  Second, for a given funding period, OceanDAO burns all non-allocated funds.   Growing Supply: Minting&nbsp;OCEAN <p>As mentioned, 51% of OCEAN is minted over time as Network Rewards directed via OceanDAO to community projects. This section describes Ocean’s minting schedule.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply">Bitcoin emission schedule</a> has several nice features, including a fixed supply of tokens, more benefits to early movers, and a track record of being live for a decade. For these reasons, Ocean uses Bitcoin’s network rewards schedule, including half-life of four years, as a starting point&nbsp;[4].</p><p>Our main additional challenge is: how to be resistant to instability in the early days of OceanDAO? E.g. if OceanDAO gets gamed or hacked. To address these, we “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">bake slowly</a>” by ratcheting up the amount of rewards over time, until stability is&nbsp;reached.</p><p>We start with manually-sourced grants directly from Ocean Protocol Foundation that aren’t part of the 51%. With a bit of stability, we begin to draw on the 51% rewards. First, there’s a 10% multiplier on the rewards curve, then 25% once we are more comfortable (6 months or less), then 50% after more comfortable yet, and finally 100%. The ability for manual intervention will be removed by the time the 100% multiplier is&nbsp;hit.</p><p>The Appendix provides the exact equations.</p> Ocean Network Reward&nbsp;Curves <p>This section shows how network rewards are dispensed over time. Initial funding from OPF is not shown; and it assumes a 6-month interval between each ratchet. The actual interval will be a function of perceived stability, as described above.</p>% network rewards tokens released over the next 2&nbsp;years<p>The image below shows network rewards over 25 years. The curve is shaped much like Bitcoin’s, except the initial years of&nbsp;ramp-up.</p>% network rewards tokens released over the next 25&nbsp;years<p>The table below shows network rewards going to 50 years. It takes just over 5 years to get to 50% dispensed.</p>Table: % network rewards released over the next 50&nbsp;years Conclusion <p>Ocean’s core token dynamics are those of a work token, embedded within a loop for growth and long-term sustainability.</p><p>This post described the system design for near-term growth and long-term sustainability. It then elaborated on design facets: how value is added to the system (via work, including staking and governance), Ocean Data Farming for growth, OCEAN as a unit-of-exchange, how supply contracts (burning), and how supply expands (minting).</p>Ocean dynamics: a fishnado [Image: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/robinhughes/404457553/">Robin Hughes, CC-BY-SA&nbsp;2.0</a>] Appendix 1: On Burning &amp; Growing&nbsp;Value <p>One reviewer question [by <a href="https://twitter.com/edendhaliwal">Eden Dhaliwal</a>] was: “Why was the burning mechanism selected vs buying back OCEAN and then locking up in a treasury? Since OCEAN is also used as a governance token, burning might limit the network’s ability to grow fundamental value: I tend to agree with the points made [by Joel Monegro of Placeholder] <a href="https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/9/17/stop-burning-tokens-buyback-and-make-instead">here</a>.”</p><p>This is an excellent question, and an excellent article. The article’s thesis is: don’t make burning the core of your token model, because it’s a major lost opportunity for&nbsp;growth.</p><p>We agree with that&nbsp;premise!</p><p>The article, however, frames things in a binary fashion: either burn is the heart of your token model and you do it completely, or&nbsp;not.</p><p>It doesn’t have to be binary. It can be more nuanced, with relative rates of supply and burning adaptively set over time. The primary objective is to grow fundamental value. Burning helps as a tool towards value. In Ocean, tokens are minted with the possibility of allocation towards growing fundamental value, and if they can’t grow it, they’re burned. To be more specific: in a given funding interval with newly minted tokens for that interval, the OceanDAO community chooses whether each funding proposal will drive more value than simply&nbsp;burning.</p><p>For longer-term value, we expect that the majority of funds will be allocated to growth, because there is exponential “snowball effect” payoff compared to just “one-time” payoff for&nbsp;burning.</p><p>We confirmed this in simulation as follows. We conducted experiments in TokenSPICE agent-based simulator to test the effect of using 100% of minted tokens for growth, versus burning 100% of them. The summary result is that in medium time frames, there was 4x value creation for 100% minted tokens for&nbsp;growth.</p><p>At some point in time, there will likely be diminishing returns on projects towards value. But will that be in 5 years or 50 years? We don’t know. But the community will be able to adaptively decide using OceanDAO. Minted tokens will go to projects that promise to drive growth sufficiently; the rest will get&nbsp;burned.</p><p>Besides burning inside OceanDAO, Ocean also burns 5% of Network Revenue. This is a nonzero value to give a lower bound of the benefits of revenue growth to OCEAN holders over time. It’s a small number (vs. large), because there is greater benefit to redirecting revenue back to&nbsp;growth.</p> Appendix 2: On Burning &amp; Surviving Shocks <p>A second question [also by Eden Dhaliwal] was: “If burned, my concern is that long term there are not sufficient tokens available to react to future shocks. Locking in a treasury [as in Joel Monegro’s <a href="https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/9/17/stop-burning-tokens-buyback-and-make-instead">model</a>] could help mitigate this&nbsp;risk.”</p><p>It’s important to consider the problem of how to handle future shocks in revenue. If the token doesn’t have an expanding supply, then the treasury approach is a great design choice. However, Ocean has an expanding supply. The supply is only a function of time, not of revenue. This means that even when there are future shocks in revenue, the Ocean community will still have access to funding to keep building and growing fundamental value.</p> Appendix 3: Ocean Network Reward Equations <p>This section describes the equations of Ocean Network Rewards, which implement the goals described in the “Growing Supply: Minting OCEAN”&nbsp;section.</p><p>First, Bitcoin’s Network Rewards schedule&nbsp;is:</p><p>Where F(H, t) is the fraction of all reward tokens that have been released after t years, and H is the half-life, in years. Half-life is the time taken for 50% of the remaining supply to be released. Bitcoin uses a half-life of 4&nbsp;years.</p><p>Ocean’s Networks reward schedule uses Bitcoin’s schedule as a starting point, including half-life of four years. However it has a “ratchet-up” phase in the beginning to give time to OceanDAO to stabilize.</p><p>We now provide precise equations describing the Ocean Network Rewards schedule. g(t) is the overall schedule. It’s a piecewise model of four exponential curves.</p><p>Where gi(t) are pieces of the piecewise model chosen depending on t, and Gi are the values of gi(t) at the inflection points.</p><p>Mi is a multiplier for a given interval i. f(t) is the value of F(H,t) assuming a constant H. F(H,t) is the base exponential curve. The units of H and t are&nbsp;years.</p><p>The pieces of the model are a function of t, which are parameterized with Ti. The units of Ti are&nbsp;years.</p><p>The following parameter values are chosen: H=4 years; M1=0.10; M2=0.25;&nbsp;M3=0.5.</p> Further Reading   <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1311924485612883975">Here’s</a> the tweetstorm summarizing this&nbsp;post.  “Ocean Protocol V3 Posts: Links to all V3-Related Stories”&nbsp;[<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-posts-413b2dd33e8f">link</a>]  The Ocean token model is the result of years of thinking and collaboration on Token Engineering.

<p>Explore the standards-based scalable identifiers and encrypted data storage tools that power Transmute’s product.</p>An example of the Transmute Encrypted Data Vaults Workbench document&nbsp;preview.<p>Transmute is proud to announce the release of several new technical workbenches as a part of our continued commitment to open-standards development, interoperability, and product transparency. Whenever possible, our team strives to provide interactive proof of functionality along with standards, specifications, and library&nbsp;support.</p><p>This new suite of tools is available for developers to experiment with today and includes:</p>  <a href="http://staging.element.transmute.industries/">Element Ropsten Workbench</a>  <a href="https://staging.data-vault.transmute.industries/">Encrypted Data Vault Workbench</a>  <a href="http://did.key.transmute.industries/">DID Key Workbench</a>  <p>Transmute leverages these workbenches as part of our global trade solutions, where our customers benefit from verifiable data workflows and integrated capabilities. Reach out to our team <a href="https://transmute.typeform.com/to/RshfIw">here</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p> Workbench Details <p>Read on to learn technical details of what is included in each workbench, and follow the links to see how each works for yourself.</p><p>Element Testnet Workbench <a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.element.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve updated did:elem to support the latest stable version of the Sidetree protocol, and we’ve reimplemented our block explorer from <a href="https://element-did.com/">https://element-did.com</a> to support the new Sidetree filesystem and the latest element&nbsp;dids.</p><p>We’ve also added universal wallet* support to the element workbench, so you can create a Sidetree did and control it with the same keys you use for did key or any other universal wallet compatible product.</p><p>*The universal wallet is also an official work item of the W3C CCG <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec</a>.</p><p>Data Vault Workbench <br><a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.date-vault.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve added support for encrypted data vaults to the universal wallet spec, and provide a developer user interface which is similar to a database administration interface which helps DID controllers explore their vaults, documents, and indexes inside encrypted data&nbsp;vaults.</p><p>We also published the first vendor interoperability tests in the Secure Data Store working group: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store</a>. These tests help vendors prove they are interoperable.</p><p>Having workbenches like these helps Transmute separate standards, libraries, sample implementations, demos into microservices which are independently upgradeable and valuable by themselves as standalone products.</p><p>For example, our Sidetree node for Element regularly anchors testnet DID activity, and it’s helpful to be able to explore that activity on our block explorer, even if you didn’t use our node to anchor those events… If you want to dig into the Ethereum related details, we happily link you to <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/">https://ropsten.etherscan.io/</a> for more detailed information about the Ethereum transactions and&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Our encrypted data vault workbench demonstrates the concept of “wallet portability” by showing how wallet content can be encrypted client-side and replicated between clients. This demonstrates the value of encrypted data vaults and the universal wallet interop spec at the same time…. It also helps us prove that encrypted data vaults work with did:key and did:elem.</p><p>DID Key Workbench <br><a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries">https://did.key.transmute.industries</a></p><p>We’ve added support for BLS12381, which is used to construct zero-knowledge proofs using <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020</a></p><p>We’ve also added support for the “NIST Curves” which are legacy elliptic curves that are supported almost everywhere, including natively in web browsers. Not everyone trusts them, you should review <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/</a>. Nonetheless, we have shown them to be working with DID Key, which opens the door for legacy integration and interoperability.</p><p>We use DID Key for testing, and because of its simplicity it’s an ideal starting point for learning about DIDs and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>The DID Key Workbench also has the first [to our knowledge] support for content-type and multiple did document representations. Support for multiple representations in the DID Core Specifications is currently being defined and subject to change. Today, there is a lot of language which describes JSON-LD, and almost no examples of JSON or CBOR. We hope that by showing how did:key can support both JSON and JSON-LD we can help the community figure out the representation sufficient for it to be testable.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-releases-technical-workbenches-892f8140ac6e">Transmute Releases Technical Workbenches</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>ITSM is going well beyond ITIL and IT ticketing these days: It’s becoming the portal and workflow platform</p>
<p>Not that long ago, ITSM (IT Service Management) was what the name means: A technology used within IT to manage IT services and facing to the end user when it comes to IT requests. IT requests led to tickets as the tasks to be performed by workers in IT. And yes, there was and is ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) describing common IT processes, there were and are Service Catalogs, and there were and are CMDBs (Configuration Management Databases).</p>
<p>However, this is changing. ITSM platforms are shifting from IT solutions to business solutions and becoming strategic tools for organizations, for service delivery (and thus service definition, service management, and so on) across a range of business functions. They have become a widely used interface for users to a wide range of services, and they support the workflows and process automation behind these interfaces.</p>
<p>With IAM providing interfaces and with workflows and processes being a vital part of every IAM, it is obvious that there is a logical link between IAM and ITSM (or the other way round).</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, in his talk will look at the journey of ITSM and where ITSM is heading. He will look at the overlaps and links between IAM and ITSM. And he will take a high-level perspective on where integration is expected to become deeper and where IAM capabilities might shift to ITSM, specifically in the context of IAM evolving from monolithic platforms to modern, microservice-based architectures that can well make use of existing ITSM services, microservices, and APIs.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive10_2020_10_01_kuppinger"></a>

<p>As the seasons change, each week on <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/podcast-main/">State of Identity</a>, we’re watching the trends in identity transition as well, especially as COVID-19 has accelerated the importance of these solutions across business landscapes. While it’s no surprise COVID unmasked itself in each episode, each guest moved past “what’s the impact” and rather dove into “what’s next” for businesses and users in the new normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We kicked off the month welcoming Jimmy Williams, Accelitas National Sales Manager at Accelitas, for a conversation centered around alternative data pertaining to access to financial services. The ways we access financial services, lending, credit, or otherwise have changed, and how to leverage alternative data for inclusion. How is Accelitas doing it?</p>
<p>“What we’ve found to be incredibly successful is consumer behavior, both at the physical point of sale as well as the virtual point of sale…because not only is it a reflection of that consumer’s spending, potential fraud, things like that, but also it’s a proxy for things like employment or payback behavior.” Tune in to learn how this data is opening up access to financial services, especially when physical documentation isn’t as accessible, and how this can be the future of establishing trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following, Christina Luttrell, Chief Operating Officer of IDology, sat down with Cameron D’Ambrosi (virtually, of course) to not just discuss the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the customer experience across industries. The conversation begins noting how they have seen a massive spike in not only the number of fraud cases but a shift in the ways they fraudsters are executing.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You know, the creativity isn’t quite there… it’s a lot of the old same old things that we’ve seen in the past. It’s just that it’s so much more. And it’s impacting demographics that normally wouldn’t be transacting digitally.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And while fraudsters will always be around, looking for ways to cause harm, this posed a broader conversation on successful, frictionless onboarding as companies see a rapid spike in users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conversation on fraud led us to wonder, is this spike an unprecedented event, like the pandemic itself? We continued the discussion with Socure Senior Counsel &amp; Privacy Lead Annie Bai, exploring why an uptick in identity fraud usually follows economic downturns, honing in on what kind of security and experiences customers expect, and how businesses – especially the financial sector – can meet them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A critical challenge that I think we need to face as an industry is can we balance these mandates of providing high levels of assurance and high levels of customer experience, with low friction, but also respecting the needs that these digital identities have with regard to inclusion?” Annie believes yes, emphasizing the importance of partnerships, alternative data, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we rounded out the month by welcoming Yoti Commercial Director Gareth Narinesingh and Synectics Solutions Head of Presales Chris Lewis, following the launch of Project Endeavor, a pilot program to revolutionize electronic digital onboarding, identity verification, and risk assessment for the financial services sector in the United Kingdom. While they’re making significant strides with this new venture, the guests closed out in making some future-focused predictions, spanning from the adoption of digital identity, to open banking, to the lasting impact of COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You’ve then got a global model, which is going to change the way that we engage digitally. But I think it’s probably not in the long term future. I think it’s medium-term future. And I think that schemes like Endeavor and many others like it are going to be big pioneers moving in that direction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re keen to see the impact Endeavor has, and if their predictions come to fruition. And while each of our guests left us with great food for thought, each took a future-focused look at the potential impacts of today’s landscape and how we can create a safer, more secure, and more inclusive world. What will the next month bring across the identity ecosystem? You’ll have to tune in each Thursday to find out!

<p>By Kacie Harold, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the <a href="http://www.ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer Pack</a> — a toolkit designed to help tech workers spark dialogue about the future impacts of their designs, identify early warning signs, and brainstorm positive solutions. This week, we are sharing some additional, practical advice from leading experts on how to mitigate against several of the tech risk zones (or potential downsides) and ensure technology is safe, fair, and compassionate.</p><p>Caroline Sinders is a designer and artist focusing on the intersections of artificial intelligence, abuse, and politics in digital conversational spaces. She has worked with the United Nations, Amnesty International, IBM Watson, the Wikimedia Foundation and recently published a <a href="https://medium.com/@OmidyarNetwork/how-to-design-for-delight-and-connection-during-the-pandemic-c54eb2131169">piece</a> with the support of Omidyar Network and Mozilla Foundation. Sinders has held fellowships with the Harvard Kennedy School, Google’s PAIR (People and Artificial Intelligence Research group), and the Mozilla Foundation. Her work has been featured in the Tate Exchange in Tate Modern, the Victoria and Albert Museum, MoMA PS1, LABoral, Wired, Slate, Quartz, the Channels Festival and others. Caroline also has a passion for addressing harassment online, which represents one of the harmful behaviors within the Bad Actors Tech Risk&nbsp;Zone.</p><p>Caroline, can you tell us about how design plays an important role in creating safe and inclusive environments online?</p><p>I’ve been studying online harassment for nearly the past seven years. I look at it from the perspective of how technology products and social networks are designed, and how that design can mitigate or amplify harassment. I focus on how the design of a space allows for harassment to occur, including both the actions that a harasser could engage in and the affordances that a victim has, to mitigate the harassment that they are receiving.</p><p>How can tech companies benefit from protecting their users from harassment?</p><p>I always like to remind people that bad business costs money. Additionally, when people face harassment, they tend to engage in self-censorship. The chilling effect of harassment is that people post less content and they engage less often. I believe that becomes a human rights issue when, for safety reasons, some people can not engage freely in a platform, but others can. Being able to participate safely in a space is crucial for engaging in free speech. Ultimately, a company will lose money if people stop using or all together leave their platform; one way to get users to stay is to protect&nbsp;them.</p><p>In the last few years, you’ve worked with Band Camp, Facebook, and Wikipedia on anti-harassment policies and tools to support victims. Are there any common challenges that you’ve seen tech teams struggle with as they address harassment on their platforms?</p><p>Platforms, across the board, struggle to identify growing forms of harm. Harassers are always changing their methods and finding some new and interesting way to hurt other people. It’s important to regularly talk to a variety of people from underrepresented groups, who are using your product or technology in order to understand how forms are harassment are evolving.</p><p>When you listen to users, you need to be aware their relationship to the tool. Often in open source communities or volunteer led projects, you see a lot of users who feel very committed to a project because they have contributed to it and they are deeply invested in the community. For instance, at Wikimedia, I saw victims who were more willing to forgive or try to empathize or work through the harassment they had faced out of concern that asking the Wikimedia Foundation or community leadership to make changes might rupture the community or hurt the encyclopedia. In these cases, you need to find other marginalized members who have experienced toxicity, and have a conversation with them and make sure you aren’t perpetuating toxicity in order to protect a&nbsp;project.</p><p>Another challenge is that some forms of harassment look innocuous at first. For example, imagine you receive the same message from 10 different people over the course of a year, and although you block the users, the messages keep coming. When you file a report, there’s no way to show the messages are related, and the platform has no way to investigate it. In another scenario where you receive a comment from someone that says, “I love your green top with the polka dots,” you might be scared, wondering why or how that person has seen your shirt. But the content moderator isn’t going to see that, all they see is a comment on the victim’s appearance. Even with harassment policy and procedures in place, reporting flows may prevent victims from sharing context or evidence necessary for a content moderator to verify&nbsp;it.</p><p>How can tech companies be proactive about preventing harm on their platforms?</p><p>Unfortunately, when big tech thinks of preventative care in terms of harassment, they think of technology solutions to it. This can be really problematic because those technology solutions end up being things like AI and AI filters, which aren’t very accurate.</p><p>Preventing harassment would entail much more user friendly privacy settings. The challenge is, most people aren’t necessarily thinking of their safety until it has been compromised. One way to increase safety for users is to make data privacy settings really legible, and easy to find and use. This could also look like sending users a push notification suggesting changes to their privacy settings, keeping location sharing off by default, or even notifying users of ways that harassment can occur on that platform.</p><p>In addition to giving people tools to protect themselves, victims may also need proof that they have reported abuse in case things get worse. So right now, if you file a harassment report on Facebook or Twitter they send you an email, but it would help victims to be able to find all of those reports in one place and in a downloadable format in case they need those reports to build a legal case at some&nbsp;point.</p><p>What advice do you have for tech makers, builders, or companies that are just starting to think about or discuss harassment?</p><p>Hire Black women and other marginalized people who use your tool. If you are a privileged person, you may not quite understand that someone could experience harassment in a place that you feel is very safe. I think of Zoom which, really could not have anticipated this moment or the popularity of their tool. The CEO said that they had never thought of harassment because Zoom was created as a workplace tool. But we know that harassment happens at&nbsp;work.</p><p>When you design a technology, always ask yourself what could possibly go wrong and really map out things, even if they feel absurd to you. Don’t just design for like this middle area of how you hope people will use your technology, design for the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Finally, remember that every data point about harassment is a real person’s traumatic story. So even if you have what seems like really low numbers of harassment, it’s always important to remember that these are people experiencing trauma, not&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>You can find more of Caroline’s work on her <a href="https://carolinesinders.com/projects/">website</a>, and can follow her journey on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/carolinesinders">@CarolineSinders</a>.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Whether you are a firm believer in the bright future of Artificial Intelligence or somewhat of a skeptic like me – you simply cannot ignore the great strides AI technologies have made in recent years. Intelligent products powered by machine learning are everywhere: from chatbots to autonomous vehicles, from predicting consumer behavior and detecting financial fraud to cancer diagnostics and crop harvesting. There is however a major factor limiting even further applications of AI and ML in almost any industry: AI algorithms are very computationally intensive and until quite recently, prohibitively expensive to operate “on-premises”.</p>
<p>The rise of cloud computing has given a major boost to AI technologies in recent years, and to this day, it is the cloud that powers the majority of AI applications, both for consumers and for enterprise applications. However, what works perfectly well for business analytics, language translation services or, say, virtual assistants, might be not enough for more mission-critical scenarios.</p>
<p>The Challenges of AI in the Cloud</p>
<p>The biggest challenge of cloud-based AI are potential connectivity issues: if a device is only occasionally connected to the Internet, it won’t be able to utilize cloud-based machine learning services efficiently. For real-time scenarios like self-driving cars, even the additional milliseconds of network latency can be a deal-breaker. Another major problem of cloud-based AI is the sensitivity of the information that has to be sent to the cloud for processing. Companies operating under strict regulations (which nowadays includes anyone dealing with personally identifiable information) simply cannot afford the risks for a security breach or a compliance violation fine.</p>
<p>These problems are nothing new, of course – they’ve been the biggest obstacle to adopting any cloud services for over a decade already. To address this challenge and to expand their customer base to these “not cloud-ready” companies, cloud service providers have been pushing the concept of Edge Computing. At its face value, edge computing simply means bringing computing and storage resources closer to the customer’s geographical location to reduce network latency. This has started over 20 years ago with CDNs (content delivery networks) but expanded to mobile phones, IoT devices and network gateways.</p>
<p>Nowadays, these devices are powerful enough to implement a substantial part of the cloud service stack locally, creating a distributed computing platform between corporate networks and clouds, dramatically improving response rates and reducing the strain on the core cloud infrastructure. It is important to understand that this trend does not by any means undo the achievements of the cloud model. Edge computing isn’t returning to on-prem data centers; it is simply another phase in the evolution of the cloud. Even the name itself implies it: the edge, of course, refers to the cloud, its proverbial “silver lining” …</p>
<p>In a sense, edge computing is an alternative approach towards hybrid architectures, one that tries to blur the massive divide in on-prem and cloud technology stacks and to expand the reach of cloud service providers even deeper into their customers’ networks. Bringing AI capabilities closer to their consumers is just another logical step in that direction.</p>
<p>The Future of the Intelligent Edge</p>
<p>It is well known that preparing data for machine learning and training of ML models is the part of AI that requires the most computing resources. The actual inference (i.e., putting a model to productive use) is much lighter. Optimizing ML models for running on edge devices is one of the primary methods of decoupling them from the cloud. Solutions like AI-powered antiviruses that only require updates every six months are already a reality. Simple image recognition can run directly on your mobile phone, helping you take better pictures of your food.</p>
<p>More sophisticated models require specialized hardware to run. Major semiconductor manufacturers like Intel and Nvidia and even cloud service providers themselves like AWS have specialized AI chips in their portfolios; smaller companies are offering solutions for developers to simplify and optimize the usage of this hardware. In other words, a whole ecosystem is being born, bringing AI/ML closer to customers and enabling usage scenarios previously impossible.</p>
<p>The field is still far from mature, however. Perhaps the best indication of this is a lack of standardization developments and a very fragmented market, where very few vendors can deliver a full technology and service stack to satisfy different use cases. Will we see the emergence of a standardized abstracted architecture similar to VMware or Kubernetes for traditional computing? Perhaps: companies like Run:AI are already working on AI orchestration platforms.</p>
<p>One thing is clear though: cloud AI isn’t going anywhere. For the foreseeable future, we’re going to deal with a multitude of hybrid architectures. History has a tendency to repeat itself, after all.</p>

<p>The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, better known as Freddie Mac, is the backbone of the United States housing sector. The government-sponsored public enterprise has provided more than $10 trillion to help more than 67 million homeowners and 11 million renters establish their homes since its inception 50 years ago, fulfilling its mission to provide liquidity, stability and affordability to the U.S. housing market.<br>
<br>
Recently, the Freddie Mac identity team determined it was time to <a>modernize their legacy web access management (WAM)</a> infrastructure. The system was nearing end of life and presented numerous security vulnerabilities that weren’t easily remedied. But given the number of resources involved and the 400+ applications that had to be migrated, the switch to a modern identity and access management (IAM) platform would be a massive undertaking.<br>

<p>On September 22nd, the<a href="http://know.oneworldidentity.com"> KNOW Identity Digital Forum</a> took a look into the growing ways that alternative data can expand services to new customer groups as well as combat fraudulent attempts worldwide. We gathered experts in the financial services and digital identity industries to discuss inclusion and security balances in our current banking systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each session was jam-packed with unprecedented insights, but a few standout takeaways included:</p>
 
 Fraud rates have accelerated in 2020 with more and more transactions happening online as a result of COVID-19. However, regulation is still slow to catch up to or empower technologies to ward off bad actors’ tactics. 
 Openness and data sharing across governmental bodies and private institutions are going to be critical to expanding service offerings to new customer groups, such as immigrants and previously thin-file consumers. Data collected from mobile devices can also help level the playing field for previously un- or underbanked consumers.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Combating Synthetic Identity Fraud&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first session, <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/ghost-in-the-machine-combating-synthetic-identity-fraud/">Ghost in the Machine: Combating Synthetic Identity Fraud</a>, in partnership with Acuant, tackled the ever-moving target of synthetic identities. Even difficult to define, these data mashups present unique threats for companies verifying relationships between user and data attributes. In 2020, the SSA in the U.S. will be rolling out its Electronic Consent Based SSN Verification Service (eCBSV), but is this the end-all solution to stop synthetics? Jose Caldera (Chief Product Officer at Acuant), Lauren Day (Compliance and Risk Manager at Binance.US) and Chuck Christofilis (Chief Compliance Officer at CoinZoom) discuss how businesses better detect and remove synthetic identities as fraudsters adapt their strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: One solution that has come to the fore on the synthetic identity fraud front is the eCBSV that has begun to be rolled out by the Social Security Administration to allow for verification of SSN and the tying a user-submitted social to the actual issuing database. Is this a magic bullet that can end synthetic identity fraud as we know it, or do we need to continue pushing ahead in terms of identifying ways as an industry to combat synthetic fraud?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acuant: I think that thinking of any solution as a silver bullet is probably not the right way of thinking. It is the components that make that solution, they are not necessarily available to every application where identity fraud or synthetic identity fraud is present. Certainly those applications that rely on the data and the data attributes are going to benefit from it. No question about that. But then you have to deal with the consent issue. I think a lot of other practitioners may be put off by the fact that you need to get consent from your end customer to let the Social Security Administration give you permission to access that data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other countries have similar solutions, but one of the issues that they have had is that one to one relationship. It is unclear whether those databases actually maintain that relationship between the security number and the entity of the person. It is unclear whether within the database itself, there might be multiple identities associated with the same person. So that is one to end or one to one relationship has been a problem in other countries with similar solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: What are we seeing in the current fraud landscape from the bad actors? Is synthetic fraud accelerating in 2020? Does this remain as one of the favored fraud vectors?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance.US: As we move online, more and more, our transactions move online. Companies move online and we’re just going to see more and more of these fraudsters trying to get around certain controls. We’ve definitely seen an increase. On top of not only synthetic fraud, we’ve also seen a lot of classic scams that essentially trick people into giving away certain elements of their personal identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Data offers greater visibility into quantifying synthetic fraud, and potentially being able to strengthen the models being used to predict or identify current parts of the portfolio or applicants who are believed to be synthetic fraudsters. What are some of those techniques that we’re seeing success with? And what are some of those new types of data that we are leveraging successfully in this fight against synthetic fraud?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoinZoom: We’ve seen [success] specifically in potential elder abuse cases where someone is using the same device. That’s a data point. And it’s information that just a few years ago was unthinkable. Now we’re able to prevent a lot of what could potentially be elder abuse when we just see people trying to set up accounts with different people on the same device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Do you foresee any challenges from the device data from a regulatory standpoint that is often a strong indicator of fraud? What are you seeing in terms of the evolving landscape, in terms of what we have access to to help make these fraud decisions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acuant: Just a couple of years ago was when FinCEN allowed that the collection and the reporting of data had to do with devices and IP as part of the source. I think from the regulatory standpoint, there is now a recognition of the detailed aspects of those transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how are they used for prevention? I think, regulatory-wise, it is being accepted as those reportings have more information about the detailed components of those transactions. By FinCEN adding this data to their [reports], it seems to be a recognition that this data is relevant and it’s important–it’s reliable to do analysis on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Alternative Data Revolution 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shifting gears from fighting fraud to expanding services, OWI next welcomed Robin Weiss (Sr. Technology Advisor at Fidelity Investments), Schan Duff (VP of Strategy at Kiva), and Steve Polsky (Founder and CEO at Juvo) to the virtual stage for <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/alternative-data-revolution/">The Alternative Data Revolution: Fast Forward to Today’s Inclusive Lending Through Big Data &amp; AI</a>. Weiss moderated the discussion on how each company has utilized mobile data and other digital touch-points to build alternative credit files for the previously un- and underbanked and what we have learned through grappling with the repercussions of the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fidelity: How are you each using alternative data sources to broaden financial service access through your work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Juvo: What we are trying to do is using the ubiquity of mobile phones and cloud computing to build what we call a financial identity, to establish who is thought of as credit worthiness, but with a broader perspective that their financial identity starts with their everyday usage of their mobile phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That gives us a macro ability to impact a large portion of populations in the countries that we serve. We can then turn this around and create a feed to financial service providers. A data feed that effectively bridges the gap between financial services providers who don’t have information on a group of consumers and a group of consumers who are unable to access financial service to close this gap through a new source of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kiva: The thesis behind all of our work is that unbanked borrowers are not riskier borrowers. They’re not inherently uncredible. They’ve just been denied the opportunity and access to the formal financial system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Q2 2020, the United States in the height of the COVID pandemic, default rates on credit cards were somewhere near 3.8 percent or 4 percent. Over our time at Kiva, our default rates across those 90 countries, including conflict zones, is about 3.6 percent. This is lending to populations who aren’t included in credit bureaus, who don’t have bank accounts and don’t have access to formal financial services. So that experience proves to us that, in the words of William Gibson, the world is awash in credit data. In financial transaction data, it’s just not evenly distributed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fidelity: Inherent in both of your models is the fact that they are dependent on government-issued foundational identities that clearly vary from geography to geography. Can these or should they be replaced by a constellation of non-foundational identities? In other words, alternative data points to arrive at a high assurance I.D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Juvo: There’s essentially three parts that need to come together to provide someone financial services. One, you need an anchor: you need the government to step up and provide a system of identities, something you can tie into. Two, we need some form of biometrics. It’s not NSA always biometrics; that person needs to prove they are who they say they are just to eliminate fraud. Then the third piece is that we need to know that the person qualifies for the particular service they might be offered. To me, stitching these three things together is the key thing to enable someone to get access to a financial service. Juvo’s focus is on the last piece: understanding qualification and giving like a whole new group of people the ability to establish qualification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kiva: Our view at Kiva is that there will always be a role for a centralized identity issuer and that in some ways is going to be the most easy way to compliantly onboard an individual into regulated financial institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FATF, the Financial Action Task Force, which is the intergovernmental body that thinks about things like MLSE, a key compliance, has issued some really interesting guidance in the last year on the use of digital identities for compliant onboarding. Yet they leave the door open for what we’re thinking about risk-based approaches to this question. They haven’t gone as far as to say official identity is not required or is not recommended for financial sector onboarding…but I do think that it’s possible technologically to prove with a high level of assurance who a person is without reliance on an official identity. I think we’re still a little ways away from having regulators fully embrace that concept but I think it’s a conversation that if we’re serious about financial inclusion, we should be having.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity &amp; Immigrant Banking 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the final session of the day, OWI was joined by Alka Gupta (Co-Founder and Board Director of GlobaliD) to discuss how growing non-citizen or new citizen populations are able to access financial services in <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/coming-to-america-immigrant-banking-in-the-u-s/">Coming to America: Immigrant Banking in the U.S</a>. The conversation identified some of the current gaps and possible solutions in providing user-friendly services to these communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GlobaliD: For context…51 percent of [U.S.] foreign-born non-citizens are either unbanked or underbanked. Of those that are banking, 80+ percent of the immigrants are with one of five financial institutions, which means about 18 percent of them are spread across 60-70 other smaller banks or credit unions, with none of them making up more than 2 percent. Why is this happening? How do we help? What does this next chapter look like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges are three-fold. Banking has historically accepted limited forms of identity. Identity more traditionally is a driver’s license and Social Security, which many immigrants may not have. So how do we open that aperture? And many have, since government-issued I.D. vary from country to country. Banks have expanded the list, whether it’s the individual taxpayer numbers, passports, consular I.D., etc.. That’s a huge area. There is also fear. There’s just a fear of even walking into the bank. So how do we provide culturally-specific guidelines? And lastly is minimizing fees or not maximizing those types of schemes. This is frankly not true just with financial services, but also with international calling and other type of infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Where do we see the solutions coming into play? What role do we see governments playing? What role do we see nongovernmental organizations playing and what role do we see private sector players playing in solving this challenge? And where do you see the most progress being made in the near-term future?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GlobaliD: I think there’s been some progress whether it’s startups or neo-banks looking to address some of the issues we’ve talked about, there are immigrant banking focused startups. So there is a cottage industry around migrant banking, migrant tech, but we need to step back and talk about the larger ecosystem. I do believe that the more meaningful improvements are going to happen, not just from a technology perspective. In fact, I might argue that this is not about the technology. This is about the silos coming down. We do see the world opening up more and more, but at the same time, sometimes we see more and more walls going up, given the times that we’re in. I think that much of the advancement is going to need to come from…cooperation and openness, open access to data and silos coming down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also think it’s about there being more user control and portability of that data and that information. Users need to control their data. Institutions need to respect the portability of data. And those that don’t know how to either keep data secure or store cetera are better off in focusing on their core competencies and allowing more of these horizontal plays. Whether it’s the identity, the chat, the calling, et cetera, to be to be frankly, you know, built within a horizontal stack that can be leveraged across whether it’s financial services or others. I think we’re at a time where we would be all well-served to consider how it is that the user is experiencing the data, the frustrations, the frictions. We would be better served really thinking about is that just neat and cool? Or if I were a user, would I actually engage? Would I trust it? I really think that’s what this next chapter is about and why I am so passionate about this space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s Next? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s always more to dive into (we recommend you <a href="http://know.oneworldidentity.com">secure your seat</a> at our next digital event now,) and we’re looking forward to seeing how the industry drives further inclusion in financial services through this data. Take a moment to <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session-library">catch up on the</a> <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session-library/">sessions from this event</a> or other KNOW Identity Digital Forums you may have missed!</p>

<p>By Kacie Harold, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the <a href="http://www.ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer Pack</a> — a toolkit designed to help tech workers spark dialogue about the future impacts of their designs, identify early warning signs, and brainstorm positive solutions. This week, we are sharing some additional, practical advice from leading experts on how to mitigate against several of the tech risk zones (or potential downsides) and ensure technology is safe, fair, and compassionate.</p><p>Matt Mitchell is a hacker and <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/people/matt-mitchell/">Tech Fellow</a> at <a href="https://fordfoundation.org/">The Ford Foundation</a>, working with the BUILD and Technology and Society teams to develop digital security strategy, technical assistance offerings, and safety and security measures for the foundation’s grantee partners. Matt has also worked as the Director of Digital Safety &amp; Privacy at Tactical Tech, and he founded CryptoHarlem, which teaches basic cryptography tools to the predominately African American community in upper Manhattan.</p><p>Matt, why should small and midsize tech companies want to address issues of surveillance and think about data privacy and security for their&nbsp;users?</p><p>I recently spoke with founders of a blockchain, cryptocurrency social media startup that values “humans first”. Privacy came up briefly in the conversation. As a small team going through their first round of funding, they are motivated to build quickly, get people to use the product, and then find a way to monetize it. I suggested they create a transparency report and a plain speak privacy policy because this would give them competitive advantage, and it speaks to the motivations of that team. When you are building a product that’s new, existing companies and competitors might not have these things, so focusing on privacy is really easy, lo-hanging fruit when it comes to feature development. You can go a long way to earning the trust of your users and build engagement when people know that using your product isn’t going to compromise their security in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Are there any common surveillance related problems companies run into when they build a new products or features?</p><p>When you’re making a product, there’s a temptation to gather as much data as possible because, in the worst case scenario, maybe you’re VC-funded and you’re losing your seed funding. The money you have to play with every month is going down and you’re not really meeting your KPIs, but you do know your users. If you reach a place where you may have to lose some staff, it can be tempting to sell user information or what you know about user behavior.</p><p>Monetizing user data usually seems like a good idea at the time. But it always turns out to be something that hurts you, because it hurts your relationship with the users. When your users can’t trust you anymore, they begin seeing you as the lowest part of what you provide. You are no longer delighting the users, and then they lose the reason why they’re there, and it becomes so easy for someone to replace&nbsp;you.</p><p>You may be approached by a company who is interested in just a small part of what you do, for instance, something related to user behavior. This is where you should say “no”. You are still empowered to say “no” at that moment. But as soon as you say “yes”, even if it’s just to sell a little bit of information, but only to trusted partners in certain conditions, that criteria starts sliding really quickly, especially if you are not the only one making decisions or you have funders or VCs you report to. Once you make it, you can’t undo it. You can’t unbuild a surveillance apparatus.</p><p>Another common problem is that teams are working on tight timelines, and it can be hard to find the time to make sure they are doing things right, and without guidance, they don’t know when they are doing something wrong. When it comes particularly to surveillance, people don’t have a good mapping of things that equal surveillance in their industry and in their products. Engineers aren’t thinking they want to add surveillance to something, they just want to build a tool. They don’t realize when the different elements of what they built and the data they are collecting can be used to monitor and harm&nbsp;users.</p><p>What can teams do to prevent surveillance issues from creeping up on&nbsp;them?</p><p>I think harm reduction on a micro-intervention level is a helpful practice because it’s just adding a few minutes into a workday that is full of loose minutes. When you’re trying to fix a broken app or a broken world it can take years, and you won’t necessarily have any wins. This is why it is important to invest those minutes and prevent these&nbsp;harms.</p><p>Everyone on the team needs to be equipped with tools and information to identify and prevent surveillance-related harms. For engineers, (quality assurance), and the debugging team, using basic checklists on a regular basis can help prevent problems and identify moments where the team should slow down and evaluate whether there may be a surveillance issue developing. Product managers and UX should create user personas that include information about how that user could be harmed, if your tool were used for surveillance.</p><p>Finally, give your team an “emergency brake” that anyone can pull anonymously, if they see an emerging harm, or something that violates the values your team or company has agreed upon. Make it clear ahead of time that if the emergency brake is pulled, the team will dedicate a sprint to fixing the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>What advice would you give tech builders who are just starting to think about surveillance?</p><p>Reading doesn’t seem like the first thing you want to do when starting a company and focused on finding funding, hiring engineers, and building a prototype. But reading doesn’t take long, and the value it saves you in protecting you from liability, enhancing your ability to compete, and building trust with your users pays itself back in dividends.</p><p>I recommend reading about Black [people] using technology, because those use cases open up a set harms that you can apply to almost everything. Two books I like are <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/dark-matters-on-the-surveillance-of-blackness/9780822359388">Dark Matters</a> by Simone Brown, an amazing book on the surveillance of Black folks, and <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/algorithms-of-oppression-how-search-engines-reinforce-racism/9781479837243">Algorithms of Oppression</a> by <a href="https://omidyar.quip.com/XKgdAsdCCxXq/Interview-with-Safiya-Noble-EE-blog-edit">Safiya Umoja Noble</a>. When you know better, you can do&nbsp;better.</p><p>You can learn more about Matt’s work and watch his talks and security training videos on <a href="https://medium.com/@geminiimatt/whoami-a513e9e4c02f">Medium</a>, or follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/geminiimatt">@geminiimatt</a>.</p>

 The market capitalization of stablecoins reached $20.62 billion, Stablecoin regulatory policy of the United&nbsp;States <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1915489812">https://bihu.com/article/1915489812</a></p><p>Original publish time: September 30,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   The market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $757 million to $20.62&nbsp;billion.  Last week, the circulation of USDT, USDC, and DAI increased by 150 million, 334 million, and 213&nbsp;million.  OCC issued the regulations on stablecoins for the first time, confirming that the Commonwealth Bank can provide custody services for legal-collateralized stablecoins.  The bank has the right to deposit reserves of certain ‘stablecoin’, which refers to stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency.  The Bank verifies at least once a day that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with&nbsp;issuers.  FinHub encourages all parties involved in the construction and sale of digital assets to contact FinHub through the official website to help them ensure that such digital assets comply with the Federal Securities Act. If appropriate, a ‘no action’ position will be considered.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(September 19, 2020 ~ September 25, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $757 million to $20.62&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past week, Tether additionally issued 150 million USDT on Ethereum.

Stablecoin Regulatory Policy of the United&nbsp;States <p>As early as June, the OCC issued a ‘pre-notification of the proposed rulemaking’, asking the public to weigh how to use cryptocurrency and other financial technology tools in the financial sector before August 3. Several banks have indicated that they may be interested in providing crypto custody and other services to customers. Dominic Venturo, the chief digital officer of the National Association of American banks, said in response that the OCC should distinguish between utility tokens, stablecoins, and Exchange platform&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Last week, the OCC issued regulations on stablecoins, confirming that the Commonwealth Bank can provide custody services for legal-collateralized stablecoins. This is the first time the OCC has issued regulations regarding stablecoins. The OCC is a federal agency responsible for overseeing the implementation of laws related to the National Bank and supervising the Federal Bank and the agencies of foreign banks. Subsequently, the SEC FinHub Staff stated that it could consider adopting a ‘no action’ position on specific digital asset activities under appropriate circumstances.</p> The OCC released regulations on stablecoins for the first&nbsp;time <p>On September 21, the OCC issued a press release and subsequent explanatory letter stating that banks have the right to deposit certain ‘stablecoins’ reserves. The stablecoin mentioned here specifically refers to stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency and does not include other stablecoins backed by commodities, cryptocurrencies, or other assets. The demand for stablecoins is increasing day by day, with multiple applications, such as large-scale transfers, which have great potential. Two technologies for realizing cryptocurrency, encryption technology and distributed ledger technology, are developing rapidly.</p><p>The National Bank has a clear authorization to accept deposits, which is also the core business of the bank. Certain stablecoin issuers may also wish to deposit the cash reserves supporting their issuance of stablecoins in the National Bank. As long as stablecoin issuers can effectively manage risks and comply with relevant laws (including the ‘Bank Secrecy Law’ and anti-money laundering laws), banks can provide services for their legitimate businesses, including cryptocurrency businesses. Therefore, banks may obtain deposits from stablecoin issuers, including stablecoin reserve deposits related to custodian wallets.</p><p>Like other deposits, stablecoin reserves are also subject to laws and regulations related to deposit insurance coverage. The stablecoin reserve account can be the deposit of a stablecoin issuer or the deposit of a single stablecoin holder. Banks and the FSA should provide accurate and appropriate disclosures on deposit insurance coverage to ensure compliance with the BSA and other regulations, including but not limited to the customer due diligence under the BSA, customer identification requirements under the Patriot Act, requirements under the Federal Securities Act, and identification of the beneficial owners of the accounts&nbsp;enabled.</p><p>Reserves related to stablecoins may bring significant liquidity risks. New banking activities should be developed and implemented under sound risk management principles, and banks should establish appropriate risk management procedures for the development of new businesses. OCC hopes that all banks manage liquidity risks at the same level as the risks they assume. The protocol between the bank and the stablecoin issuer may include restrictions or requirements for holding assets in the reserve account, and the protocol may stipulate the responsibilities of the parties. For example, the bank should sign an appropriate protocol with the issuer to ensure that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with issuers. The agreement should include a mechanism for the bank to periodically check the amount of outstanding stablecoin.</p><p>To summarize, national banks are authorized to deposit stablecoin reserves, subject to the following restrictions:</p><p>Only support stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency.<br>The Bank verifies at least once a day that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with issuers.<br>Banks should establish appropriate risk management procedures for the development of new businesses.<br>Banks must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.<br>Banks must establish appropriate control measures and conduct adequate due diligence.<br>The bank must confirm the beneficial owners of the accounts&nbsp;enabled.</p> The Statement of&nbsp;SEC <p>After the OCC issued the explanatory letter, the SEC FinHub Staff issued a statement.</p><p>According to the Federal Securities Law, whether a specific digital asset (including stablecoins) should be considered security depends on actual conditions. The nature of the asset needs to be carefully analyzed, including the right to hold the asset and how to provide and sell the&nbsp;asset.</p><p>SEC FinHub believes that as long as it meets the relevant registration, reporting, and other requirements of the Federal Securities Law, market participants may construct and sell digital assets in a way that does not constitute securities. However, the terms used to describe digital assets or financial activities involving digital assets may not be consistent with the definitions of SEC in relevant laws and regulations. FinHub encourages all parties involved in the construction and sale of digital assets to contact FinHub through the official website to help them ensure that such digital assets can comply with the Federal Securities Act. FinHub staff will always be ready to assist participants. If appropriate, a ‘no action’ position will be considered.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

 The GiD Report#128 — What the Apple App Store backlash tells us about this moment in&nbsp;time <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-127-amid-tiktok-deal-ray-dalio-explains-chinas-differences-58c5cab76639">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  The era of David v.&nbsp;Goliath  The era of moderation  Stuff happens   1. I’ll just talk about two main things this week — both of which speak to the moment that we are currently in. The first is the Apple App Store backlash. <p>It’s worth noting — it’s still pretty unclear how any of this plays out. Apple is in a strong position in terms of its loyal user base, the quality of its products and ecosystem, and also possibly in the eyes of the law (disclaimer: I am not a lawyer). It’s Apple’s App Store and Apple gets to call the&nbsp;shots.</p><p>Plus, I’ve been an iPhone user since the 5S and I don’t see myself switching anytime soon. (Not that it would make a huge difference since Google — aside from allowing you to access apps outside the Play Store, essentially follows the same type of&nbsp;model.)</p><p>And Apple has taken criticism before from disgruntled developers.</p><p>But what all of this shows is that this time, it’s different.</p>Photo: Fortune Global&nbsp;Forum<p>Whatever you want to call it — the establishment, the status quo, Big Tech monopolies — people have never been more distrustful and/or critical of the large institutions that rule over us. As one of the world’s largest multinational corporations with a market cap of ~$2 trillion, Apple easily falls into that&nbsp;camp.</p><p>That distrust has been brewing for some time, but for the most part, I’m not sure people had a real sense of belief that things could change. It’s Apple. What are you going to do about&nbsp;it?</p><p>That’s what makes this moment different — the growing sense of belief that change is suddenly possible. It’s not just about Apple and the App Store, either. You don’t have to look around very much to see that this moment applies to everything — our platforms, our politics, our society in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney certainly senses the moment. His latest coalition is a call to&nbsp;arms.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/technology/apple-google-coalition-epic-match-spotify.html">NYTimes&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>For months, complaints from tech companies against Apple’s and Google’s power have grown&nbsp;louder.</blockquote><blockquote>Spotify, the music streaming app, criticized Apple for the rules it imposed in the App Store. A founder of the software company Basecamp attacked Apple’s “highway robbery rates” on apps. And last month, Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued Apple and Google, claiming they violated antitrust rules.</blockquote><blockquote>Now these app makers are uniting in an unusual show of opposition against Apple and Google and the power they have over their app stores. On Thursday, the smaller companies said they had formed the Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit group that plans to push for changes in the app stores and “protect the app economy.” The 13 initial members include Spotify, Basecamp, Epic and Match Group, which has apps like Tinder and&nbsp;Hinge.</blockquote><blockquote>“They’ve collectively decided, ‘We’re not alone in this, and maybe what we should do is advocate on behalf of everybody,’” said Sarah Maxwell, a spokeswoman for the group. She added that the new nonprofit would be “a voice for&nbsp;many.”</blockquote><p>What the coalition is fighting&nbsp;for:</p><blockquote>At the heart of the new alliance’s effort is opposition to Apple’s and Google’s tight grip on their app stores and the fortunes of the apps in them. The two companies control virtually all of the world’s smartphones through their software and the distribution of apps via their stores. Both also charge a 30 percent fee for payments made inside apps in their&nbsp;systems.</blockquote><blockquote>App makers have increasingly taken issue with the payment rules, arguing that a 30 percent fee is a tax that hobbles their ability to compete. In some cases, they have said, they are competing with Apple’s and Google’s own apps and their unfair advantages.</blockquote><blockquote>On Thursday, the coalition published a list of 10 principles, outlined on its website, for what it said were fairer app practices. They include a more transparent process for getting apps approved and the right to communicate directly with their users. The top principle states that developers should not be forced to exclusively use the payments systems of the app store publishers.</blockquote><p>Reality check: At best, this is simply the beginning of a movement that is fundamentally a story of David v. Goliath. Despite the success of Fortnite, Apple is still 200x the size of Epic Games. And more recently, Apple’s has centered the narrative of the company’s future around “services.” Expect Tim Cook to stand his&nbsp;ground.</p><p>And the Goliaths of the world have been steadfast and reaping the rewards for some&nbsp;time.</p><p>But like I said, this time, it’s different:</p><blockquote>Scrutiny of the largest tech companies has reached a new intensity. The Department of Justice is expected to file an antitrust case against Google as soon as next week, focused on the company’s dominance in internet search. In July, Congress grilled the chief executives of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook about their practices in a high-profile antitrust hearing. And in Europe, regulators have opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple’s App Store tactics and are preparing to bring antitrust charges against Amazon for abusing its dominance in internet commerce.</blockquote><p>Grab some popcorn. Whatever happens, it’s a bit thrilling that the Davids of the world are starting to believe again,&nbsp;no?</p><p>In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://appfairness.org/">the coalition’s site here</a>, where they <a href="https://appfairness.org/our-vision/">outline their 10 principles</a>.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-opens-new-fight-with-apple-over-messaging">Facebook Opens New Fight With Apple Over Messaging</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage">Justice Dept.

The second thing we’ll highlight this week is really about the challenges of operating a platform in this current climate. Which is sort of a catch-22 seeing as the nature of our platforms have themselves deeply contributed to where we’ve ended up. Just look at Facebook. <p>And I’m not talking about the Facebook that you and I use. I’m talking about the internal Facebook that Facebook employees use.</p><p>Ina Fried:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: As political arguments on Facebook’s employee discussion boards have grown more heated and divisive, the company ordered new restrictions on the forums earlier this month, which run on Facebook’s Workplace platform.</blockquote><blockquote>Last week, the company banned employees from replacing their profile photos on the system with activist&nbsp;images.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Facebook’s difficulty managing its own employees using its own social network suggests that the company’s problems might be rooted more in the conception and design of its products than in the fiery state of today’s public discourse.</blockquote><blockquote>Catch up quick: Facebook, like most Silicon Valley companies, has long prided itself on an open culture embracing free debate, epitomized by regular staff meetings where CEO Mark Zuckerberg answers employee questions.</blockquote><p>Mark’s solution has been to create “dedicated spaces&nbsp;… for discussing charged topics, with clear rules and strong moderation.”</p><p>Which makes you wonder — how will that make Facebook think about actual Facebook? The difference, of course, is that divisive engagement internally is bad because it makes the company dysfunctional. But divisive engagement on Facebook proper, despite contributing to a more dysfunctional society, is super aligned with their core ad-based business&nbsp;model.</p><p>Because what we’re learning — and frankly, what people have intuitively known for some time — is that the engagement that these platforms promote is probably not that&nbsp;great:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: What’s bugging so many Facebook workers is the same problem some of Facebook’s 3 billion users identified a long time&nbsp;ago.</blockquote>  By shunting so many different dimensions of our online communications onto the same platform — from school connections to family members and workplace acquaintances to people with shared interests — Facebook makes it impossible to keep different facets of our lives from overlapping.  <blockquote>The scholar Danah Boyd popularized the phrase “context collapse” to describe the tendency of social networks to flatten our&nbsp;lives.</blockquote>  Now that dynamic is pushing Facebook, which has staked out a content moderation policy that treads lightly on limiting political speech in public, to curtail the political speech of its own employees.  <blockquote>The catch: Facebook’s internal moderators will now have to figure out how to draw a clean line between “charged topics” and everything else.</blockquote><blockquote>Everything Facebook touches today has a political dimension, and everything from user interface design to machine-learning code to marketing materials has social and political dimensions that can trigger “charged” exchanges.</blockquote><p>I’m not going to put too much blame on Facebook for this one. They’re figuring things out along with the rest of us. But it certainly raises a bunch of important questions as we look to build the&nbsp;future.</p><p>And in an age when every company is also a messaging company (see: Zoom, below), these are questions that every platform will need to ask itself (and in a way, they’ll be able to come at it from a different perspective since companies like Zoom and Discord aren’t built on ad-based business&nbsp;models.)</p><p>Because how do we want to shape the incentives that define our communities such that we can constructively evolve as a&nbsp;society?</p><p>In any case, the road ahead won’t be easy or straightforward.</p><p>Certainly <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-13a2568e-e823-475a-88b8-eb370237d273.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">not for Facebook</a>:</p><blockquote>A group of high-profile Facebook critics on Friday announced the launch of what they are calling the “Real Facebook Oversight Board.” As Sara Fischer reports, it’s an effort that aims to counter an independent board established by Facebook last year to oversee its decisions on content moderation.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: The opposing effort represents how political the fight between Facebook and its critics has become in the lead-up to the presidential election.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: The group includes leaders from the Stop Hate for Profit boycott, like Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, and Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, as well as prominent Facebook critics like Roger McNamee and some journalists and&nbsp;pundits.</blockquote><p>So yeah, tomorrow’s presidential debate will be interesting.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/zoom-invests-in-big-messaging-upgrade-in-challenge-to-slack">Zoom Invests in Big Messaging Upgrade in Challenge to&nbsp;Slack</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/opinion/2020-election-security-tech.html">America’s Tech Billionaires Could Help Protect the Election.

<p>Even before 2020, digital transformation initiatives were monopolizing the attention of most enterprises. Lines of business were attempting to outmaneuver the competition with experiences that would win customer loyalty and steal market share. IT departments were focusing on access and data security and technical enablement of the initiatives. And compliance departments were striving to ensure adherence to GDPR, CCPA and other regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then earlier this year the pandemic appeared. Suddenly, everyone was working from home and any customers still physically interacting with brands shifted to 100% digital—or very close to it. Organizations with five-year digital transformation plans have been forced to get their digital infrastructure in order much faster than previously anticipated.</p>

Due to the pandemic, organizations were forced to rapidly scale up their remote working facilities, secure employee-owned devices (Bring Your Own Devices (BYODs) , and maintain a secure environment for enterprise and customer identities . However, when it comes to their identity architecture, the picture is typically fragmented. They may have a general Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform from one company, a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution from another, and some other pieces of IAM deployed, but still face gaps.

   Access management and access governance in many companies are still largely based on traditional authorization concepts. Thus defining and thinking access management is often rooted in a rather one-dimensional paradigm. Martin and Matthias talk about access policies as a common language for defining and maintaining rules for access,&nbsp;independent of the actual implementation of access control.

September 23, 2020, <a href="https://www.fintechaustralia.org.au/fintech-australia-is-proud-to-announce-the-2020-finnies-finalists/">FinTech Australia announced the finalists</a> for this year’s Finnies. The Finnies recognise and reward the Australian FinTech community by honouring innovation, growth and collaboration.




 




For <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a>, collaboration is at the heart of everything we do. We’re humbled (and a little excited) to be a finalist in the “Excellence in Industry Collaborations &amp; Partnerships” category.




 




Our submission was based on our partnerships in Belgium with <a href="https://www.kbc.be/particulieren/nl.html">KBC Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.kbcbrussels.be/retail/en/information/bank-with-kbc-brussels.html?s_kwcid=AL!10117!3!184845854352!e!!g!!kbc%20brussels&amp;TYPE=ga&amp;CID=pa_crs_AO_na_kbc-brussels_44591477710&amp;PLA=na_na_adw_na_na_brand&amp;CRE=184845854352_na_na_na&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9bLXlteE7AIVD1dgCh3y8gyqEAAYASAAEgLC8PD_BwE">KBC Brussels</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.be/particuliers/fr.html">CBC Bank</a>. As an Australian FinTech, we’re thrilled to have&nbsp;forged this partnership along with expanding our operations into Belgium and establishing a team on the ground.




 




KBC was recently voted the most valuable brand in Belgium for the 5th consecutive time, along with also being voted the best Digital Bank for 2019. Known for digital innovation, KBC has created an eco-system of value added services for customers, all available from within their mobile banking app.<br><br>In December 2019, three of KBC’s retail bank brands added the <a href="https://www.kbc.be/particulieren/nl/product/betalen/zelf-bankieren/met-je-smartphone/mobile/digitale-kluis.html">“Digital Safe powered by Meeco”</a>. A secure data enclave that enables customers to capture, store and share personal data and documents. Available in four languages (Dutch, French, German and English) and leading the way in customer data privacy and personal data mobility.




 




Despite the global challenges of 2020, our engineering teams in Australia and Belgium have been focussed on making Meeco’s technology available to more partners. <a href="https://dev.meeco.me">Our APIs and SDKs</a> will soon be available in Australia, to support the Consumer Data Right, in the same way we have been helping our European partners with GDPR and Open Banking.




 




We would also love to give a shout out to our newest partners developing amazing application powered by Meeco. <br><br>Starting with <a href="https://miks-it.com">mIKs-it</a> “The safe multimedia app for kids”. mIKs-it is a protected space for kids to experience play and joy through photos, videos and audio. Enabling kids and their trusted grown-ups to safely connect to daily life always with complete privacy.  mIKs-it is being developed in <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/meeco-announces-kidtech-partnership-with-heder-to-co-develop-safe-media-platform-for-kids/?_thumbnail_id=2975">partnership with Heder VZW</a> in Belgium, and will launch in December 2020.




 




Closer to home, Meeco is privileged to have been selected by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pam-moorhouse-8a6aa516/">Pam Moorhouse</a>, founder and CEO to provide the privacy, security and consent platform for <a href="https://mylifecapsule.com.au">My Life Capsule</a>. My Life Capsule empowers family connection &amp; organisation across multiple generations, relieving day-to-day and time-critical administration. It helps families capture and share memories, important information and data assisting with the emotional and logistical requirements at every stage of life.




 




The Finnies category winners will be announced at the virtual ceremony on Wednesday 28 October (AEST).  Also, <a href="https://www.stoneandchalk.com.au">Stone &amp; Chalk</a> in Sydney, will be hosting a special <a href="https://events.humanitix.com/stone-and-chalk-and-fintech-australia-presents-finnies-2020">in-person event on the night</a>.




 





<blockquote>“We are thrilled with the&nbsp;quality of applications and the finalists, which are a testament of the growth, and strength of the fintech ecosystem.&nbsp;We are excited to celebrate the hard-fought achievements of the ecosystem at this year’s Finnies”&nbsp;<p></p>Rebecca Schot-Guppy, CEO, FinTech Australia</blockquote>




This will be the first virtual Finnies event, starting at 18:00 AEST on October 28. People will be able to watch from home, which means our team in Belgium can also join in the celebrations. 




 




From all of us at Meeco, huge congratulations to all the wonderful finalists. <br>




 




It’s an honour to be counted in such great company, thank you!

					 <p>Digital identity has advanced over time, most recently culminating in self-sovereign identity (SSI). In this Trinsic Basics post, we are going to briefly cover the different models of digital identity and how SSI is the next step in the digital identity evolution. The content in this post is inspired by a <a href="https://medium.com/evernym/the-three-models-of-digital-identity-relationships-ca0727cb5186">blog post</a> written by digital identity expert Timothy Ruff in 2018.</p>

					 <p>The first model of digital identity is the siloed model, and its name describes exactly how it works. In the siloed approach, in order to interact with another company or institution digitally, you must open an account, typically with a username and password. Through this process, the company becomes your identity provider. Over time, you’ll end up managing hundreds of accounts from hundreds of identity providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your identity provider stores your username and password and other personal data in large data silos. In other words, your personal data is stored with all of the other customers’ personal data in one central location controlled by the company.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The siloed model is broken because it is:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Centralized. You are not in control of your digital identity—the company or institution is. If they choose to block your account or if they shut their doors, your account, along with all of your data, would be gone.  Not secure. Data silos are gold mines for hackers since they essentially only have to crack one silo to gain access to the personal data of a lot of people. Besides this, account security usually relies on a username and password, and research shows that people do not typically create secure passwords and often use the same username and password for many of their accounts.  Poor user experience: How many times have you forgotten your password and had to recreate it? Having so many different accounts with (supposedly) unique usernames and passwords has led to a frustrating customer experience when trying to access services digitally.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Model #2: Federated identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Digital identity advocates saw the flaws of siloed identity and sought to create a more user-centric approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of every company needing to be its own identity provider, anyone could be an identity provider! You could, theoretically, be your own identity provider! But ultimately, this approach to “federated identity” was taken over by big tech companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although we may not be familiar with the term, we are all very familiar with how federated identity works. The most common federated identity example is the “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook.” With federated identity, large tech monoliths act as middlemen between you and the company you are interacting with digitally. Instead of the company managing your identity data, the middlemen do.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Although the federated identity model improves the user experience, it too suffers from some problems:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Reliance: In this model, technology monoliths provide us a digital existence. Instead of being independent and in control, we subject ourselves to the whims of the middleman. This has led to anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior that is problematic.  Universality: Logging in with Facebook might work for buying shoes or signing up for a newsletter. But business tools, regulated industries (financial, healthcare, government), and privacy-focused industries will never accept your personal social media account as authentication because it has almost no assurance—anyone can create multiple Google accounts with ease.  Surveillance: When you login with Facebook, Google, or some other service, you give that middleman more data points they can use to track and spy on you so that they can increase their revenue. Interests are fundamentally not aligned between people and the middleman.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Model #3: Self-sovereign identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Various approaches have been tried over the years to put individuals in more control of their identity, but they’ve struggled to get adopted. Finally, self-sovereign identity appears to be the solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Various technical innovations including blockchain, <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-digital-wallets/">digital wallets</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">DIDs</a>, and more gave rise to a new, decentralized identity that not only improves the user experience but also the security of the internet. SSI can be summed up as a movement that claims digital identity should be just as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>With SSI, you’re your own identity provider because, as an individual, you have a human identity! Nobody gave you your real-world identity, so likewise, you don’t need someone to give you a digital one. Instead, you control the information that makes up your identity information as well with whom you share that information with. For the first time ever online, SSI makes it so that you interact as a “peer” with other people, organizations, and more.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Trinsic is the easiest way to implement SSI 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>At Trinsic, we are trying to make this third model of digital identity a reality. Our company’s mission is to make the world and its services more accessible by making self-sovereign identity more accessible. We’ve done that by creating the world’s most advanced SSI platform.
