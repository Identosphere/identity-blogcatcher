   Software as a service (SaaS) applications have become a boon for enterprises looking to maximize network agility while minimizing costs. 
 The post Maximizing SaaS application analytics value with AI appeared first on IBM Blog.

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software as a service</a> (SaaS) applications have become a boon for enterprises looking to maximize network agility while minimizing costs. They offer app developers on-demand scalability and faster time-to-benefit for new features and software updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SaaS takes advantage of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> infrastructure and economies of scale to provide clients a more streamlined approach to adopting, using and paying for software.</p>



<p>However, SaaS architectures can easily overwhelm DevOps teams with data aggregation, sorting and analysis tasks. Given the <a href="https://ascendixtech.com/number-saas-companies-statistics/">volume of SaaS apps on the market</a> (more than 30,000 SaaS developers were operating in 2023) and the <a href="https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/saas-statistics/#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20(53%25),use%20a%20staggering%20473%20apps.">volume of data a single app can generate</a> (with each enterprise businesses using roughly 470 SaaS apps), SaaS leaves businesses with loads of structured and unstructured data to parse.</p>



<p>That’s why today’s application analytics platforms rely on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML) technology to sift through big data, provide valuable business insights and deliver superior data observability.</p>



 What is application analytics? 



<p>Broadly speaking, application analytics refers to the process of collecting application data and performing real-time analysis of SaaS, mobile, desktop and web application performance and usage data.</p>



<p>App analytics include:</p>



 
 App usage analytics, which show app usage patterns (such as daily and monthly active users, most- and least-used features and geographical distribution of downloads). 
 



 
 App performance analytics, which show how apps are performing across the network (with metrics such as response times and failure rates) and identify the cause and location of app, server or network problems. 
 



 
 App cost and revenue analytics, which track app revenue—such as annual recurring revenue and customer lifetime value (the total profit a business can expect to make from a single customer for the duration the business relationship)—and expenditures such as customer acquisition cost (the costs associated with acquiring a new customer). 
 



<p>Using sophisticated data visualization tools, many of which are powered by AI, app analytics services empower businesses to better understand <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/it-operations">IT operations</a>, helping teams make smarter decisions, faster.</p>



 AI in SaaS analytics 



<p>Most industries have had to reckon with AI proliferation and AI-driven business practices to some extent.</p>



<p>Roughly 42% of enterprise-scale organizations (more than 1,000 employees) have used AI for business purposes, with nearly 60% of enterprises already using AI to <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters">accelerate tech investment</a>. And by 2026, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-10-11-gartner-says-more-than-80-percent-of-enterprises-will-have-used-generative-ai-apis-or-deployed-generative-ai-enabled-applications-by-2026">more than 80% of companies</a> will have deployed <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai"></a>AI) <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">)</a>AI-enabled apps in their IT environments (up from only 5% in 2023).</p>



<p>SaaS app development and management is no different.</p>



<p>SaaS offers businesses cloud-native app capabilities, but AI and ML turn the data generated by SaaS apps into actionable insights. Modern SaaS analytics solutions can seamlessly integrate with AI models to predict user behavior and automate data sorting and analysis; and ML algorithms enable SaaS apps to learn and improve over time.</p>



<p>Using comprehensive, AI-driven SaaS analytics, businesses can make data-driven decisions about feature enhancements, UI/UX improvements and marketing strategies to maximize user engagement and meet—or exceed—business goals.&nbsp;</p>



 SaaS app analytics use cases 



<p>While effective for some organizations, traditional SaaS data analysis methods (such as relying solely on human data analysts to aggregate data points) sometimes fall short in handling the massive quantities of data SaaS apps produce. They may also struggle to fully leverage the predictive capabilities of app analytics.</p>



<p>The introduction of AI and ML technologies, however, can provide more nuanced observability and more effective decision automation. AI- and ML-generated SaaS analytics enhance:</p>



 1. Data insights and reporting 



 
 
  



<p>Application analytics help businesses monitor key performance indicators (KPIs)—such as error rates, response time, resource utilization, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-retention">user retention</a> and dependency rates, among other key metrics—to identify performance issues and bottlenecks and create a smoother user experience. AI and ML algorithms enhance these features by processing unique app data more efficiently.</p>



<p>AI technologies can also reveal and visualize data patterns to help with feature development.</p>



<p>If, for instance, a development team wants to understand which app features most significantly impact retention, it might use AI-driven <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a> (NLP) to analyze unstructured data. NLP protocols will auto-categorize user-generated content (such as customer reviews and support tickets), summarize the data and offer insights into the features that keep customers returning to the app. AI can even use NLP to suggest new tests, algorithms, lines of code or entirely new app functions to increase retention.</p>



<p>With AI and ML algorithms, SaaS developers also get granular <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> into app analytics. AI-powered analytics programs can create real-time, fully customizable dashboards that provide up-to-the-minute insights into KPIs. And most machine learning tools will automatically generate summaries of complex data, making it easier for executives and other decision-makers to understand reports without needing to review the raw data themselves.</p>



 2. Predictive analytics. 



<p><a></a><a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-analytics">Predictive analytics</a> forecast future events based on historical data; AI and ML models—such as <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/linear-regression">regression analysis</a>, <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a> and <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decision-trees">decision trees</a>—enhance the accuracy of these predictions. An e-commerce app, for example, can predict which products will be popular during the holidays by analyzing historical purchase data from previous holiday seasons.</p>



<p>Most SaaS analytics tools—including Google Analytics, Microsoft Azure and IBM® Instana®—offer predictive analytics features that enable developers to anticipate both market and user behavior trends &nbsp;and shift their business strategy accordingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Predictive analytics are equally valuable for user insights.</p>



<p>AI and ML features enable SaaS analytics software to run complex analyses of user interactions within the app (click patterns, navigation paths, feature usage and session duration, among other metrics), which ultimately helps teams anticipate user behavior.</p>



<p>For instance, if a company wants to implement churn prediction protocols to identify at-risk users, they can use AI functions to analyze activity reduction and negative feedback patterns, two user engagement metrics that often precede churn. After the program identifies at-risk users, machine learning algorithms can suggest personalized interventions to re-engage them (a subscription service might offer discounted or exclusive content to users showing signs of disengagement).</p>



<p>Diving deeper into user behavior data also helps businesses proactively identify app usability issues. And during unexpected disruptions (such as those caused by a natural disaster), AI and SaaS analytics provide real-time data visibility that keeps businesses running—or even improving—in challenging times.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Personalization and user experience optimization. 



<p>Machine learning technologies are often integral to providing a personalized customer experience in SaaS applications.</p>



<p>Using customer preferences (preferred themes, layouts and functions), historical trends and user interaction data, ML models in SaaS can dynamically tailor the content that users see based on real-time data. In other words, AI-powered SaaS apps can automatically implement adaptive interface design to keep users engaged with personalized recommendations and content experiences.</p>



<p>News apps, for instance, can highlight articles similar to the ones a user has previously read and liked. An online learning platform can recommend courses or onboarding steps based on a user’s learning history and preferences. And notification systems can send targeted messages to each user at the time they’re likeliest to engage, making the overall experience more relevant and enjoyable.</p>



<p>At the application level, AI can analyze user journey data to understand the typical navigation paths users take through the app and streamline navigation for the entire user base.</p>



 4. Conversion rate optimization and marketing. 



<p>AI analytics tools offer businesses the opportunity to optimize conversion rates, whether through form submissions, purchases, sign-ups or subscriptions.</p>



<p>AI-based analytics programs can automate funnel analyses (which identify where in the conversion funnel users drop off), A/B tests (where developers test multiple design elements, features or conversion paths to see which performs better) and call-to-action button optimization to increase conversions.</p>



<p>Data insights from AI and ML also help improve product marketing and increase overall app profitability, both vital components to maintaining SaaS applications.</p>



<p>Companies can use AI to automate tedious marketing tasks (such as lead generation and ad targeting), maximizing both advertising ROI and conversation rates. And with ML features, developers can track user activity to more accurately segment and sell products to the user base (with conversion incentives, for instance).&nbsp;</p>



 5. Pricing optimization. 



<p>Managing IT infrastructure can be an expensive undertaking, especially for an enterprise running a large network of cloud-native applications. AI and ML features help <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-cost-management">minimize cloud expenditures (and cloud waste)</a> by automating SaaS process responsibilities and streamlining workflows.</p>



<p>Using AI-generated predictive analytics and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/cloud-spend-management/">real-time financial observability tools</a>, teams can anticipate resource usage fluctuations and allocate network resources accordingly. SaaS analytics also enable decision-makers to identify underutilized or problematic assets, preventing over- and under-spending and freeing up capital for app innovations and improvements.</p>

				  Add additional features to existing credential systems while preserving their original functionality with Indicio Proven.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The emerging age of digital credentials will transform how we interact digitally, prove identity, and share data. The benefits will be reduced fraud and friction, increased data privacy and security, and the ability to create seamless processes based on data that can be instantly verified and acted on.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of credentials for different needs: some offer only basic authorization; others can manage the kind of data sharing and verification that are essential for business. The key is to be able to interoperate between the two, where a credential with limited features can be given a wrapper that preserves its original function while providing the advanced features of other credential types.</p>
<p>Enter Indicio Proven’s newest feature: a credential bridge. It’s a simple way to bridge the gap between limited and more advanced credential features and allow participation in multiple credential ecosystems.</p>
<p>For example, the Microsoft Entra Verified Identity Platform has basic features but is widely available. It only supports one credential type (JSON Web Token VC), and one DID method (DID: web); it doesn’t support OpenID4VCI (essential to interoperate with European Union’s preferred digital identity protocol), has limited digital wallet support (Microsoft Authenticator), limited governance capability, and doesn’t contain the privacy-preserving features of other verifiable credential types.</p>
<p>These features may not matter to some users, but, increasingly, we see enterprise and public sector organizations around the world opting for more expansive features to meet business, customer, and citizen needs. Why shut yourself out of these ecosystems?</p>
<p>Using Indicio Proven as your credential bridge, you don’t have to limit your options because it’s not a case of one or the other. Now, you can wrap an Entra identity in different credential formats, preserve the underlying capacity to verify it as an Entra identity, and take advantage of Indicio’s:</p>
 
 Support for additional DID methods 
 Selective disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, and predicate proofs to share data in privacy-preserving ways. 
 Support for additional OIDC specs for interoperability with the EU. 
 Support for additional communication protocols such as DIDComm, which opens up the capacity of direct, secure communication between DID holders. 
 Enable use of peer DIDs for subjects, which improves security 
 Convert to additional credential types such AnonCreds, SD-JWT, BBS+, mDoc/mDL. 
 
<p>The point is — don’t get locked into a single path when the technology is advancing rapidly. It is highly unlikely that there will ever be a single credential format or protocol that does everything. So why not be able to use them all?</p>

<p>An explosion in new financial services experiences, powered by fintech apps for consumers and small businesses, has propelled the rise of open banking technology in the U.S. and around the world. Every player in the consumer finance arena must now rethink what is possible when consumers and small businesses have full control of their financial lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) is embracing this moment of innovation with the long-awaited Dodd-Frank section 1033 open banking rule, which will accelerate the adoption of open banking technologies and protect consumer interests as we move further into the digital future. This proposed rule is set to be finalized in the 2nd half of 2024. With decades of leadership in data responsibility, Mastercard’s principles align with the tenets of CFPB rulemaking and our role is to protect this data.</p>



<p>Mastercard has created this primer to demystify the provisions of CFPB section 1033 and explain how banks, fintechs and other holders of consumer financial data will be affected by the proposed rule. Read on to discover what CFPB rulemaking means for you — and how Mastercard equips customers to thrive in this new landscape.&nbsp;</p>

 What is the CFPB?&nbsp; 



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency of the United States federal government, established in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis to protect consumers’ interests in financial markets and promote long-term stability in the broader economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, better known as Dodd-Frank, to provide a single point of accountability for protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive financial practices and to taking action against companies that break the law.&nbsp;<br></p>



 What does the Dodd-Frank Act Section 1033 say about consumers’ rights to access financial data?&nbsp; 



<p>Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a consumers’ right to access financial data associated with the financial products and services they use, such as credit cards, deposits and savings accounts.&nbsp; This data includes account details, transactions, balances, and more (see “<a>What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?</a>” below), and subject to rules put forward by the CFPB.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



 What is the CFPB’s role in section 1033 rulemaking?&nbsp; 



<p>Section 1033 gives the CFPB authority to issue rules governing personal financial data rights.&nbsp; The CFPB has been working toward implementing this rulemaking since 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some key milestones include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 publishing a set of consumer protection principles (2017)&nbsp; 



 holding a symposium on consumer access to financial records (2020)&nbsp; 



 releasing detailed documentation of rulemaking proposals and alternatives under consideration (2022)&nbsp; 



 convening a Small Business Review Panel and issuing a report of its findings (2023)&nbsp; 
 



<p>In October 2023, the bureau released its proposed rule and opened a period of public comment through December 29, 2023. Since then, the CFPB has been working to finalize the written regulations. Once it takes effect, the proposed rule will serve as implementation of Dodd-Frank section 1033.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



 What parties are impacted by the CFPB section 1033?&nbsp; 



 
 Data providers – Financial institutions and&nbsp;some payment facilitators&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Third party data recipients – Fintechs and financial institutions acting on consumers’ behalf as data recipients and data aggregators acting on their behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Qualified industry standard-setting bodies – CFPB-recognized issuers of fair, open, and inclusive industry standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 
 



 How does the proposed rulemaking impact personal financial data rights?&nbsp; 



<p>Broadly speaking, the CFPB open banking rule is a framework of regulations and industry standards that provides consumers with ownership and rights to control their financial data; enhanced consumer protections; and consistency in how data can be accessed and used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB proposal will require financial institutions and some payment facilitators to make financial data available to consumers and authorized third-party data recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposed rule also outlines:&nbsp;</p>



 
 obligations and limitations for how companies must collect, use and store consumer data.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 requires banks to share data in a standardized format via safe and secure application programming interfaces (APIs)&nbsp; 



 seeks to empower consumers with their finanancial data&nbsp; 



 enable better access to financial products&nbsp; 



 and jump start competition between banks of all sizes, fintechs and other digital players&nbsp;<br> 
 



 What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?&nbsp; 



 
 Transaction information, including amounts, dates, payees, historical data, and fees.&nbsp; 



 Account balances&nbsp; 



 Account and routing numbers, both tokenized and non-tokenized&nbsp; 



 Terms and conditions, including fee schedules, rates, rewards terms and overdraft coverage&nbsp; 



 Information on upcoming bills, such as minimum payment amounts 



 Basic account verification information, including names, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.&nbsp;<br> 
 



 When does the open banking regulation take effect?&nbsp; 



<p>While the CFPB hasn’t given an exact date, it has indicated that it will finalize the proposed rule towards the end of 2024, with a tiered compliance timeline to follow, which makes it even more important that financial service providers are prepared for the change.&nbsp;</p>



 
 First, the CFPB must finalize the rulemaking.&nbsp;
 
 While the bureau hasn’t given an exact date, CFPB section 1033 is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2024, most likely in the fall.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Third Parties must comply within 60 days.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 For consumer-authorized third parties, the CFPB proposed rule becomes effective 60 days from the date of the final rulemaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 The proposed timeline for complying with the CFPB rule varies based on the size of the financial institution. Banks and other institutions that hold deposits will have between six months and four years to comply, based on their assets. Non-deposit institutions will have six or 12 months, depending on annual revenue. The CFPB has detailed this tiered approach as follows:&nbsp;

 <br>How can Mastercard help?&nbsp; 



<p>At Mastercard, we believe that consumers own their financial data; they should be in control of how and by whom it is used and should benefit from its use. Mastercard’s role is to protect this data and help data providers do the same. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB proposed rule calls for secure permissioned data-sharing across developer interfaces, or APIs. Navigating this compliance is going to be complex as financial institutions must decide to build APIs on their legacy infrastructure or outsource. As well as other areas including but not limited to consent management, info security, and third-party risk management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Bug bounty programs are sometimes viewed with a negative connotation for a variety of reasons. This post aims to overcome implementation obstacles by debunking those misconceptions, and providing recommendations for organizations as they embark on the bug bounty journey.</p> 
 What Is a Bug Bounty Program?  
<p>First a quick definition. A bug bounty program is a security scheme offered by many websites, organizations, and software developers where individuals are paid to find security vulnerabilities. These programs incentivize independent security researchers and ethical hackers to discover and report potential flaws, making the technology more secure and reducing breach risk. So why don’t more companies have them?&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Objections to Bug Bounty Programs  
<p>I’ve been involved in a few companies where bug bounty programs were generally perceived negatively. Colleagues gave a number of reasons for not implementing a bug bounty program. These included:</p> 
  
  Too expensive  
  Takes several months before seeing results  
  It’s hard to manage and is extremely time-consuming  
  Researchers can be hostile  
  Quality of findings can be inadequate  
  
<p>However, I’ve been fully managing a bug bounty program for more than two years now and I can attest that these concerns are essentially baseless.&nbsp;</p> 
 Financial Concerns  
<p>The financial concern is misplaced since it’s significantly cheaper to find a critical vulnerability by doing a routine penetration test, or through a controlled bug bounty program, than if one of your customers discovers that vulnerability and demands a fix as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The consequences of customers and prospects finding security issues in an application can range from reduced confidence in your product, to actually losing an opportunity because the prospect considers the application insecure. This is far more expensive than the average bug bounty program. Not to mention the financial consequences of an actual security breach caused by a vulnerability.</p> 
 Results Timeline&nbsp;  
<p>Results can be obtained almost instantly. The researchers are usually highly motivated and working across multiple different time zones. Moreover, unlike penetration testing programs, which usually take place at specific points in time, bug bounty researchers test continuously. This allows you to constantly have an up-to-date understanding of your risk.</p> 
 Management and Scope  
<p>Bug bounty partner/platforms aid significantly when it comes to program management.</p> 
<p>Organizations hesitant to implement a bug bounty program can start by setting a private program that provides access to only a limited number of researchers. This gives organizations more control over the program and limits the number of reports they receive. A private program helps address concerns both about an overwhelming influx of reports and the cost of bug bounty rewards.</p> 
<p>Organizations can include production assets in the scope of their programs by disallowing certain types of testing. Common exclusions include denial of service attacks, social engineering, self-inflicting vulnerabilities, etc.</p> 
 Submissions Management  
<p>This is a more extensive topic that we will be covering in a future post, along with guidance on managing inadequate findings and researchers.</p> 
 Suggestions To Get Started  
 Preparing the Test Environment  
<p>For smaller organizations, it is usually easier to run a bug bounty program when the company only has one main core product or a limited number of offers. For larger companies that have hundreds of applications and thousands of endpoints, providing full access for testers can become a challenge.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ideally, a new test environment that researchers can freely use to run all the needed tests will be provided. If this is not possible, most companies already have a testing environment without any real data, which can be used for providing access to researchers.</p> 
 Including Production Assets  
<p>It is recommended to include all production assets in scope for a bug bounty program, otherwise companies will likely miss vulnerabilities that are only applicable to production applications and configurations. This doesn’t necessarily mean encouraging load testing in production, rather, if somebody finds an issue in production, it must be rewarded.</p> 
<p>For example, wouldn't you like to know if a person with limited resources and an open source web scanner were able to bring down an entire production environment? That’s certainly something I’d like to fix if it happened.</p> 
<p>HYPR has made significant performance improvements by analyzing the scan patterns that researchers performed in production assets. Furthermore, even if these assets are not included under the scope, there’s usually nothing stopping actors on the internet from scanning assets that require authentication.</p> 
 Final Recommendations  
  
  Use an existing platform: Implementing a bug bounty program can be challenging and there are many recommended bug bounty platforms that can help your organization get started in no time, and they handle all the communications, accounts, payouts (especially international payments), etc.&nbsp;  
  Start with a private program: A private program will limit the amount of researchers and initial time invested.  
  Implement guardrails: If there are some assets/domains/vulnerabilities that shouldn’t be included, these can be marked as out of scope.  
  Define payouts: Bounties are a great way to motivate researchers to participate in a program. Consider increasing the bounties whenever possible — use other bug bounty participating companies in your space for guidance.  
  Include all assets in scope: Production-like environments can be added instead of production if there are concerns.

<p>Healthcare technology is rapidly evolving and digital healthcare is now the norm. In order to deliver healthcare online, payer and provider organizations need the ability to securely and seamlessly share member and patient data across their various digital healthcare systems. Interoperability and modern identity and access management (IAM) are what make this happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s (ONC) 21st Century Cures Act Final Rule was enacted. A significant component of the ONC’s Cures Act is its focus on interoperability. Electronic Medical Record (EMR)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complying with the Cures Act for interoperability requires the use of two standards:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>&nbsp;SMART Health IT’s Substitutable Medical Applications Reusable Technologies (SMART) standard</p>
 
 <p>HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard,&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, these two standards are what’s known as SMART on FHIR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ONC’s Rule and SMART on FHIR the stage is set for a more connected, efficient, and patient-centric healthcare system where clinical data can be more readily shared and accessed by healthcare providers, payers, consumers, and app developers alike.​</p>

<p>The average lost business cost following a data breach was USD 1.3 million in 2023, according to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/E3G5JMBP">IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach</a> report. With the rapid emergence of real-time payments, any downtime in payments connectivity can be a significant threat. This downtime can harm a business’s reputation, as well as the global financial ecosystem.</p>



<p>For this reason, it’s paramount that financial enterprises support their resiliency needs by adopting a robust infrastructure that is integrated across multiple environments, including the cloud, on prem and at the edge.</p>



 Resiliency helps financial institutions build customer and regulator confidence 



<p>Retaining customers is crucial to any business strategy, and maintaining customer trust is key to a financial institution’s success. We believe enterprises that prioritize resilience demonstrate their commitment to providing their consumers with a seamless experience in the event of disruption.</p>



<p>In addition to maintaining customer trust, financial enterprises must maintain regulator trust as well. Regulations around the world, such as the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-operational-resilience-act">Digital Operational Resilience Act</a> (DORA), continue to grow. DORA is a European Union regulation that aims to establish technical standards that financial entities and their critical third-party technology service providers must implement in their ICT systems by 17 January 2025.</p>



<p>DORA requires&nbsp;financial institutions to&nbsp;define the business recovery process, service levels and recovery times&nbsp;that are acceptable for their business across processes, including payments. Traditionally, this has caused covered institutions to evaluate their cybersecurity protection measures.</p>



<p>To meet customer and regulator demands, it is critical that financial institutions are proactive and strategic about creating a cohesive strategy to modernize their payments infrastructure with resiliency and compliance at the forefront.</p>



 How IBM helps clients address resiliency in payments 



<p>As the need for operational resilience grows, enterprises increasingly adopt hybrid cloud strategies to store their data across multiple environments including the cloud, on prem and at the edge. By developing a workload placement strategy based on the uniqueness of a financial entity’s business processes and applications, they can optimize the output of these applications to enable the continuation of services 24/7.</p>



<p><a>IBM Cloud</a>®&nbsp;remains committed to providing our clients with an enterprise-grade cloud platform that can help them address resiliency, performance, security and compliance obligations. IBM Cloud also supports mission-critical workloads and addresses evolving regulations around the globe.</p>



<p>To accelerate cloud adoption in financial services, we built <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/financial-services">IBM Cloud for Financial Services</a>®, informed by the industry and for the industry. With security controls built into the platform, we aim to help financial entities minimize risk as they maintain and demonstrate their compliance with their regulators.</p>



<p>With approximately 500 industry practitioners across the globe, the expertise of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/payments?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700077912690888&amp;p5=e&amp;p9=58700008538420112&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwl4yyBhAgEiwADSEjeM-7exVj8fuF7QP6UhitENdPBVu5DpRjBGV31xKDI-VxPdQyimH5aBoC4f0QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM Payments Center</a>® provides clients with guidance on their end-to-end payments’ modernization journey. Also, clients can use payments as a service, including checks as a service, which can help give them access to the benefits of a managed, secured cloud-based platform that can scale up and down to meet changing electronic payment and check volumes.</p>



<p>IBM’s swift connectivity capabilities on IBM Cloud for Financial Services enable resiliency and use IBM Cloud multizone regions to help keep data secured and enable business continuity in case of advanced ransomware or cyberattacks.</p>



<p>IBM® can help you navigate the highly interconnected payments ecosystem and build resiliency. Partner with us to reduce downtime, protect your reputation and maintain the trust of your customers and regulators.</p>

<p>This blog has been written as an explainer to support the wider <a href="https://lee.darkmatterlabs.org/">Life-Ennobling Economics conversation</a>. It is focused on the LEE aspiration of moving beyond colonising capital and explores how this could be applied to financing a FreeHouse. The work is part of a collaborative initiative between Dark Matter’s Next Economics Lab and Radicle Civics&nbsp;Arc.</p><p>In our work at Dark Matter Labs we talk a lot about the need to respect and steward the shared commons. Whilst a Commons framing is frequently associated with governing communal resources such as grazing land and fishing stocks, it can also be applied to less tangible value flows. Real estate prices are an interesting example. Driven by diverse contributions, from local businesses and schools to parks and improved transport links, the shared value generated is largely captured by privately owned assets. Put another way, public investment is driving private wealth. A logical intervention is to bring land and buildings into common stewardship, rendering embedded dynamics such as price speculation and extractive rent obsolete.</p><blockquote>So far so good but there is a giant elephant in the room: how can we bring a house or a piece of land into common ownership in the first place? Why would an existing property owner give up their rights to receive future benefits? If we need to borrow money and generate future financial returns to secure the initial site, are we simply perpetuating the status quo in the name of a new economy? If the transfer is funded by philanthropy or gifted, how will this translate into shifts in the ‘real’&nbsp;economy?</blockquote> Setting a strong intention for practical action <p>Recently we have received feedback questioning whether this kind of discussion is adding anything of value. There is a rising and palpable sense of frustration. Rhetoric and provocations are one thing, but are they really doing anything to help? Are they of any practical use to those at the frontline of the housing crisis? Actually we agree, but from a yes / and perspective. We absolutely need practical action, but let’s not forget that the actions taken in response to the 2008 financial crisis are a big driver for the mess that we find ourselves in today. Perhaps if more inclusive conversations had taken place, involving diverse voices, things would have evolved differently. We can’t know for sure, but demystifying topics such as finance and governance is core to our&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>So here we are wondering what to do about the entrenched dynamics of housing and the financial system. Where should we start? Probably with a few obvious yet difficult questions: how can we interact with finance to bring a house into common ownership? In doing so, what would be the least extractive way possible? If we manage, what kind of financial setup would ensure that regenerative and equitable intentions sit at the heart of its operations? Critically, how can we test our ideas on the&nbsp;ground?</blockquote><p>We are using the following principles to develop non-extractive pathways for bringing a house into the commons. The aim is to apply these examples to a FreeHouse demonstrator that <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle Civics</a> intend to start work on later this year. We also hope to connect with mainstream financial actors who are innovating in this field to test our assumptions. If you are working in this field and would be interested to join a conversation then please do get in&nbsp;touch:</p><p>Financing principles for a FreeHouse:</p>  No economic rent (generated by the set up funding or in the ongoing operation);  Utilise multi-sensory, ‘buffer’ metrics (to reduce unintended value extraction);  Minimise new money creation (to reduce future claims on finite resources);  IOE — Infinite Outcome Exchange¹ (remove capital from the current extractive, overshoot economy in exchange for infinite economic outcomes e.g. solidarity, knowledge)  Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@journosousa?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Aaron Sousa</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>  No economic&nbsp;rent  <p>Economic rent = income derived from ownership or control over a limited asset or resource. Such income is attained without any expenditure or effort on behalf of the resource holder OR the income is in excess of their opportunity cost i.e. the minimum the asset holder would accept to transfer or invest&nbsp;it².</p><p>In the context of a Freehouse, we want to protect against two sources of economic&nbsp;rent:</p>  Re-commoning the House: to begin the Freehouse journey we need to transfer the ownership of the House from the market to the Commons. This involves making a capital payment to the current holders of the property rights. We want to design this initial funding agreement so that the provider of financial capital does not receive any economic&nbsp;rent.  Financing the Commons: once the House is under commons stewardship the intention is that it will generate value to support itself, via activities such as community energy and user contributions. The goal will then be to direct any unused financial surplus to align with the no-rent principle. One example of this would be to create a fund for future house projects to reduce the external capital required on start-up. Surplus above a set percentage could be automatically redistributed to this&nbsp;fund.  <p>2. Utilise, multi-sensory ‘buffer’&nbsp;metrics</p><p>Where measures of success are required to secure funding, we will strive to incorporate indicators that respect the intrinsic and entangled values that are generated by living systems. This principle aims to avoid the erosion of often unnoticed stocks and flows of value in pursuit of a defined one. For example, if outcomes based financing is secured for planned community solar panels, we might unintentionally disrupt vital pollinator habitats in the area surrounding the house whilst striving to meet this singular target. If multi-point and multi-sensory indicators are used to validate outcomes and improve the learning capacity of governance systems, misaligned incentives can be&nbsp;reduced.</p><blockquote>The Rumsfeld Matrix of knowns and unknowns:</blockquote><blockquote>“Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones” — Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defence,&nbsp;2002</blockquote><p>3. Minimise future&nbsp;claims</p><p>This principle will keep the amount of new credit used (i.e. commercial bank loans) to a minimum. Where a loan is deemed the most appropriate financing instrument, we will strive to find a product that is linked to existing savings (e.g. Credit Union loans). By doing this, the intention is to take a stand against unsustainable future claims on the environment and increasing fragility of the global financial system. When new money is created, this credit (together with its associated interest) creates a future productive liability, which equates to a future claim on the energy and materials that will be required to settle it. The physical claims are coded into fiat money³ creation and at current levels are essentially a fatal contract with the future of the&nbsp;Earth⁴.</p><p>4. IOE (Infinite Outcome Exchange)</p><p>Here the house will playfully subvert the concept of Outcomes Based Financing. The aim is to provide infinite returns such as reciprocity, trust and knowledge in exchange for non-returnable financial capital. The principle is based on an aspiration to remove fiat money from circulation and thus in a small way weaken its extractive power. In its current form fiat money converts complex, entangled values into an abstract and highly liquid exchange medium. If you wanted to, you could exchange a Canadian lynx for a barrel of oil, potentially even making a profit in the process⁵. Incredibly, you could do so from such an emotional and physical distance that you wouldn’t even need to question the morality of your actions. Our current monetary system rewards the exploitation and pollution of everything that we need to thrive (and even survive), whilst money itself self-perpetuates, creating an ever increasing cycle of destruction.</p><blockquote>How could this work in practice? Perhaps the European Investment Bank (or a development bank) could step up to invest in the non-specific benefits of city transitions? By doing so it could set a precedent to shift outcomes based financing to a new level for other transition initiatives. If the benefits are achieved then the surplus could even be paid-forward to a public trust to improve other local services.</blockquote> Using speculative case studies to test the edges of what might be&nbsp;possible <p>The four speculative case studies described below have been designed to match the motivations of capital holders with the principles outlined above. They might seem far-fetched at first, but for each case study we have included some potential pathways that align with existing organisations and financial motivations. The next step will be to socialise them with people working in these areas for critical feedback.</p><blockquote>We are genuinely curious and open to be challenged. What are we missing? What are we getting wrong? Are there similar or adjacent innovations being developed?</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lunarts?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Volodymyr Hryshchenko</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>1Layered economy&nbsp;approach</p><p>This will involve looking at the different economies that the House will be part of (e.g. land, materials, energy generation, right-of-use) and matching them to appropriate funding streams. This could take the form of a portfolio of investments, loans and grants which have differential interest rates depending on the activity supported. The idea would be to create a matching platform to work out where differential interest rates, grants or preferential loans terms that are already on offer can be matched with elements of the House’s economy. For the model to remain non-extractive each funding stream will need to be carefully assessed in terms of fair effort or opportunity cost (for example an ultra low interest rate would be a significant opportunity cost for the investor).</p><p>As an example, a three way split could be proposed as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Right-of-use economy: for the areas of the House that are designated for residents, an ultra long-term loan (10 years +) could be used to secure a fixed monthly cost. This might suit a private impact investor or local pension scheme interested in supporting just transition outcomes.  Creative economy: for paying guests (accommodation and events), a more flexible shorter-term loan could be arranged based on forecast guest income. Potentially, paydowns could be planned to align with the busy visiting periods i.e. immediately after summer. For this type of funding to meet the ‘no economic rent’ principle the lender could commit to developing pathways to make it easier for other mixed housing models to access preferential loan rates. An example would be to use the <a href="http://www.positivemoney.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021_Building-Renovation-TLTROs.pdf">ECB’s TLTROs</a> (targeted long term refinancing operations) as an onramp for other alternative housing&nbsp;models.  Generative systems: grants or incentivised green loans could support the installation of renewable energy systems. The surplus generated would provide additional income to paydown the other loans further in the&nbsp;future.  <p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actors: private impact investor, local pension fund, business lenders, government matched funding for green initiatives.  Motivations: reputation, ESG compliance, political pressure for banks to play their part in a just transition.  Proposed agreement: mixed contracts via a central platform.  Potential partners / collaborators: Positive Money Europe has been<a href="https://unlock.green/about/"> campaigning</a> for commercial banks to play their part in green home renovations by leveraging European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy instruments. One suggested pathway is to channel preferential interest rates offered on TLTROs (targeted long term refinancing operations) towards sustainability loans. These loans can be at extremely low or even negative interest rates. A coalition of German development banks recently co-issued <a href="https://www.imug-rating.de/en/news-en/first-german-social-community-bond-wins-environmental-finances-bond-award-2023/">a social bond</a> linked to affordable housing provision and might be interested in providing low interest finance (Investitionsbank des Landes Brandenburg<a href="http://www.ilb.de/"> (ILB)</a>, <a href="http://www.ifbhh.de/">IFB Hamburg</a>, <a href="http://www.isb.rlp.de/">ISB&nbsp;Mainz</a>)  <blockquote>Terms like targeted ‘long term financing operations’ and ‘central bank monetary policy instruments’ can seem technocratic and removed from everyday life. In reality, they are not as complicated as we might be led to believe. For example, TLTROs are simply long-term loans made by the European Central Bank to commercial banks, at low or even negative interest rates, to stimulate lending to customers⁶. Organisations like Positive Money are doing a brilliant job of debunking and opening these topics up for conversation. In fact, central banks exist in service of economic stability so their role in addressing the public housing crisis would seem a logical extension of their current&nbsp;remit.</blockquote><p>2Resilience investment mortgage</p><p>This proposal is based on the risk exposure of mortgage providers. Tighter ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting requirements are forcing lenders to openly state their strategies for hedging against cascading climate and social risks. We see this as an opportunity to design a new class of mortgage, where the provider makes an advanced purchase order for future resilience as part of the agreement. In practical terms, this would mean that a proportion of the mortgage loan would not be repayable. Initially this would be a direct cost to the mortgage provider, based on the risk of future weather damage or defaults due to the rising cost of living. The remainder of the mortgage would be a standard arrangement where the House would make regular repayments plus interest. However, the advance resilience discount would in effect reduce the interest paid compared to a regular mortgage.</p><p>For example:</p><p>If the cost of the property was EUR 200,000 and the future risk was assessed at&nbsp;15%</p>  Risk cost = EUR 16k (15% *&nbsp;200,000)  Base mortgage = EUR 184 (residual value)  <blockquote>We appreciate that not everyone is interested, familiar or comfortable with accounting. This is actually something we would like to address. Why should the inner workings of professions like accountancy remain out of reach? Given their impact on decision making at the highest levels, it seems a missed opportunity to leave it in the hands of a small sector of society. For anyone that is interested the accounting entries on the mortgage providers books could work as&nbsp;follows:</blockquote><p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actor: a mortgage provider with a high volume of mortgage loans in a specific&nbsp;area.  Motivation: protecting against the future risk of mortgage defaults (e.g. caused by extreme weather, cost of living pressures).  Proposed agreement: Part advance purchase order, part mortgage.  Potential partners / collaborators: Mortgage providers who are innovating in the field such as <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/business/corporate-banking/specialist-teams/sustainability-and-esg-financing.html">ESG Financing at Lloyds&nbsp;Bank</a>.  Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lg17?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Lance Grandahl</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>3Strategic co-investment</p><p>This proposal looks at stakeholders providing a non-returnable financial investment and becoming partners with the House for mutually beneficial activities. The motivation for the investor would be having access to the House to test innovative technologies or to become part of its creative infrastructure. For example, a private company could co-invest (with The House) in the opportunity to test computational value mapping tools. A university might partner with the House to look at the links between collaborative living and sustainable outcomes. The capital would not be repayable and the house would be investing itself as an innovation catalyst.</p><p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actor: private tech company, university, performing arts&nbsp;group.  Motivation: innovation potential, reputation, ESG.  Proposed agreement: time bound generative use of the house in exchange for a non-returnable financial investment.  Potential partners / collaborators: universities who are focused on exploring new economic thinking in urban environments, for example the <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/studieren/studienangebot/gesamtes-studienangebot/studiengang/urban-management-m-sc">Urban Management Programme at Technische Universität Berlin.</a>  <p>4Joint ownership linked to pay-it-forwards mortgage</p><p>Here the suggestion is for a lender to become a co-owner of the House, and for the House to gradually purchase the lender’s share until it owns itself in full. This type of arrangement allows for a better alignment of shared risk at the outset. Over the period of co-ownership the House would pay rent to the lender for using the part that is still under their ownership. The principle is similar to Islamic Diminishing Musharaka Financing Products (DMFPs) which are designed to avoid income being generated via interest.</p><p>With existing DMFPs the rent is normally fixed, but there is potential for the rent to be linked to the surplus generated from the house’s activities. In this case, the mortgage agreement would stipulate that the principal repayments are based on a percentage of the surplus generated by the house. If there is no surplus nothing is due and no ‘rent’ accrues. This idea could be extended into a pay-it-forward solidarity mortgage.

But chances are, you’re under attack. So how do you know if you’re under attack? Well, the safe bet is to simply assume you already are. But, there are other indicators. Odd login behaviour, large numbers of failed login attempts, and huge spikes in login attempts are all likely evidence of something malicious afoot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As your trusted IAM partner, Ping has a vested interest in helping you protect your business. Our experience with the largest enterprises in the world has shown us that fraudsters, as big and scary as they can be, are also human and follow the path of least resistance. They mostly target the weakest links – your users. With the increasing sophistication and quality of attacks, users often fall victim to credential theft via phishing, vishing, smishing, and man-in-the-middle attacks, precisely because it is so challenging to differentiate malicious messages from genuine ones.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As businesses embrace Digital Transformation and become increasingly cloud-native, mobile, and interconnected, the corporate network perimeter is gradually disappearing, exposing users to malware, ransomware, and other cyber threats. Traditional perimeter security tools no longer provide adequate protection from these threats. Unlike traditional perimeter-based security models that assume trust within the network, Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) adopts a more granular and identity-centric approach.<br> <br> ZTNA is an alternative approach rapidly gaining popularity that essentially replaces the notion of a rigid single, usually hardware-based perimeter of a corporate network with the ability to create multiple dynamic perimeters around individual systems or applications deployed across multiple environments and managed from a centralized control plane. Often expressed as "Never trust, always verify", ZTNA is an embodiment of the principle of least privilege, and at its core mandates that every access request be properly authenticated and authorized.</p>
<p>This session will not only explore the basic principles of ZTNA but will also provide a comprehensive exploration of the ZTNA market segment based on our expert analysis. Attendees can expect an in-depth examination of the relative market share among key players in the ZTNA landscape, identifying the industry leaders and the innovative approaches they employ.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-network-access-market-overview-eic24"></a>

  <p>This session features an odyssey across the landscape of conceptions and practices of “Identity” starting from the pre-internet history, through early digital identity approaches of the Internet´s insular inception, the abstractions of institutional identity centralization and leading to today’s decentralized identity innovations.&nbsp; All of this sets the stage for anticipating radically distributed interaction and identity futures for an Upgraded Reality where hybrid digital and analog forms support functional identity.</p>
<p>Panelists and participants will offer multiple practical perspectives on identity to help guide you through the historical developments of Digital Identity.&nbsp; The historical perspective reveals at least 4 main periods.&nbsp;</p>
 
 The earliest simplified forms at the inception of the Internet reflected data-centric identity patterns derived from human relationships in pre-Internet physical spaces.&nbsp; 
 A second stage saw identity structured to address the needs of powerful but siloed commercial and governmental institutions and the rise of centralized Identity &amp; Access Management Systems.&nbsp; 
 A third (and current stage) is driven by the recognition and realization of the scalability benefits of user-centric and community-based forms of “Decentralized Identity.”&nbsp; 
 Finally, we will explore potential Identity futures that may see radically distributed and localized identity forms of identity supported by various forms of powerful AI and computational intelligence. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all periods, “identity” systems have been designed, developed and operated to provide&nbsp; highly reliable and adaptable systems through which we all recognize, remember and respond to each other and other entities.&nbsp; This next stage of digital identity will help foster the mutual hybridization of people with AI systems and host the systems of spatial computing, where analog and digital worlds merge to an upgraded reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engage with us as we analyze how current and future forms of Decentralized and Distributed Identity are gaining adoption in global standards in various business, operating, legal, technical and social domains. These historical trends will help reveal interventions through which we can all work towards reliable, predictable, trustworthy, user-centric, and privacy-aware practices and ensuring robust protections of individual rights in a future dominated by AI and other forms of computational intelligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s explore together: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Foundations of Digital Identity: Examining the initial structures of digital identity in the early internet era and the business, operating, legal, technical and social (BOLTS) factors that drove its evolution. 
 Centralized Identity &amp; Access Management Systems: An evaluation of centralized frameworks, their advantages, and the associated challenges related to control, privacy, and security. 
 Decentralized Identity – Unleashing a New Era: Exploring the mechanics, potential, and critical role of Decentralized Identity in creating a more secure and user-centric digital world. 
 Extending Identity and Safeguarding Privacy in the AI Era: Discussing how Decentralized Identity will evolve radically distributed forms that will be pivotal in protecting privacy and empowering individuals in a world increasingly influenced by artificial intelligence. 
 Envisioning the Future - The Global Impact of Functional Distributed Identity Infrastructures: Looking ahead, understanding how these privacy-aware standards are transforming into fundamental rights in our interconnected digital society. 
 
<p>&nbsp;We hope that you will join us and contribute to this journey of exploration tailored for innovators, thought leaders, and advocates of a high integrity, functional, secure and private digital future. Uncover the complexities, challenges, and untapped opportunities of Digital Identity with KuppingerCole Analysts, guided by the provocative inquiries of Dr. Scott David.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/from-digital-evolution-to-ai-integration-eic24"></a>

The main challenge for banks is not the implementation, but capturing business opportunities around those regulations rather than seeing them as constraints.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will describe an Open Finance architecture which allows:</p>
 
 Anticipating future regulations by structuring services that are secure and provide useful data, including strong customer authentication to confirm one's identity out of the box 
 Setting up the right API management tools that can be used internally, for regulatory APIs and bankable APIs 
 Providing additional services to consumers through extensible web interfaces

  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of identity and access management (IAM), the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings forth both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. This talk examines the critical importance of trust and transparency in AI systems, particularly in the context of IAM. We explore how AI decisions are made and communicated, emphasizing the need for Explainable AI (XAI) to demystify complex processes and foster user confidence.</p>
<p>We begin by exploring diverse real-world scenarios where AI's pivotal role in access management is demonstrated. This includes examining how AI systems are employed to make automated access decisions, while highlighting the challenges and successes in building trust through transparency. Detailed attention is given to XAI models and techniques such as LIME and SHAP, which are used to make AI's decision-making process accessible and understandable to all users.</p>
<p>The talk then transitions to innovative ways XAI can enhance user experience in IAM systems. We discuss how XAI not only clarifies AI decisions for users but also contributes to creating more intuitive, personalized, and user-friendly interfaces. Through examples and case studies, we showcase how XAI has been instrumental in reducing user frustration, increasing system adoption, and improving overall satisfaction.</p>
<p>Attendees will gain insights into the practical applications and benefits of transparent AI systems in identity governance, the significance of XAI in bridging the gap between complex AI algorithms and user-centric experiences, and how these elements collectively contribute to more secure, efficient, and trustworthy IAM solutions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-driven-identity-and-access-management-eic24"></a>

  <p>The glitzy and very convincing diagrams of IGA processes and architectures demonstrate what happens during the provisioning, deprovisioning, access request, and attestation stages using one key assumption… that everything will go according to plan. But what happens if something goes wrong? As an example: what happens if an access request process gets stuck because a dynamically calculated approver is on long-term leave or has left the organization? Ask IAM operations professionals, and they will tell you many stories of what went wrong and how tough it is to be in emergency mode fixing issues. IAM departments spend almost 80% of their time handling the results of something going wrong. So, it’s not about “if” something goes wrong, but “when”, and how to deal with it.</p>
<p>In the session, we will discuss practical steps to predict and handle situations when something doesn’t go according to plan. This is based on real-life examples from day-to-day IGA business. We will go over several use cases and show the cause, issue, resolution, and the prediction methodology for reducing the probability of it happening again. We will cover business, technological, and human factor aspects of handling possible standard process deviations and propose a model for predicting and mitigating such issues. This topic is important not just for IAM/IGA professionals, but also for COOs and CFOs because it impacts operational efficiency and cost.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/real-world-iga-stories-eic24"></a>

  <p>If governments or enterprises want to implement digital identity systems (eID/eIDAS2), they need to decide on a lot of technical topics with a high degree of uncertainty. One goal is to be interoperable across Europe or even on a global level and with the private sector. Moreover, existing and established eID systems and schemas further complicate the decision-making process.<br> <br> The art of timing:<br> One key question arises in this scenario: when is the right time to initiate the implementation of eID/eIDAS2 systems? For governments, timely adoption of the eIDAS2 regulation is imperative, ensuring compliance and unlocking economic advantages associated with an advanced eID infrastructure. On the corporate front, companies face similar challenges delaying implementation until the eIDAS2 compliant eID is in production, which may result in losing ground to competitors who are quick to adapt.<br> The risk of making incorrect decisions leading to a protocol lock-in situation looms large, jeopardizing the long-term viability and adaptability of the chosen eID solution.<br> <br> How to solve the dilemma?&nbsp;<br> But how can you avoid being too early and making the wrong technical decisions?<br> In the presentation we will show you an approach how to start with an eID implementation and avoid protocol lock-in and highlight a way how to integrate in existing eID schemas.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-protocol-challenge-and-the-art-of-timing-eic24"></a>

  <p>A significant trend in cybersecurity breaches is the shift from targeting endpoints to hijacking user identities. This evolution marks a significant change in attack vectors, emphasizing the need for robust Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR). The presentation will dig into the dynamics of this trend, explaining the mechanisms through which attackers infiltrate systems by exploiting identity vulnerabilities instead of traditional hardware or software loopholes.</p>
<p>In response to the increasing focus on identity-based threats, there has been a paradigm shift in organizational structures and workflows. Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) teams are no longer siloed entities; they are increasingly integrated with Security Operations Centers (SOC). This presentation will explore the multifaceted implications of this integration. Attendees will gain insight into how the fusion of IAM and SOC functions is reshaping security strategies, fostering a more resilient, proactive defense against identity-based attacks.</p>
<p>Topics covered will include the evolution of ITDR tools and techniques, the role of artificial intelligence in predicting and mitigating identity threats, and the critical importance of fostering a culture of security awareness throughout the organization.</p>

  <p>In this session we will consider various emerging forms of Artificial Intelligence in the context of the evolution of intelligence generally and the accelerating effects of combining human intelligence and AI.</p>
<p>The rapid spread of LLM-fueled information affordances has stoked human imagination regarding the nature of “intelligence” itself as a phenomenon, and the nature and role of human intelligence in relation to other forms. This session will set the stage for the upgrade reality track. In our journey of life and learning, how we think and understand the world around us plays a huge role. We often think of human intelligence as our inner voice and identity compass. Intelligence is central to our defining our sub-species as “Homo Sapiens Sapiens” (those who know that they know). Our individual and collective intelligence has changed and grown over time[, much like how we grow from children to adults]. In this session we will explore what happens when we blend our natural thinking with both modern technology and age-old wisdom from around the world. The "Upgrade Intelligence – Synthesizing with AI toward Meta-Knowing" session will open a treasure chest of insights into the evolution of intelligence. We will explore the value of synthesizing what we know naturally, what we've learned over time, and what modern tools like computers can teach us, aiming to help us achieve a deeper level of understanding. The umbrella term “AI” covers many different sorts of computational intelligence systems that help humans to process information and interactions in ways that we have never been able to do before. Better awareness of the variety of intelligences, both computational and otherwise, will help us to better manage the risks and leverage the benefits of integrating these rapidly proliferating “AI” systems with more traditional human intelligence systems (such as shared communities, organizations, languages, markets, etc.), and to manage how they will change us. Let’s explore together:</p>
 
 Our Thinking Journey: A simple look back at how humans have thought and learned over the ages, from basic instincts to deep thinking. 
 Brain Adventures: Exploring the wonders of our brains, like its ability to adapt and learn new things throughout our lives. 
 Computers as Brain Boosters: How technology and artificial intelligence can help us think better and solve problems in ways we never imagined. 
 Timeless Wisdom: Embracing valuable lessons from cultures around the world, mixing feelings, intuition, and logic to truly understand things. 
 Mixing it All for Deeper Understanding: Combining all these insights to see the world more clearly and make sense of complex ideas. 
 Dreaming of Tomorrow: Imagining a future where our natural smarts and technology come together, helping us make even better decisions. 
 
<p>By the end of our session, you'll leave with a refreshed view of intelligence and exciting tools to think smarter and deeper. So, whether you're a curious learner, an information worker, a risk professional, a teacher, or just someone looking to understand the world a bit better, come aboard! Let's discover the magic of mixing old wisdom, natural smarts, and modern tools to truly upgrade our intelligence.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/synthesizing-with-ai-toward-meta-knowing-eic24"></a>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/field-programmable-gate-arrays">Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/microcontroller">microcontroller units (MCUs)</a> are two types of commonly compared integrated circuits (ICs) that are typically used in embedded systems and digital design. Both FPGAs and microcontrollers can be thought of as “small computers” that can be integrated into devices and larger systems.</p>



<p>As processors, the primary difference between FPGAs and microcontrollers comes down to programmability and processing capabilities. While FPGAs are more powerful and more versatile, they are also more expensive. Microcontrollers are less customizable, but also less costly. In many applications, microcontrollers are exceptionally capable and cost-effective. However, for certain demanding or developing applications, like those requiring parallel processing, FPGAs are necessary.</p>



<p>Unlike microcontrollers, FPGAs offer reprogrammability on the hardware level. Their unique design allows users to configure and reconfigure the chip’s architecture depending on the task. FPGA design can also handle parallel inputs simultaneously, whereas microcontrollers can only read one line of code at a time. An FPGA can be programmed to perform the functions of a microcontroller; however, a microcontroller cannot be reprogrammed to perform as an FPGA.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a field programmable gate array (FPGA)? 



<p>First introduced by manufacturer Xilinx in 1985, FPGAs are highly valued for their versatility and processing power. As a result, they are a preferred choice in many <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hpc">high-performance computing (HPC</a>), digital signal processing (DSP) and prototyping applications.<br><br>Unlike traditional application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), FPGAs are designed to be configured (and reconfigured) “in the field” after the initial manufacturing process is complete. While customization is the FPGAs greatest value offering, it should be noted that FPGAs not only allow for programmability, they require it. Unlike ASICs, FPGAs are not “out-of-the-box” solutions, and they must be configured prior to use with a hardware description language (HDL), such as verilog or VHDL. Programming an FPGA requires specialized knowledge, which can increase costs and delay deployments. While some FPGAs do offer non-volatile memory that can retain programming instructions when powered off, typically FPGAs must be configured on start-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 FPGA benefits 



<p>Despite these challenges, FPGAs remain useful in applications requiring high-performance, low-latency and real-time flexibility. FPGAs are particularly well suited for applications requiring the following:</p>



 
 Rapid prototyping: FPGAs can be quickly configured into multiple types of customized digital circuits, allowing for expedited deployments, assessments and modifications without the need for costly and time-consuming fabrication processes.&nbsp; 



 Hardware acceleration: Demanding applications benefit from the FPGA’s parallel-processing capabilities. FPGAs may offer significant performance improvements for computationally intensive tasks, such as signal processing, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cryptography">cryptography</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> algorithms. 



 Customization: FPGAs are a flexible hardware solution that can be easily optimized to meet specific project requirements.&nbsp; 



 Longevity: FPGA-based designs may benefit from a longer hardware lifespan as FPGAs can be updated and reconfigured to meet evolving project demands and technology standards.&nbsp; 
 



 FPGA components 



<p>To achieve reconfigurability, FPGAs are composed of an array of programmable logic blocks interconnected by a programmable routing fabric. The main components of a typical FPGA are as follows:</p>



 
 Configurable logic blocks (CLBs): CLBs provide compute functionality and may contain a small number of primitive logic elements, such as logic gates, small look-up tables (LUTs), multiplexors and flip-flops for data storage.&nbsp; 



 Programmable interconnects: Made up of wire segments joined by electrically programmable switches, these linkages provide routing pathways between the various FPGA resources, allowing for different configurations and the creation of custom digital circuits.&nbsp; 



 I/O Blocks (IOBs): The interface between an FPGA and other external devices is enabled by input output (I/O) blocks, which allow the FPGA to receive data from and control peripherals&nbsp; 
 



 FPGA use cases 



<p>Versatile by nature, FPGAs are common among a wide variety of industries and applications:</p>



 
 Aerospace and defense: Offering high-speed parallel processing valuable for data acquisition, FPGAs are a preferred choice for radar systems, image processing and secure communications.&nbsp; 



 Industrial control systems (ICS): Industrial control systems used to monitor infrastructure—like power grids, oil refineries and water treatment plants—use FPGAs that can be easily optimized to meet the unique needs of various industries. In these critical industries, FPGAs can be used to implement various automations and hardware-based encryption features for efficient cybersecurity. 



 ASIC development: FPGAs are often used in the prototyping of new ASIC chips.&nbsp; 



 Automotive: Advanced signal processing also makes FPGAs well-suited for automotive applications, including advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), sensor fusion and GPS. 



 Data centers: FPGAs add value to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> by optimizing high-bandwidth, low-latency servers, networking and storage infrastructure. 
 



 FPGA features 



 
 Processing core: Configurable logic blocks 



 Memory: External memory interface&nbsp; 



 Peripherals: Configurable I/O blocks 



 Programming: Hardware description language (VHDL, Verilog)&nbsp; 



 Reconfigurability: Highly reconfigurable, reprogrammable logic 
 



 What is a microcontroller? 



<p>Microcontrollers are a type of compact, ready-made ASIC containing a processor core (or cores), memory (RAM), and erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) for storing the custom programs that run on the microcontroller. Known as a “system-on-a-chip (SoC)” solution, microcontrollers are essentially small computers integrated into a single piece of hardware that can be used independently or in larger embedded systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumer-grade microcontrollers, such as the Arduino Starter Kit or Microchip Technology PIC, can be configured using assembly language or common programming languages (C, C++), and they are favored by hobbyists and educators for their cost-effective accessibility. Microcontrollers are also capable of handling more complex and critical tasks and are common in industrial applications. However, decreased processing power and memory resources can limit the microcontroller’s efficacy in more demanding applications.&nbsp;</p>



 Microcontroller benefits 



<p>Despite their limitations, microcontrollers offer many advantages, including the following:</p>



 
 Compact design: Microcontrollers integrate all necessary components onto a small, single chip offering a small footprint valuable in applications where size and weight are a priority.&nbsp; 



 Energy efficiency: Designed to operate on low power, microcontrollers are well suited for battery-powered devices and other applications where power consumption is a concern. 



 Cost-effective: Microcontrollers offer a complete SoC solution that reduces the need for additional peripherals and components. Low-cost, general-purpose microcontrollers can greatly reduce overall project expenses.&nbsp; 



 Flexibility: Although not as versatile as FPGAs, microcontrollers are programmable for a wide range of various applications. While they cannot be reprogrammed on the hardware level, microcontrollers can be easily reconfigured, updated and optimized on a software level.&nbsp; 
 



 Microcontroller components 



<p>When reprogrammability is not a priority, self-contained microcontrollers offer a compact and capable alternative. The following are the key components of a microcontroller:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Central processing unit (CPU): Colloquially referred to as the “brain,” the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/central-processing-unit">central processing unit (CPU)</a> serves as the core component responsible for executing instructions and controlling operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Memory: Microcontrollers contain both volatile memory (RAM), which stores temporary data that may be lost if the system loses power, and non-volatile memory (ROM, FLASH) for storing the microcontroller’s programming code. 



 Peripherals: Depending on the intended application, a microcontroller may contain various peripheral components, such as input/output (I/O) interfaces like timers, counters, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C). 
 



 Microcontroller use cases 



<p>Unlike FPGAs, small, affordable, and non-volatile microcontrollers are ubiquitous in modern electronics, frequently deployed for specific tasks, including the following:</p>



 
 Automotive systems: Microcontrollers are used in engine control, airbag deployment and in-car infotainment systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Consumer electronics: Microcontrollers are critical to smartphones, smart TVs and other home appliances, especially devices that integrate into the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>. 



 Industrial automation: Microcontrollers are well-suited to industrial applications, such as controlling machinery, monitoring systems and process automation.&nbsp; 



 Medical devices: Microcontrollers are often deployed in life-saving devices, such as pacemakers, blood glucose monitors and diagnostic tools.&nbsp; 
 



 Microcontroller features 



 
 Processing core: Fixed CPU 



 Memory: Integrated RAM and ROM/Flash&nbsp; 



 Peripherals: Built-in I/O interfaces for 



 Programming: Software (C, Assembly)&nbsp; 



 Reconfigurability: Limited, firmware updates

 How can Liminal analyze the passwordless authentication space in different verticals to create a tailored GTM strategy that identifies key metrics, use cases, and ideal customer profiles? 



 







 



 Introduction 



<p>As the CIAM and authentication market spaces evolve, new vendors enter and compete against one another. Liminal was tasked with a Go-to-Market Strategy engagement with a prominent, large-scale digital identity vendor client as they launched their passwordless platform. The project aimed to develop actionable playbooks that the client’s salesforce team could leverage when working with its global customers with significant presence across key identified verticals, such as financial institutions and eCommerce. To achieve this goal, the Liminal team of skilled consultants and strategists worked closely with the client to refine a GTM strategy that tasked Liminal with creating playbooks specific to the client’s key verticals that outlined the buyer’s journey. It increased their ability to grow their customer portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



 Challenge 



<p>While the client’s product portfolio boasted innovative capabilities and features, developing tailored sales materials that differentiated the client from its competition proved difficult. Liminal wanted to ensure the vendor could leverage unique insights into different verticals aligned with other industries’ various goals, personas, and metrics. Specifically, Liminal wanted to identify these key elements:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs): Who are the personas with whom the sales team would interact across different verticals?&nbsp; 
 



 
 Key use cases: Which use cases most apply to the respective vertical the sales team is targeting?&nbsp; 
 



 
 The buyer/customer journey: What is the timeline for each vertical and ICP’s buying process? What questions or roadblocks might the potential customer raise along the way?&nbsp; 
 



 
 Tailored sales metrics: How can Liminal provide the client with quantifiable sales metrics that differentiate their product from other vendors while specifically targeting each vertical?&nbsp; 
 



<p>To tackle the challenge, Liminal leveraged market research, extensive customer interviews, and the creation of a dynamic ROI Calculator for each vertical. Through our analysis of the identity market, we landed on two key verticals that the client could focus on in its sales efforts: Financial Services and e-commerce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, Liminal pursued a long list of customer interviews to collect key insights about what customers seek in an identity vendor. Our research helped us identify the key use cases relevant to each vertical, such as Account Takeover Fraud in Financial Services or Cart Abandonment in e-commerce. We met with various personas that also led us to pinpoint which roles our client would interact with when selling. Our interviews provided information regarding the buying journey, helping us to identify how long the client could expect to engage with potential customers and who these customers might be.&nbsp;</p>



 Solution 



<p>The knowledge we gained during our extensive research led to developing two vertical-specific GTM Playbooks for our clients to leverage in their sales efforts. We used our four main takeaways from the research (ICPs, key use cases, buying journey, and sales metrics) to differentiate the playbooks so that our clients knew how to approach different sales scenarios across verticals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using our resources, we created ICP profiles in each vertical to provide insights into the different industries. We also made sure to weave in the key use cases we identified from our research so the sales team could understand which use cases applied more directly to the two verticals. This information allowed us to create specific sales enablement strategy materials, such as questions to ask the customer, key points to make, or categories where the customer wants to save money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We combined the work in our vertical playbooks to transfer into dynamic ROI Calculators for the client to use in each vertical. The goal was to make the vertical playbooks go hand-in-hand with the ROI Calculators so our client could further their sales efforts with tailored metrics to the customer and their industry. This would allow our clients to avoid any industry-knowledge gaps in the sales process and expedite the sales process without conducting initial discovery or research into the industry. The goal was to enhance our client’s sales efforts as their products launched.&nbsp;</p>



 Outcome 



<p>Liminal successfully provided the client with two actionable GTM playbooks and two dynamic ROI Calculators, each tied to a unique vertical. The playbooks combined all of our key findings and presented them in a logical flow that followed the client’s specific sales framework and methodology. We hosted training sessions with the client, walking them through the playbooks so they could understand how to&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most unique outcome of the engagement was the two ROI Calculators we provided to the client. The calculators allowed our client to walk through a potential deal with a customer, selecting the use cases they were most interested in and the products they wanted to purchase. From there, the calculators also had customizable options, allowing the salesperson to work closely with their customers, tailoring specific metrics to their needs. This helped our client calculate savings categories across industry pain points, making the data digestible to the potential customer. Our ROI Calculators predicted an average of a 7x ROI for customers with a million end-users, providing the client with a metrics breakdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The client was able to target unique personas in different verticals, understand their wants and needs in the market, and provide uniquely differentiated metrics from competitors.&nbsp;</p>



 Conclusion&nbsp; 



<p>As a result of our engagement, the client walked away with actionable GTM vertical-specific playbooks and a customizable ROI Calculator to leverage in sales efforts. The engagement was successful from the client’s perspective, along with Liminal’s, and proved our ability to enhance a client’s sales process. Additionally, the engagement materials demonstrated tangible results, where the client could convert perspectives to customers and increase their revenue. As one of the first major GTM Strategy engagements, this project promoted our ability to leverage industry knowledge and combine it with feedback from customers we spoke to turn it into easily comprehensible deliverables. Overall, the engagement highlighted the team’s ability to successfully leverage our data-driven research and turn it into practical sales materials for a company to utilize in its sales strategy efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two months ago, we launched a new part of the Dark Matter Labs ecosystem: Property &amp; Beyond Lab. Since then, we have expanded our portfolio of <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/">strategic property provocations</a>; we have launched a <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/tool">digital platform</a> that maps the connections between global systemic risks and property; and we have co-hosted the conference “<a href="https://www.notion.so/what-and-how-we-own/What-How-We-Own-The-Politics-of-Change-0755201b081549bfa8ff8426c1fdeb0f">What and How We Own: The Politics of Change</a>”, where we gathered with over a hundred experts to explore the intricate workings of property systems, their extensive impacts on our everyday lives, as well as promising ideas, case studies, and methods that can seed different futures.</p><p>If there is one thing that has become unmistakably clear at our conference and through this work, it is that the time of tinkering at the margins is over. In a similar way that we cannot address the biodiversity crisis by simply planting additional trees, we are seeing that we cannot address the micro-massive impacts of failing property institutions — such as rising inequality, growing numbers of unhoused peoples, and concentrations of power — by tweaks to surface level codes such as taxes, regulation, and contracts.</p><p>The global real estate market (which includes commercial and residential real estate and agricultural land) is the <a href="https://www.savills.com/impacts/market-trends/the-total-value-of-global-real-estate-property-remains-the-worlds-biggest-store-of-wealth.html">world’s biggest source of wealth at $379.7 trillion</a>, yet much of that is owned by the <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/family-office-uhnw/reports/global-wealth-report-2023.html">global top 1% whose wealth share rose to 44.5%</a> in 2022. While the planet is headed for at least 1.5C of heating — with disastrous results for people and ecosystems — control over the critical minerals necessary for our green transitions has been highly concentrated, with<a href="https://www.oecd.org/trade/topics/global-value-chains-and-trade/documents/clean-energy-supply-chains-OECD-G7-202305.pdf"> only 3 companies owning 49% of global lithium production in 2020.</a> Meanwhile, our housing crisis puts us in a tight double bind, with our need to house people contributing heavily to even more carbon emissions and biodiversity loss (our own research suggests that <a href="https://www.irresistiblecircularsociety.eu/news/invitation-paper-a-new-european-bauhaus-economy-designing-our-futures">Europe can afford to build only 176,000 new homes a year </a>to remain within the carbon budget set by the Paris Agreement, which is far below the housing supply required to meet&nbsp;demand).</p><p>Governments have been dealing with these emerging and evolving risks and impacts by shoring up flaws in policies or trying to course-correct. Yet we believe it is time to ask the more fundamental question of whether property and ownership in its current form, with its hierarchies of control and worldview of separation, is in fact the right framework to deal with the challenges at hand. Or to put it simply, it is becoming clear that without innovating the deep code of property and the cultural norms that surround it, the scale of the transitions ahead of us feel out of&nbsp;reach.</p><p>This blog is an attempt to dive deeper into the complexities of the property problem space, by starting to unpack two of its most pressing yet knotted challenges: housing and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Part 1: In this first part, we will start to peel back the layers of the multifaceted crisis of housing looking at its intertwined economic, social, and ecological impacts.</p><p>Part 2: A second part on data ownership will follow, in which we will look at the need to transition away from governing data itself to governing access to data and what it is used&nbsp;for.</p><p>These blogs are intended both as an exploratory journey and a rallying cry to policymakers and strategic risk holders to deepen their commitment to systemic innovation and invest in compelling visions for the future to be able to overcome political and institutional lock-ins and match the necessity of the contexts we&nbsp;face.</p><p>HOW A DIFFERENT LENS ALLOWS US TO SEE PROPERTY&nbsp;ANEW</p><p>At Dark Matter Labs, we have found it increasingly helpful to get a better picture of property’s complex problem landscapes by looking through the lens of affordances and disaffordances: what do our property systems allow us to do, see, be and imagine? And consequently, how could its redesign recast our relationship with each other, with ecosystems, and with the planet and build a pathway to systemic thriving?</p><p>Affordance is a concept that was originally developed in the late 1960s by the ecological psychologist James Gibson, who defined affordance as what an artifact “offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill” (<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs137/2017/readings/Gibson-AFF.pdf">Gibson, 1979</a>). It was later popularized in design by Donald Norman’s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, where he defined it as the “perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine how the thing could possibly be used.” Affordances can be both positive and negative, which is to say beneficial and injurious depending on the context. A fire can afford both the warmth necessary to life, but it can also cause destruction.</p><p>What is interesting in adopting the lens of affordances is that it allows us to see our legal designs as not just socially-constructed, but as having ontological effects: what we design designs us back. Our legal designs mediate our understanding of perceptions of the world and what is possible to do. Our individual and collective sense of agency is mediated by these designs, and so too is our understanding of ourselves and the world co-constituted through the lens of that mediation.</p><p>When we apply this lens to our property rights frameworks, what becomes very clear is how it allows for a very specific, narrow range of behaviors and actions that are increasingly misaligned with our changing material reality (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VUCA">VUCA&nbsp;world</a>).</p><p>Through its legal coding, property rights have turned the world into abstract objects and things, and subsequently a world of capital assets. Land is no longer a source of social and cultural value, a sense of belonging and group identity, or existential and ecological rootedness, but an object that can be mortgaged and sold for the extraction of profits. The prism of property as it currently stands stamps out any different modes of relating to land other than through the lens of financial value. Property detaches ‘things’ from their social and ecological relationships, resulting in absurdities like timber being valued as a resource more than the forest as a living ecosystem.</p><p>Property tends to create competing interests of the individual owner versus society. As Blackstone famously formulated, the “sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe” (<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/blackstone-on-property-1753">Blackstone, 1753</a>). It generates an artificial distinction between first and third parties, and then systematically structures relationships in service of property-owners at the expense of non-owners and that which is ‘owned’. In this process of optimizing for individual rights and interests, it purports to provide security — as if somehow the world is made up of a series of individual parts, rather than recognizing that everything happens out of the coming together of complex wholes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA5GV-XmwtM">Iain McGilchrist</a>, 2023).</p><p>Property affords only a reductive mode of information processing and organizing in which complexity and entanglement is reduced to systems of low information burdens. Boundaries are drawn, fences put up, to communicate the limit of where rights apply, from which the world and their interests are excluded. Definitions of what counts as “property”, “property damage” and externalities limit actions that can be taken to mitigate distributed risks and impacts, or acknowledge multiple value creation, as is becoming increasingly pressing with copyright and other forms of IP in the context of machine learning systems which extract private value from the availability of vast amounts of public training data and the “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">collective intelligence</a>” of humanity.</p><p>Where Friedrich Hayek recognized that “liberty and responsibility are inseparable” in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution_of_Liberty#:~:text=Hayek%20highlights%20the%20decline%20in,guides%20individuals%20in%20their%20choices.">The Constitution of Liberty</a>, our current forms of property have failed to balance the freedoms of rights with the burdens of responsibilities, especially when those consequences fall on non-individualized and non-human, such as the social and ecological commons.</p><p>Seeing property and ownership through the lens of affordances — by looking at how it shapes our ways of being and relating, the incentives it creates, the priorities it assigns, the asymmetries it creates — allows us to lift our gaze from the micro-institutional or domain-specific level where impacts are felt, one case or transaction at a time, towards the wider system-level operation of property and the logic and norms that define and sustain&nbsp;it.</p><p>THE HOUSING CRISIS: A KNOTTED PROBLEM&nbsp;SPACE</p><p>By diving deeper into the deep codes of our systems, we get to see our problem spaces more clearly. The housing crisis, often portrayed as a singular issue, starts to quickly reveal itself as a complex web of challenges and deeply intertwined with and restrained by the disaffordances of our dominant systems of property and ownership.</p><p>New York, Toronto, London, Amsterdam, and Seoul, indeed nearly every urban center faces a housing crisis. In 200 cities studied across the world, <a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/kallergis_wp18ak1.pdf">90% were found to be unaffordable to live in</a>. <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/press-releases/new-report-shows-rent-unaffordable-half-renters-cost-burdens-surge-record-levels">Nearly half of all renters in the US spend more than 30% of their income on rent</a>, and a quarter spend more than 50%. Houselessness is on the rise and not just limited to major cities:<a href="https://www.security.org/resources/homeless-statistics/"> the number of people without access to housing climbed in every type of setting</a> — including a 10% increase in rural areas. Globally, UN-Habitat estimates that <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-11-01-01.pdf">1.6 billion people live in inadequate housing</a>, of which 1 billion live in slums and informal settlements; numbers which are likely to only increase with growing displacement by conflicts and climate-related impacts like water scarcity, crop failure, and rising sea&nbsp;levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, real estate lobbyists, policy makers, and some housing experts have portrayed the housing crisis as simply a problem of supply. If we build more housing, the argument goes, people will have more choices, and rents will be lower. The problem with this supply-side argument is that it is not the full picture. In fact, research shows that there tends to be a surplus in virtually every urban area. New York, for example, has an <a href="https://jacobin.com/2016/10/housing-crisis-rent-landlords-homeless-affordability">excess of a quarter-million units</a> beyond what is necessary to house its current population. Not to mention its vacant office and commercial space — 74,582,671 square feet to be precise, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/10/opinion/nyc-office-vacancy-playground-city.html">26 Empire State buildings</a> worth — that could potentially be retrofitted for housing and community-serving uses.</p><p>Simply building more homes won’t solve the problem of affordability. The crisis is much deeper than that: it is rooted in a cluster of dysfunctions of property and ownership. In order to craft effective solutions, we need a new approach that unpacks how our legal coding, institutional logics, and cultural norms around property all play a complex, entangled role in creating this multi-faceted problem space. This means developing a new understanding of how property as a framework has articulated and captured social imaginaries as to the goals we set around housing, how it has enabled the privatization of benefits while commoning costs to society and the environment, and how it has built a systemic lock-in for NIMBY solutions. This is especially critical because pathways to democratizing access to housing as we currently understand it are becoming increasingly unavailable, through rising costs, carbon constraints, material affordability, and declining public investments.</p><p>UNTANGLING THE&nbsp;KNOT</p><p>So what are the different strands of this knotted problem space? What actions, behaviors, and imaginaries does property and ownership afford us when it comes to our&nbsp;homes?</p><p>Homes are seen as a financial asset, rather than a place to live&nbsp;…</p><p><a href="https://www.savills.com/impacts/market-trends/the-total-value-of-global-real-estate-property-remains-the-worlds-biggest-store-of-wealth.html">Housing has become the world’s most valuable asset class</a>, worth US$379.7 trillion or three times global GDP. Owning property is viewed as a secure pathway to long-term financial stability for individual and institutional investors alike. Residential real estate has become an investment of choice for private equity firms, pension funds, and insurance companies, who have turned to real estate looking to diversify and hedge against market volatility, driving up housing prices — and financial volatility for individual residents — as a result. This prioritization of housing as a financial asset over its social value or human right is problematic, but the reality is presently essential to the economic models of our cities and countries.<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-state-and-local-property-taxes-work"> Property taxes account for over 60% of township/municipal revenue in the US</a>, while also being an essential part of the financial health and sustainability of the pensions of our nurses, teachers, and firefighters. We are facing deep institutional lock-ins that make dealing with any systemic change a political hot&nbsp;potato.</p><p>… where security of tenure for some comes at the expense of that of&nbsp;others</p><p>By perceiving and treating housing as just another commodity, we fall into a persistent analytical error. At the heart of this error is that land, on which housing is built, is a fixed resource. We cannot produce more of it. Especially highly desirable land — be it downtown building lots or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/16/arizona-colorado-river-water-rights-drought">arable farmland</a> — are scarce, giving those who own it the upper hand. In addition, housing is immobile and has high transaction and construction costs (<a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/rethinking-the-economics-of-land-and-housing-9781350374270/">Ryan-Collins et al. 2017</a>). These features are not market failures, but fundamental properties that limit how the housing system is able to behave. They mean that increased demand invariably translates into upward spirals of housing prices, rent-seeking and hoarding, rather than increased supply as in real commodity markets. Housing increases in value over time, incentivizing someone to hold on to an empty apartment, to keep land lying dormant, or to buy an additional investment property. The result is that the security of tenure and investment by some deprives others, accelerating and externalizing the costs of insecurity.</p><p>Home ownership allows for the privatization of public value&nbsp;…</p><p>What would your home be worth if you were to move it to McCarthy, Alaska? (one of the most isolated places with a population of a mere 107 at the 2020 census) This might be a strange question, but not if you consider tha<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1376634/land-price-as-a-share-of-property-value-in-selected-cities-in-the-us/">t most of what our homes are worth is made up of the value of the land on which it is built</a>, sometimes over two-thirds. In matters of real estate, it really is location, location, location. The majority of current property value is derived from what is called “unearned increment”, the financial value that is captured by homeowners, landlords, and speculators of the non-financial value generated by our social and ecological commons. These are the things that make a place desirable, such as access to schools, safe streets, the amount of sunlight, or ecological integrity. Property rights have enabled homeowners to systematically gain an unfair dividend of our shared public goods and investments. This private enclosure of public goods is nowhere more evident than in the example of the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">NYC High Line</a>. A US$187 million investment (of which 77% from public funds from a mixture of NYC, federal and state government) led to a US$3.4 billion surge in surrounding property values. Individual homeowners reaped most of this benefit, whilst property tax revenue only went up by US$103&nbsp;million.</p><blockquote>“Roads are made, streets are made, services are improved, electric light turns night into day, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains — and all the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements is effected by the labor and cost of other people and the taxpayers. To not one of those improvements does the land monopolist, as a land monopolist, contribute, and yet by every one of them the value of his land is enhanced.”</blockquote><blockquote>— W. Churchill</blockquote><p>… and the externalization of&nbsp;costs</p><p>Whenever we build a house, we create social and ecological impacts that reach well beyond the construction site, impacts that are seldom factored into the overall costs. This includes environmental degradation, depletion of resources, and both direct and indirect displacement of communities — costs that society bears rather than them being included in the price of construction. In 2020, the<a href="https://globalabc.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/GABC_Buildings-GSR-2021_BOOK.pdf"> built environment accounted for 37% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions</a> and the use of <a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/introducing-retrofirst-a-new-aj-campaign-championing-reuse-in-the-built-environment">25% of all plastic</a> worldwide. Construction is spending our sand ‘budgets’ faster than it can be produced naturally and responsibly, leading to pollution, hoarding, price gouging and even the<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sand-mafias-are-plundering-the-earth/"> rise of “sand mafias”.</a> All these forms of lifecycle costs are rarely taken into account, never mind priced in for investors, developers or builders, and the impacts accumulate. As the necessity to internalize these costs grows, we are likely to see a significant decrease in housing affordability for the majority. This will also challenge the supply-side approach to solving the housing crisis, potentially leading to an erosion of the housing market’s capacity to meet demand affordably.</p><p>CRAFTING PATHWAYS TOWARDS NEW AFFORDANCES</p><p>Untangling the knot of the housing crisis shows that if we were to meaningfully take on its interwoven challenges, we would have to reimagine and recode the problematizing structures of property and ownership. We would need to build new institutional mechanisms that provide a wider scope of affordances, allowing for (re)new(ed) ways of relating to our homes, the land it is built on, the materials it is drawn from, the ecologies it supports, and the public goods it relies on. It would involve unhooking homes from both control and extractive dynamics in favor of stewardship, mutual care, and responsibility.</p><p>On our journey so far, we have begun to progressively craft some of the blueprints for instruments, institutions, and interfaces that allow for new ways of relating to our&nbsp;homes.</p><p>What if building materials of a house were rented and not&nbsp;owned?</p><p>This might involve a system where materials are not owned but are part of an<a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/gg6r1tfm/production/e2d01e567642a433f4eb812cf19ab5c20f2aa0e2.pdf"> Open Chain Digital Trust. </a>This idea reflects the philosophy once expressed by the Indigenous peoples of Taiwan: “I will borrow the stones and give them back once I’m done.” Such a system is now feasible digitally and enables a fully circular material economy — designed to remove incentives for waste, rent-seeking and hoarding and encourage maximum utility and sustainability. Open Chain Digital Trusts are one way in which new technologies are creating affordances that surpass the qualitative affordances of not just property rights but law as such, allowing us to dynamically and transparently manage multiple entangled risks, interests, and values and distribute power in unprecedented ways.</p><p>What if a house could generate value for the&nbsp;commons?</p><p>Community Land Trusts have long been around as a promising way of removing housing from the speculative market to create stable, affordable housing options that are controlled by the community and stewarded by the residents that live in them. The <a href="https://www.theguild.community/peoples-community-land-trust/">People’s Community Land Trust in Atlanta</a> is an inspiring example of leveraging housing to build community wealth. Yet regulatory barriers and long and expensive development trajectories have meant that CLTs are still not widespread: there are an<a href="https://www.policylink.org/resources-tools/tools/all-in-cities/housing-anti-displacement/community-land-trusts#:~:text=Today%2C%20there%20are%20an%20estimated,close%20to%2020%2C000%20rental%20units."> estimated 225 CLTs in the US that provide only around 10,000 homeownership units</a> and 20,000 rentals. That’s why we have been contemplating what kind of additional pathways are opened up when a house is not just put in the hands of the community, but removed entirely from property structures and is made self-owning. Liberating a house from its extractive rent-seeking logic allows it to be put fully in the service of both the ecological and social commons. It could unlock (re)generative returns currently unavailable within housing policy, such as savings in healthcare or ecosystem restoration. We are looking to demonstrate this with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19cSm8Wj0N5DrOXNwOSfsAOt3--O73mP4/view?usp=drive_link">FreeHouse Toronto</a>, where we aim to build regenerative housing on ravine land, where residents carry out land stewardship under the leadership of Indigenous stewardship stakeholder groups.</p><p>What if our contract would not be with a landlord, but with our neighbors?</p><p>Rent-seeking behavior has largely undermined property’s classical justification as a means of securing future returns on labor and contribution and has instead led to increasing waste and inefficiencies of use. Previously we have written about how our Proof of Possibility <a href="https://bloombergcities.jhu.edu/news/city-putting-its-people-charge-public-space#:~:text=They%27re%20doing%20so%20by,billboards%E2%80%94in%20the%20people%27s%20hands">Permissioning the City</a> with local government in Daegu, South Korea seeks to overcome the inefficiencies and barriers of centralized management and regulation by unlocking vacant and underutilized spaces for creative use via a digital peer-to-peer permissioning system. Yet distributed permissioning systems could open up many other new pathways for commoning, for instance by using it to create a <a href="https://www.landcommission.gov.scot/downloads/655b1bb264fac_SLC-DML_Discussion-Paper_for%20publication.pdf">partial commons layer over privately-owned properties</a> to facilitate the development of shared green spaces or joint renewable energy projects.</p><p>OUR CALL TO&nbsp;ACTION</p><p>Addressing the knotted problem spaces of our housing crisis demands a deep-code perspective. Solutions so far have focused too often on single, isolated aspects. Whether it is by boosting public and private housing supplies or establishing CLTs, these solutions individually fail to address the deep-rooted asymmetries, distributed harms, and underperformance plaguing the housing system — dysfunctions that can be traced back to the narrow range of affordances of our axiomatic property and ownership institutions. By diving deep into the deep code, we can start to see how seemingly discrete challenges are in fact interrelated and interdependent, and idiosyncratic for a wider system that optimizes for control, single point optimization, and financial value. A meaningful transition for the housing sector demands we recognize the need to build truly new option spaces. We are in need of new institutional capabilities — governance instruments, cultural norms, technical infrastructures, and legal contracts — that allow us to relate differently to housing as a critical infrastructure and its effects on our shared economic stability, social wellbeing, and environmental thriving.</p><p>Did this blog resonate with you and are you interested in getting involved?

				  Indicio Proven® adds support for OpenID protocols and the SD JWT credential format for interoperability with a wide variety of existing and emerging solutions and specifications, including the European Union’s digital identity requirements.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert, CTO</p>
<p>We at Indicio have been closely monitoring the European Union’s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age_en">eIDAS 2.0</a> (electronic IDentification, Authentication, and Trust Services) regulation and the associated <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">EUDI</a> (European Digital Identity) wallet specification. We are excited to announce that Indicio Proven® supports the OpenID protocols required for both.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that our government and business customers can more easily build verifiable credential solutions and digital wallets that work with emerging EU digital identity wallet specifications in anticipation of the EU’s requirement that all member-state citizens have access to a digital identity wallet by 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follows Indicio’s implementation of OpenID for <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-badges/">Open Badges 3.0</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenID</p>
<p>The OpenID communication <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">protocols</a>, consisting of OpenID4VCI (Verifiable Credential Issuance) and OpenID4VP (Verifiable Credential Presentation), are required by the European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework and are included in the EUDI specification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These protocols enable verifiable digital identity credentials to be issued to a digital wallet and then be presented from that digital wallet to a relying party for verification. Through these mechanisms, European citizens can use digital identity credentials to access government services, prove their age, hold mobile driver’s licenses, and cross borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selective disclosure and EUDI</p>
<p>In addition to our ongoing support for selective disclosure in AnonCreds, Indicio now also supports the new SD JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT) credential format. Selective disclosure is a feature that allows credential holders to present specific information in a credential for verification (instead of having to disclose all the information in the credential at once). This feature is key to meeting the European Union’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/Security+and+Privacy">requirements</a> for data minimization and privacy in eIDAS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven: One solution, many options</p>
<p>We understand the first-mover advantage. And we understand the cost and worry of having to adapt to new specifications, standards, and customer needs. It’s why Indicio ensures our customers have the best and most flexible technology. They can deploy today with the confidence that they can quickly evolve as new specs roll in and stay ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding support for OpenID and SD JWT to Indicio Proven doesn’t just mean satisfying EU requirements; it also means customers satisfy EU requirements and get a host of more advanced features to satisfy business needs, such as the ability to issue KYC credentials, Digital Travel Credentials, and Open Badges 3.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By offering the widest possible selection of credential formats and protocols, Indicio Proven is the most capable verifiable credential solution in the market and the only complete verifiable credential solution available in both the <a href="https://indicio.tech/google-cloud/">AWS</a> and <a href="https://indicio.tech/amazon-web-service/">Google</a> marketplaces.</p>
<p>But there’s more…</p>
<p>EUDI is still a work in progress, and Indicio’s CEO, Heather Dahl, is now serving on the European Commission’s Ad-Hoc Technical Advisory Group for the European Digital Identity Wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it’s not the only emerging digital identity solution. Indicio Proven will also support the emerging Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) ISO 18013 specification, which is currently being piloted in various states and countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the first company to successfully implement a <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-takes-the-lead-in-indicio-series-a-funding-round-cementing-a-partnership-delivering-trusted-digital-identity-for-travel/#new_tab">Digital Travel Credential</a> based on the International Civil Aviation Organization’s specifications for a digital equivalent of a passport and to develop effective <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcu76JEaqwI">liveness and biometric binding to personal data in a verifiable credential</a>, we are excited to incorporate land travel into Indicio Proven’s portfolio of options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, with all these different credential formats and implementations, how do you choose which to build to, especially as some are still very much works-in-progress?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re serious. It really doesn’t matter. You can have the best of everything. We have built Indicio Proven to act as a credential bridge. This means you can wrap an existing credential format with the features of a more advanced credential while retaining the original credential’s functionality and verifiability. It’s a lock-in buster, meaning you don’t need to worry about being stuck with an underpowered solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means —&nbsp;get building now. You can create dynamic deployments that do amazing things right now and be compatible with whatever comes along in the future. That’s the magic of this technology and Indicio Proven.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), this keynote delves into the revolutionary impact of large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents in software development. This presentation unveils a paradigm shift from traditional static software and user experiences to a dynamic, AI-driven approach where LLM agents independently think, plan, and execute, bringing a new level of intelligence and adaptability to IGA.</p>
<p>However, with great power comes great responsibility. The autonomous nature of these LLM AI agents, while groundbreaking, introduces a level of unpredictability and complexity. This talk addresses the critical need for dynamic, real-time authorization as flexible guardrails, essential in steering these agents safely and effectively within the vast and intricate landscape of IGA.</p>
<p>We will explore how dynamic real-time authorization can be seamlessly interwoven with these AI orchestrations, acting not just as a security measure, but as an integral component that enables LLM agents to operate within a controlled yet adaptable framework. This integration is crucial in ensuring that the revolutionary capabilities of AI are harnessed responsibly, maintaining compliance and security without stifling innovation.</p>
<p>Attendees will gain insight into the cutting-edge integration of LLM AI agents in IGA, understanding the challenges and opportunities presented by this new paradigm. The session aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on managing the dynamism of AI with robust and flexible authorization techniques, paving the way for a more secure, efficient, and forward-thinking approach in identity governance. Join us in exploring how we are setting the course for the future of IGA, where autonomy meets accountability.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/navigating-the-new-iga-frontier-eic24"></a>

  <p>We, as an industry, have been working on identity management for quite some time. But, from some perspectives, we haven’t made progress. We have solved many of the problems of user account management, but we have yet to solve the problems of identity management to the same extent. The magical future where I can put the supercomputer on my wrist to work in a way that delivers real value and not just interesting insights and alerts feels both disappointingly far away yet tantalizingly within our grasp. In this talk, Ian Glazer puts forward the concept of counselors: software agents that act on one’s behalf to make introductions of the individual to a service and vice versa, perform recognition of these services and associated credentials, and prevent or at least inhibit risky behavior, such as dodgy data sharing. Counselors are a way to both humanize online interactions and make meaningful (as in meaningful and valuable to the individual) progress on solving the challenges of digital identity management.</p>
<p>In this session you will learn:</p>
 
 Why solving for user account management is only part of the story 
 How the notion of counselors fills the remaining gaps 
 What is required to make counselors real 
 Steps you can take today towards identity management

  <p>In an era where misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation flood our digital channels, discerning truth from falsehood has become a formidable challenge. The implications are profound, stretching from individual trust to societal cohesion and impacting everything from public health through individual safety and security to democratic processes. DIACC (Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada) President Joni Brennan aims to unravel the complex web of false information that pervades our digital and physical worlds. Joni will explore the role digital identity plays in both perpetuating and mitigating the spread of these harmful narratives. She will address how the misinformation crisis has eroded public trust, and more importantly, how technology, policy, and community engagement can be harnessed to restore it.</p>
<p>Key points of discussion will include:</p>
 
 The Anatomy of Misinformation:&nbsp;Understanding the differences and intersections between misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation. 
 Digital Identity at the Crossroads:&nbsp;Examining how digital identities can be manipulated to spread false narratives, but also how robust digital ID systems can help verify sources and information integrity. 
 Crisis of Trust:&nbsp;Investigating the impact of false information on public trust and how this crisis extends beyond the digital realm into societal fabric and governance. 
 Building Resilience:&nbsp;Strategies for individuals, organizations, and governments to foster resilience against false information through digital literacy, critical thinking, and technological solutions. 
 Policy and Governance:&nbsp;Insights into how policymakers and digital identity leaders can collaborate to establish frameworks that promote truth and transparency in the digital landscape. 
 
<p>Joni Brennan's keynote promises to be a thought-provoking journey through one of the most pressing issues of our time. Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of the misinformation crisis and practical insights into building and maintaining public trust in a world shaken by crises.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/how-to-build-public-trust-eic24"></a>

  <p>Around the globe countries and continents are taking practical steps towards digital identity infrastructure. Alongside these government initiatives standards bodies and working groups have been mapping a landscape for interoperability and scalability beyond borders.</p>
<p>The “Wallet” is emerging as a new citizen and customer channel replacing apps with more connected digital services. However, unlike payments, the international rules and technical specifications don’t yet exist to enable identity and data sharing beyond the enterprise or seamlessly across borders.</p>
<p>Will this new channel be won by the major operating systems from Google and Apple, building on familiar user experience? Or will important initiatives such as the Open Wallet Foundation and the vision for a digitally connected European Union create the benchmarks for interoperable and scalable services.</p>
<p>This keynote will explore these questions through the lens of a cross-border use case connecting continents, service and identity network providers, all united by overcoming the technical, legal, and commercial challenges to enable digital customers without borders.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/into-the-wild-and-beyond-the-enterprise-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development and deployment, the prominence of microservices and Kubernetes, allied with the Policy as Code paradigm, has significantly influenced the direction of authorization strategies. This surge in popularity brings to the forefront a critical question for this workshop: Can the agile, scalable solutions offered by Policy as Code effectively meet the nuanced requirements of traditional business application authorization, or are we trying to fit a square peg into a round hole?</p>
<p>This question does not presume a one-size-fits-all answer but opens the floor to a robust debate on the compatibility and potential gaps between these modern authorization practices and the enduring needs of business applications. The workshop will explore whether the principles of Policy as Code, celebrated for their seamless integration with contemporary cloud-native technologies, can be adapted or extended to serve the distinct, often more static, requirements of enterprise applications.</p>
<p>By inviting diverse perspectives from industry experts and analysts, we aim to dissect the strengths and limitations of Policy as Code within the broader context of application authorization. This exploration will not only shed light on the current state of authorization strategies but also encourage a forward-looking dialogue on how organizations might navigate the divergence between cutting-edge and traditional authorization needs. Can a harmonious solution be engineered to bridge this divide, or do we need distinct approaches to cater to the different landscapes of microservices/Kubernetes and business applications?</p>
<p>Attendees will leave this workshop equipped with a deeper understanding of the ongoing debate, better positioned to evaluate the suitability of Policy as Code for their own organizational needs and the broader implications for the future of authorization strategies.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/workshop-versus-traditional-business-needs-eic24"></a>

<p>In today’s competitive business environment, firms are confronted with complex, computational issues that demand swift resolution. Such problems might be too intricate for a single system to handle or might require an extended time to resolve. For companies that need quick answers, every minute counts. Allowing problems to linger for weeks or months is not feasible for businesses determined to stay ahead of the competition. To address these challenges, enterprises across various industries, such as those in the semiconductor, life sciences, healthcare, financial services and more, have embraced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/high-performance-computing">high-performance computing (HPC)</a>.</p>



<p>With HPC, enterprises are taking advantage of the speed and performance that comes with powerful computers working together. This can be especially helpful amid a steadily growing push to build AI on a larger and larger scale. While analyzing massive amounts of data might feel impossible, HPC enables the use of high-end computational resources that can perform many computations rapidly and in parallel to help businesses get insights faster. At the same time, HPC is used to help businesses bring new products to market. It is also used to better manage risks and more, which is why an increasing number of enterprises are adopting it.</p>



 The role of cloud in HPC 



<p>Most commonly, enterprises that run workloads with surges in activity are finding that they exceed the <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloud/blogs/terry-fisher/2024/02/28/achieving-the-impossible-rightsizing-your-hpc?CommunityKey=74d589b7-7276-4d70-acf5-0fc26430c6c0">compute capacity</a> available on-premises. This is an example of where cloud computing can augment on-premises HPC to transform the business’s approach to HPC with cloud resources. Cloud can help address peaks in demand during product development cycles, which might last from a short duration to a longer duration, and enable organizations to get access to the resources and capabilities that they might not have a need for around the clock. Businesses using HPC from the cloud can take advantage of the benefits of greater flexibility, enhanced scalability, better agility, improved cost efficiencies and more.</p>



 Cadence uses IBM Cloud HPC

 Taking a hybrid cloud approach to HPC 



<p>Traditionally, HPC systems were built on-premises. However, the large models and large workloads that exist today are often not compatible with the hardware that most companies have on premises. Given the high up-front costs of obtaining GPUs, CPUs and networking, as well as those of building the data center infrastructures needed to efficiently run compute at scale, many companies have used cloud infrastructure providers that have already made massive investments in their hardware. To realize the full value of public cloud and on-premises infrastructures, many organizations are adopting a hybrid cloud architecture that is focused on the mechanics of transforming portions of a company’s on-premises data center into private cloud infrastructure.</p>



<p>By adopting a <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloud/blogs/john-easton/2024/02/13/the-what-and-why-of-hpc-and-why-hybrid-matters?CommunityKey=74d589b7-7276-4d70-acf5-0fc26430c6c0">hybrid cloud approach to HPC</a> where cloud and on premises are used together, organizations can use the strengths of both, allowing organizations to achieve the agility, flexibility and security required to meet their demands. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/high-performance-computing">IBM Cloud® HPC</a> can help organizations flexibly manage compute-intensive workloads on-premises. With security and controls built into the platform, IBM Cloud HPC also allows organizations to consume HPC as a fully managed service while helping them address third- and fourth-party risks.</p>



 Looking ahead 



<p>By using hybrid cloud services through platforms like IBM Cloud HPC, enterprises can solve many of their most difficult challenges. As organizations continue to embrace HPC, they should consider how a hybrid cloud approach can complement traditional on-premises HPC infrastructure deployments.</p>

 What is a CPU? 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/central-processing-unit">central processing unit (CPU)</a> is the computer’s brain. It handles the assignment and processing of tasks and manages operational functions that all types of computers use.</p>



<p>CPU types are designated according to the kind of chip that they use for processing data. There’s a wide variety of processors and microprocessors available, with new powerhouse processors always in development. The processing power CPUs provide enables computers to engage in multitasking activities. Before discussing the types of CPUs available, we should clarify some basic terms that are essential to our understanding of CPU types.</p>



 Key CPU terms 



<p>There are numerous components within a CPU, but these aspects are especially critical to CPU operation and our understanding of how they operate:</p>



 
 Cache: When it comes to information retrieval, memory caches are indispensable. Caches are storage areas whose location allows users to quickly access data that’s been in recent use. Caches store data in areas of memory built into a CPU’s processor chip to reach data retrieval speeds even faster than random access memory (RAM) can achieve. Caches can be created through software development or hardware components. 
 



 
 Clock speed: All computers are equipped with an internal clock, which regulates the speed and frequency of computer operations. The clock manages the CPU’s circuitry through the transmittal of electrical pulses. The delivery rate of those pulses is termed clock speed, which is measured in Hertz (Hz) or megahertz (MHz). Traditionally, one way to increase processing speed has been to set the clock to run faster than normal. 
 



 
 Core: Cores act as the processor within the processor. Cores are processing units that read and carry out various program instructions. Processors are classified according to how many cores are embedded into them. CPUs with multiple cores can process instructions considerably faster than single-core processors. (Note: The term “Intel® Core™” is used commercially to market Intel’s product line of multi-core CPUs.) 
 



 
 Threads: Threads are the shortest sequences of programmable instructions that an operating system’s scheduler can independently administer and send to the CPU for processing. Through multithreading—the use of multiple threads running simultaneously—a computer process can be run concurrently. Hyper-threading refers to Intel’s proprietary form of multithreading for the parallelization of computations. 
 



 Other components of the CPU 



<p>In addition to the above components, modern CPUs typically contain the following:</p>



 
 Arithmetic logic unit (ALU): Carries out all arithmetic operations and logical operations, including math equations and logic-based comparisons. Both types are tied to specific computer actions. 



 Buses: Ensures proper data transfer and data flow between components of a computer system. 



 Control unit: Contains intensive circuitry that controls the computer system by issuing a system of electrical pulses and instructs the system to carry out high-level computer instructions. 



 Instruction register and pointer: Displays location of the next instruction set to be executed by the CPU. 



 Memory unit: Manages memory usage and the flow of data between RAM and the CPU. Also, the memory unit supervises the handling of cache memory. 



 Registers: Provides built-in permanent memory for constant, repeated data needs that must be handled regularly and immediately. 
 



 How do CPUs work? 



<p>CPUs use a type of repeated command cycle that’s administered by the control unit in association with the computer clock, which provides synchronization assistance.</p>



<p>The work a CPU does occurs according to an established cycle (called the CPU instruction cycle). The CPU instruction cycle designates a certain number of repetitions, and this is the number of times the basic computing instructions will be repeated, as enabled by that computer’s processing power.</p>



<p>The three basic computing instructions are as follows:</p>



 
 Fetch: Fetches occur anytime data is retrieved from memory. 



 Decode: The decoder within the CPU translates binary instructions into electrical signals, which engage with other parts of the CPU. 



 Execute: Execution occurs when computers interpret and carry out a computer program’s set of instructions. 
 



<p>Basic attempts to generate faster processing speeds have led some computer owners to forego the usual steps involved in creating high-speed performance, which normally require the application of more memory cores. Instead, these users adjust the computer clock so it runs faster on their machine(s). The “overclocking” process is analogous to “jailbreaking” smartphones so their performance can be altered. Unfortunately, like jailbreaking a smartphone, such tinkering is potentially harmful to the device and is roundly disapproved by computer manufacturers.</p>



 Types of central processing units 



<p>CPUs are defined by the processor or microprocessor driving them:</p>



 
 Single-core processor: A single-core processor is a microprocessor with one CPU on its die (the silicon-based material to which chips and microchips are attached). Single-core processors typically run slower than multi-core processors, operate on a single thread and perform the instruction cycle sequence only once at a time. They are best suited to general-purpose computing. 



 Multi-core processor: A multi-core processor is split into two or more sections of activity, with each core carrying out instructions as if they were completely distinct computers, although the sections are technically located together on a single chip. For many computer programs, a multi-core processor provides superior, high-performance output. 



 Embedded processor: An embedded processor is a microprocessor expressly engineered for use in embedded systems. Embedded systems are small and designed to consume less power and be contained within the processor for immediate access to data. Embedded processors include microprocessors and microcontrollers. 



 Dual-core processor: A dual-core processor is a multi-core processor containing two microprocessors that act independently from each other. 



 Quad-core processor: A quad-core processor is a multi-core processor that has four microprocessors functioning independently. 



 Octa-core: An octa-core processor is a multi-core processor that has eight microprocessors functioning independently. 



 Deca-core processor: A deca-core processor is an integrated circuit that has 10 cores on one die or per package. 
 



 Leading CPU manufacturers and the CPUs they make 



<p>Although several companies manufacture products or develop software that supports CPUs, that number has dwindled down to just a few major players in recent years.</p>



<p>The two major companies in this area are Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Each uses a different type of instruction set architecture (ISA). Intel processors use a complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture. AMD processors follow a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture.</p>



 
 Intel: Intel markets processors and microprocessors through four product lines. Its premium, high-end line is Intel Core. Intel’s Xeon® processors are targeted toward offices and businesses. Intel’s Celeron® and Intel Pentium® lines are considered slower and less powerful than the Core line. 
 



 
 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD sells processors and microprocessors through two product types: CPUs and APUs (which stands for accelerated processing units). APUs are CPUs that have been equipped with proprietary Radeon™ graphics. AMD’s Ryzen™ processors are high-speed, high-performance microprocessors intended for the video game market. Athlon™ processors was formerly considered AMD’s high-end line, but AMD now uses it as a basic computing alternative. 
 



 
 Arm: Although Arm doesn’t actually manufacture equipment, it does lease out its valued, high-end processor designs and/or other proprietary technologies to other companies who do make equipment. Apple, for example, no longer uses Intel chips in Mac® CPUs but makes its own customized processors based on Arm designs. Other companies are following this example. 
 



 Related CPU and processor concepts 



 Graphics processing unit (GPUs) 



<p>While the term “graphics processing unit” includes the word “graphics,” this phrasing does not truly capture what GPUs are about, which is speed. In this instance, its increased speed is the cause of accelerating computer graphics.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/gpu">GPU</a> is a type of electronic circuit with immediate applications for PCs, smartphones and video game consoles, which was their original use. Now GPUs also serve purposes unrelated to graphics acceleration, like cryptocurrency mining and the training of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a>.</p>



 Microprocessors 



<p>The quest for computer miniaturization continued when <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/computer-science#:">computer science</a> created a CPU so small that it could be contained within a small integrated circuit chip, called the microprocessor. Microprocessors are designated by the number of cores they support.</p>



<p>A CPU core is “the brain within the brain,” serving as the physical processing unit within a CPU. Microprocessors can contain multiple processors. Meanwhile, a physical core is a CPU built right into a chip, but which only occupies one socket, thus enabling other physical cores to tap into the same computing environment.</p>



 Output devices 



<p>Computing would be a vastly limited activity without the presence of output devices to execute the CPU’s sets of instruction. Such devices include peripherals, which attach to the outside of a computer and vastly increase its functionality.</p>



<p>Peripherals provide the means for the computer user to interact with the computer and get it to process instructions according to the computer user’s wishes. They include desktop essentials like keyboards, mice, scanners and printers.</p>



<p>Peripherals are not the only attachments common to the modern computer. There are also input/output devices in wide use and they both receive information and transmit information, like video cameras and microphones.</p>



 Power consumption 



<p>Several issues are impacted by power consumption. One of them is the amount of heat produced by multi-core processors and how to dissipate excess heat from that device so the computer processor remains thermally protected. For this reason, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperscale">hyperscale data centers</a> (which house and use thousands of servers) are designed with extensive air-conditioning and cooling systems.</p>



<p>There are also questions of sustainability, even if we’re talking about a few computers instead of a few thousand. The more powerful the computer and its CPUs, the more energy will be required to support its operation—and in some macro-sized cases, that can mean gigahertz (GHz) of computing power.</p>



 Specialized chips 



<p>The most profound development in computing since its origins, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> is now impacting most if not all computing environments. One development we’re seeing in the CPU space is the creation of specialty processors that have been built specifically to handle the large and complex <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workload">workloads</a> associated with AI (or other specialty purposes):</p>



 
 Such equipment includes the Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP), which handles <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> tasks in addition to AI applications. Other products equally suited to AI work are the AMD Ryzen Threadripper™ 3990X 64-Core processor and the Intel Core i9-13900KS Desktop Processor, which uses 24 cores. 



 For an application like video editing, many users opt for the Intel Core i7 14700KF 20-Core, 28-thread CPU. Still others select the Ryzen 9 7900X, which is considered AMD’s best CPU for video editing purposes. 



 In terms of video game processors, the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D features a 3D V-Cache technology that helps it elevate and accelerate game graphics. 



 For general-purpose computing, such as running an OS like Windows or browsing multimedia websites, any recent-model AMD or Intel processor should easily handle routine tasks. 
 



 Transistors 



<p>Transistors are hugely important to electronics in general and to computing in particular. The term is a mix of “transfer resistance” and typically refers to&nbsp;a component made of semiconductors used to limit and/or control the amount of electrical current flowing through a circuit.</p>



<p>In computing, transistors are just as elemental. The transistor is the basic building unit behind the creation of all microchips. Transistors help comprise the CPU, and they’re what makes the binary language of 0s and 1s that computers use to interpret Boolean logic.</p>



 The next wave of CPUs 



<p>Computer scientists are always working to increase the output and functionality of CPUs. Here are some projections about future CPUs:</p>



 
 New chip materials: The silicon chip has long been the mainstay of the computing industry and other electronics. The <a href="https://medium.com/@starcompseo/the-future-of-processors-emerging-technologies-and-trends-560f54ac0998#:~:text=The%20future%20of%20processors%20will,as%20autonomous%20vehicles%20and%20healthcare.">new wave </a>of processors (link resides outside ibm.com) will take advantage of new chip materials that offer increased performance. These include carbon nanotubes (which display excellent thermal conductivity through carbon-based tubes approximately 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), graphene (a substance that possesses outstanding thermal and electrical properties) and spintronic components (which rely on the study of the way electrons spin, and which could eventually produce a spinning transistor). 



 Quantum over binary: Although current CPUs depend on the use of a binary language, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">quantum computing</a> will eventually change that. Instead of binary language, quantum computing derives its core principles from quantum mechanics, a discipline that has revolutionized the study of physics. In quantum computing, binary digits (1s and 0s) can exist in multiple environments (instead of in two environments currently). And because this data will live in more than one location, fetches will become easier and faster. The upshot of this for the user will be a marked increase in computing speed and an overall boost in processing power. 
 



 
 AI everywhere: As artificial intelligence continues to make its profound presence felt—both in the computing industry and in our daily lives—it will have a direct influence on CPU design. As the future unfolds, expect to see an increasing integration of AI functionality directly into computer hardware. When this happens, we’ll experience AI processing that’s significantly more efficient. Further, users will notice an increase in processing speed and devices that will be able to make decisions independently in real time. While we wait for that hardware implementation to occur, chip manufacturer Cerebras has already unveiled a processor its makers claim to be the “<a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-fastest-ai-chip-in-the-world-gigantic-ai-cpu-has-almost-one-million-cores-cerebras-has-nvidia-firmily-in-its-sights-as-it-unveils-the-wse-3-a-chip-that-can-train-ai-models-with-24-trillion-parameters#:~:text=Pro-,'The%20fastest%20AI%20chip%20in%20the%20world'%3A%20Gigantic%20AI,models%20with%2024%20trillion%20parameters">fastest AI chip in the world</a>” (link resides outside ibm.com). Its WSE-3 chip can train AI models with as many as 24 trillion parameters. This mega-chip contains four trillion transistors, in addition to 900,000 cores. 
 



 CPUs that offer strength and flexibility 



<p>Companies expect a lot from the computers they invest in. In turn, those computers rely upon having a CPUs with enough processing power to handle the challenging workloads found in today’s data-intensive business environment.</p>



<p>Organizations need workable solutions that can change as they change. Smart computing depends upon having equipment that capably supports your mission, even as that work evolves. IBM servers offer strength and flexibility, so you can concentrate on the job at hand. Find the IBM servers you need to get the results your organization relies upon—both today and tomorrow.</p>

  The minimum threshold for Crypto Travel Rule in South Africa is R25,000 ($1,357).  CASPs must verify and share originator and beneficiary details for regulatory compliance.  CASPs need risk-based policies for handling transactions, especially with unhosted wallets, to mitigate financial crimes.  <p>With the majority of adults in Africa not having access to a bank account, cryptocurrency is widely popular in this continent. In sub-Saharan Africa, crypto adoption is among the highest in South&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>While cryptocurrency adoption is still in its infancy in the country, the authorities have initiated several initiatives, such as declaring crypto a financial product and implementing regulatory measures, including <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p> ‍Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in South&nbsp;Africa <p>‍In 2020, changes to the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FIC Act of FICA), which applies AML/CFT laws in South Africa, aligned its cryptocurrency regulatory framework with that of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s standards on crypto and exchange regulation.</p><p>This includes enacting the Crypto Travel Rule, which applies to crypto companies operating inside and outside South Africa. It is also imperative to mention that the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) is the one governing the crypto sector in South&nbsp;Africa.</p> ‍Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>‍South Africa’s IFWG <a href="https://www.treasury.gov.za/comm_media/press/2020/20200414%20IFWG%20Position%20Paper%20on%20Crypto%20Assets.pdf">2020 Position Paper on Crypto Assets</a> mandates the Crypto Travel Rule. According to this, originating and beneficiary Crypto Asset Service Providers or CASPs should obtain, hold, and provide accurate information on their customers.</p><p>On April 18, 2024, the FIC <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Draft-Directive-9-Travel-rule-relating-to-crypto-asset-transfers.pdf">published a draft directive</a> regarding the implementation of the “Travel Rule” regarding crypto transfers. The directive’s purpose is to ensure that those who engage in crypto transfer activities implement FATF’s recommendations. Those who fail to comply with this directive are subject to an administrative sanction.</p><p>The compliance requirement includes conducting customer identification and verification (KYC), developing and implementing a Risk Management and Compliance Programme, training employees, conducting customer due diligence (CDD), keeping accurate records, regularly monitoring for suspicious and unusual activity, and reporting any unusual transactions to the&nbsp;FIC.</p> ‍Compliance Requirements <p>‍Crypto asset service providers (CASPs) must report cash transactions over R25,000 ($1,357). They need to provide the following details: For originators:</p>  Full name  Wallet address  Residential address (if available)  Date and place of&nbsp;birth  Identity number for South Africans, or passport number for non-residents  <p>For Beneficiary:</p>  Name  Wallet address  <p>This data must be verified according to the FIC Act and the CASP’s Risk Management and Compliance Programme.</p><p>For cross-border transfers below R5,000 (about $270), CASPs must share the originator’s full name and wallet address, along with the beneficiary’s name and wallet address, without needing to verify the information unless there are concerns of money laundering or terrorism financing.</p><p>CASPs must also identify and vet the receiving CASP, ensuring it can protect data confidentiality and isn’t involved in illicit activities. They should not process transfers that cannot meet these security and verification requirements. Moreover, CASPs should have policies to decide when to suspend or reject a transfer that lacks necessary details, with procedures in place for any follow-up actions.</p><p>Finally, both originating and beneficiary CASPs are responsible for securely storing this information to ensure record accuracy and protection from unauthorized disclosure. Measures like post-event or real-time monitoring are also used to track transfers that are missing required information.</p> ‍Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>‍In South Africa, CASPs must register as “accountable institutions.” As of March 2024, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-financial-conduct-regulator-approves-59-crypto-licences-2024-03-13/#:~:text=JOHANNESBURG%2C%20March%2013%20(Reuters),with%20regulating%20the%20asset%20class.">the FSCA has approved 59 operating licenses</a> for crypto businesses, with another 262 applications under&nbsp;review.</p><p>Exchanges are required to monitor transfers between CASPs and those involving unhosted wallets — where owners control their private keys directly. Following the FIC directive, both the sending and receiving CASPs must develop and maintain risk-based policies for handling transfers to and from unhosted wallets. This includes establishing procedures for gathering additional information on these wallets when there’s an elevated risk of money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing.</p> ‍Global Context and Comparisons <p>‍As a member of FATF, South Africa was greylisted by the international agency in 2023. Since then, it has been <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/High-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/Increased-monitoring-february-2024.html">working with FATF</a> to strengthen the effectiveness of its AML/CFT&nbsp;regime.</p><p>‍<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/almost-70-of-all-fatf-assessed-countries-have-implemented-the-crypto-travel-rule">According to the latest FATF report</a>, South Africa has been labeled as “Partially Complaint,” along with Brazil, Denmark, Estonia, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Venezuela, regarding its implementation of the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> ‍Concluding Thoughts <p>‍To dissuade financial crimes and avoid increased monitoring by the FATF, South Africa has created a robust regulatory <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML/CFT framework</a> to govern crypto assets. With citizens’ interest in crypto growing and regulators providing a clear set of rules that are challenging to follow, South Africa believes these measures will help it attract more crypto companies and investor attention while mitigating risks.</p> ‍FAQs  ‍‍Q1: What is the minimum transaction amount that triggers the FATF Travel Rule in South&nbsp;Africa? <p>‍Transactions over R25,000 ($1,357) must comply with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> ‍Q2: What information must CASPs exchange under the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>‍CASPs must exchange detailed information, including the full names and wallet addresses of both the originator and beneficiary.</p> ‍Q3: What requirements apply to transactions involving unhosted wallets under the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>‍Transactions involving unhosted wallets require CASPs to implement risk-based policies to identify and mitigate potential financial crimes.</p> ‍Q4: What is the best Travel Rule solution for VASPs in South&nbsp;Africa? <p>‍Shyft Veriscope stands out as the best Travel Rule solution for VASPs in South Africa due to its automated counterparty VASP detection, secure peer-to-peer data transfer without third-party servers, and robust compliance features that align with FATF guidelines.</p> About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 16th May to 31th&nbsp;May <p>Welcome to the latest issue of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This edition unpacks the shifts in the US crypto regulatory landscape as the 2024 presidential elections draw near, highlighting how these changes could impact users and the broader crypto&nbsp;market.</p> Crypto is Now a Major Election&nbsp;Issue <p>With crypto now a hot topic in the US political scene, presidential candidates have reportedly started warming up to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Take Presidential candidate Donald Trump, for instance. Once a Bitcoin skeptic, calling it a “scam” in 2021, the former US President is now promising to protect citizens’ rights to own BTC and “stop Joe Biden’s crusade to crush&nbsp;crypto.”</p><p>He has made several other promises, including supporting the right to self-custody, ensuring the future of BTC remains in the US, opposing the creation of a CBDC, and advocating for the release of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht.</p><p>Additionally, Trump’s campaign has begun accepting crypto donations, and his crypto holdings have now surpassed $10&nbsp;million.</p><p>As a result, Trump’s potential return to the White House is being seen as “broadly positive” for&nbsp;crypto.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1794537413907214356">Image Source</a>)<p>In response, President Joe Biden also made a surprising shift as his re-election campaign began consulting crypto industry players for advice on “crypto policy moving forward.”</p><p>These outreach efforts, however, started just a few weeks ago, shortly after the Biden administration announced it would veto the SAB 121’s repeal, a bill that discourages banks and financial institutions from offering crypto custody services.</p> Change in Voters’ Crypto Perception <p>This growing political engagement with crypto is also shaping public&nbsp;opinion.</p><p>A recent Grayscale survey reveals a shift in how voters view crypto’s role in politics. Conducted by The Harris Poll from April 30 to May 2, the survey polled 1,768 adults planning to vote in the upcoming election.</p><p>The results highlight a cautious approach among potential investors: 44% of US voters who currently don’t own any crypto stated they are “waiting on additional policies and/or regulation” before making a purchase.</p><p>Millennial and GenZ voters, in particular, are strongly interested in crypto, with 62% seeing it as the “future of finance.”</p> SEC Approves Spot ETH&nbsp;ETFs <p>In a surprising move, the securities regulator approved 19b-4 applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, and Invesco Galaxy for Spot Ethereum ETFs last&nbsp;week.</p><p>What makes this interesting is that it happened despite the SEC considering Ether security, according to several&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Spot Ether ETFs, however, won’t begin trading yet as they await the necessary S-1 registration approvals. This process is expected to take a few weeks to a few&nbsp;months.</p> Crypto-favorable Bill also&nbsp;Approved <p>Another recent significant development is the approval of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the US House of Representatives. This act establishes a new legal framework for cryptocurrencies, aiming to provide regulatory clarity and promote&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The bill also gives the CFTC the regulatory authority to regulate crypto as a commodity when it runs on a decentralized blockchain and clarifies the jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and CFTC over digital asset&nbsp;markets.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1793400905028547009">Image Source</a>)<p>The bill was approved with a bipartisan 279–136 vote (with 208 Republicans and 71 Democrats voting in favor) despite the SEC Chairman Gary Gensler warning about “new regulatory gaps,” financial risks, and the bill undermining “decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts.”</p> Wisconsin’s Pension Funds Invests in Bitcoin&nbsp;ETF <p>Another interesting development came from Wisconsin, where the state-owned Wisconsin Pension Fund recently ventured into the cryptocurrency market by investing $180 million in a Bitcoin ETF. This move, constituting 0.1% of its total assets, represents a significant step towards integrating high-risk, potentially high-return investments into a traditionally conservative portfolio.</p><a href="https://x.com/saylor/status/1797535279278072302">(Image Source)</a><p>According to <a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/david-krause-on-the-state-of-wisconsin-investing-in-bitcoin/">Marquette University’s David Krause</a>, this strategic allocation not only introduces diversification but serves as a trial to gauge public reaction and could potentially act as an inflation hedge, thus redefining traditional investment strategies for pension&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Moreover, this approach might just set a precedent, prompting other US pension funds to consider similar investments in the evolving asset class of digital currencies.</p> Concluding Thoughts: What’s&nbsp;Ahead? <p>As we wrap up this edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, it’s clear that political support for crypto in the US could reshape the industry both here and globally. With key elections coming up and significant laws being passed, the future looks promising for wider crypto adoption. How these changes affect the global market will be something to&nbsp;watch.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-guide-for-south-africa">FATF Travel Rule Compliance Guide for South&nbsp;Africa</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-switzerland">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Switzerland</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-germany">FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Germany</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-mexico">Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Mexico</a></p><p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Streamline On-chain Compliance:<br>
Configure and Customize Anytime 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in May 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>I’m thrilled to announce a significant UX enhancement for self-services on compliance settings to our platform, reinforcing our commitment to providing a top-tier on-chain operating system for financial institutions and innovative companies.</p>
<p>Controlling tokenized securities means controlling the underlying token smart contracts. Our latest update simplifies this process, allowing you to streamline the compliance configuration of the smart contracts effortlessly. With easy-to-use interfaces, you can customize compliance rule settings anytime, ensuring your tokens enforce on-chain compliance with great flexibility to meet your needs.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Here’s how you can benefit from these updated self-service token settings:</p>
<p>Set up compliance on tokens anytime:&nbsp;Unlike other token standards, the ERC-3643 standard allows compliance configurations to be set up during token creation or after deployment, without requiring redeployment. Our user-friendly T-REX Platform makes it easy to deploy tokens and configure compliance settings, including identity eligibility, jurisdictions, supply rules, and transfer rules through simple forms. You can update compliance settings at any time.</p>
<p>Plug additional custom compliance rules to cover any use case:&nbsp;With the modular compliance capability of the ERC-3643 smart contracts, you can add compliance rules over time, ensuring flexibility and scalability. Our platform provides the most commonly used compliance settings and allows you to incorporate additional rules to tailor the setup for any specific use case.</p>
<p>Change tokenization providers made effortless:&nbsp;One of the key advantages of tokenized securities using ERC-3643 is their independent smart contract suite, ensuring no dependency on a software provider. Tokens can be imported from one tokenization platform to another, allowing issuers to switch to solutions that better address their pain points. We ensure that ERC-3643 tokens can be easily imported to our SaaS tokenization platform, making setup simple and efficient.</p>
<p>Our goal is to simplify token management for your operational teams, enabling you and your agents to effortlessly issue, manage, and distribute tokenized securities on your own.</p>

 Introduction to Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 



<p>If you’re delving into decentralized digital identity (SSI), understanding Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) is crucial. DIDs are unique identifiers that users can create and control without relying on third parties. They use cryptographic elements (public and private keys) to demonstrate ownership. At Extrimian, we provide comprehensive guidance to help you choose the right DID method for your needs.</p>



Source: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 | W3C: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/



 



 Disclaimer 



<p>This article covers only a few of the many points to consider when choosing a DID method. For a deeper understanding, we invite you to watch the following Extrimian Academy Masterclass: <a href="https://extrimian.io/courses/masterclass-what-to-consider-before-choosing-a-did-method/" title="">What to consider before choosing a DID Method.</a></p>



 Understanding DID Documents 



<p>Each DID comes with a DID document. This is a standard file that contains the DID controller’s public key, possibly other keys, and relevant metadata. This document is key for verifying the DID’s authenticity and enabling digital authentication and signing.</p>



 What Is a DID Method? 



<p>A DID method is a technical specification detailing how DIDs and their documents are created, resolved, and managed across systems. DID methods can vary, catering to different functionalities and infrastructure needs.</p>



<p>Learn more about DIDs or Decentralized Identifiers with this: <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="">DIDs Wiki</a></p>



 Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a DID Method 



 Subject of the DID 



 
 Individuals: Data protection regulations like GDPR impose strict requirements that DID methods must meet, including the ability to delete personal data. 



 Organizations: Often require advanced functionalities like managing multiple authorized signatories. 



 Objects (IoT): Need to support a high volume of transactions and secure interactions. 
 



 Legal and Regulatory Framework 



<p>The legal and regulatory environment is crucial when selecting a DID method. Privacy and data protection laws vary across jurisdictions and can influence the choice of method and infrastructure used.</p>



 Required Functionality vs. Technical Complexity 



<p>It’s important to balance the functionality you need against the technical complexity and infrastructure requirements. Some DID methods offer advanced features like key rotation and designated signatories but may be more costly to implement and maintain.</p>



 Regulation Compatibility 



<p>To comply with data protection regulations, it’s essential to choose a DID method that allows for efficient modification or deletion of personal information to respect privacy rights like the right to be forgotten.</p>



 Examples of DID Methods 



 
 DID Web: Uses standard URLs for resolvability via HTTP/S. Ideal for web interoperability. 



 DID Key: Creates DIDs directly from cryptographic keys. Suitable for straightforward setups. 



 DID ION: Based on Bitcoin, it offers a scalable and secure solution. Recommended for high-security needs. 



 DID QuarkID: A decentralized, open, extensible, and multi-chain SSI protocol. Perfect for flexible digital identity management in Latin America. 
 



<p>For more examples, visit the <a href="https://identity.foundation/" title="">DIF documentation</a>.</p>



 Quick Guide: 10 Questions to Choose a DID Method 



<p>Here’s a quick guide from Extrimian with key questions to help you select a DID method that fits your legal, security, and functionality needs:</p>



 
 What type of entity does the DID represent (individual, organization, IoT device)? 



 What are the legal and regulatory requirements in the entity’s jurisdiction? 



 Does the DID method allow for data deletion to comply with regulations like GDPR? 



 What level of security is required for the specific application? 



 What advanced functionalities are needed (key rotation, multiple signatories, etc.)? 



 What is the estimated cost of implementation and maintenance of the DID method? 



 Is it necessary for the DID method to support a high volume of transactions? 



 How critical are ease of resolution and web interoperability for the application? 



 Does the DID method allow for efficient modification or deletion of personal information? 



 How flexible is the DID method to adapt to future needs and technological changes? 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Choosing a DID method involves a detailed understanding of the subject, legal and regulatory requirements, and specific functional needs against technical complexity and costs. At Extrimian, we can assist you with our expertise in defining and implementing suitable solutions. <a href="https://extrimian.com/contact" title="">Contact us</a> for more information and support.</p>

<p>In the realm of software development, efficiency and innovation are of paramount importance. As businesses strive to deliver cutting-edge solutions at an unprecedented pace, generative AI is poised to transform every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unleashing-developer-productivity-with-generative-ai">McKinsey study</a> shows that software developers can complete coding tasks up to twice as fast with generative AI. From use case creation to test script generation, generative AI offers a streamlined approach that accelerates development, while maintaining quality. This ground-breaking technology is revolutionizing software development and offering tangible benefits for businesses and enterprises.</p>



 Bottlenecks in the software development lifecycle 



<p>Traditionally, software development involves a series of time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks. For instance, creating use cases require meticulous planning and documentation, often involving multiple stakeholders and iterations. Designing data models and generating Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) demand significant effort and expertise. Moreover, techno-functional consultants with specialized expertise need to be onboarded to translate the business requirements (for example, converting use cases into process interactions in the form of sequence diagrams).</p>



<p>Once the architecture is defined, translating it into backend Java Spring Boot code adds another layer of complexity. Developers must write and debug code, a process that is prone to errors and delays. Crafting frontend UI mock-ups involves extensive design work, often requiring specialized skills and tools.</p>



<p>Testing further compounds these challenges. Writing test cases and scripts manually is laborious and maintaining test coverage across evolving codebases is a persistent challenge. As a result, software development cycles can be prolonged, hindering time-to-market and increasing costs.</p>



<p>In summary, traditional SDLC can be riddled with inefficiencies. Here are some common pain points:</p>



 
 Time-consuming Tasks: Creating use cases, data models, Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), sequence diagrams and test scenarios and test cases creation often involve repetitive, manual work. 



 Inconsistent documentation:&nbsp;Documentation can be scattered and outdated, leading to confusion and rework. 



 Limited developer resources:&nbsp;Highly skilled developers are in high demand and repetitive tasks can drain their time and focus. 
 



 The new approach: IBM watsonx to the rescue 



<p><a href="https://www.tcs.com/">Tata Consultancy Services</a>, in partnership with IBM®, developed a point of view that incorporates IBM watsonx™. It can automate many tedious tasks and empower developers to focus on innovation. Features include:</p>



 
 Use case creation:&nbsp;Users can describe a desired feature in natural language, then watsonx analyses the input and drafts comprehensive use cases to save valuable time. 



 Data model creation:&nbsp;Based on use cases and user stories, watsonx can generate robust data models representing the software’s data structure. 



 ERD generation:&nbsp;The data model can be automatically translated into a visual ERD, providing a clear picture of the relationships between entities. 



 DDL script generation: Once the ERD is defined, watsonx can generate the DDL scripts for creating the database. 



 Sequence diagram generation: watsonx can automatically generate the visual representation of the process interactions of a use case and data models, providing a clear understanding of the business process. 



 Back-end code generation:&nbsp;watsonx can translate data models and use cases into functional back-end code, like Java Springboot. This doesn’t eliminate developers, but allows them to focus on complex logic and optimization. 



 Front-end UI mock-up generation:&nbsp;watsonx can analyze user stories and data models to generate mock-ups of the software’s user interface (UI). These mock-ups help visualize the application and gather early feedback. 



 Test case and script generation:&nbsp;watsonx can analyse code and use cases to create automated test cases and scripts, thereby boosting software quality. 
 



 Efficiency, speed, and cost savings 



<p>All of these watsonx automations lead to benefits, such as:</p>



 
 Increased developer productivity:&nbsp;By automating repetitive tasks, watsonx frees up developers’ time for creative problem-solving and innovation. 



 Accelerated time-to-market:&nbsp;With streamlined processes and automated tasks, businesses can get their software to market quicker, capitalizing on new opportunities. 



 Reduced costs:&nbsp;Less manual work translates to lower development costs. Additionally, catching bugs early with watsonx-powered testing saves time and resources. 
 



 Embracing the future of software development 



<p>TCS and IBM believe that generative AI is not here to replace developers, but to empower them. By automating the mundane tasks &nbsp;and generating artifacts throughout the SDLC, watsonx paves the way for faster, more efficient and more cost-effective software development. Embracing platforms like IBM watsonx is not just about adopting new technology, it’s about unlocking the full potential of efficient software development in a digital age.</p>

<p>The new era of generative AI has spurred the exploration of AI use cases to enhance productivity, improve customer service, increase efficiency and scale IT modernization.</p>



<p>Recent <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters">research</a> commissioned by IBM® indicates that as many as 42% of surveyed enterprise-scale businesses have actively deployed AI, while an additional&nbsp;40%&nbsp;are actively exploring the use of AI technology. But the rates of exploration of AI use cases and deployment of new AI-powered tools have been slower in the public sector because of potential risks.</p>



<p>However, the <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-05-16-IBM-Study-As-CEOs-Race-Towards-Gen-AI-Adoption,-Questions-Around-Workforce-and-Culture-Persist">latest CEO Study by the IBM Institute for the Business Value</a> found that 72% of the surveyed government leaders say that the potential productivity gains from AI and automation are so great that they must accept significant risk to stay competitive.</p>



 Driving innovation for tax agencies with trust in mind 



<p>Tax or revenue management agencies are a part of the public sector that might likely benefit from the use of responsible AI tools. Generative AI can revolutionize tax administration and drive toward a more personalized and ethical future. But tax agencies must adopt AI tools with adequate oversight and governance to mitigate risks and build public trust.</p>



<p>These agencies have a myriad of complex challenges unique to each country, but most of them share the goal of increasing efficiency and providing the transparency that taxpayers demand.</p>



<p>In the world of government agencies, risks associated to the deployment of AI present themselves in many ways, often with higher stakes than in the private sector. Mitigating data bias, unethical use of data, lack of transparency or privacy breaches is essential.</p>



<p>Governments can help manage and mitigate these risks by relying on IBM’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics-focus-areas">five fundamental properties</a>&nbsp;for trustworthy AI: explainability, fairness, transparency, robustness and privacy. Governments can also create and execute AI design and deployment strategies that keep humans at the hearth of the decision-making process.</p>



 Exploring the views of global tax agency leaders 



<p>To explore the point of view of global tax agency leaders, the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ibm-cbg/">IBM Center for The Business of Government</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/american-university/">American University</a> Kogod School of Business Tax Policy Center, organized a series of roundtables with key stakeholders and released a <a href="https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/AI%20and%20The%20Modern%20Tax%20Agency.pdf">report</a> exploring AI and taxes in the modern age. Drawing on insights from academics and tax experts from around the world, the report helps us understand how these agencies can harness technology to improve efficiencies and create a better experience for taxpayers.</p>



<p>The report details the potential benefits of scaling the use of AI by tax agencies, including enhancing customer service, detecting threats faster, identifying and tackling tax scams effectively and allowing citizens to access benefits faster.</p>



<p>Since the release of the report, a subsequent roundtable allowed global tax leaders to explore what is next in their journey to bring tax agencies around the globe closer to the future. At both gatherings, participants emphasized the importance of <a href="https://www.businessofgovernment.org/blog/ai-tax-administrations-governance-and-innovation">effective governance and risk management</a>.</p>



 Responsible AI services improve taxpayer experiences  



<p>According to the FTA’s <a href="https://read.oecd.org/10.1787/900b6382-en?format=html">Tax Administration 2023</a>&nbsp;report, 85% of individual taxpayers and 90% of businesses now file taxes digitally. And 80% of tax agencies around the world are implementing leading-edge techniques to capture taxpayer data, with over 60% using virtual assistants. The <a href="https://read.oecd.org/10.1787/900b6382-en?format=html">FTA research</a>&nbsp;indicates that this represents a 30% increase from 2018.</p>



<p>For tax agencies, virtual assistants can be a powerful way to reduce waiting time to answer citizen inquiries; 24/7 assistants, such as watsonx™’s advanced AI chatbots, can help tax agencies by decentralizing tax support and reducing errors to prevent incorrect processing of tax filings. The use of these AI assistants also helps streamline fast, accurate answers that deliver elevated experiences with measurable cost savings. It also allows for compliance-by-design tax systems, providing early warnings of incidental errors made by taxpayers that can contribute to significant tax losses for governments if left unresolved.</p>



<p>However, these advanced AI and generative AI applications come with risks, and agencies must address concerns around data privacy and protection, reliability, tax rights and hallucinations from generative models.</p>



<p>Furthermore, biases against marginalized groups remain a risk. Current risk mitigation strategies (including having human-in-system roles and robust training data) are not necessarily enough. Every country needs to independently determine appropriate risk management strategies for AI, accounting for the complexity of their tax policies and public trust.</p>



 What’s next? 



<p>Whether using existing large language models or creating their own, global tax leaders should prioritize AI governance frameworks to manage risks, mitigate damage to their reputation and support their compliance programs. This is possible by training generative AI models using their own quality data and by having transparent processes with safeguards that identify and alert for risk mitigation and for instances of drift and toxic language.</p>



<p>Tax agencies should make sure that technology delivers benefits and produces results that are transparent, unbiased and appropriate. As leaders of these agencies continue to scale the use of generative AI, IBM can help global tax agency leaders deliver a personalized and supportive experience for taxpayers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technical interoperability refers to the ability of different systems, devices, applications, or components to connect, communicate, and exchange data seamlessly and effectively. This involves adhering to common standards and protocols to ensure compatibility, enabling diverse systems to work together without requiring significant modifications.</p>
</blockquote>
 Introduction 
<p>As more ecosystems look to enable digital trust architectures for their participants, interoperability continues to be deemed important but often misunderstood. If you’re working towards enabling a digital trust ecosystem for B2C use cases, consider the following questions:</p>
 
 What ‘technical interoperability’ strategy should you consider to ensure maximum uptake and value creation for your ecosystem? 
 What technical dependencies exist in outside ecosystems when it comes to credentials and wallets? 
 
<p>In my opinion, it looks likely that Government Wallets and OEM Wallets will dominate the storage of high-value personal identity credentials, both in the short term and potentially in the long term. This means that not only will government credential issuers define their own issuance technical requirements, but they will also place conditions on what wallets their issued credentials can be issued to, what technical stack these wallets support, and even business logic.</p>
<p>This raises an important question for non-government credential issuers, verifiers, and ecosystem governance authorities: Should you invest time and resources in defining new technical interoperability profiles, or what your ecosystem will support? Or is this effort redundant if your goal is to verify high-value personal identity credentials?</p>
 Defining Your Ecosystem Strategy 
<p>When thinking about how to best benefit your ecosystem with digital trust tools, here are some considerations to think about:</p>
 
 Ecosystem Goals: Define your business goals. Define the primary functions and goals of your ecosystem. Define your locus of governance and influence. This helps in understanding the scope and the specific needs of your ecosystem. What ecosystems are you working in, and do they fit together nicely? 
 Bootstrapping: Decide whether or not your ecosystem requires a foundational credential from outside your ecosystem to get started. If so, understand the technical interoperability requirements of that system to know what bridges are needed to first become a consumer of credentials. 
 Wallet: Decide where it makes sense for your ecosystem’s credentials to be issued to. Should there be any conditions on what wallets can receive these credential offers? 
 Consuming External Inputs: Understand what additional inputs your ecosystem needs from external ecosystems and how these can be consumed by your participants. This involves defining the necessary bridges and ensuring compatibility with external profiles to create a frictionless user experience. 
 Providing Outputs Externally: Determine if your ecosystem wants to produce outputs that are usable by other ecosystems. This might involve aligning with common standards and external ecosystem interoperability profiles. 
 
 Interoperability Profiles and Wallet Compliance 
<p>If your ecosystem requires consuming credentials from external ecosystems and their wallets (Bootstrapping), you will need to demonstrate alignment to their technical profiles.</p>
<p>Examples of technical interoperability profiles that Governments Issuers, Government Wallets and OEM Wallet providers are aligning to include the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile#aries-interop-profile-version-10">Aries Interop Profile 1.0</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md">Aries Interop Profile 2.0</a>, the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO mDL profile (ISO 18013-5)</a>, the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-sd-jwt-vc-1_0-00.html">OpenID4VC High Assurance Interoperability Profile with SD-JWT VC</a>, the <a href="https://dutchblockchaincoalition.org/en/bouwstenen-2/diip-2">Dutch Decentralized Identity Interop Profile (DIIP)</a>, and others. You’ll notice that they all make hard decisions on credential exchange protocols, credential formats, identifier types, signatures schemes, revocation methods and more. Further, some credentials are bound to wallets, others aren’t – this may be valuable for you to know for your own use cases.</p>
<p>If you decide that it’s not important for your ecosystem and its participants to exert any sort of wallet control today, does it make sense to have your ecosystem credentials issued to these government or OEM wallets? A positive aspect of this approach is that your credentials will sit alongside high-value identity credentials and can be used in conjunction with them during verification interactions. A potential downside is the dependency on these third-party wallets, which could pose risks in the future. However, this approach is straightforward, as illustrated in the next section when we discuss practical examples.</p>
<p>If it is important for you and your participants to exert control over wallets, consider whether you are dependent on other ecosystems to bootstrap your use case. If the answer is no, then think about the demand side for your ecosystem’s credentials. Will demand come from external ecosystems outside of your governance, or solely from within your ecosystem?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, and governments are unlikely to issue credentials to non-government or OEM wallets in the near term, it’s crucial to consider user flows and associated risks. If you’re conducting proofs by accepting credentials from third-party wallets and want to extend a credential offer to participants in your ecosystem-approved wallets, ensure the user experience remains smooth and the risk vectors low. This is particularly important given the difficulty of conducting app-to-app binding for data exchanges on certain mobile phones.</p>
 Practical Examples and User Experience 
 Vancouver’s Digital Credentials Initiative 
<p>A practical example of this concept is the <a href="https://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/vancouver-leads-development-of-credentials-technology-may-2024.aspx">City of Vancouver’s initiative to modernize city services using digital credentials</a>. In collaboration with Technical Safety BC (TSBC), the Land Title and Survey Authority of BC (LTSA), and the Ministry of Citizens’ Services, Vancouver is issuing digital credentials to municipal residents to streamline processes such as permitting and licensing.</p>
 
 Ecosystem Goals: The City of Vancouver, and broader municipal primary function is to modernize city services by reducing manual verification steps in permitting and licensing processes. Their locus of governance is municipal services. 
 Bootstrapping: Vancouver’s initiative relies on foundational credentials issued by provincial partners such as the Ministry of Citizens’ Services (<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/online-identity/person-credential/">Person credential</a>, and BC Registries (<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/online-identity/digital-business-card/">Digital Business Card</a>). 
 Wallet: The city has decided that it makes sense for their ecosystem to rely on the provincial wallet as a utility for their ecosystem’s credentials. There’s limited value in them owning the wallet experience as there is a direct dependency between the municipality and the province. 
 Consuming External Inputs: Beyond consuming provincial credentials, the municipality integrates inputs from provincial partners such as Technical Safety BC (TSBC), the Land Title and Survey Authority of BC (LTSA) to enable more modernization of municipal services. 
 Providing Outputs Externally: Vancouver produces digital credentials that can be used by other government ecosystem organizations. 
 
<p>After answering these questions, it’s clear that technical interoperability isn’t a complicated discussion. The fact that the ecosystem is localized makes a difference as well. Therefore, a decision was made to align with the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-wallet">BC Wallet</a> (based on Aries Interop Profile 1.0).</p>
 Airlines and Seamless Travel Initiatives 
<p>There are many other efforts underway within the airlines to improve customer journeys through the use of digital credentials and other digital trust tools. Being an IATA Strategic Partner allows Northern Block to have purview over active industry efforts to modernize travel experiences.</p>
 
 Ecosystem Goals: Airlines aim to provide seamless travel experiences through identity management, offer management, payments and fulfillments.&nbsp; 
 Bootstrapping: Airlines may require foundational government personal identity credentials such prior to issuing their own credentials to customers. 
 Wallet: Airlines require direct interactions with their customers, therefore any wallet functionalities must be embedded within their existing channels. 
 Consuming External Inputs: Outside of government-issued credentials, airlines may need to consume credentials from other travel ecosystem participants such as airports for security clearances, loyalty providers for frequent flier benefits, and retailers for duty-free shopping privileges. 
 Providing Outputs Externally: Just like airlines will value the consumption of credentials from third parties, these same third parties will also value airline issued credentials within their business processes. 
 
<p>Airlines must remain in control of their products, money flows and data. This changes the outlook around technical interoperability profiles compared to the first example with the City of Vancouver.</p>
<p>To this end, airlines prefer to integrate wallet capabilities into their existing mobile apps. Their customers are already using these apps, and customer data is crucial for creating personalized travel experiences. Their interoperability story gets more complex considering the ecosystem needs and the global footprint of the industry. Ongoing work is happening to address industry technical interoperability challenges.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>In summary, while evaluating technical interoperability profiles for your ecosystem might seem like a daunting task, we hope this blog has provided valuable insights on how to approach this challenge. It may not be as complicated as you think, and you may not need to overanalyze the short-term implications. As the adoption of digital credentials grows, you can adapt to the evolving landscape. The key is to start by demonstrating value to your ecosystem and build from there.<br>

 We unpack our ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’ and reveal the different priorities of global and Latin American operators. 



<p>The gross gaming revenue (GGR) of the Latin American (LATAM) gambling market is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1326686/betting-market-gross-gaming-revenue-latin-america/">projected to exceed $3.4 billion</a> by the end of 2025. Considering the GGR in 2020 was just $1.3 billion, this is a huge leap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many reasons for LATAM’s projected rapid growth, including the opening of multiple lucrative markets and simply the sheer number of potential players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2024/02/12/colombia-2024-gambling-tax/">Colombia</a>, which has had relatively clear regulation since 2016, many Latin American countries are either in their infancy or gestation phases, meaning they have a valuable opportunity to learn from the mistakes and successes that established markets have already made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand the challenges facing gambling operators, new and old, we commissioned the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-top-compliance-challenges-2024/">‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’</a>, featuring insights and opinions from 104 global compliance professionals from the gambling industry. Respondents were a mixture of the old guard, including the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">UK</a>, Malta and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">Germany</a> to the new like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/peru-gambling-regulation/">Peru</a> and Chile. In this blog we explore the differences in responses between global players and LATAM operators and consider the reasons.</p>



 Top compliance concerns for LATAM operators. 



<p>In answer to the question, ‘How challenging for your business are the following compliance issues’, there did appear to be consensus on the most difficult issue, with 30% of LATAM operators and 22.73% of global respondents choosing the ‘Source of funds check’ option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most interesting, but perhaps unsurprising compliance challenges for LATAM (considering its ever-changing regulatory landscape) was ‘Staying up to date with regulatory changes’, with more than one in five (22.2%) saying it was the most difficult challenge, compared to just 6% of global respondents.</p>



<p>[Read more about the regulatory status of some of the biggest LATAM markets later in the blog.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other stark difference in responses was the 22.2% of LATAM respondents that cited ‘Licensing and permissions’ as the most difficult compliance challenge, compared to just 7.58% of global respondents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With the LATAM gambling market so early in its journey toward regulation, it’s understandable that almost half of LATAM respondents list regulatory concerns and licensing and permission as their most difficult compliance challenges. From rates of taxation and anti-money laundering policies to licensing requirements and responsible gambling measures, each country is approaching issues slightly differently.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>As many LATAM countries are at a similar stage, there is also a very real game of ‘let’s wait to see what our neighbors are doing’ being played out. A game of chicken, if you will, of who’ll move first and what path will they take.</p>Ronaldo Kos, Head of LATAM Gaming at IDnow.</blockquote>



 The global impact of fraud. 



<p>When asked which types of fraud they had been subjected to in the last 12 months, there were negligible differences between responses, with bonus abuse (Global: 65.57% LATAM: 70%) and document fraud (Global: 57.38% LATAM: 50%) the two most common fraud attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, operators based in LATAM said that they had not been subjected to any money laundering in the last 12 months, whereas almost one in five global operators (19.67%) said they had. Whether this is indicative of fewer Latin American money launderers or less robust AML controls in LATAM gambling platforms is up for debate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the next 12 months, respondents cited both <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">‘Bonus abuse’</a> (Global: 54.10%, LATAM: 80%) and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">‘Social engineering’</a> (Global: 54.10%, LATAM: 60%) as the top areas for concern.</p>



 AI and the different approaches in fighting fraud and optimizing onboarding. 



<p>As gambling operators scale and look for ways to expand their business, especially during periods of increased activity, many have implemented AI-based tools to help in their fight against fraud, but perhaps not as many as you think.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, despite AI’s ability to increase automation, reduce costs and act as an effective fraud prevention tool, just over a third of global respondents (36%), and under a third of LATAM respondents (30%) said they were currently using AI to fight fraud. Interestingly, however, LATAM operators appear to be more forward-thinking regarding the implementation of AI-based tools in the next 12 months, with 50% saying they have plans to implement vs just 37.70% of global respondents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The extensive consultation periods on Brazil’s gambling regulations, and on the technical, payment and security requirements operators must follow (including geolocation requirements) clearly shows that LATAM operators are taking the threat of fraud very seriously.</p>



<p>Operators be warned: if you’re not taking advantage of the benefits of AI-based tools to enhance your identity verification efforts, or bolster your fraud-prevention arsenal, then know that fraudsters are probably using them to attack you.</p>



<p>“While in the past, cybercriminals needed a certain base level of technical skills to produce fake documents or websites, AI-augmented fraudsters can utilize generative AI to create authentic-looking documents, videos, images and audio,” said Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow.</p>



<p>Of course, the other major use case for implementing AI tools is to aid with huge volumes of new customers.</p>



 







<p>“Onboarding is the most crucial stage of the customer journey, so it should be as seamless as possible. While the above data speaks to the myriads of different components that operators deem as ‘very important,’ it also reveals some interesting difference between the priorities of global and LATAM operators. </p>



<p>“For example, almost 7 out of 10 global respondents agreed that ‘Security and data privacy’ was very important, but only 37.5% of LATAM respondents agreed. A similar disparity was also seen for ‘Cost’, with almost double the number of global respondents (25.49%) citing it as a very important factor compared to LATAM respondents (12.5%),” said&nbsp;Ronaldo.</p>



<p>Clearly, LATAM operators are prepared to make the necessary financial investment and although concerned about security and data privacy, remain less so than their global counterparts, suggesting they are eager to enter the market and participate by any means necessary.</p>



 Get onboard. Pick-ups and drop-offs. 



<p>While global operators believed there were a variety of reasons that customers abandoned onboarding, including Registration; Document Verification; Selfie Checks and Document Submission, the only area that appears to be a cause for concern for LATAM operators is ‘Document submission.’ In the ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey,’ we separated Document submission into two categories: a) including personal information; bank statements; utility bills (Global: 50.98% LATAM: 62.5%) and ‘b: ID documents (Global: 13.73% LATAM: 37.5%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two most common other factors that deter players from completing onboarding were an ‘Extensive KYC process’ (Global: 60.78% LATAM: 100%) and a ‘Complex and lengthy registration’ (Global: 54.90% LATAM: 75%).</p>



 All onboard: All eyes on Brazil. 



<p>The grey areas in which many LATAM countries’ gambling communities exist has meant that onboarding processes have historically either been non-existent or light touch; perhaps requiring players to just submit a name and address. As KYC and identity verification is the cornerstone of any trustworthy customer-business relationship within a regulated market, this will change dramatically. In the highly anticipated market of Brazil, for example, onboarding will become more complex than it’s ever been. Practically overnight (likely one night at the end of 2024), operators will be required to perform a three-step identification process, each of which carries a unique challenge.</p>



  Due to each Brazilian region having its own form of identity document, operators will need the capability to process a wide range of different documents<br>  Another requirement for operators is the ability to verify citizens’ Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas (Natural Persons Register) number<br>  Biometric verification will also be mandated, with weekly facial reverifications to become a requirement  



<p>“Although such measures have long been in place for financial services, for many Brazilian gambling operators and players, these onboarding requirements will be completely new, so it’s important that operators are able to comply with regulations while still offering an attractive-enough user experience to ensure players migrate over from the grey market to the regulated market,” said Rayissa Armata, Director of Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>



 5 LATAM countries to place your bets on in 2025. 



 Brazil&nbsp; 



<p>Perhaps the LATAM market with the most potential, Brazil&nbsp;will roll out the particulars of its new gaming policies in a series of ordinances released in four phases throughout the coming months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first phase (featuring the technical, payment and security requirements operators must follow) wrapped at the end of the April. The remaining three stages will be held throughout May, June and July:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stage two:&nbsp; AML/KYC and bettors’ rights;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stage three: Technical and security standards and advertising;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stage four: Industry contributions to social responsibility clauses;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, the Ministry of Finance will implement the approved sports betting by the end of July 2024, and operators will have six months to become compliant in order to participate in LATAM’s largest gambling market. Perhaps most eagerly anticipated, Brazil issued an ordinance on May 22 that allows operators to apply for licenses to offer sports betting and online gaming.</p>



 Peru&nbsp; 



<p>Peru has a long-standing relationship with gambling and is one of a few South American countries to have allowed local and international companies to operate online casinos and betting sites. In October 2023, Peru decided to introduce new gambling rules and licenses for local and international operators. Testament to the size of the market is the fact that Peru’s Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/licensing/peru-receives-145-licence-applications/">received 145 requests for operator licences</a> within the first 30 days. Read more about the gambling market in Peru in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/peru-gambling-regulation/">‘Open for business: Understanding gambling regulation in Peru.’</a></p>



 Argentina&nbsp; 



<p>The LATAM country with perhaps the most confusing regulatory environment (and that’s saying something) is without doubt Argentina. The main cause of the confusion is the fact that Argentina does not have one national regulatory body, and instead cedes control to each of its 24 autonomous jurisdictions. As two thirds of jurisdictions have legalized gambling, it makes for <a href="https://www.vixio.com/insights/gc-argentina-enacts-decree-raising-taxes-online-gambling">16 different regulatory regimes</a> throughout the country. Although differences between regimes are negligible, operators need to ensure they comply with each and every requirement to serve different region’s customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that Germany used to have a similar arrangement, with 16 different states offering unharmonized gaming requirements. Now that Germany has a central Gaming Authority operating under one gaming regime, the expectations are high that operators and gamers are moving away from the black market. Of course, it may take time to reap the benefits of a harmonized regime but considering stricter global requirements on Anti-Money Laundering and the roll out of digital identities, new regulations and digital services are here to stay.&nbsp;</p>

 Chile 



<p>In Chile, it’s not a question of ‘Will they?’ but more a case of ‘When will they?’ finally pass gambling regulation. Like many LATAM countries, until that happens, offshore operators have stepped into the void, circumnavigating domestic regulatory restrictions to offer gambling services to Chilean players. This will all be set to change when the Senate finally gives the green light to regulations. As said, when that will be is anyone’s guess (it was supposed to be finalized by 2023), but it is likely to be later this year or early 2025. For now, and for Chile’s Senate and National Congress, it’s back to the drawing board to find a resolution, in particular, regarding the <a href="https://casinobeats.com/2024/03/08/developments-continue-for-online-gambling-framework-in-chile/">legal status of operators currently offering services</a>.</p>



 Colombia&nbsp; 



<p>In Colombia, the <a href="https://practiceguides.chambers.com/practice-guides/gaming-law-2023/colombia">GGR generated from online gambling exceeded $56 million in 2022</a>. The industry is regulated as part of the Columbian Gambling Act 2002, which organizes the administration and control of the industry at both national and regional level. In this regard, the gaming industry in Colombia is considered a monopoly.</p>

 A story of debugging, despair and data integrity, where booleans in a DataFrame hold dark&nbsp;secrets  Introduction <p>As part of <a href="http://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a>, users are able to make money predicting token price trends. Of course, to enable reliable predictions, our dev team constantly works on improving the toolset. Crafting reliable and fast access to large amounts of data is not an easy task, and often we encounter puzzles like the one I’m about to show&nbsp;you.</p> In the name of&nbsp;speed <p>Recently, our team has started leveraging <a href="http://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a>, an SQL database management system for fast in-memory data access. Coupled with <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a>, a lightning fast DataFrame implementation, this gives predictoors a competitive edge. But what about tradeoffs? Speed matters, but not if it requires sacrifices to data integrity and precision. Which is why we run regular integrity checks and CI&nbsp;pipes.</p><p>One rainy day, an interesting issue popped up in one of our builds. It was definitely… mysterious. No one could reproduce it locally. But we relentlessly hunted it, cornered it and squashed it, albeit sometimes questioning our own&nbsp;sanity.</p><p>And while no bard will sing about the time booleans turned random and the valiant developers SSH-ed into Github Actions… well, it’s still a story of&nbsp;triumph.</p> A cute, harmless DataFrame <p>I will not use real Predictoor data to demonstrate, since those structures are still being developed. Instead, I will use this regular, vanilla, completely harmless data frame that shows people and&nbsp;apples:</p><p>The schema is inferred automatically from the data itself, so Polars knows that names are strings and ages and update timestamps are ints. It also shows our booleans just as they should be. The Arrow representation is uniform and nothing seems out of the ordinary.</p> To filter or not to&nbsp;filter? <p>Given our vanilla example above, a simple filter can and will change this idyllic situation. Let’s filter our DataFrame by age. And… you know what? I think everyone from Alice to Fiona deserves to stay with us. Everyone’s age is under 100, so filtering should produce an identical DataFrame. Right?</p><p>First, it seems so. Our filtered DataFrame looks identical to our unfiltered one. All its values are the same. But what if we look even&nbsp;closer?</p><p>Well, first, the arrow representation of the data frame is a bit off. You can see some weird grouping for each column, but it shouldn’t be of much concern. But then, we try to see what DuckDB sees, and suddenly most of our false values become true.&nbsp;Ayyyyyy…</p> How does FALSE become&nbsp;TRUE? <p>We must be dreaming. Let’s look at the data again, just to make&nbsp;sure:</p><p>Our Dataframes look the same, each value is equal to its counterpart, but DuckDB seems to think something else. That is because DuckDB uses the arrow representation of the DataFrame, which has splintered our contingous DataFrame into four different chunks. Polars represents its data in memory by contiguous allocation, but when we filtered the data, this left some… scars. Those scars are invisible to the naked eye, but indeed, calling n_chunks() on the filtered dataset gives us four different chunks. Same data, but organised differently under the&nbsp;hood.</p> What is happening under the&nbsp;hood? <p>So, what happens when DuckDB gets a hold of those chunks? The chunks represented by [false] are evaluated as boolean true, i.e. lists containing at least an element. Our “invisible scars” suddenly turn into a critical issue! Boolean values become unreliable, and we could end up saving the wrong value to persistent storage, via&nbsp;DuckDB.</p><p>Much of this is happening “under the hood”, so it’s difficult to figure out. But, luckily, the fix is very easy. After filtering, we simply run a rechunk() to make sure the memory is reallocated and everything is uniformly in&nbsp;place:</p> “Never tell me the&nbsp;odds” <p>Please note that this only happens on some architectures, only if large values are used as part of some columns (like the int64 here), only if chunks happen to contain single [false] values that unexpectedly evaluate to true. Filtering doesn’t always result in chunking, but keep in mind that lazy functions such as chunked reading from a file or vstack-ing DataFrames do have this chunking effect, which is almost invisible.</p><p>Yes, this perfect storm of corner cases is improbable. Alas, in programming, odds are irrelevant. If it can happen, it will happen. Murphy strikes&nbsp;again.</p> Conclusion <p>The moral of the story is to of course always inspect data for integrity, expect the unexpected when it comes to representations by 3rd parties and… keep a level head. Booleans do not go rogue overnight. It’s just a matter of finding out who told them to&nbsp;“rebel”.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>There's a post that hasn’t left your mind since you read it, and now you want to send it to a friend… but you can't find it anymore. We’ve been there before too. Let’s dive into all the tips and tricks for advanced Bluesky search!</p>
<p>Over time, we’ll make these features easier to use directly within the Bluesky app. Think of these as advanced features!</p>
 Find a specific phrase 
<p>Use quotes around keywords, like <code>"hello world"</code>.</p>
 
 Results include posts that use the phrase in its alt text on images as well. 
 
 Find posts with a specific hashtag 
<p>Any term that has the <code>#</code> prefix will show you posts with that tag. For example, if you searched for <code>#hello</code>, you’d see all posts that contain that hashtag.</p>
 Find posts that mention a specific user 
<p>Search for a handle like <code>@jay.bsky.team</code> to see posts that mention that user (in this example, Jay). If the user has changed handles, you may still get posts that mention their previous username too.</p>
 
 <code>to:jay.bsky.team</code> or <code>mentions:jay.bsky.team</code> also show posts that mention the user. 
 <code>mentions:me</code> will show you posts that mention your username, if you’re logged in. 
 If you use quotes around the username, like <code>"@jay.bsky.team"</code>, you will see results that include the text <code>@jay.bsky.team</code>, whether or not it actually tags Jay’s account. 
 
 Find posts from a specific user 
<p>Use <code>from:jay.bsky.team</code> to see posts from that user (in this example, Jay). If you’re logged in, you can use <code>from:me</code> to show your own posts.</p>
 
 You can use a combination of these keywords. For example, <code>to:jay.bsky.team from:me </code>shows my own posts that mention Jay. 
 
 Find posts that mention or are from you 
<p>If you are logged in, you can use the <code>me</code> keyword or search for your own username.</p>
 
 <code>from:me</code> shows your own posts 
 <code>mentions:me</code> shows posts that mention your username 
 
 Find a specific URL 
<p>Paste in a URL to see posts that have also shared that URL.</p>
 
 To see all posts with links from a specific domain, use <code>domain:example.com</code>. For example, searching for <code>domain:npr.org</code> shows you all posts that have linked an NPR article. 
 
 Find posts in a specific language 
<p>Use the keyword <code>lang</code> to search for posts in a specific language.</p>
 
 Use the two-character ISO language code. Wikipedia has a handy chart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes">here</a> — use the codes under the column “Set 1.” 
 For example, to see posts in English that have the keyword <code>"science"</code>, use the search term <code>lang:en "science"</code>. To see posts in Japanese that have the keyword <code>"science"</code>, use <code>lang:ja "science"</code>. 
 
 Find posts within a specific date range 
<p>Specify your date range with <code>since:</code> and/or <code>until:</code>. You can use full dates (YYYY-MM-DD format), or full UTC timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).</p>
 
 This currently does not work for local datetime/date or other time formats. Please use the UTC date. Here is a <a href="https://www.utctime.net/utc-time-zone-converter">timezone converter.</a> 
 
 Searching while logged in 
<p>We can customize your search results for you more when you are logged in, though users that are logged out are also able to search Bluesky.</p>
 
 You can use the <code>me</code> keyword when searching for your own posts or posts that mention you. 
 People that you follow are prioritized in search results when you search for accounts. 
 
 Developer API 
<p>Bluesky’s search API allows HTTP query params for most of these facets and filters. Read more in the developer documentation <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-actor-search-actors">here</a>.</p>

   CNN reports that operations at major U.S. nonprofit hospital network Ascension continue to be hobbled by a ransomware attack earlier this month, which nurses at its hospitals noted have begun to endanger patient safety amid the lack of "safety guardrails" as manual prescription information inputs and the lack of electronic health records persist in the aftermath of the incident.

 Why Real Gold Bars Tokenized Through Mattereum are a Step Change for the Blockchain <p>Mattereum has always talked about the importance of tokenized gold, we even ran a small number of gold bars through the system as proof of concept years back — it worked, we tokenized gold with a <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport</a> (MAP), listed it on OpenSea, sold it to buyers, who then used their NFT and MAP to go claim the gold bars from the vault. It was a bit rough, but it all worked, and this was <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/05/26/lohko-and-mattereum-launch-groundbreaking-verifiable-gold-bullion-nfts/">in 2021</a> — back when everyone else was still mostly talking about RWAs being some sort of vision for the future. You may ask “what is so amazing and revolutionary about this?” because other people already offer “tokenized gold”, but this is not the same — tokenized gold products such as <a href="https://paxos.com/paxgold/">Paxos</a> and <a href="https://gold.tether.to/">Tether Gold</a> are not tokenized gold per se, they are gold backed tokens, i.e. they are tokens whose value is guaranteed by gold owned by the issuers. This is an important difference. Mattereum works with partners to tokenize and fractionalize gold directly; that is, to create tokens that can be traded on the blockchain that also give the token holder actual legal ownership of the underlying physical gold itself. This is literally, ownership of a numbered, specific gold bar in a named vault that is owned by whoever owns the token, and they can, if they so wish, burn the token and take the physical gold home from the vault and hold it in their hands. The gold is owned by the token holder and not the token&nbsp;issuer.</p><blockquote>Mattereum works with partners to tokenize and fractionalize gold&nbsp;directly</blockquote>Tokenized Gold until now — a gold token connected by opaque legals to bars owned by the issuer in a vault somewhere<p>So, we did proof of concept. Now we have partnered with <a href="https://mattereum.com/2024/04/30/tokenized-gold/">Sempsa JP,</a> a Madrid-based globally recognized producer and distributor of precious metals, with decades of experience in the precious metals industry and renowned for its commitment to quality, integrity, and innovation. This partnership enables us to work with Sempsa JP to tokenize gold through our German regulated exchange partner <a href="https://mattereum.com/2023/07/23/announcing-swarm-x-mattereum-partnership/">Swarm</a> in quantity, giving investors immutable proof of ownership and provenance so that every token has a traceable, legally enforceable, connection to a specific gold bar in a named vault. This will offer unparalleled security, transparency, and accessibility worldwide under the protection of international law in over<a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/english"> 170 jurisdictions</a>.</p><blockquote>Every token has a traceable, legally enforceable, connection to a specific gold bar in a named&nbsp;vault</blockquote>Gold Tokenized through Mattereum &amp; Sempsa JP— A gold token giving its holder direct ownership of gold in a known&nbsp;vault<p>So why is this important? I think it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan">JP Morgan</a>, or one of those guys, a century or so back, who said “Gold is money! Silver is money! Everything else is credit!” That’s the absolutely hardline position. That is because gold is a hedge against risk in some global sense. In the same way that Bitcoin is a hedge against risk in some global sense, but there are slightly different hypotheses for gold and Bitcoin about what happens if the existing fiat regime crumbles. The difference between the two is that Bitcoin is appreciating value very, very quickly and is extremely volatile. It is also subject to regulatory attack. Gold is accumulating value relatively slowly, but it is doing so steadily and is dramatically less volatile; it is also dramatically less subject to attack. The bottom line is that gold is extremely likely to hold value globally, even in a regime where the US dollar is in trouble. You don’t want to be 100% in Bitcoin as it may not, ultimately, hold its value, and because Bitcoin may also get into trouble with regulators. Gold on chain, though, gives you a lot of the same advantages that Bitcoin does, but with dramatically lower volatility. And there is a pretty good chance that even in your nightmare scenarios your legal claim on the gold, if it was done properly, through Mattereum, will&nbsp;survive.</p><blockquote>“Gold is money! Silver is money! Everything else is&nbsp;credit!”</blockquote><p>Now we get to the Mattereum role in this. It begins and ends with the ultra transparent documentation value provided by the Mattereum Asset Passport. There are a bunch of things that can be wrong with a gold bar. The most common problem with a gold bar is that you don’t actually own it. You have a piece of paper that says somebody owes you a gold bar, you go and ask him for the gold bar, it turns out that they do not own the gold bar, and there’s an entire industry around all of those issues. It’s not uncommon for people to sell your gold bar or lend the gold bar out to somebody else for interest. Then, at the point where you ask them for your gold bar, they go and get another gold bar from a third vendor, because the gold bar that you gave them is out for loan and if you need a bunch of gold in a hurry, they borrow it from somebody else. There are very complicated arrangements behind the scenes that give you the impression that everybody has all the gold that you want all the time but in actual fact, it can be a shuffle. It’s widely perceived in the gold industry that if everybody pulls the gold out at the same time you’d get a phenomenal wave of bankruptcy. Now, of course, nobody can prove that, because that would be illegal. A MAP nails the NFT to a specific, named, gold bar, so it makes all this jiggery pokery impossible. You unambiguously own that gold bar, not some notional one the gold dealer claims to have while switching it about behind your back for profit and which, when push comes to shove, there is a small, but reasonable, chance they might not be able to pony up when you ask them for&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>You unambiguously own that gold bar, not some notional&nbsp;one</blockquote><p>To make it even easier to put gold, or any other high value asset on chain, the Mattereum group, through its German subsidiary Mattereum GmbH has a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/permanent-summer-the-new-matr-token-and-why-the-rwa-bull-market-goes-on-forever-0d4fb0f7c3e9">discount token</a>, <a href="https://mattereum.de/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=marsmatr">MATR*</a>, on sale through the fully regulated German exchange Swarm. This gives anyone onboarding assets a discount of up to 50% on their onboarding fees, which is significant when you are talking about gold&nbsp;bars.</p><p>Mattereum also helps handle the the risks. The gold industry as it currently stands is very well equipped to deal with the major one, which is fake gold — gold bars that turn out to be tungsten bars coated with a thin layer of gold — tungsten has the same density as gold, so that happens. There are various other kinds of shenanigans too, where you’ve got gold in the vault, but somebody’s pulling bars out of the middle of the pile where it can’t easily be seen, those kinds of things. There’s just a whole bunch of gold fraud and a whole bunch of expertise in the industry dedicated to stopping it using lots of science or technology. The thing the gold industry is really not geared up for is gold bars, which are made of actual solid, real, gold, but not the gold you thought it was. This is the whole world of <a href="https://thesentry.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ConflictGoldResponsibleGold-TheSentry-Feb2021.pdf">conflict&nbsp;gold</a>.</p><p>The original, staggeringly bad, conflict gold problem was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_gold">Nazi gold</a>. We never fully dealt with that problem, and then it came back around with <a href="https://www.congoresearchgroup.org/en/2023/05/15/all-that-glitters-the-struggle-over-congolese-gold/">Congo</a> and maybe even <a href="https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Organized-Crime-and-Illegally-Mined-Gold-in-Latin-America.pdf">South America</a>. No one really has a good understanding of the conflict gold landscape and where it’s really coming from, or not, as the case may be. But we know it’s an issue. A few years ago English banks were doing audits of their gold holdings and they kept finding duplicate bars, so they would have a bar that was Valcambi 123456, 400 pounds, then a bit later, they’d turn up another bar, and that too was Valcambi 123456, 400 pounds, and the problem was that they couldn’t tell which one was the original gold bar and which was the conflict gold bar that had cloned its identity. Now, there’s a whole bunch of ever more sophisticated science and technology stuff constantly being developed to stop that happening, but what that means is that there’s an arms race to get conflict gold sold as legit gold before the science catches up with it. That is a new fight for the gold industry and both sides are very sophisticated. <a href="https://www.gold.org/">The World Gold Council</a> is attempting to set up some global scheme for bar registers as part of this, but a bar registry also becomes a record of who owns what, and people are quite freaked out by that for obvious reasons. People still remember the US’s<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act#:~:text=A%20year%20earlier%2C%20in%201933,some%20jewelry%20and%20collector's%20coins."> 1933 confiscation</a> of privately held gold. Basically, nobody knows exactly what to do about conflict gold, but Mattereum can help deal with this too by having an asset passport that provides money-back warranties on the gold’s origin and history. If you buy a bar, you know it isn’t conflict gold, because it is backed by warranties that give you your money back if it is, and this is legally enforceable almost anywhere in the world. We’re now in a position where it is possible to make peace over conflict gold by aligning global systems using English common law through MAPs and the blockchain. Gold can be put on chain at source, with a MAP documenting its origin and updated every step of the way, giving purchasers a scrupulous and unambiguous provenance that makes it impossible to slip dodgy conflict bars into the supply chain&nbsp;unseen.</p><blockquote>Mattereum makes it impossible to slip dodgy conflict bars into the supply chain&nbsp;unseen</blockquote><p>This gold story is complex, and there are lots of aspects to it that are relevant to Mattereum’s tokenized gold partnership. The next aspect is the business of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp">yield generating assets</a> — there are a bunch of games which are played on yield. Let’s narrow it down to variable yield assets. I own a property, it generates rent. The rent varies over time and the value of the property varies over time, but we’ll just deal with the rent. The rent is a yield and that yield varies over time. We can then do a bunch of weird things with that yield so I can make you a bet that the yield will be over 1200 dollars, and if it is over 1200 dollars, you give me money. That’s a bizarre kind of thing, but the world is filled with bizarre kinds of things that people do with yield — tranching your mortgage, collateralized debt obligations, all those kinds of things. As soon as you have a variable yield asset like rent, or mortgages, people start finding ways of betting on it. So the typical way of doing this is the repayment rate on a mortgage. I basically have 100 mortgages. I tell you that on average 98% of those mortgages pay back. I then say I would like to sell you 20 years of these mortgages paying back at 98% for 95% of that amount. You say I get 3% free money. Realistically, I might take 80% and you get the equivalent of 3% a year for that time period because you bought it low and then they paid back over time and you go “great, I made money!”. If the yield is thought to be more variable than that, I might take a<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tranches.asp"> tranche</a>. The basis of that is taking the most certain payments and the least certain payments, and selling them to different people at different prices, and those are what’s called tranches, e.g. for one buyer you say, “They’re meant to pay me a million dollars a month in total. I am going to sell you the first 600k that comes in”, in theory that should be completely secure for the rest of time. So for the next buyer you say “I’m gonna sell you everything that comes in between $950,000 and $1 million”. That might not come in all the time, but it’s probably going to be there most of the time. What I’m doing is I’m pulling the payments forward and invariably discounting the payments depending on how probable they are. Make sense? This stuff is basically just various forms of sophisticated invoice factoring when all is said and done. It’s invoice factoring, but they call it high finance. A lot of hedge funds and pension funds will try and have a mixed balanced portfolio of these kinds of things and they’ll use sophisticated maths to try and make sure it all balances out over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The entire world runs on these bets <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresmarket.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20a%20Futures%20Market,at%20a%20price%20set%20today.">— futures markets</a>. But in the long run, what we know is that most people are optimistic about their guesses about the future, because of persistent psychological biases; everybody wears rose-tinted glasses, particularly when they’re selling. As a result, what happens is that bad bets accumulate in the system at an enormous scale for a variety of factors, but mainly it’s down to optimism about the future, a tendency to ignore bad data, expectation of government bailout and and things along these lines. This causes this entire world of variable return stuff to gradually be assumed to be more and more shaky. The further out you go, the more risk piles up into the system, and more or less the entire global financial system is built out with this. It doesn’t have to be, though. If you want a relatively steady state economy, you start looking at things like tranching corn. Here is a field. It grows about 100 kilos a year. I would like you to pay me now for 80 kilos of that and the remaining 20 kilos you could have for half, right? You get where you can start making bets about things which are more sure. Then you get down to things which have no variability at&nbsp;all.</p><blockquote>The further out you go, the more risk piles up into the&nbsp;system</blockquote><p>When we ran society with no credit and no optimism bias and no betting about the future, we were in a steady state for centuries. When we injected optimism about the future and bets, what we got was crazy amounts of risk taking and speculation which turned out overall to be staggeringly performative in terms of generating innovation, which generated wealth, but in the process, we also generated a system of massively pathological incentives, because if you’re only dealing with a 20 year variable rate, the thing only has the last 20 years. So the suggestion is that basically, because we kind of packaged all that risk in particular ways, we created a situation where the underlying stuff of the world began to be depreciated in the same way that the financial instruments deriving the stuff tended to be trashed. The construction of the system basically faded the future out in a variety of ways. As a result, what we’ve been doing is consuming the underlying yield-generating resources as a way of generating artificial fake yield. In theory, you’re meant to be selling the harvest from the land. In practice, you push the land so hard that you’re effectively burning the capital of the land to generate the harvest. It’s almost like a Ponzi scheme on farmland. If we deplete the farmland every year to keep the same consistent yield, and then one day that stops, any financial instruments that are based on this yield continuing are suddenly worth nothing. What we’re doing is basically exporting risk into the future by destroying the present invisibly by&nbsp;degrees.</p><p>That’s been quite a detour, but let’s get back to the case for digital gold. The world needs to be more like the world was like before 1971, which is when we came off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard">gold standard</a>, so money stopped being gold and the basis for its value became free floating. The world before 1971 did much heavier innovation at a much larger scale. We were staggeringly wealthy and the whole thing was really running great, apart from the fact that we had an infinite demand for oil and we didn’t have an infinite amount of gold to pay for it. But if we had to pay for the oil in gold, there’s a pretty good chance we’d be using a whole hell of a lot less of it and we’d be much more careful about how we&nbsp;lived.</p><p>The case for digital gold is the case against credit. It’s the case against tranches. It’s the case against complicated index portfolios and all the rest of that stuff. It’s the case against risk. We have gold, a 5000- to 8000-year-old asset that has had relatively consistent value for the entire time period, and we’re going to use that as our yardstick of value, rather than this portfolio of&nbsp;.com stocks, and rather than Bitcoin, which is a very untested bet, and is not even intended to be stable, it’s intended to be massively deflationary. Then we come to gold on the blockchain, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold">e-gold</a>, which I was paid in in the 1990s, <a href="https://www.royalmint.com/digital-investments/digigold/?utm_term=digital%20gold&amp;utm_campaign=PRM+-+LT+%26+DigiGold&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=7880654689&amp;hsa_cam=19902811424&amp;hsa_grp=150568997034&amp;hsa_ad=694956823871&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-297814713027&amp;hsa_kw=digital%20gold&amp;hsa_mt=p&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjLGyBhCYARIsAPqTz19BxjXx6xJQUlAysOX0IedRyZ8zlGXrgE-fE4knfGbKIBvfLaFcfvQaApYeEALw_wcB">Digi gold</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_contract">Ian Grigg</a> stuff, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/06/e-gold/">Doug Jackson </a>stuff. The way that cryptocurrency started was with gold, but this was derailed by both external and internal actions. Firstly, the US government absolutely hates crypto, it likes to have control over currency and information and crypto threatens both. With cryptography itself, in the ’90s, the US decided that uncrackable strong cryptographic applications like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)</a> were munitions and put them under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations">ITAR</a>, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, a regulatory regime to restrict and control the export of defence and military technologies. This led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk">cypherpunks</a> getting tattoos of PGP code, and suggested that the US really hadn’t got the hang of this internet thing back then, despite their military academic complex having invented it. This did not work, unsurprisingly, and strong crypto went on to underpin Web 2.0 and modern online payment systems. The US government sat hard on e-gold too, on the basis that it was a conduit for money laundering and criminal enterprise. They also saw huge potential for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi schemes</a> in crypto, and the US government absolutely loathes Ponzi’s since such things were at the root of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929">1929 bank crash</a>. So, early attempts at de-dollarizing through crypto were stifled at birth. Mattereum’s system breathes new life into the concept, though, as it is built on transparency and legal compliance, so cannot be used in the way the US fears. Secondly, internal resistance came from blockchain purists, who felt the link to gold tied crypto too heavily to the physical world that it was intended to transcend, although, I note, they seemed less resistant to linking it to the dollar. The paranoid among you might see some kind of hidden hand at work there…. But in the end, gold is a global system not controlled by any single government, which is exactly what crypto aspires to be, so logic suggests they are natural partners. Mattereum’s creation of a global marketplace of 170 countries in which tokenized gold can be freely traded enables this, by binding the NFT to the physical gold and backing it with legally enforceable money-back guarantees.</p><blockquote>The case for digital gold is the case against&nbsp;risk</blockquote><p>For the notion of a digital economy, gold is an exemplar. Gold is old and stable. For digital economics we need to use old global stable assets as yardsticks and value. Gold is the first, but then there’s agricultural land — this is why Matterum is interested in gold and real estate. These are things which have been valuable in consistent ways for the whole of human history, and nothing says that we can’t use those things for payments. Nothing says we can’t use those things for wealth storage. It has been very difficult to do because of stuff in the fear ecosystem that’s existed since ’71. The transactional costs have always made it very difficult to do that stuff as well. But the fundamental truth of the situation is that most of the world’s genuinely wealthy people keep most of their assets in things which are pretty durable and the exception is the new money.com stuff. If you look at the old money, the old money’s more or less all buildings, and occasionally trade. So the argument is basically this. It is possible, using crypto, to massively cut the transactional costs and open up the old money ecosystem to young money, and to open up the big money ecosystem to small money. This is what Mattereum is&nbsp;doing.</p><blockquote>Mattereum opens up the old money ecosystem to young money and the big money ecosystem to small&nbsp;money</blockquote><p>Gold is the beginning of that process and then you do land, then you do real estate, potentially art, this is the democratization of the real wealth machinery. Then what goes with all these asset classes, the fundamental question is, “is it there?” And the answer to all doubts about “is it there?” is massively ramified insurance. Again, the old money assets are heavily insured, and heavily physically protected. That’s what the vaulting system is like. And by the way, there’s $20 trillion in vaults or whatever the number is. This is how the big guys do it and, yes, you could do it that way. We do not expect the existing system to survive without radical transformation, partly because of the overuse of credit in the American economy, or at least the global economy. And secondly, there is a huge push, I mean, just a huge push to try and figure out some kind of ecological economics framework which will work more globally and that’s the fundamental bedrock.</p><p>So you have gold, you’re doing transactions in gold, you have all the same fundamental financial needs that anybody has in the money economy. So if you need to borrow, if you’re making payments in gold and you don’t have enough gold, so somebody lends you gold, by all means do that, but it has to be understood by all parties that the gold is not yield generating. It’s not that you can make a bunch of investments, borrow money, hope investments going up will be enough to pay the interest and then come back to it. It’s just not that kind of thing, because the gold itself is not yield generating. While there will always be people to play games at the edge of that stuff and make bets on the gap between the say, fiat performance, gold performance, Bitcoin performance, all those games are there, but that is just dragging a hard asset back into the insanity.</p><p>By tokenizing gold, we are making it possible to do transactions in actual, real, gold in the modern system, digitally, on the blockchain, backed by warranties and insurance, which no one else can do. It has all the advantages of a slick modern system along with those of having someone turn up in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugger_family">Fugger</a> counting house and make their payment by tipping out a bunch of gold coins on a table that then go in a vault. Solid and tangible, but liquid and tradable; unambiguous ownership, consistent, long term value, and it isn’t going to destroy the world in a riot of over-optimistic speculation and evaporated value:</p><p>Tokenized gold on chain with a Mattereum Asset Passport.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.de/get-tokens?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">Find out more about Mattereum GmbH’s token&nbsp;sale*.</a></p><p>*The Mattereum Discount Token (MATR) is available for purchase through Mattereum GmbH’s fully regulated German crypto exchange partner, Swarm.

 Digital Identification in Africa — notes from ID4Africa credit: ID4Africa<p>Digital identification is one of the central elements of digital transformation, and governments, civil society and development actors are paying increasing attention to it. At the industry’s leading conference for digital identity in Cape Town, South Africa, <a href="https://id4africa.com/">ID4Africa</a> on May 21st-24th, over 2,000 exhibitors, governments, and civil society representatives gathered to discuss how digital identification could empower and enable choice. <a href="https://id4africa.com/the-general-secretariat/">Joseph Atick</a>, the visionary behind ID4Africa, has established the convening as the continent’s premier forum for thinking about digital identification and development.</p><p>It was a privilege to attend the forum, supporting UNDP’s efforts around <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benjamin-bertelsen_governance-digitalpublicinfrastructure-activity-7201125020855603200-qdo-?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Model Governance Frameworks</a> and <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/announcements/unhcr-welcomes-commitments-id4africa-2024-digital-identity-gains-displaced">UNHCR’s efforts to ensure refugee inclusion</a>, and to explore the implications of <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/identity-and-migration/">digital identity and wallets for migrants</a>. I was left thinking about three key&nbsp;themes:</p><p>Digital ID as digital public infrastructure (DPI) — but what is DPI? The conference tagline was ‘digital ID as DPI’, and there was much discussion of the importance of digital ID not only an end in itself, but as an enabler. In practice, this means that efforts prioritising ‘public interest’ and ‘public value’ are increasingly prominent. These include efforts such as <a href="https://mosip.io/#1">MOSIP</a>, a non-profit open source ID solution that establishes an interoperable ecosystem, with increasing numbers of vendors advertising their ‘MOSIP Compliance’. Private vendors were also promoting interoperability through the <a href="https://osia.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">OSIA standard</a>, now an <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/osia-officially-adopted-as-itu-standard-for-interoperable-digital-identity-management">officially adopted by the ITU</a>. There were also normative efforts around public interest of digital digital identity, such as UNDP and the United Nations Office of the Secretary General’s Envoy on Technology (OSET) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/un-tech-envoy_safedpi-sdgs-digitalcooperation-activity-7199850430967820288-OBLp?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">convening on how to ensure that DPI is safe, inclusive and rights protecting</a>.</p><p>Yet, despite this growing attention, there’s still a lot of questions about what DPI actually means and what it looks like. As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hilda-barasa-3467355_id4africa2024-activity-7198933848447938560-_7Gm?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Hilda Barasa of the Tony Blair Institute noted</a> following the UNDP and OSET consultation, there’s a lack of clarity about what DPI means. Even with some established definitions, it’s still not clear to many in the international development community how to distinguish ‘vanilla’ digital transformation from a ‘DPI approach’, and how DPI relates to earlier lessons learned, strategies, and thinking about DPI. I think this is really critical if the current momentum is to be maintained and translated into impact. As a firm believer in evidence and specificity, at Caribou Digital going to invest in efforts to advance this&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>Digital ID innovation — is it the future of identity wallets? There was much conversation around wallets as the ‘next thing’ in digital ID innovation. Digital wallets are digital versions of the wallet you hold in your pocket or purse — a way to store digital documents so that people who need to rely on them as proof of an entitlement or status can trust them. There are many reasons for the growing interest in digital wallets — from promising to simplify the management of credentials to giving individuals greater control over their credentials and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest driver of interest in digital wallets comes from the EC’s adoption of a new digital identity regulation, eIDAS2.0, that specifies a digital wallet and mandates all member countries to provide one to citizens. This has prompted speculation about whether the EC’s new standard may define a new global standard for identification — a <a href="https://www.brusselseffect.com/">‘Brussels effect’</a> that pushes this particular approach to digital identification on&nbsp;others.</p><p>But digital wallets also introduce new challenges. In <a href="https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/mobile-economy/europe/">2022 only 81% of the EU population had a smartphone</a>, while across <a href="https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/mobile-economy/sub-saharan-africa/">Africa only 41% had access to any phone</a>. So questions of exclusion are increasingly important, not just in terms of access to technology, but also access to the legal credentials and status that underpin wallets. For example, it may have significant implications for marginalised and vulnerable populations, such as migrants and refugees. UNHCR, the UN agency responsible for refugees, has already developed a digital wallet, which we’re currently researching related to <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/identity-and-migration/">migrants’ identification needs in Kenya and&nbsp;Germany</a>.</p><p>Empowerment and choice — but for whom? Empowerment and choice was another important theme of the conference. At first this seemed to refer to empowerment and choice for individuals, as wallets are promised to enable. But throughout the conference it became clear that this theme is also about governments and their capacity to choose an approach to digital identification that meets their needs. As one senior figure put it, many countries feel that they have particular systems, approaches, and ways of thinking about digital identification imposed on them. In a conference panel of parliamentarians convened by UNDP there was resistance to this imposition, and a strong call for greater recognition of their role in the process of establishing digital identification — as representatives of their citizens, ‘we need to be involved’, and asked for more support to empower their capacity to choose their own approach to digital identification.</p><p>I think this was significant for two reasons. Firstly, recognising government and institutions as users of ID systems highlights questions of sovereignty — the right to choose and assert authority — and of responsibility and accountability. This year’s conference marked the first time civil society organisations participated; they shared stories of holding their governments to account through advocacy and the judiciary. This highlights the importance of national sovereignty and individual civic&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Second, digital identification is increasingly one of the fields in which geopolitics are played out. Technologies, standards, and governance models are manifestations of ideas, values, and interests. The competing definitions of DPI are one example, but so too is the close relation that many vendors of ID systems have or claim to have with states, like Thales from France, NEC from Japan, and Veridos from&nbsp;Germany.</p><p>So I think this is only the beginning of calls from African governments and civil society to strengthen their capacity to understand and choose digital systems and governance approaches that meet their needs. It will be incumbent on development partners to support them to make decisions and choices that reflect their&nbsp;needs.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identification-in-africa-insights-from-id4africa-dfd74b4ec86d">Digital Identification in Africa — insights from ID4Africa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Combating deepfakes and misinformation is commonly framed as an arms race, constantly one-upping each other for more realistic attacks and more sophisticated detection. But is this a game that really needs to be played? Rather than escalating competition, is it possible to disarm deepfakes? Decentralized identity is all about a chain of trust for transactions, building the foundation for proving identity and content authenticity. Is it possible that decentralized systems can fundamentally negate the risk that deepfakes pose?</p>
<p>Blockchain and decentralized identity leverage an immutable ledger to establish trust. Through cryptographic signatures and distributed consensus, they create transparent, verifiable records of identity and content provenance, fostering accountability and authenticity in the digital realm.</p>
<p>Such a system undermines the very concept of deepfakes and misinformation, which thrive on obfuscating origins and manipulating trust. By anchoring identities and content to transparent, verifiable records, deepfakes can potentially lose their potency.</p>
<p>Rather than perpetuating an arms race, decentralization is a method of restructuring trust in the digital world. Combating deepfakes through decentralized identity is a departure from reactive measures towards proactive resilience, where authenticity is upheld through collective validation rather than relentless competition.</p>
<p>The three panelists of this webinar are all speakers that you can hear in person at the European Identity and Cloud conference in Berlin, June 4. It is a star-studded cast, with Wayne Chang, CEO of SpruceID, Kim Hamilton Duffy, Executive Director of the Decentralized Identity Foundation, and Linda Jeng, Founder and CEO of Digital Self Labs. The panel will be moderated by Annie Bailey, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts.</p>

<p>Protecting ESXi hosts is crucial to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of virtualized environments, preventing data breaches, downtime, and regulatory non-compliance. With administrators frequently altering configurations within your virtualized environments, how do you maintain and/or enhance your security posture? These questions are becoming increasingly critical for all IT security professionals managing VMware products. With threats constantly evolving and new challenges emerging, it’s essential to stay vigilant and proactive in your security practices.</p>
<p>Recently, in a security advisory, <a href="https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2024-0006.html">Broadcom disclosed four critical vulnerabilities</a> that could allow attackers to bypass sandbox and hypervisor protections in all versions of VMware ESXi products, including those no longer supported. An attacker with privileged access – root or administrator – to the guest operating system within a virtual machine (VM) could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to the hypervisor. Given the critical role hypervisors play in enterprise environments, these vulnerabilities pose a serious risk.</p>
 Understanding the Environment 
<p>A physical host computer can operate multiple independent guest virtual machines, each isolated from one another and the host. Managed by a hypervisor like VMware ESXi, these VMs utilize the host’s physical resources.</p>
<p>The sandbox, a controlled and isolated environment within which VMs operate, is designed to limit the machines’ ability to interact with the host system or other VMs beyond specific, intended interactions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Scope of the Vulnerabilities 
<p>The vulnerabilities disclosed by Broadcom relate to flaws in USB controllers, which could allow attackers to compromise the sandbox and hypervisor protections across all versions of VMware ESXi and Cloud Foundation products. These vulnerabilities are particularly alarming because they compromise one of the core functions of VMware products: to securely isolate sensitive operations within VMs, away from the host machine.</p>
 Proactive Measures With Entrust CloudControl 
<p>Virtualization and cloud technologies have brought new capabilities to automation, time to market, and IT flexibility, but have also heightened the need for hypervisor security. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/cloudcontrol">Entrust CloudControl</a> plays a key role in capturing vital data for compliance, forensics, and troubleshooting, while identifying hypervisor configuration errors in VMware vSphere for ongoing compliance.</p>
<p>CloudControl offers a comprehensive range of capabilities, including the ability to automatically disable USB controllers on virtual machines across all ESXi hosts. This feature could be used to mitigate all vulnerabilities described in the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2024-0006.html">Security Advisory VMSA-2024-0006</a> by quickly removing USB controllers from all virtual machines as described in <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/96682">KB96682,</a> pending the patching of all ESXi machines.</p>
<p>A second line of defense involves ensuring that patches addressing the vulnerabilities have been properly applied to all ESXi hosts. This time-consuming operation can also be managed by CloudControl, which ensures that these vulnerabilities have been eliminated across the entire virtual infrastructure.</p>
<p>Once this verification has been carried out by CloudControl, it will then be possible to reactivate the USB controllers on all virtual machines.</p>
<p>In the ever-changing security landscape, every component of your IT infrastructure remains susceptible to potential threats. Staying informed about the latest security challenges is crucial. Implementing proactive security measures and continuously monitoring for vulnerabilities are key to ensuring that your VMware environments remain secure, resilient, and trustworthy. Automatic monitoring and remediation tools like Entrust CloudControl can greatly <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management">improve your overall security posture</a>.</p>

  <p>Zero Trust has become the industry standard for safeguarding your entire digital estate. Central to Zero Trust is securing identity and access, which is essential for protecting resources, enforcing security policies, and ensuring compliance in today’s dynamic digital landscape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Microsoft Entra, we help our customers create <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/08/how-implementing-a-trust-fabric-strengthens-identity-and-network/">a trust fabric that securely connects any trustworthy identity with anything, anywhere</a>. Driven by the adoption of multicloud strategies in the era of AI, customers are encountering more challenges in securing access, not just across multiple public and private clouds, but also for business apps and on-premises resources. Unlike securing access for humans or within a single environment, where customers have established methods to address challenges, securing access anywhere is more complicated due to the dynamic nature of today’s digital estate and tools to address emerging challenges need further development. To support our customers, we unveiled <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-announcements-and-demos-at-rsac-2024/ba-p/2520429">our vision for securing access in any cloud at this year’s RSA conference</a>. Today, we're excited to dive deeper into our future investment aimed at securing access to cloud resources from any identity across diverse cloud environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Managing multicloud complexity in a rapidly evolving digital environment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations are grappling with substantial challenges in navigating cloud access complexities, often citing issues like fragmented role-based access control (RBAC) systems, and compliance violations. These challenges are compounded by the growing use of cloud services from various cloud service providers.&nbsp; There have been links to several notable breaches attributed to over-permissioned identities. Our customer engagements reveal that organizations are currently using 7 to 8 products, including privileged access management (PAM) and identity governance and administration (IGA) solutions to tackle multicloud access challenges. Despite their efforts, such as toggling across multiple solutions and increasing their workforce, many organizations still struggle to achieve full visibility into their cloud access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://aka.ms/multicloudriskreport">Our 2024 State of Multicloud Security Risk Report</a> underscores these ongoing challenges arising from over-permissioned human and workload identities. Analysis of past year usage data from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management">Microsoft Entra Permissions Management</a> confirms that the complexities in multicloud environments primarily stem from rapid identity growth and over-provisioned permissions (<a href="https://aka.ms/multicloudinfographic">learn more</a>), including:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Over 51,000 permissions that can be granted to identities – 50% of which are identified as high-risk permissions. 
 Only 2% of those 51,000 permissions were used. 
 Of the 209M identities discovered, more than 50% are identified as super identities that have all permissions to access all resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Introducing our vision for cloud access management: Building a converged platform 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I’m excited to expand on our vision for cloud access management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As businesses expand, organizations inevitably face challenges of overprovisioning at various levels. Initially, this manifests as granting more access to accommodate growing teams and workloads and can lead to overlapping access privileges. To address these issues, organizations must proactively identify vulnerabilities in identities and permissions and respond swiftly and, eventually, automatically. There’s a pressing need for a new solution that empowers all identities to access resources in any cloud securely while adhering to least-privileged permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address this critical need, we’re developing a converged platform that encompasses a comprehensive set of capabilities. This upcoming platform is designed to streamline the journey from risk discovery to remediation for secure access to any cloud resource whenever deviations occur, offering:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Visibility: Gain insights into all identities and permissions assigned and used and detect risky permissions. 
 Risk remediation: Remediate risky permissions with recommendations. 
 Granular controls: Grant the right privileges for role-specific durations. 
 Automated governance: Implement continuous compliance through automated policies.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: How to secure access from any identity across multiple clouds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our journey to secure access to resources in any cloud is advancing by building upon our industry-leading Microsoft Entra products:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management">Permissions Management</a> (CIEM) for delivering visibility into identities, permissions, and usage. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id">Privileged Identity Management</a> (PAM) for enforcing least-privileged controls for both human and workload identities. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-governance">ID Governance</a> (IGA) for automating identity lifecycle and access workflows regardless of origin or usage. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-workload-id">Workload ID</a> (IAM for workloads) for offering customized authorization policies for workload identities.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Convergence of four critical areas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, as part of our continuous Copilot journey, we're leveraging AI/ML to enhance all the technologies within the cloud access management platform. This enables organizations to uncover risks that are otherwise challenging to detect manually, identify the most significant risks, propose impactful remediations, and recommend usage-based custom roles and policies for any identity as the platform adoption grows. It will help simplify cloud access management and provide more effective ways to secure cloud environments for organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Our commitment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Microsoft, we’re committed to bringing this vision to life for our customers through the advancement and innovation of our newly converged platform, designed to secure access to resources in any cloud. Additionally, this vision extends to securing access to resources anywhere, including on-premises and business apps. Our goal is to help our customers enhance their security for any access to any resource in the era of AI and robust workload identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to collaborating with the community to realize this vision, empowering every organization to implement least-privileged access and permissions across all identities in multicloud and hybrid environments. We’ll keep you posted on our progress towards this vision. Until our next update, we invite you to explore our products that form the foundation of our cloud access management vision.

  Name: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjen-van-veen-b77529109/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Arjen van Veen</a><br>Team: Credible<br>Based in: The Netherlands   About Arjen <p>Although my educational background is as a geophysicist, I became an IT consultant out of University. I was exposed to what was then still described as the “SSI” (Self-Sovereign Identity) space. I got hooked on the idea of helping to build a privacy-preserving digital experience and wanted to join a company solely focused on exactly that, which is when I found SpruceID.</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>I’m a software engineer at SpruceID, working, among others, on open standards implementations such as the OpenID family and the ISO 18013-x specifications. I’m excited that some of our Rust libraries are already open-source and open for anyone to use, even if you still need to be somewhat of an expert to get started.</p> What do you find most rewarding about your job? <p>I love working on a team with the smartest people I’ve ever met. Seeing our solutions in the real world comes in at a close second.</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Be collaborative and communicative within the team. This stuff is hard, and mistakes can have awful consequences. It’s best to build these solutions together.</p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>I will always strive to write better code. I’m still taking my first steps in the standards community and hope to become much faster at assessing protocols and identifying potential problems or missing features.</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>I’m going to go with our company retreat to Kyoto while the cherry blossoms were in full swing.</p> What's the best advice you’ve received since starting your job here? <p>“Don’t get stuck”</p><p>Meaning, it is easy to waste a lot of time researching something you don't understand properly when there might be somebody around who can give you a TLDR or move you forward immediately. So we don't want to pay the price of learning something over and over, especially in such a complicated space as ours.</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>If we securely get credentials into people’s hands and their day is improved by using them, that is what I count as a win! Similarly, if our open-source libraries gain wide adoption, that would be amazing, too.</p> What is your favorite part about working at SpruceID? <p>If you have an idea or want to pursue something, there is a path for you. Propose a new solution, attend a conference, introduce a new tool: if it makes sense, there is a way.</p><p>Also, there is a lot of respect for focus time for engineers.</p> Fun Facts <p><br>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?: I like guitar, gardening, and any type of sports, really. At the moment, it’s going to the gym and rock climbing.</p><p>What is your favorite coding language (and why?): Rust, for obvious reasons (our codebase is in rust).</p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: I’ll choose the oak. It’s a tree that supports so many different species, and I’d get to live for a very long time.</p><p>Want to work with Arjen and the rest of the SpruceID team? Well, you’re in luck, we’re hiring! Check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://jobs.lever.co/sprucesystems?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Careers pag</a>e&nbsp;for our current openings.&nbsp;</p><p></p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET Finalize Token Merger Details to Create Artificial Superintelligence Alliance <p>Artificial Intelligence Pioneers Combine to Create a Decentralized<br>Alternative to AI Projects Controlled by Big&nbsp;Tech</p><p>Fully Diluted Market Cap of $ASI token is USD$6 billion as of May 28,&nbsp;2024</p><p>Zug and Singapore — May 29, 2024. SingularityNET (SNET), the world’s first decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) network, Fetch.ai, a Web3 platform for the new AI economy, and Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange platform to protect data, today announced the June 13 finalization of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) merger. The newly combined $ASI token represents the largest open-sourced, decentralized network focused on the AI industry.</p><p>As of June 11, 2024, $FET will be renamed $ASI and on June 13 the merger completes. The $ASI token will function across the combined decentralized AI network, providing unprecedented scale and power. As of June 11, ERC20 tokens will be made available for users to swap $FET to $ASI tokens via a token migration contract, followed by $AGIX and $OCEAN on June 13. An audited, secure token migration contract will allow the conveyance of tokens into $ASI from over 200,000 token holders of the constituent communities with $AGI, $FET and $OCEAN tokens swapped at the previously announced pegged&nbsp;ratios.</p><blockquote>“This merger paves the way for a new era in AI, combining our strengths to achieve unprecedented advancements,” states Ben Goertzel, CEO of ASI Alliance, renowned pioneer of AGIX and SNET&nbsp;Founder.</blockquote><p>“This is only the start of a broader movement to gather together forces working toward beneficial decentralized AGI and super-intelligence. The ASI token serves as a symbol and a practical tool for our shared quest to leverage advanced AI, blockchain and decentralized governance to move quickly and effectively toward an amazing future for&nbsp;all.”</p> Turbocharged ASI&nbsp;Future <p>With the closing of this merger, a decentralized AI infrastructure at scale is a reality. This fusion of SNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol’s research, brands, technologies, and products lays the groundwork for an open, scalable AI infrastructure that leverages blockchain to ensure ethical and trustworthy practices in AI development and deployment.

<p>The concept of identity has taken on newfound significance. As our lives become increasingly entwined with technology, the way we define, manage, and protect our identities has become a crucial concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike.&nbsp;</p><p>To better understand the challenges and opportunities in this space, we spoke with Kim Duffy, the Executive Director of the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p><p>At the heart of this conversation lies the delicate balance between privacy, security, and convenience — a trinity of competing priorities that shape the development and adoption of digital identity systems.</p><p>The stakes are high. In a world where personal data is often likened to the new oil, the consequences of mismanaged or compromised digital identities can be severe. From data breaches and identity theft to the erosion of privacy and the commodification of personal information, the risks are manifold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, so too are the opportunities. Advancements in decentralized technologies offer the potential for more secure, private, and user-centric identity management solutions.</p> Defining Identity in the Digital Landscape <p>People consider digital identity many different things. And it is. It often refers to the information that represents an individual in digital interactions, including usernames, email addresses, social media profiles, and biometric data. However, the scope of digital identity has expanded to include a much broader range of data points, from browsing histories to financial data. As Kim stated, "Identity, I think, to your point, is very large and amorphous."</p><p>The challenge lies in managing this vast array of personal information in a way that balances privacy, security, and convenience. Traditional centralized identity models, where user data is stored and controlled by a single entity, have proven vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, decentralized identity solutions aim to give users greater control over their personal data, using cryptographic techniques to enable users to create and manage their own digital identities without intermediaries.</p> The Pitfalls of Traditional Digital Identity Models <p>The traditional approach to digital identity management has given rise to significant challenges and risks. One pressing concern is the lack of user control and consent over the collection, use, and sharing of personal data. As Kim noted, "We are still accustomed to this model where we share all our data for purposes of someone vetting us, but we're not afforded that in return."</p><p>This lack of control has led to the proliferation of data brokers and the commodification of personal information, often without the knowledge or consent of the individuals involved. Additionally, the centralization of user data has made digital identity systems an attractive target for hackers, with data breaches exposing millions of users' personal information to potential misuse.</p><p>Another pitfall is the erosion of privacy in the pursuit of convenience. Simplified login processes, such as social media authentication, can create a single point of failure and enable third parties to track user activity across different platforms.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Kim highlighted the risks, stating, "The text messages that you receive from ‘Wells Fargo’, or, you know, all of these things. One of our new members at DIF is focusing on the impact specifically to senior citizens. And if they can confuse people who work daily in technology, like my God, they're getting really good at deceiving us."</blockquote><p>The limitations of traditional digital identity models have led to a growing recognition of the need for more secure, privacy-preserving, and user-centric approaches. Decentralized identity systems have emerged as a promising alternative, aiming to give users greater control over their personal data and reduce reliance on centralized authorities.&nbsp;</p> Balancing Privacy and Accountability in Decentralized Systems <p>As decentralized identity systems gain traction, it is crucial to strike a balance between privacy and accountability. With their public designs, blockchain-based identity systems also come with risks.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>As Kim pointed out, "People have thought about the risks of having your activities on-chain for 20 years. Then, to hear people talk of them as a benefit, like one that I heard that Vitalik himself said was if criminal convictions were recorded on a blockchain — you can maybe use that as a negative reputation. It would make us crazy."</blockquote><p>The key is to prioritize user agency and control over shared information, preventing the weaponization of personal data against individuals. Decentralized systems must be designed to empower users to selectively disclose their information, ensuring that their privacy is protected while still enabling necessary accountability.</p><p>As Kim emphasized, "Yes, we sometimes want or need personal information from people. But if everything is public on the blockchain, it isn't simply information or reputation — it can also be weaponized against people. We have to give agency to people over their identity and ensure that what they share isn't just some free-for-all where anyone with the most time or money can find it and use it against us."</p><p>Finding this balance requires a combination of thoughtful system design, robust privacy controls, and clear governance frameworks. By putting users at the center and prioritizing their needs, decentralized identity systems can pave the way for a more secure, private, and accountable digital future.</p> Decentralized Identity and the Path Forward <p>As we navigate the complex landscape of digital identity, it is clear that decentralized solutions will play a crucial role in shaping a more secure, private, and user-centric future. The emergence of technologies like Holochain, with its agent-centric, distributed architecture, offers a promising path forward for building decentralized identity management systems that prioritize user agency and control.</p><p>However, the success of these solutions will depend on our ability to strike the right balance between privacy, security, and convenience. It will require ongoing collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and industry leaders to ensure that the systems we build are not only technologically sound but also aligned with the needs and values of the individuals they serve.</p><p>The journey ahead may be complex, but with the right tools, mindset, and commitment to putting users first, we have the opportunity to redefine the way we manage and protect our digital identities. One that prioritizes the rights, needs, and aspirations of individuals in an increasingly connected world.&nbsp;</p>

The collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB) resulted previously in <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping/urban-land-ownership-mapping-in-copenhagen-eb13bfbbded1">mapping of Copenhagen</a>, Lisbon.</p><p>Through findings in this blog, we aim to point towards the role of land ownership ptterns and related dynamics that led to increasing unaffordability and spatial injustice.</p>  *Note: We are still in a process of establishing a collaboration with the Municipality of Athens and Ktimatologio to obtain needed data for analysis of the largest landowners in Athens. This article will be updated by a map, visualization and reflection based on further findings.   Introduction <p>Athens, just like Lisbon, became <a href="https://greekcitytimes.com/2024/04/05/athens-ranked-second-least-liveable-city-in-europe/">one of the least affordable cities</a> in Europe for its citizens in the last decade. There are multiple reasons for it which relate to similar patterns as observed in <a>Lisbon</a>. The below outlined findings of the project Eteron — Institute for Research and Social Change (a non-profit organisation based in Athens, produces knowledge, contributes to citizen empowerment and promotes partnerships) reveal some of the contributing dynamics.</p> Athens soaring&nbsp;prices <p><a href="https://eteron.org/">Eteron</a> — the Institute for Research and Social Change — a non-profit organization working with production of knowledge and citizen empowerment through its project Housing360 provides a <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/">great overview</a> of the present housing problem in Greece. The issues are&nbsp;known:</p>  Increasing rents to sky-high levels, causing “79.2% of renters are overburdened by housing costs”, combined with worsening housing conditions, caused by a combination of factors that include, lack of adequate housing policy, regulation or protection of tennants, short-term rentals popularity, financialization of housing so a shift of domestic and international capital to the real estate market combined with little affordable housing&nbsp;supply.  <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/short-term-rentals/">Short-term rental</a> induced by platforms such as AirBnb, combined with lack of regulation, and promotion of touristification by the central authorities (see also this&nbsp;article)  <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/financialisation/">Speculation and financialization</a> — institutional foreign investments combined with the “Golden Visa” programme (similar to&nbsp;Lisbon)  Vacant buildings — large proportions of empty housing in urban centers (31% in Athens in 2011) incl. Significant amount of sqare meters owned by public institutions.  <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/youth-housing/">Youth housing</a> — increasing difficulties for young men and women combined with high rates of unemployment following the financial crisis in&nbsp;2008.  <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/home-ownership/">Issues of ownership</a> — as 74.6 % of Greeks own their home post-financial crisis reality characterized itself by a an over-indebtedness of households.  <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/energy-poverty/">Energy poverty</a> impacting citizens&nbsp;health  combined with the <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/urban-space/">Urban planning focus merely on urban space improvements</a>  <p>All contributing to increasing inequality affecting <a href="https://housing360.eteron.org/vulnerable-groups/">vulnerable groups</a>.</p> Data transparency review <p>Establishing land ownership overview has been a long process that finally is being crystalized into a unified set of online data services. The creation of the <a href="https://www.ktimatologio.gr/">National Property Registry, also known as the Ktimatologio,</a> has been a laborious process spanning over three decades. Presently, the Greek government expresses optimism regarding the project’s culmination by the year&nbsp;2026.</p><p>Recently, an <a href="https://www.ktimatologio.gr/">interactive digital map</a> with all properties currently incorporated into the registry has been released, accompanied by the number for each plot. In adherence to data protection protocols, ownership details will remain undisclosed within the&nbsp;map.</p><p>To find out the information on owners, under Greek Law, anyone invoking <a href="https://www.elra.eu/contact-point-contribution/greece/how-to-get-the-information-7/">“legitimate interest” can apply for information held in the land registry, which is provided by the Land Registrar in the form of a certificate or excerpt of the Land Book</a> (ELRA) — therefore the information can be considered public in the sense that anyone can have access in the books. Each property has been marked with a unique number, the so-called Code Number E of the national K thematic catalog ( KAEK )&nbsp;, which is the exclusive code number for each parcel of land, the identity of the property. The <a href="https://www.ktimatologio.gr/">interactive digital map</a> provides for the first time these codes for each plot. One can <a href="https://www.ktimatologio.gr/pliroforiako-yliko/ktimatologio-se-leitourgia/21">purchase</a> different types of information upon registration through a Greek digital system <a href="https://login.gsis.gr/mylogin/login.jsp?bmctx=1DB55AB50C08F2B418903DE4EB7466AD47038BC455E39B9EA82B1EB28CE52BC6&amp;contextType=external&amp;username=string&amp;password=secure_string&amp;challenge_url=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.gsis.gr%2Fmylogin%2Flogin.jsp&amp;ssoCookie=disablehttponly&amp;request_id=6618290009597394467&amp;authn_try_count=0&amp;locale=en&amp;resource_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww1.gsis.gr%252Ftaxisnet%252Fmytaxisnet">Taxisnet</a> for residents with Tax registration number.</p><p>As this is a work in progress, property holders are still having the liberty to register their properties and update information conveniently, eliminating the need for physical visits to government agencies with supporting documentation. Though the deadline for property registration has lapsed, the online map aims to serve as an incentive for registration, ideally before November 30th,&nbsp;2024.</p> Athen’s largest landowners   *Note: We are still in a process of establishing a collaboration with the Municipality of Athens and Ktimatologio to obtain needed data for analysis of the largest landowners in Athens.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In this guide, we will lead you through the process of obtaining your own SelfKey iD, outlining the incredible benefits that await you upon successful completion.&nbsp;</p>
 Highlights 
 
 How to Obtain a SelfKey iD 
 SelfKey iD Benefits 
 Conclusions 
 
 How to Obtain a SelfKey iD 
 Prerequisites 
<p>Obtaining your very own SelfKey iD is a simple process. You will need:</p>
 
 A passport or a government-issued iD. 
 A valid email address. 
 A Laptop/PC with a webcam to successfully take a selfie.&nbsp; 
 Metamask wallet browser extension set up. For important details, please open the following <a href="https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-metamask/">link</a>. 
 MATIC in the wallet - instructions on how to obtain MATIC will be provided within the wallet. 
 
<p></p>
<p>These are crucial to verify your identity and ensure that you are indeed the individual you claim to be.</p>
<p>Please note that certain steps may take varying amounts of time to complete, ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Your patience is appreciated as the process unfolds.</p>
 Step One: Getting started 
<p>The first step is to access SelfKey DAO’s <a href="https://app.selfkey.org/">official website</a> and connect your wallet. After your wallet connects, simply press the Metamask button to start your journey.</p>
<p></p>
 Step Two: Input Email Address and agree with Terms 
<p>Once you’ve completed the first step, you will be required to initiate the verification process. You must enter a valid email address and you must make sure to acknowledge SelfKey DAO’s <a href="https://staging.gc.selfkey.org/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> by checking the box below.</p>
<p></p>
 Step Three: Invitation to join KYC Application 
<p>After completing the second step, you will receive an email from <a>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>, with the title “Invitation to join KYC Application”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure to also double check your spam folder if the email did not arrive. If you accidentally introduced a typo in the email address, you can try to send the invitation again.</p>
<p>The email should open to the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>After clicking on the “Start the KYC application” button, you will be redirected to the application page, where you will begin the KYC (know your customer) verification process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of KYC in SelfKey DAO is to verify the authenticity and uniqueness of each individual and confirm their claimed identity. This measure prevents users owning more than one SelfKey iD and ensures that the SelfKey DAO and its partners are sybil or bot-free.</p>
 Step Four: Connecting Wallet and Signing 
<p>Before beginning your KYC verification process, you'll be prompted to connect your digital wallet and provide a signature.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You're now starting the onboarding process. Please read each instruction thoroughly to successfully complete each step.</p>
 Step Five: ID Document verification 
<p>Before proceeding, it's essential to read and agree to the <a href="http://kycs.ai">KYCS.AI Privacy Policy &amp; Terms of Service</a>. Make sure to scroll through the entire document for the next button to activate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While verification via other devices is possible using a QR code, it's advisable to continue on a desktop or laptop.</p>
<p>A brief guide will be provided to demonstrate how to position your ID or passport for the desktop or laptop camera to capture a photo. Alternatively, you can upload the document directly from your computer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's crucial that the document is clear, fully visible, not tilted, and not cropped. If the upload fails, please make sure the guidelines are followed and attempt the upload again.</p>
<p></p>
 Step Six: Selfie Check 
<p>The next, and one of the most crucial steps in the process, is the selfie check. Given that the number of attempts is limited to only three, you must be extra cautious to respect the following guidelines before pressing the photo button:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Make sure that you are facing the camera directly. 
  You must be in good light, so that all your features are visible. 
  Position your face close enough to the camera to fit within the oval guide provided. 
 
<p></p>
 Step Seven: Details and Information 
<p>After passing the selfie check, you will be required to confirm the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please make sure that the fields are filled in correctly before continuing to the next step.</p>
<p>Following this, you will need to confirm additional details, such as your date of birth, nationality, and country of residence. These fields must be completed before proceeding to the next step.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The final step will be to review the information you've submitted for accuracy. Once you submit the form, you won't be able to make any further changes.</p>
<p></p>
 Step Eight: Verification and Onboarding 
<p>The verification process can take a few minutes up to a few hours but if all is well, your application will be approved. If you’ve successfully completed the KYC process, you will receive an email redirecting you to selfkey.app.org.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Make sure you thoroughly read, understand, and agree with the <a href="https://staging.gc.selfkey.org/terms-of-service">terms of service</a> before proceeding.</p>
 Step Nine: Claiming your SelfKey iD SBT 
<p>Once you've finished the preceding step, you'll be able to claim your SelfKey iD. This involves an additional selfie check as an added security measure.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please make sure that the additional selfie matches the one taken during onboarding and that you check the agreement box before proceeding.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With this final step, you’ve completed your onboarding.</p>
<p>If you’re experiencing any issues during or after obtaining your SelfKey iD, please make sure to open a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/897002577831526460/1128242522829897758">support ticket</a>. SelfKey DAO is here to provide assistance every step of the way, as promptly as possible.</p>
 SelfKey iD Benefits 
<p>Congratulations on obtaining your very own SelfKey iD SBT! Now that you’re a valued member of SelfKey DAO, it is vital to take note of all the perks and benefits you can enjoy as a proud SelfKey iD user.</p>
<p></p>
 Claiming SELF tokens 
<p>Upon completing onboarding, each new SelfKey iD user has the opportunity to claim a generous 50 SELF tokens to ignite their journey. This gesture serves as a token of appreciation and a heartfelt welcome from SelfKey DAO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the initial 50 SELF tokens must be manually claimed by the user, ensuring active participation in the process.&nbsp;</p>
 Redeeming Invite Code 
<p>Each SelfKey iD holder receives a unique invite code, which remains usable indefinitely. This code offers one of the simplest means to accumulate SELF tokens while also fostering the growth and expansion of the DAO.</p>
<p>To benefit, users merely need to distribute their code among friends, family, and acquaintances. For each eligible member successfully onboarded into SelfKey DAO using this code, both the user and the referred individual stand to potentially qualify for SELF tokens.</p>
<p>With the invite code's indefinite usability, it presents an exceptional chance for active members to consistently build their SELF holdings over time.</p>
 Credential Locking 
<p>Within the SelfKey iD framework, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-id-credential-locking/">Credential Locking</a> serves as an added layer of security for online identity verification. This process typically involves the following steps:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie as part of the initial KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure. 
 For continued access to SelfKey DAO, users undergo additional selfie checks. 
 Upon successful check, users receive a credential that can be locked using KEY. This verification procedure ensures the authentication of users' identities, potentially enhancing their digital security. 
 
<p>By securing KEY on their credentials, users actively contribute to fortifying the security of the SelfKey DAO ecosystem and may have the opportunity to mint SELF tokens themselves.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Through the development of cutting-edge digital solutions, SelfKey DAO aims to erect barriers against cyber threats that could result in identity theft. One such solution could be SelfKey iD.</p>
<p>Leveraging the remarkable capabilities of artificial intelligence, SelfKey iD stands ready to counter the risks posed by data breaches and identity theft. Moreover, it offers unique advantages and presents opportunities for active members of the SelfKey DAO community.</p>
<p>If you're prepared to enhance your digital identity management, seize the opportunity to acquire your very own SelfKey iD today!</p>

<p>Virtually every organization recognizes the power of data to enhance customer and employee experiences and drive better business decisions. Yet, as data becomes more valuable, it’s also becoming harder to protect. Companies continue to create more attack surfaces with hybrid models, scattering critical data across cloud, third-party and on-premises locations, while&nbsp;threat actors constantly devise new and creative ways to exploit vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>In response, many organizations are focusing more on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-protection">data protection</a>, only to find a lack of formal guidelines and advice.</p>



<p>While every data protection strategy is unique, below are several key components and best practices to consider when building one for your organization.</p>



 What is a data protection strategy? 



<p>A data protection strategy is a set of measures and processes to safeguard an organization’s sensitive information from data loss and corruption. Its principles are the same as those of data protection—to protect data&nbsp;and&nbsp;support data availability.</p>



<p>To fulfill these principles, data protection strategies generally focus on the following three areas:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">Data security</a>—protecting digital information from unauthorized access, corruption or theft throughout its entire lifecycle. 



 Data availability—ensuring critical data is available for business operations even during a data breach, malware or ransomware attack. 



 Access control—making critical data accessible only to employees who need it and not to those who don’t. 
 



<p>Data protection’s emphasis on accessibility and availability is one of the main reasons it differs from data security. While data security focuses on protecting digital information from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/threat-actor">threat actors</a>&nbsp;and unauthorized access, data protection does all that and more. It supports the same security measures as data security but also covers authentication, data backup, data storage and achieving regulatory compliance, as in the European Union’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/gdpr-eu">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR).</p>



<p>Most data protection strategies now have traditional data protection measures, like data backups and restore functions, as well as business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) plans, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/draas">disaster recovery as a service</a> (DRaaS). Together, these comprehensive approaches not only deter threat actors but also standardize the management of sensitive data and corporate information security and limit any business operations lost to downtime.</p>



 Why it’s important for your security strategy 



<p>Data powers much of the world economy—and unfortunately, cybercriminals know its value.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">Cyberattacks</a> that aim to steal sensitive information continue to rise.&nbsp;According to IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">Cost of a Data Breach</a>, the global average cost to remediate a data breach in 2023 was USD 4.45 million, a 15 percent increase over three years.</p>



<p>These data breaches can cost their victims in many ways. Unexpected downtime can lead to lost business, a company can lose customers and suffer significant reputational damage, and stolen intellectual property can hurt a company’s profitability, eroding its competitive edge.</p>



<p>Data breach victims also frequently face steep regulatory fines or legal penalties. Government regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and industry regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA), oblige companies to protect their customers’ personal data.</p>



<p>Failure to comply with these data protection laws can result in hefty fines. In May 2023, Ireland’s data protection authority imposed a USD 1.3 billion fine on the California-based Meta for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/22/facebook-fined-mishandling-user-information-ireland-eu-meta">GDPR violations</a>.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, companies are increasingly prioritizing data protection within their cybersecurity initiatives, realizing that a robust data protection strategy not only defends against potential data breaches but also ensures ongoing compliance with regulatory laws and standards. Even more, a good data protection strategy can improve business operations and minimize downtime in a cyberattack, saving critical time and money.</p>



 Key components of data protection strategies&nbsp; 



<p>While every data protection strategy is different (and should be tailored to the specific needs of your organization), there are several solutions you should cover.</p>



<p>Some of these key components include:</p>



 Data lifecycle management&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lifecycle-management">Data lifecycle management</a>&nbsp;(DLM) is an approach that helps manage an organization’s data throughout its lifecycle—from data entry to data destruction. It separates data into phases based on different criteria and moves through these stages as it completes different tasks or requirements. The phases of DLM include data creation, data storage, data sharing and usage, data archiving, and data deletion.</p>



<p>A good DLM process can help organize and structure critical data, particularly when organizations rely on diverse types of data storage. It can also help them reduce vulnerabilities and ensure data is efficiently managed, compliant with regulations, and not at risk of misuse or loss.</p>



 Data access management controls 



<p>Access controls help prevent unauthorized access, use or transfer of sensitive data by ensuring that only authorized users can access certain types of data. They keep out threat actors while still allowing every employee to do their jobs by having the exact permissions they need and nothing more.</p>



<p>Organizations can use role-based access controls (RBAC),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>&nbsp;or regular reviews of user permissions.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/identity-access-management">Identity and access management (IAM)</a>&nbsp;initiatives are especially helpful for streamlining access controls and protecting assets without disrupting legitimate business processes. They assign all users a distinct digital identity with permissions tailored to their role, compliance needs and other factors.</p>



 Data encryption 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">Data encryption</a>&nbsp;involves converting data from its original, readable form (plaintext) into an encoded version (ciphertext) using encryption algorithms. This process helps ensure that even if unauthorized individuals access encrypted data, they won’t be able to understand or use it without a decryption key.</p>



<p>Encryption is critical to data security. It helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access both when it’s being transmitted over networks (in transit)&nbsp;and&nbsp;when it’s being stored on devices or servers (at rest). Typically, authorized users only perform decryption when necessary to ensure that sensitive data is almost always secure and unreadable.</p>



 Data risk management 



<p>To protect their data, organizations first need to know their risks. Data&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/risk-management">risk management</a>&nbsp;involves conducting a full audit/risk assessment of an organization’s data to understand what types of data it has, where it’s stored and who has access to it.</p>



<p>Companies then use this assessment to identify threats and vulnerabilities and implement risk mitigation strategies. These strategies help fill security gaps and strengthen an organization’s data security and cybersecurity posture. Some include adding security measures, updating data protection policies, conducting employee training or investing in new technologies.</p>



<p>Additionally, ongoing risk assessments can help organizations catch emerging data risks early, allowing them to adapt their security measures accordingly.</p>



 Data backup and recovery 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/backup-disaster-recovery">Data backup and disaster recovery</a>&nbsp;involves periodically creating or updating more copies of files, storing them in one or more remote locations, and using the copies to continue or resume business operations in the event of data loss due to file damage, data corruption, cyberattack or natural disaster.</p>



<p>The subprocesses ‘backup’ and ‘disaster recovery’ are sometimes mistaken for each other or the entire process. However, backup is the process of making file copies, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/disaster-recovery">disaster recovery</a>&nbsp;is the plan and process for using the copies to quickly reestablish access to applications, data and IT resources after an outage. That plan might involve switching over to a redundant set of servers and storage systems until your primary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a>&nbsp;is functional again.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/draas">Disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS)</a>&nbsp;is a managed approach to disaster recovery. A third-party provider hosts and manages the infrastructure used for disaster recovery. Some DRaaS offerings might provide tools to manage the disaster recovery processes or enable organizations to have those processes managed for them.</p>



 Data storage management 



<p>Whenever organizations move their data, they need strong security. Otherwise, they risk exposing themselves to data loss, cyber threats and potential data breaches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data storage management helps simplify this process by reducing vulnerabilities, particularly for hybrid and cloud storage. It oversees all tasks related to securely transferring production data to data stores, whether on-premises or in external cloud environments. These stores cater to either frequent, high-performance access or serve as archival storage for infrequent retrieval.</p>



 Incident response 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/incident-response">Incident response</a>&nbsp;(IR) refers to an organization’s processes and technologies for detecting and responding to cyber threats, security breaches and cyberattacks. Its goal is to prevent cyberattacks before they happen and minimize the cost and business disruption resulting from any that do occur.</p>



<p>Incorporating incident response into a broader data protection strategy can help organizations take a more proactive approach to cybersecurity and improve the fight against cybercriminals.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2023</a>, organizations with high levels of IR countermeasures in place incurred USD 1.49 million lower data breach costs compared to organizations with low levels or none, and they resolved incidents 54 days faster.</p>



 Data protection policies and procedures 



<p>Data protection policies help organizations outline their approach to data security and data privacy. These policies can cover a range of topics, including data classification, access controls, encryption standards, data retention and disposal practices, incident response protocols, and technical controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and antivirus and data loss prevention (DLP) software.</p>



<p>A major benefit of data protection policies is that they set clear standards. Employees know their responsibilities for safeguarding sensitive information and often have training on data security policies, such as identifying phishing attempts, handling sensitive information securely and promptly reporting security incidents.</p>



<p>Additionally, data protection policies can enhance operational efficiency by offering clear processes for data-related activities such as access requests, user provisioning, incident reporting and conducting security audits.</p>



 Standards and regulatory compliance 



<p>Governments and other authorities increasingly recognize the importance of data protection and have established standards and data protection laws that companies must meet to do business with customers.</p>



<p>Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines, including legal fees. However, a robust data protection strategy can help ensure ongoing regulatory compliance by laying out strict internal policies and procedures.</p>



<p>The most notable regulation is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/gdpr-eu">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, enacted by the European Union (EU) to safeguard individuals’ personal data. GDPR focuses on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;and imposes stringent compliance requirements on data providers. It mandates transparency in data collection practices and imposes substantial fines for non-compliance, up to 4 percent of an organization’s annual global turnover or EUR 20 million.</p>



<p>Another significant data privacy law is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which, like GDPR, emphasizes transparency and empowers individuals to control their personal information. Under CCPA, California residents can request details about their data, opt out of sales, and request deletion.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates data security and compliance standards for “covered entities” like healthcare providers handling patients’ personal health information (PHI).</p>

 Best practices for every data protection strategy 



 Inventory all available data 



<p>Having secure data starts with knowing what types of data you have, where it’s stored and who has access to it. Conduct a comprehensive data inventory to identify and categorize all information held by your organization. Determine the sensitivity and criticality of each data type to prioritize protection efforts, then regularly update the inventory with any changes in data usage or storage.</p>



 Keep stakeholders informed 



<p>Maintain strong communications with key stakeholders, such as executives, vendors, suppliers, customers and PR and marketing personnel, so they know your data protection strategy and approach. This open line of communication will create greater trust, transparency and awareness of data security policies and empower employees and others to make better cybersecurity decisions.</p>



 Conduct security awareness training 



<p>Conduct security awareness training across your entire workforce on your data protection strategy. Cyberattacks often exploit human weakness, making&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/insider-threats">insider threats</a> a significant concern and employees the first line of defense against cybercriminals. With presentations, webinars, classes and more, employees can learn to recognize security threats and better protect critical data and other sensitive information.</p>



 Run regular risk assessments 



<p>Running ongoing risk assessments and analyses helps identify potential threats and avoid data breaches. Risk assessments allow you to take stock of your data footprint and security measures and isolate vulnerabilities while maintaining updated data protection policies. Additionally, some data protection laws and regulations require them.</p>



 Maintain strict documentation 



<p>Documenting sensitive data in a hybrid IT environment is challenging but necessary for any good data protection strategy. Maintain strict records for regulators, executives, vendors and others in case of audits, investigations or other cybersecurity events. Updated documentation creates operational efficiency and ensures transparency, accountability and compliance with data protection laws. Additionally, data protection policies and procedures should always be up-to-date to combat emerging cyber threats.</p>



 Perform ongoing monitoring&nbsp; 



<p>Monitoring offers real-time visibility into data activities, allowing for the swift detection and remediation of potential vulnerabilities. Certain data protection laws may even require it. And even when it’s not required, monitoring can help keep data activities compliant with data protection policies (as with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/compliance-monitoring">compliance monitoring</a>). Organizations can also use it to test the effectiveness of proposed security measures.</p>



<p>While strategies will differ across industries, geographies, customer needs and a range of other factors, nailing down these essentials will help set your organization on the right path forward when it comes to fortifying its data protection.</p>

<div class='wrap'>


<p>In November 2023, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) released a set of draft regulations on the use of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and automated decision-making technology (ADMT).</p>



<p>The proposed rules are still in development, but organizations may want to pay close attention to their evolution. Because the state is home to many of the world’s biggest technology companies, any AI regulations that California adopts could have an impact far beyond its borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, a California appeals court <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/major-win-california-privacy-protection-agency-enforcement-regulations-can-begin">recently ruled</a> that the CPPA can immediately enforce rules as soon as they are finalized. By following how the ADMT rules progress, organizations can better position themselves to comply as soon as the regulations take effect.</p>



<p>The CPPA is still accepting public comments and reviewing the rules, so the regulations are liable to change before they are officially adopted. This post is based on the most current draft as of 9 April 2024.</p>



 Why is California developing new rules for ADMT and AI? 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ccpa-compliance">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA</a>), California’s landmark <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-privacy">data privacy</a> law, did not originally address the use of ADMT directly. That changed with the passage of the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in 2020, which amended the CCPA in several important ways.</p>



<p>The CPRA created the CPPA, a regulatory agency that implements and enforces CCPA rules. The CPRA also gave the CPPA the authority to issue regulations concerning California consumers’ rights to access information about, and opt out of, automated decisions. The CPPA is working on ADMT rules under this authority.</p>



 Who must comply with California’s ADMT and AI rules? 



<p>As with the rest of the CCPA, the draft rules would apply to for-profit organizations that do business in California and meet at least one of the following criteria:</p>



 
 The business has a total annual revenue of more than USD 25 million. 
 



 
 The business buys, sells, or shares the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii">personal data</a> of 100,000+ California residents. 
 



 
 The business makes at least half of its total annual revenue from selling the data of California residents. 
 



<p>Furthermore, the proposed regulations would only apply to certain uses of AI and ADMT: making significant decisions, extensively profiling consumers, and training ADMT tools.&nbsp;</p>



 How does the CPPA define ADMT? 



<p>The <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/meetings/materials/20240308_item4_draft_risk.pdf">current draft</a> (PDF, 827 KB) defines automated decision-making technology as any software or program that processes personal data and uses computation to execute a decision, replace human decision-making, or substantially facilitate human decision-making. The draft specifically notes that this definition includes software and programs “derived from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a>, statistics, other data-processing techniques or artificial intelligence.”</p>



<p>The draft rules explicitly name some tools that do not count as ADMT, including spam filters, spreadsheets, and firewalls. However, if an organization attempts to use these exempt tools to make automated decisions in a way that circumvents regulations, the rules will apply to that use.</p>



 Covered uses of ADMT 



 Making significant decisions 



<p>The draft rules would apply to any use of ADMT to make decisions that have significant effects on consumers. Generally speaking, a significant decision is one that affects a person’s rights or access to critical goods, services, and opportunities.</p>



<p>For example, the draft rules would cover automated decisions that impact a person’s ability to get a job, go to school, receive healthcare, or obtain a loan.</p>



 Extensive profiling 



<p>Profiling is the act of automatically processing someone’s personal information to evaluate, analyze, or predict their traits and characteristics, such as job performance, product interests, or behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Extensive profiling” refers to particular kinds of profiling:</p>



 
 Systematically profiling consumers in the context of work or school, such as by using a keystroke logger to track employee performance. 
 



 
 Systematically profiling consumers in publicly accessible places, such as using facial recognition to analyze shoppers’ emotions in a store. 
 



 
 Profiling consumers for behavioral advertising. Behavioral advertising is the act of using someone’s personal data to display targeted ads to them. 
 



 Training ADMT 



<p>The draft rules would apply to businesses’ use of consumer personal data to train certain ADMT tools. Specifically, the rules would cover training an ADMT that can be used to make significant decisions, identify people, <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/Blog-Heres-What-Policymakers-Can-Do-About-Deepfakes">generate deepfakes,</a> or perform physical or biological identification and profiling.</p>



 Who would be protected under the AI and ADMT rules? 



<p>As a California law, the CCPA’s consumer protections extend only to consumers who reside in California. The same holds true for the protections that the draft ADMT rules grant.</p>



<p>That said, these rules define “consumer” more broadly than many other data privacy regulations. In addition to people who interact with a business, the rules cover employees, students, independent contractors, and school and job applicants.</p>



 What are the draft CCPA rules on AI and automated decision-making technology? 



<p>The draft CCPA AI regulations have three key requirements. Organizations that use covered ADMT must issue pre-use notices to consumers, offer ways to opt out of ADMT, and explain how the business’s use of ADMT affects the consumer.</p>



<p>While the CPPA has revised the regulations once and is likely to do so again before the rules are formally adopted, these core requirements appear in each draft so far. The fact that these requirements persist suggests they will remain in the final rules, even if the details of their implementation change.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/guardium-insights/data-compliance">Learn how IBM Security® Guardium® Insights helps organizations meet their cybersecurity and data compliance regulations.</a></p>



 Pre-use notices 



<p>Before using ADMT for one of the covered purposes, organizations must clearly and conspicuously serve consumers a pre-use notice. The notice must detail in plain language how the company uses ADMT and explain consumers’ rights to access more information about ADMT and opt out of the process.</p>



<p>The company cannot fall back on generic language to describe how it uses ADMT, like “We use automated tools to improve our services.” Instead, the organization must describe the specific use.</p>



<p>The notice must direct consumers to additional information about how the ADMT works, including the tool’s logic and how the business uses its outputs. This information does not have to be in the body of the notice. The organization can give consumers a hyperlink or other way to access it.</p>



<p>If the business allows consumers to appeal automated decisions, the pre-use notice must explain the appeals process.</p>



 Opt-out rights 



<p>Consumers have a right to opt out of most covered uses of ADMT. Businesses must facilitate this right by giving consumers at least two ways to submit opt-out requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least one of the opt-out methods must use the same channel through which the business primarily interacts with consumers. For example, a digital retailer can have a web form for users to complete.</p>



<p>Opt-out methods must be simple and cannot have extraneous steps, like requiring users to create accounts.</p>



<p>Upon receiving an opt-out request, a business must stop processing a consumer’s personal information using that automated decision-making technology within 15 days. The business can no longer use any of the consumer’s data that it previously processed. The business must also notify any service providers or third parties with whom it shared the user’s data.</p>



 Exemptions 



<p>Organizations do not need to let consumers opt out of ADMT used for safety, security, and fraud prevention. The draft rules specifically mention using ADMT to detect and respond to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">data security</a> incidents, prevent and prosecute fraudulent and illegal acts, and ensure the physical safety of a natural person.</p>



<p>Under the human appeal exception, an organization need not enable opt-outs if it allows people to appeal automated decisions to a qualified human reviewer with the authority to overturn those decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations can also forgo opt-outs for certain narrow uses of ADMT in work and school contexts. These uses include:</p>



 
 Evaluating a person’s performance to make admission, acceptance, and hiring decisions. 
 



 
 Allocating tasks and determining compensation at work. 
 



 
 Profiling used solely to assess a person’s performance as a student or employee. 
 



<p>However, these work and school uses are only exempt from opt-outs if they meet the following criteria:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The ADMT in question must be necessary to achieve the business’s specific purpose and used only for that purpose.&nbsp; 
 



 
 The business must formally evaluate the ADMT to ensure that it is accurate and does not discriminate. 
 



 
 The business must put safeguards in place to ensure that the ADMT remains accurate and unbiased.&nbsp; 
 



<p>None of these exemptions apply to behavioral advertising or training ADMT. Consumers can always opt out of these uses.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/data-security">Learn how IBM data security solutions protect data across hybrid clouds and help simplify compliance requirements.</a></p>



 The right to access information about ADMT use&nbsp; 



<p>Consumers have a right to access information about how a business uses ADMT on them. Organizations must give consumers an easy way to request this information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When responding to access requests, organizations must provide details like the reason for using ADMT, the output of the ADMT regarding the consumer, and a description of how the business used the output to make a decision.</p>



<p>Access request responses should also include information on how the consumer can exercise their CCPA rights, such as filing complaints or requesting the deletion of their data.</p>



 Notification of adverse significant decisions 



<p>If a business uses ADMT to make a significant decision that negatively affects a consumer—for example, by leading to job termination—the business must send a special notice to the consumer about their access rights regarding this decision.</p>



<p>The notice must include:</p>



 
 An explanation that the business used ADMT to make an adverse decision. 
 



 
 Notification that the business cannot retaliate against the consumer for exercising their CCPA rights. 
 



 
 A description of how the consumer can access additional information about how ADMT was used. 
 



 
 Information on how to appeal the decision, if applicable.&nbsp; 
 



 Risk assessments for AI and ADMT 



<p>The CPPA is developing draft regulations on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-risk-management">risk assessments</a> alongside the proposed rules on AI and ADMT. While these are technically two separate sets of rules, the risk assessment regulations would affect how organizations use AI and ADMT.</p>



<p>The risk assessment rules would require organizations to conduct assessments before they use ADMT to make significant decisions or carry out extensive profiling. Organizations would also need to conduct risk assessments before they use personal information to train certain ADMT or AI models.</p>



<p>Risk assessments must identify the risks that the ADMT poses to consumers, the potential benefits to the organization or other stakeholders, and safeguards to mitigate or remove the risk. Organizations must refrain from using AI and ADMT where the risk outweighs the benefits.&nbsp;</p>



 How do the draft CCPA regulations relate to other AI laws? 



<p>California’s draft rules on ADMT are far from the first attempt at regulating the use of AI and automated decisions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/eu-ai-act">European Union’s AI Act</a> imposes strict requirements on the development and use of AI in Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the US, the Colorado Privacy Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act both give consumers the right to opt out of having their personal information processed to make significant decisions.</p>



<p>At the national level, President Biden signed an executive order in October 2023 directing federal agencies and departments to create standards for developing, using, and overseeing AI in their respective jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But California’s proposed ADMT regulations attract more attention than other state laws because they can potentially affect how companies behave beyond the state’s borders.</p>



<p>Much of the global technology industry is headquartered in California, so many of the organizations that make the most advanced automated decision-making tools will have to comply with these rules. The consumer protections extend only to California residents, but organizations might give consumers outside of California the same options for simplicity’s sake.</p>



<p>The original CCPA is often considered the US version of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/gdpr-eu">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> because it raised the bar for data privacy practices nationwide. These new AI and ADMT rules might produce similar results.</p>



 When do the CCPA AI and ADMT regulations take effect? 



<p>The rules are not finalized yet, so it’s impossible to say with certainty. That said, many observers estimate that the rules won’t take effect until mid-2025 at the earliest.</p>



<p>The CPPA is expected to hold another board meeting in July 2024 to discuss the rules further. Many believe that the CPPA Board is likely to begin the formal rulemaking process at this meeting. If so, the agency would have a year to finalize the rules, hence the estimated effective date of mid-2025.</p>



 How will the rules be enforced? 



<p>As with other parts of the CCPA, the CPPA will be empowered to investigate violations and fine organizations. The California attorney general can also levy civil penalties for noncompliance.</p>



<p>Organizations can be fined USD 2,500 for unintentional violations and USD 7,500 for intentional ones. These amounts are per violation, and each affected consumer counts as one violation. Penalties can quickly escalate when violations involve multiple consumers, as they often do.</p>



 What is the status of the CCPA AI and ADMT regulations? 



<p>The draft rules are still in flux. The CPPA continues to solicit public comments and hold board discussions, and the rules are likely to change further before they are adopted.</p>



<p>The CPPA has already made significant revisions to the rules based on prior feedback. For example, following the December 2023 board meeting, the agency added new exemptions from the right to opt out and placed restrictions on physical and biological profiling.</p>



<p>The agency also adjusted the definition of ADMT to limit the number of tools the rules would apply to. While the original draft included any technology that facilitated human decision-making, the most current draft applies only to ADMT that substantially facilitates human decision-making.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many industry groups feel the updated definition better reflects the practical realities of ADMT use, while privacy advocates worry it creates exploitable loopholes.</p>



<p>Even the CPPA Board itself is split on how the final rules should look. At a March 2024 meeting, two board members <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/california-proposed-amendments-to-5668070/">expressed concerns</a> that the current draft exceeds the board’s authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given how the rules have evolved so far, the core requirements for pre-use notices, opt-out rights, and access rights have a strong chance to remain intact. However, organizations may have lingering questions like:</p>



 
 What kinds of AI and automated decision-making technology will the final rules cover? 
 



 
 How will consumer protections be implemented on a practical level? 
 



 
 What kind of exemptions, if any, will organizations be granted? 
 



<p>Whatever the outcome, these rules will have significant implications for how AI and automation are regulated nationwide—and how consumers are protected in the wake of this booming technology.</p>

<p>With Generative AI being used to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-21/scarlett-johansson-shocked-by-openai-voice/103872924">imitate celebrities</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/podcasts/the-daily/ai-deepfake-drake.html">creators</a>, the question arises, is your likeness a form of intellectual property (IP)? Can you trademark your face or copyright your voice?</p>
<p>These questions are on the <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=40f40397-c091-4259-8e97-eab0943f565f">bleeding edge of IP law</a> and could take years to resolve. But I find there may be a simpler way to legally protect personal appearance.</p>
<p>On my reading of technology-neutral data protection law, generating likenesses of people without their permission could be a privacy breach.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the generally accepted definition of&nbsp;personal data as any data that may reasonably be related to an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data (sometimes called&nbsp;personal information) is treated in much the same way by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.caprivacy.org/cpra-text/">California Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;(CPRA), Europe’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data">General Data Protection Regulation</a>&nbsp;(GDPR), Australia’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information">Privacy Act</a>, and the new draft&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/the-american-privacy-rights-acts-definition-of-covered-data">American Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;(APRA).</p>
<p>These regulatory approaches to privacy place limits on how personal data is collected, used and disclosed. If personal data is collected without a good reason, or in excess of what’s reasonable for the purpose, or without the knowledge of the individual concerned, then privacy law may be breached.</p>
<p>What’s more,&nbsp;<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/the-regulatory-superpower-of-technology-neutrality/">technology neutrality in privacy law</a> means it does not matter how personal data comes to be held in a storage system; if it’s there, it may be deemed to have been collected.</p>
<p>Collection may be done directly and overtly via forms, questionnaires and measurements, or indirectly and subtly by way of acquisitions, analytics and algorithms.</p>
<p>To help stakeholders deal with the rise of analytics and Big Data, the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/">Australian privacy regulator</a> developed the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/more-guidance/guide-to-data-analytics-and-the-australian-privacy-principles">Guide to Data Analytics and the Australian Privacy Principles</a> which explains that:</p>
<p>“The concept of ‘collects’ applies broadly, and includes gathering, acquiring or obtaining personal information from any source and by any means. This includes collection by ‘creation’ which may occur when information is created with reference to, or generated from, other information” (underline added).</p>
<p>That guidance should apply to Deep Fakes, for what are digital images and voices if not data?</p>
<p>Digital recordings are series of ‘ones and zeros’ representing optical or acoustic samples that can be converted back to analog to be viewed or heard by people. If those sounds and images are identifiable as a natural person—that is, the output looks like or sounds like someone in particular—then logically that data is personal data about that person.</p>
[Aside: If it seems like a stretch to label digitally sampled light and sound as personal data, then consider digital text. That too is merely ‘ones and zeros’, in this case representing coded characters, which can be converted by a display device or printer to be human readable. If those characters form words and sentences which relate to an identifiable individual, then the ones and zeros from which they were all derived are clearly treated by privacy law as personal data.]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it ought not matter under technology neutral privacy law if an identifiable image or sound was recorded from real life or synthesised by software: the law would apply in both cases.</p>
<p>The same sort of interpretation would seem to be available under any similar technology neutral data protection regime.</p>
<p>That is, if a Generative AI model makes a likeness of a real-life individual Alice, then we can say the model has collected [by creation] personal information about Alice, and the operation of the model could be subject to privacy law.</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer but this seems to me to be easy enough to test in a ‘digital line up’. If a face or voice is presented to a sample of people, and an agreed percentage of them say the face or voice reminds them of Alice, then that would be evidence that personal data of Alice has been collected.</p>
<p>Moreover, if it was found that the model was actually prompted to mimic someone, then the case would be pretty strong, shall we say, on its face.</p>

   The internet's security relies on complex math, or cryptography. However, with quantum computers on the horizon, current encryption could become easily breakable.  Post-quantum cryptography research is now focused on developing new, quantum-resistant methods. With the possibility of large-scale quantum computers within the next twenty years, organizations must prepare for the quantum apocalypse, w

<p>The security, confidentiality, and integrity of the Internet are ultimately based on really hard math, aka cryptography. Computers get faster every few years (Moore’s Law, anyone?), meaning those math problems need to be That Much Harder to remain the foundation of security for the digital world. But what happens when our computers shift from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/transistor">transistors</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsquantum-mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>? That’s when everything based on today’s really hard math problems becomes laughably easy to crack.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity enthusiasts are not looking forward to that moment; it will be an Internet-wide emergency like we’ve never seen before. So, when can we expect quantum cryptography to break Internet security? Great question! That emergency may happen pretty soon. Or it may be a few more years. Some conspiracy theorists suggest it has already happened, and hackers are keeping quiet about it so they can suck up all the data with none the wiser. Ultimately, no one knows, though there are various predictions out there.</p>



 What is Quantum Mechanics? 



<p>You’ve probably heard about atoms. Teeny tiny particles that combine in various ways to make matter like oxygen and iron. Those teeny tiny particles are made up of even teenier tinier particles, and those sub-atomic particles are like magic.</p>



<p>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Arthur C. Clarke</p>



<p>Those subatomic particles offer some very interesting behavior that scientists and engineers can sometimes predict and manipulate. Predicting and manipulating those subatomic particles is what quantum mechanics is all about, and when it works, it is blindingly fast.</p>



 Quantum Computing 



<p>Scientists have been studying quantum mechanics for over a hundred years. It wasn’t until 1982, when Richard Feynman wrote in his famous paper,&nbsp;<a href="https://s2.smu.edu/~mitch/class/5395/papers/feynman-quantum-1981.pdf">Simulating Physics with Computers</a>, that people started thinking about the possibilities. Things got exciting in 1994 when Peter Shor developed a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">quantum algorithm</a>. That algorithm was the warning bell that cryptographic systems based on solving current complex math problems would be blown out of the water.</p>



<p>What that algorithm could do was find the prime factors of large numbers in shorter timeframes than ever before. You have probably seen those tables about how long it takes to crack a password (like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2023/05/18/time-taken-for-hackers-to-crack-passwords-revealed/">this one</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.response-it.co.uk/news/2020/9/2/how-long-does-it-take-to-crack-your-password">this one</a>) that shows millions or billions of years to crack a long, complicated password. Now, imagine those numbers cut down to days. More bluntly, what once took a few billion years to solve using traditional computing and existing algorithms will take days with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bairesdev.com/blog/quantum-computing-how-affect-cybersecurity/">quantum computing</a>.</p>



 Post-Quantum Cryptography 



<p>With Shor’s Algorithm kicking things off, research is underway to develop more quantum algorithms that can be used as the basis of new cryptographic methods. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a&nbsp;<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">very active program</a>&nbsp;focused entirely on this area of study.</p>



<p>The goal of this program isn’t just new, advanced math. It’s advanced math that can interoperate with both new and traditional protocols and networks. It takes an amazing mind to figure out how to develop an algorithm that takes advantage of quantum mechanics when computers that use quantum mechanics are not quite ready for prime time. (See what I did there?)</p>



<p>NIST’s take on the probability and timing of the quantum apocalypse scenario is:</p>



<p>“While in the past it was less clear that large quantum computers are a physical possibility, many scientists now believe it to be merely a significant engineering challenge. Some engineers even predict that within the next twenty or so years sufficiently large quantum computers will be built to break essentially all public key schemes currently in use.”</p>



 Looking into the Void 



<p>The world is on the brink of having new computers that can crack code faster than dropping fine china on a granite countertop. Even if post-quantum cryptography is ready for real-world use around the same time those new computers are a reality, we still have a big problem. Great! What happens to all the material that people, organizations, and governments have been collecting and storing, waiting for the day they can crack it right open? Because it’s unrealistic to say that data collection isn’t happening.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/check-point-research-cyber-attacks-increased-50-year-over-year/">number of cybersecurity attacks</a>&nbsp;reported goes up every year. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2024/02/why-data-breaches-spiked-in-2023">Harvard Business Review,</a>&nbsp;breaches spiked in 2023. And all that is just what we know about. There is a lot of data already out there, and it’s unlikely that said data is encrypted with quantum-resistant algorithms.</p>



<p>When the first quantum-based computer is produced, we will see some interesting and terrifying information exposures. And if you want to freak out and head to your closest off-the-grid bunker, imagine AI powered by quantum-based computers.</p>



 Planning for an Emergency 



<p>Like all animals, humans are terrible at staying in emergency mode for long. And preparing for something as mind-blowing as the quantum apocalypse when we don’t know the timing is difficult. Do we treat it as an imminent emergency? Or do we slide it behind all the other emergencies clamoring for our attention? The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/01/navigating-quantum-shift-preparing-people-products-systems-quantum-resilience/">World Economic Forum</a>&nbsp;breaks down the steps that organizations should build into their plans into three items:</p>



 
 Be aware that changes in computing that will make your current security models irrelevant will happen. 



 Train your workforce to stay aware of changes in best practices for cryptography and conduct assessments of what data you have that is most sensitive to changes in advances in cryptography. 



 Remember your IoT devices and other digital assets may also be impacted. 
 



 Wrap Up 



<p>The Quantum Apocalypse has many cybersecurity practitioners biting their nails as responding to the brave new world of quantum cryptography will not be simple, quick, or cheap. It has business leaders thinking about retirement. And it’s just another Urgent Event for everyone else to worry about (because we don’t have enough to worry about today).</p>



<p>Still, the only thing worse than an apocalyptic event is an apocalyptic event no one saw coming. While there may be nothing for you and your organization to do right now beyond staying aware, that awareness will put you ahead of the game when this new computing paradigm becomes available to the world.</p>

<p>I’ve been part of the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Key Management working group for 3+ years. We try to meet up virtually every two weeks, skillfully facilitated by our CSA staff member Marina Bregkou. The working group is formed from a dozen or so people, some who attend regularly and some who drop in and out. It can sometimes be tricky for us trying to make time in our calendars while still trying to do our day jobs; however, the mix of backgrounds, experience, and characters that make up our group keep us engaged and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>We’ve been working on a paper for many months, discussing hardware security modules (HSMs) and, in particular, their as-a-service manifestation (HSMaaS). If you’re not familiar with HSMs and their cloud-based as-a-service relatives, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/what-are-hardware-security-modules">here’s an introduction to HSMs</a>.</p>
<p>The CSA approach is to always remain vendor agnostic so no one contributor can shift the content of the paper to promote or discuss specific product or vendor solutions. However, that doesn’t stop us from sharing our experience and insight.</p>
<p>I’m sure like other CSA working groups, of which there are 20 or more, the major milestone is when we get to the point where we publish a paper. It is the culmination of weeks of contribution, discussion, cogitation, and deliberation. Recently we published <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/hsm-as-a-service-use-cases-considerations-and-best-practices">HSM-as-a-Service Use Cases, Considerations, and Best Practices</a>, which tackles the following topics:</p>
 
 The definition and architecture of an HSM 
 The current and future state of the HSMaaS market 
 Industry, compliance, and risk use cases for the HSMaaS model 
 The importance of clearly defined responsibilities in the HSMaaS model 
 Security considerations for HSMs 
 Key management considerations unique to HSMaaS 
 Important considerations when setting up governance for HSMs 
 HSM vendor selection best practices 
 
<p></p>
<p>We hope it will be a useful, impartial reference for cloud service customers, whose industry, compliance, security, or risk drivers necessitate increased control over HSMs and key-management operations.</p>
<p>Once you’ve read the CSA paper and decide you want to use a trusted HSM-as-a-Service provider with 25+ years’ experience and global coverage, I suggest you check out <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/hsm/nshield-as-a-service">Entrust nShield as a Service</a>.</p>

<p>PKI and cryptography are critical components of a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework?edc_sfid=7015Y000003dRWZQA2&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA_5WvBhBAEiwAZtCU78IhLzN7Zgxf6ga0wROR5TnGvrInZctKnGfXrquicZEBwdRyL_gufRoCeq4QAvD_BwE">Zero Trust</a> strategy, driving the use of encryption to keep identities, devices, data, connections, and communications secure. Like many things, increased use of encryption starts with good intentions, but may have unintended consequences. In this case, the proliferation of certificates across the organization may create a management and ownership challenge, adding cyber risk. This is the Zero Trust encryption paradox, which is why two of the critical early steps on an organization’s Zero Trust journey are to identify and inventory all cryptographic assets, followed by establishing clear ownership.</p>
<p>As a clear example, the 2024 State of Zero Trust &amp; Encryption Study sponsored by Entrust highlights how a lack of skilled personnel and no clear ownership makes the management of credentials painful, cited by 50% and 47% of respondents, respectively. And at the same time, 59% of respondents say managing keys has a severe impact on their organizations.</p>
<p>Establishing visibility and clear ownership of cryptographic assets may seem very logical and manageable on the surface, but today’s reality is far more complex. Long gone are the days of a massive Active Directory implementation to service an entirely on-prem certificate authority (CA). Today’s digital ecosystem spans servers, applications, networks, identities, infrastructure, hardware, and endpoints, with some data residing in the cloud and other data on-prem. New use cases continue to add to PKI deployment complexity as more teams use certificates, causing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/sites/default/files/documentation/infographics/state-of-pki-in.pdf">PKI sprawl</a>. As well, in their zeal to implement a Zero Trust strategy, different siloed teams from IT to security to infrastructure and beyond often acquire their own certificate authorities, deploying PKI and certificates without proper governance. In fact, the Entrust study revealed that 37% of organizations polled cited unmanaged certificates as a main area of concern that might result in the exposure of sensitive or confidential data.</p>
 Why an enterprise-wide Zero Trust strategy is critical 
<p>Without an <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/05/the-critical-role-of-clm-for-zero-trust-today-and-pq-tomorrow/">enterprise-wide Zero Trust strategy</a>, this increased use of PKI can actually increase an organization’s vulnerability both today and in the future when planning for PQC migration. Plus, expired certificates can cause significant organization disruption, costing time and money to locate the expired certificate and identify everywhere it was installed.</p>
<p>Today, PKI and cryptographic assets are critical infrastructure, expanding in number, and essential to a Zero Trust strategy. However, it is a false assumption to think that systems will be secured forever with conventional PKI cryptography, and the magnitude of this risk is often unknown because organizations lack enterprise-wide crypto asset visibility. Simply put, you can’t manage what you can’t see. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> (ZTMM) features five pillars underpinned by three core tenets: Visibility and Analytics, Automation and Orchestration, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2024/04/why-zero-trust-is-a-must-for-strong-corporate-governance/">Governance</a>. Visibility in the CISA ZTMM refers to observable artifacts that result from the characteristics of and events within enterprise-wide environments. This focus on cyber-related data analysis helps inform policy decisions, facilitate response activities, and build a proactive security risk profile.</p>
 Essential early steps 
<p>So how do you resolve the Zero Trust encryption paradox? The first step is to establish clear ownership with a team accountable for enterprise-wide Zero Trust and encryption strategy and migration. And it appears more organizations are taking this to heart with dedicated PKI specialists operating under CxO oversight vs. being the domain IT generalists. Next is to inventory data and flows to identify the location of high-value data at rest, in transit, and in use. With ownership and data flows identified, the next step is to inventory the organization’s cryptographic assets, which is usually a combined automated manual effort to identify all keys, certificates, secrets, and libraries. Armed with this information, the dedicated team is now able to draft a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/do-you-have-cryptographic-agility/">crypto-agility</a> strategy. This is a critical milestone in the Zero Trust journey, mitigating the organization’s crypto-related risk – including people, processes, and technology – with built-in capabilities.</p>
<p>And there you have it: An enterprise-wide Zero Trust strategy with clear ownership and crypto asset visibility and agility not only resolves the Zero Trust encryption paradox, but also provides a strong foundation for the next step of your Zero Trust journey.</p>

<p>Cyberattacks were forecast to have cost the global economy <a href="https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/606505844/cybercrime-damages-to-cost-the-world-8-trillion-usd-in-2023">$8 trillion USD</a> in 2023, and this number is forecast to grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025. In many cases, the scale and effectiveness of these attacks are being fueled by artificial intelligence (AI), especially deepfakes. Our Identity Fraud Report 2024 shows a <a href="https://go.entrust.com/identity-fraud-report-2024">31x increase in the volume of deepfake attempts</a> between 2022 and 2023. Facing this intensifying threat landscape, governments and enterprises around the world are scrambling to implement <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework?edc_sfid=7015Y000003dRWZQA2&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA_5WvBhBAEiwAZtCU78IhLzN7Zgxf6ga0wROR5TnGvrInZctKnGfXrquicZEBwdRyL_gufRoCeq4QAvD_BwE">Zero Trust</a> strategies to improve their cyber-risk posture and resilience. As evidence of the importance of Zero Trust to secure the organization, just 18% of respondents in the 2024 State of Zero Trust &amp; Encryption Study sponsored by Entrust say that Zero Trust is not a priority at this time.</p>
<p>While previous Zero Trust journeys may have sputtered due to the limits of existing technology and a rigorous framework, AI is a game changer. On the surface, Zero Trust and AI may appear to be polar-opposite concepts with the former framed by the strict “Never Trust, Always Verify” principle, while the latter is characterized by both the promise and fear of the great unknown. However, much like “opposites attract,” Zero Trust and AI are natural partners.</p>
 An AI-Powered Approach to Zero Trust  
<p>With the biggest challenge to implementing Zero Trust being cited as a lack of in-house expertise (by 47 percent of respondents) in the Entrust report, it becomes apparent that additional resources are needed. Zero Trust demands constant vigilance and that’s where AI’s ability to discover, classify, and process large volumes of distributed data comes in. AI can literally speed up the detection of and response to cyberattacks.</p>
<p>However, bad actors may try to poison or otherwise manipulate the training data to blunt the effectiveness of such AI systems. So, Zero Trust and AI are somewhat akin to the “which came first, the chicken or the egg” metaphor. AI-enhanced visibility and decision-making can increase Zero Trust effectiveness, but Zero Trust is needed to protect the integrity of the data being used to train the AI model.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> (ZTMM) 2.0 foreshadowed this emerging relationship between Zero Trust and AI with a significant focus on the modernization of the Identity and Devices domains to improve an organization’s cyber-risk posture. Some specific examples include:</p>
 
 Identity Verification – Establishing and maintaining trusted identity is a critical component of any Zero Trust strategy, yet this is becoming harder and harder with AI-generated fakes. This is where <a href="https://fintechmagazine.com/fraud-id-verification/entrust-set-to-acquire-onfido">AI-enabled biometric identity verification</a> can help level the playing field to identify deepfakes in real time. 
 <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/iam/capabilities/adaptive-authentication?edc_sfid=7015Y000001zvXAQAY&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI--S5rcCIhQMVHIiuBR164w5AEAAYASAAEgKqnfD_BwE">Adaptive Authentication</a> – AI-enabled authentication can dynamically adjust privileges to respond to real-time risk factors like device reputation, geolocation, and behavioral biometrics. This AI-enabled approach aligns directly with Zero Trust’s “least privilege” construct. 
 Behavioral Analytics and Pattern Recognition – AI models that continuously learn and adapt to emerging patterns are ideal to analyze large volumes of distributed data to flag anomalies and potential threats. With this AI-enabled approach, Zero Trust’s “Never Trust, Always Verify” is more easily attainable. 
 
<p>So, there you have it: Zero Trust and AI are inextricably linked for organizational success and safety. With strict access controls, comprehensive visibility, and continual monitoring, Zero Trust lets organizations take advantage of the power of AI, while also helping to neutralize AI risks.</p>

Podium Introduction <p>Participants in the “Google Trends” Data Challenge analyzed the influence of public search interest on cryptocurrency market prices. The challenge required a detailed analysis of Google Trends data, integration of additional data sources, and the application of advanced ML methods to predict market behaviors. Essential tasks included conducting exploratory data analyses (EDA), identifying correlations, and investigating how historical and current trends could forecast future market movements.</p><p>Data scientists across various expertise levels engaged in this challenge to determine Google Trends’ impact on cryptocurrency valuations. They examined data from the past and present to predict future trends and built models that could potentially guide real-world investment decisions. This competition highlighted the power of Google Trends data in predicting cryptocurrency markets and showcased the importance of combining various data sources to strengthen financial models.</p><p>The winners of the challenge, through their exceptional skills in interpreting complex datasets and developing predictive models, have not only enhanced their technical skills but also contributed significantly to advancing data-driven financial analysis in the cryptocurrency field. Their models offer insights that could influence investment strategies in the dynamic cryptocurrency market, inspiring others to follow in their footsteps.</p> Podium and Top-10 Submissions <p>The top submissions of this challenge were exceptional. Participants demonstrated outstanding abilities in utilizing ML and data analysis to probe and predict movements within the cryptocurrency market. Let’s explore the top three submissions that stood out due to their thorough analytics and insightful conclusions.</p>Top 10 1st Place:&nbsp;Anamaria <p>Anamaria secured first place in the “Google Trends” Data Challenge by applying advanced ML techniques to analyze the correlation between Google Trends data and cryptocurrency prices. Her analytical framework led to precise findings on the predictive nature of search data on cryptocurrency values. [<a href="https://bit.ly/google_trends_anamaria">Click here to see the&nbsp;report</a>]</p><p>In her analysis, Anamaria integrated data and preparation process culminated in a comprehensive analysis of multiple cryptocurrency trends from 2019 to 2024. She found that Google Trends data had a measurable impact on cryptocurrency prices, with a correlation coefficient often exceeding 0.5. This indicates a moderate to strong positive relationship, suggesting that changes in search interest could potentially lead to significant price movements. Her model highlighted that significant spikes in search volumes, especially noted in 2021, preceded price increases in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In 2021 alone, during the peak interest phase, her analysis directly correlated with the highest market prices observed during that&nbsp;year.</p><p>Anamaria’s findings, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.53, mean squared error (MSE) of 28.47, and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 5.34, have significant implications for investors and market analysts. Her research suggests that monitoring search trend spikes could provide a strategic advantage in predicting market movements, a practical application that can guide investment strategies in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.</p><p>2nd Place: Ekpenyong</p><p>Ekpenyong earned second place in the Data Challenge with his detailed statistical analysis of the relationship between Google Trends data and cryptocurrency prices. His project employed rigorous statistical methods to uncover significant insights about market dynamics. [<a href="https://bit.ly/google_trends_ekpenyong">Click here to see the&nbsp;report</a>]</p><p>He used the Jarque-Bera test to check for normality in his analysis, revealing that cryptocurrency prices and Google Trends data were non-normally distributed with p-values less than 0.05. He also applied the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, confirming non-stationarity in the time series data for both prices and trends. This non-stationarity was further validated by the Phillips-Perron and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests, showing unit roots and time-varying statistical properties. These findings indicated that advanced models like Neural Networks were more suitable for his analysis due to their ability to handle non-stationary data.</p><p>Ekpenyong’s correlation analysis, using Spearman and Pearson coefficients, showed strong positive correlations between search trends and cryptocurrency prices for significant tokens. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibited correlation coefficients of 0.75 and 0.68, respectively. His Granger causality tests revealed significant bidirectional relationships for several cryptocurrencies, including Fetch.ai and Monero, with p-values less than 0.05, indicating that search interest could predict price changes and vice versa. Okpo also conducted an optimal lag analysis, finding that a one-week lag often provided the highest correlation, with Fetch.ai showing a correlation coefficient of 0.84 at a two-week&nbsp;lag.</p><p>3rd Place:&nbsp;Ahan</p><p>Ahan secured third place in the Data Challenge with his rigorous analysis of the correlation between Google Trends data and cryptocurrency prices, focusing on various market capitalizations. His project involved detailed statistical examination and predictive modeling to uncover critical insights. [<a href="https://bit.ly/google_trends_ahan">Click here to see the&nbsp;report</a>]</p><p>He categorized cryptocurrencies into large, mid, and small-cap based on market capitalization, analyzing top assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. His exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed that Bitcoin showed a 1200% increase in Google search interest from 2016 to 2017, correlating with a price surge from $1,000 to nearly $20,000. Similarly, from 2020 to 2021, Bitcoin’s search interest grew by 150%, with prices rising from approximately $7,200 to over $64,000. Ethereum showed a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.28, indicating that about 7.84% of its price variability could be explained by changes in Google search trends, particularly around significant network upgrades and DeFi activities.</p><p>Ahan’s analysis extended to the correlation and time-lagged impact of search trends on prices. He found that Dogecoin exhibited a high correlation coefficient of 0.59, suggesting that 34.81% of its price movements were linked to changes in Google Trends data. His time-lag analysis showed that Bitcoin’s price had an optimal correlation of 0.34 with a one-day lag, explaining about 11.56% of the price variability.

<p>As our network evolves, maintaining its integrity and efficiency becomes increasingly vital.&nbsp;</p><p>To this end, we are excited to introduce <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/referenda/10?ref=blog.dock.io">two new significant governance proposals</a> to enhance the transparency of Council membership and the efficiency of transaction fees.</p><p>In summary:</p>  We propose to reduce our length fee from 0.01 to 0.0001 tokens per byte to ensure that transactions and network upgrades become more cost-effective for our users.  We propose that all council members have verified identities to reduce spam generated by anonymous members and to promote greater accountability and trust within our governance structure.  <p>Below, we will delve into the details of these proposals and explain their rationale and anticipated impact on our community and network.</p> Reducing Transaction Fees for a More Efficient Network <p></p><p>Transaction fees on the Dock network depend on several factors, including the transaction's byte size, the amount of storage read or written, and the compute resources required.</p><p>Currently the network charges 0.01 tokens per byte of transaction, which we call the “length-fee”. For instance, if your transaction is 1000 bytes, the length-fee alone contributes 10 tokens (1000 * 0.01).&nbsp;</p><p>We recognize that our length fee is significantly higher than that of some networks in the Polkadot ecosystem, such as KILT, Moonbeam or Centrifuge.</p><p>To address this, we are reducing the length fee by 100 times, bringing it down to 0.0001 tokens per byte.</p><p>Here are examples of how this change will affect popular transactions:</p>  Transfer transactions will cost 1.3 tokens instead of 1.8 tokens.  Creating DIDs will cost 2.75 tokens instead of 4.5 tokens.  Revocation (status lists) will cost 2.9 tokens instead of 10.8 tokens.  <p>Additionally, network upgrades will also become much cheaper, as their costs are primarily driven by their large size.</p><p>We believe this will ensure Dock’s network fees remain very competitive and entice more and more organizations to our platform.&nbsp;</p><p>You can vote on this proposal <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/referenda/10?ref=blog.dock.io">here</a>.</p> Introducing Verified Identities for Council Membership <p></p><p>Currently, anyone can become a Council member by locking a certain amount of tokens and submitting their candidacy.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we’ve witnessed a recent increase in spam made by anonymous members, including a failed attempt by a Validator to become elected so they could pay themselves additional treasury rewards.</p><p>To dissuade future scam attempts, we propose that all Council members must have a verified identity, indicated by a green checkmark.&nbsp;</p><p>This new requirement ensures transparency and accountability within the Council.</p><p>Prospective members must set up their identities and request verification before submitting their candidacy for Council membership. Once verified, they can proceed to submit their candidacy.</p><p>Learn more about setting up an identity <a href="https://docs.dock.io/open-source-community/blockchain-validators/identity-setup?ref=blog.dock.io">here</a>.</p><p>Vote on this governance proposal <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/referenda/10?ref=blog.dock.io">here</a>.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Identity security is at a crossroads. As digital transformation accelerates, organizations are increasingly vulnerable to identity-focused attacks, which are now the primary entry point for cybercriminals. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into the attacker’s arsenal ups the stakes even higher. Cybercriminals recently stole $25 million from a multinational finance firm in a single stroke by impersonating executives using deepfake video and audio.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With security teams grappling with unprecedented demands, we’ve expanded our seminal State of Passwordless annual report to encompass the broader identity security field. Now titled <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">State of Passwordless Identity Assurance</a>, this fourth edition investigates current and emerging identity threats to organizations, their security perspectives and practices, and greatest areas of vulnerability. Conducted by HYPR and Vanson Bourne, the report is based on interviews with 750 IT/IS decision makers, representing a cross-section of industries across the globe. The results expose the gap between evolving threats and outdated identity models, and the extent that this undermines global security and business growth.</p> 
 Key Findings  
  
  Widespread Vulnerabilities: 91% of breached organizations cited credential misuse as a critical failure point.  
  Financial Impacts: The average cost of authentication-related breaches reached a staggering $5.48 million and identity fraud costs a further $2.78 million.  
  Adoption Challenges: Despite the clear benefits, the shift towards more secure passwordless methods like passkeys is slow, hindered by implementation complexities and costs.  
  
 Threat Trends  
<p>Our research reveals&nbsp; an unsettling rise in identity theft and fraud, driven by the availability of compromised credentials and sophisticated phishing schemes. Nearly all (99%) surveyed organizations faced some kind of attack over the past 12 months and almost eight in ten (78%) were targeted by identity-based attacks.</p> 
<p>Not surprisingly, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-phishing-prevention">phishing</a> and malware are the most prevalent. Push notification attacks, also called <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">MFA-prompt bombing</a>, continue to be a favorite technique of modern hacking groups. Toward the bottom of the list just two years ago, push attacks figure prominently in many recent high-profile attacks including the widespread campaign against Apple users last month.</p> 
 Types of cyberattacks faced in the last 12 months  
<p></p> 
 The Widespread Impact of Identity Breaches  
<p>The consequences of identity security breaches are significant. A staggering 84% of organizations that experienced a cyberattack subsequently suffered a breach, with 62% experiencing multiple breaches. For those organizations that were breached, 91% blame authentication weaknesses and the misuse of credentials for one or more breaches, a notable increase from 82% the previous year.</p> 
<p>These breaches not only carry significant financial burdens — with costs averaging $5.48 million — but also lead to customer loss, reputational damage, and substantial fines.</p> 
 
 The Current Landscape: Overcoming Inertia  
<p>Many organizations remain tethered to outdated security practices that no longer suffice in the current digital era. The findings underscore the urgency to shift from traditional perimeter-based defenses to an identity-first security strategy. Today, the average organization struggles with the complexities of managing an expanding number of digital identities, brought on by remote work trends and the adoption of new technologies.</p> 
<p>This transition stresses the need for robust identity security practices that not only prevent unauthorized access but also ensure a seamless user experience. Despite advancements, 99% of organizations still rely on outdated legacy authentication methods, highlighting a significant gap in adopting more secure and efficient solutions like passwordless authentication and continuous, automated identity verification.</p> 
<p>On a positive note, four in ten (41%) or organizations plan to use passwordless authentication or passkeys over the next 1-3 years. In addition, 43% intend to incorporate identity verification into their identity security processes.</p> 
 The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Identity Security  
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both opportunities and threats for identity security. On the one hand, AI can enhance identity security protocols through adaptive and risk-based controls. On the other hand, cybercriminals are using AI to exploit vulnerabilities more effectively, creating tailored phishing messages and convincing deepfakes.</p> 
<p>IT security decision-makers recognize the dual nature of AI, with <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/ai-attack-prevention">the ability to prevent threats from generative AI </a>(60%) and deepfake identity fraud (45%) among their top concerns. Despite these challenges, three-quarters (75%) believe that adopting AI within their identity security stack will ultimately give them an advantage over cybercriminals.</p> 
 Download the State of Passwordless Identity Assurance Report  
<p>As businesses continue to transform their operations and business models, they face unprecedented and dynamic security risks. The research underscores the urgent need for organizations to adopt a holistic, identity-first security strategy that leverages advanced technologies and continuous verification processes.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform">Identity Assurance platform</a> empowers organizations with a comprehensive identity security approach so they can protect their digital identities, safeguard sensitive data, and ensure long-term business resilience in an increasingly digital world.</p>

<p>In a hybrid world that blends on-premises and cloud-based resources, securing access to sensitive data and systems is no longer achieved by defending a perimeter, but through authentication. While authentication technologies have evolved over the past decades from their humble password origins, preventing unauthorized access still hinges on choosing and implementing the right identity-based controls.<br>
This involves navigating a landscape where knowledge-based, possession-based, biometric, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods offer a variety of advantages and limitations. Let’s consider each of the options available to organizations and how to select the right mix of controls to improve their security posture.</p>
 Knowledge-Based Authentication 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA), which encompasses passwords and PINs, is the most traditional form of authentication. Its widespread adoption and user familiarity make it a convenient starting point for many security protocols. However, its susceptibility to social engineering, phishing attacks, and the perennial issue of weak password creation by users necessitate a cautious approach. For environments where ease of use is paramount and risk levels are comparatively low, KBA can serve as a component of a more comprehensive security strategy, particularly when augmented with additional authentication factors.<br>
Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is best suited for environments with comparatively low risk levels, where ease of use is paramount and the accessed information is not highly sensitive or critical. It can serve as a supplementary authentication factor in conjunction with other methods, such as biometric or device-based authentication. Examples include accessing non-critical information, utilizing KBA alongside other authentication methods as a first factor, and implementing it in public Wi-Fi hotspots for streamlined user access without compromising security.</p>
 Possession-Based Authentication 
<p>Possession-based authentication methods require users to have a physical object, such as a security token or a mobile device, to gain access. This approach adds a tangible layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access without physical possession of the required object. It’s particularly effective in scenarios where additional security is needed without significantly complicating the user experience, such as in financial transactions or access to high-security areas. However, the risk of loss or theft and the potential cost implications of deploying hardware devices must be considered.<br>
Possession-based authentication methods offer heightened security measures for a range of scenarios, including financial transactions, remote work access, secure online transactions, and compliance-driven environments like legal and government agencies. In online banking, users require physical possession of a security token or mobile device to access their accounts securely. Similarly, in remote work settings, this method ensures that only authorized employees with designated devices can connect to corporate networks and sensitive data, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access. Additionally, in e-commerce platforms and online payment systems, possession-based authentication enhances transaction security, reducing the risk of fraud and protecting sensitive financial information. Furthermore, compliance-driven industries can benefit from this approach to meet regulatory obligations and safeguard confidential information.</p>
 Biometrics 
<p>Biometric authentication offers a high-security level by utilizing unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. This method is highly resistant to traditional hacking attempts and provides a seamless user experience. It is well-suited for environments where security cannot be compromised, such as in government or healthcare settings. Nevertheless, concerns around privacy, the potential for spoofing, and the need for compatible hardware investments can pose challenges. Organizations must weigh these factors against the critical need for secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.<br>
Biometric authentication, which leverages unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, is ideal for various high-security environments. It is best suited for secure access to sensitive data and fortifying high-risk online systems. Despite its advantages, organizations must consider privacy concerns, potential spoofing, and compatible hardware investments when deploying biometric authentication systems.</p>
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>MFA combines two or more authentication methods listed above to create a layered security approach, significantly enhancing protection against various threats. By integrating knowledge, possession, and biometric factors, MFA creates a dynamic defense mechanism that is much harder for attackers to bypass. This method is ideal for protecting sensitive data and critical systems, offering a balanced solution that addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in single-method authentication systems. While MFA introduces complexity and potential user resistance, its ability to significantly reduce security risks makes it a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategies.<br>
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a versatile security method that finds applications across industries, serving to protect sensitive data and critical systems. More commonly, MFA is required to ensure secure access to corporate systems from outside the office, and in e-commerce platforms to safeguard customer accounts and high-risk customer and citizen transactions. Overall, MFA provides a defense mechanism against various threats, combining multiple authentication factors to significantly enhance security and mitigate risks inherent in single-method authentication systems.</p>
 Passwordless 
<p>Passwordless authentication represents a significant leap forward in cybersecurity, eliminating the vulnerabilities associated with traditional knowledge-based methods. The majority of authentication methods included in the above still require a user name AND password as a first step in authenticating users. But, by leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a user-friendly and highly secure alternative that reduces the risk of phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This method is particularly advantageous in creating a seamless user experience without compromising security, and ideal for environments aiming to minimize friction while maintaining high security standards. Organizations looking to bolster access security while enhancing user satisfaction should consider integrating passwordless authentication into their strategic security framework, offering an optimal balance between ease of use and robust protection.<br>
Organizations across diverse sectors, particularly those looking for a better, more secure user experience, should carefully consider integrating passwordless authentication into their security frameworks. By leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a robust and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based methods, effectively mitigating the risks associated with phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This approach not only enhances security posture but also fosters a seamless and efficient user experience, aligning with the modern landscape of digital operations where stringent security measures and user satisfaction are paramount.</p>
 Choosing the Right Strategy 
<p>The choice of authentication method should be driven by an organization’s specific needs, considering factors such as the sensitivity of the data, user experience requirements, and regulatory compliance mandates. Here are four key considerations for selecting the appropriate authentication method:</p>
 
 Risk Assessment: Evaluate the level of security risk associated with the data or systems being protected. Higher risk scenarios may warrant more stringent authentication methods, such as biometric or MFA. 
 User Experience: Consider the impact on the user. While security is paramount, overly cumbersome authentication processes can lead to poor compliance and user frustration. 
 Cost and Infrastructure: Assess the financial and infrastructure implications of deploying new authentication technologies. While advanced methods like biometric authentication offer enhanced security, they also come with higher implementation costs. 
 Compliance Requirements: Ensure that the chosen authentication method aligns with industry regulations and standards, which may dictate specific security measures. 
 
<p>Defending against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats requires understanding the unique advantages and limitations of available authentication methods, and selecting the controls that are best aligned with organizational needs and user expectations. Using the methods described above can help define an authentication strategy that ensures security measures remain robust, responsive, and user-friendly.</p>

  The minimum threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in Switzerland is transactions over 1,000&nbsp;CHF.  VASPs must obtain and transmit originator and beneficiary information.  Originator info required includes name, account/transaction number, and address or ID&nbsp;details.  <p>Switzerland, a Central European country, has a crypto-enthusiastic population. According to Statista, the number of people <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1202468/global-cryptocurrency-ownership/">who own or use cryptocurrencies reached 21% in 2023</a>, up from 10% in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>Switzerland’s clear regulatory environment, focus on innovation, and economic factors also helped it bag the second spot on the Henley &amp; Partners Crypto Adoption Index with a score of&nbsp;46.9%.</p><p>When it comes to regulation, the European banking hub requires the country’s crypto sector to comply with its strict standards, which include <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a>, to ensure transparency, financial stability, and customer security.</p> Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in Switzerland <p>In 2019, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA in short, <a href="https://www.finma.ch/en/~/media/finma/dokumente/dokumentencenter/myfinma/4dokumentation/finma-aufsichtsmitteilungen/20190826-finma-aufsichtsmitteilung-02-2019.pdf?la=en">published guidance</a> covering the FATF Travel Rule. With the latest update to the FINMA-AMLO legislation (Article 10), FINMA approved the text requiring the transmission of information on the originator and beneficiary customer along with payment orders. With this, the Crypto Travel Rule came into effect in Switzerland in&nbsp;2020.</p> Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>According to FINMA guidance, the AML Act has always applied to all blockchain service providers (VASPs), including exchanges, trading platforms, and wallets. The regulator believes the blockchain’s inherent anonymity presents increased risks, requiring existing rules on combating money laundering and terrorist financing to apply to blockchain and crypto service providers.</p><p>FINMA mandates that organizations register with the regulator,<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it"> implement Know Your Customer (KYC) processes</a>, conduct extensive customer due diligence (CDD), and follow strict reporting guidelines. Providers must verify their customers’ identities, establish the identity of the beneficial owner, and take a risk-based approach to monitoring business relationships. If there is reasonable suspicion of illegal behavior, such as money laundering, providers must report to the Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland (MROS).</p><p>The basic idea here is to “make it more difficult for sanctioned persons or states to act anonymously in the payment transaction system.”</p> Compliance Requirements <p>In Switzerland, the FATF Travel Rule applies to transactions over $1,000 (1,000 CHF), down from $5,000 (5,000 CHF) after an amendment to FINMA’s AML Ordinance in Feb.&nbsp;2020.</p><p>For the originator, the following information must be collected and verified:</p>  Name  Account number or unique transaction reference number  The physical address, date and place of birth, client identification number, or national ID&nbsp;number  <p>For the beneficiary, the following information must be collected:</p>  Name  Account number or unique transaction reference number  <p>The originating VASP must ensure the originator information is complete and accurate and that the beneficiary information is complete. All information should be provided to the counterparty or authorities upon&nbsp;request.</p><p>For domestic transactions, the originating VASP can provide only the originator’s name and transaction reference number as long as it can submit additional information to the beneficiary VASP and authorities within three working&nbsp;days.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>A VASP, as per the Anti Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO), is considered to be operating professionally if any of the following applies:</p><p>- Performing transactions worth more than CHF 2 million per&nbsp;year;</p><p>- Achieving a gross revenue of over CHF 50,000 in a calendar&nbsp;year;</p><p>- Unlimited control of third-party funds surpassing CHF 5 million&nbsp;or</p><p>- Have business relationships with over 20 contractual parties in a calendar&nbsp;year.</p><p>Now, under FINMA’s AML Act, financial intermediaries are required to obtain a license from the regulator. Different types of crypto licenses available include Exchange licenses, Fintech licenses, Investment fund licenses, and Banking licenses.</p><p>Some trading activities require ongoing monitoring by FINMA, which also applies to those who keep crypto from customers in “wallets” and manage accounts.</p><p>FINMA’s Crypto Travel Rule guidance further applies to non-custodial wallets, self-hosted wallets, or, as FINMA states, external wallets. As per this, VASPs are required to prove the ownership of these wallets when transacting with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Only after the identity of the wallet owner is verified, the beneficial owner’s identity is established, and address ownership is proved via ‘suitable technical means’ that the VASP is to transact with these external or self-hosted wallets.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Virtualassets/VACG-Snapshot-Jurisdictions.html">FATF’s latest report revealed</a> that Switzerland is “Largely Complaint” when it comes to the adoption of the Crypto Travel Rule, like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-germany">Germany</a>, France, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-canada">Canada</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-regulations-in-the-united-kingdom-a-comprehensive-analysis">the UK</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">the&nbsp;US</a>.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Switzerland, one of the top 10 economies by GDP per capita ranking, has been seeing a lot of digital innovation thanks to its clear and proactive regulations. With Zug dubbed the Crypto Valley, the country aims to spearhead fintech and blockchain development through its robust regulatory framework, including the Crypto Travel Rule that ensures security.</p> FAQs on Crypto Travel Rule Compliance in Switzerland <p>Q1: What is the minimum transaction threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in Switzerland?</p><p>The FATF Travel Rule in Switzerland applies to transactions over 1,000&nbsp;CHF.</p><p>Q2: What information must VASPs collect and transmit under the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule?</p><p>VASPs must collect and transmit the originator’s name, account/transaction number, address or ID details, and the beneficiary’s name and account/transaction number.</p><p>Q3: What are the compliance requirements for VASPs in Switzerland regarding the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule?</p><p>VASPs must register with FINMA, implement KYC processes, conduct customer due diligence, verify customer identities, establish the beneficial owner’s identity, and report suspicious activities to the Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland (MROS).

				  Passwordless login isn’t new, but, with the constant increase in data breaches from identity fraud, it is now a necessity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The problems with passwords</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/resources/top-password-strengths-and-vulnerabilities">Thirty-percent of users have experienced a security breach due to weak passwords</a> and <a href="https://cms9files.revize.com/martincountymn/Internal/Cyber%20Security/Ransomware_and_Passwords.pdf">81% of hacking-related breaches</a> take advantage of stolen or weak passwords. We know that the username and password method of authentication has been flawed for years and cannot be fixed; and yet, it is still the most common way to access accounts online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that there has not been an efficient way to create and secure a user’s account at the point of creation. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) practices are done to set up a bank account, but they can vary by organization and by area. Once this information has been collected, and an account has been set up, the easiest way that organizations control access is through a username and password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many organizations have chosen to continue using password security with multi-factor authentication (MFA). — While this offers improved security, MFA is now under stress from <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/cyberattackers-double-down-bypassing-mfa">attackers who have found ways to bypass it</a>. MFA also requires additional effort from end users who have become accustomed to less friction in digital interaction, and as a result it is struggling with adoption and user fatigue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But MFA simply underscores the problem of passwords in general: People hate them. First, we all have too many — one 2023 study found that the average person has <a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person">100 passwords</a>. — Second, if they are easy to remember, they are easy to fake; and if they are hard to fake, they are hard to remember. Given all this, <a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/resources/top-password-strengths-and-vulnerabilities">45.7% of people admit to re-using passwords</a> across multiple websites or accounts, making them even more insecure and dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s time to overhaul the system. With verifiable credential technology financial institutions do their initial KYC and issue their customers a verifiable account credential. Authentication and access is managed by cryptography, meaning that when the account holder presents their credential for login to their account, the bank instantly verifies that they are an account holder (the account holder also instantly verifies that they are interacting with their bank). No logins or passwords or MFA is needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outcome of safer login methods</p>
<p>By removing passwords, your team becomes much more resilient toward phishing attacks, which is where a bad actor will try to get an unsuspecting person to share their login credentials by posing as a trusted party. Because of their decentralized nature, verifiable credentials cannot be lost, stolen, or copied, so you can be confident that the person presenting the credential is the person who should have it.</p>
<p>You will also see an increase in efficiency once passwords are removed. Employees spend <a href="https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/article/business-reporter/how-much-time-and-money-does-your-organization-spend-on-managing-passwords">11 hours per year</a> on average remembering or resetting passwords, which doesn’t sound like too much, but for an organization of 15,000 could be costing as much as <a href="https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/article/business-reporter/how-much-time-and-money-does-your-organization-spend-on-managing-passwords">$5.2 million</a> in lost productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better efficiency doesn’t just mean less money lost and more productive employees, the customer experience also improves. <a href="https://worldretailbankingreport.com/resources/baas-platform-model-is-the-way-forward/">44% of consumers</a> reported facing medium to high friction when engaging with their digital banking platform. This means that almost half of people trying to access online banking have some form of difficulty. Simple, quick authentication processes will make your organization stand out, keep your customers happy, and keep them coming back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passwordless login is the future of online interaction. To see an example of how this technology will soon allow you to interact with your financial institution you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMZlop-TvnQ&amp;t=61s&amp;ab_channel=Indicio">see a demonstration here.</a></p>

Introduction <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. We developed tools for “predictoors” running simulations of their predictoor bots to test parameters. The simulations can now display visualizations in the browser using <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">Dash</a> to show bot accuracy, profit, and more. An example screen shot of some (but not all) Dash visualizations is shown&nbsp;below:</p>These simulation plots include the profits for both Predictoor bots &amp; Trader bots and Predictoor bot accuracy. The screenshots later in the blogpost show all other plots generated by&nbsp;Dash. 2. Evolution of Simulator Visualization  2.1 Before: Matplotlib <p>Originally, we used <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> to generate visualizations of simulation analytics. Why plot simulations? Plots give way more insight into simulation performance than just console log output. Why matplotlib? Matplotlib is Python library &amp; has good documentation, so we could rapidly develop visualizations. Plus, our users are all data scientists operating in Python. But, there were problems.</p> 2.2 Limitations of Matplotlib <p>Despite its initial benefits, matplotlib posed several challenges:</p>  It occupied the entire screen and disrupted other&nbsp;tasks.  Once closed, these plots could not be accessed&nbsp;again.  The interactive features were basic, limiting detailed data exploration.  It was only usable&nbsp;locally.   2.3 Then: Better Data Management, and Streamlit <p>We improved our data management. Before, data for plots was stored in memory only. So we refactored the code to store the plots on disk, via Python pickling.</p><p>Then we tried out <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>, using the updated data management. It overcame the matplotlib limitations above, except that interactivity was still&nbsp;weak.</p> 2.4 Finally: Moving to Plotly/Dash <p>So we tried <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">Plotly/Dash</a>: plotly for the core plots, Dash for the webapp. It quickly became clear that it met our needs, including interactivity. It&nbsp;offers:</p>  Advanced interactive elements for detailed data analysis.  Web-based plots that are accessible anytime and can be shared&nbsp;easily.  Compatibility with Python, allowing us to maintain rapid development.   3. Running Simulation &amp;&nbsp;Plots <p>This section walks through how to run simulation and get live plots in a&nbsp;webapp.</p><p>First, begin by following the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">Predictoor bot README</a>’s instructions to install the pdr-backend code, and set simulation parameters in my_ppss.yaml.</p><p>Then, kick off a simulation using this CLI&nbsp;command:</p> pdr sim my_ppss.yaml <p>Then, open a new terminal and get simulator plots&nbsp;going:</p> # prep<br>cd ~/code/pdr-backend # or wherever your pdr-backend dir is<br>source venv/bin/activate  # start the plots server<br>pdr sim_plots <p>The plots server will give a url, such as <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8050/">http://127.0.0.1:8050</a>. Developers can open that url in their browser to see plots update in real&nbsp;time.</p><p>Below are screenshots of the nine simulation plots currently output by Dash. We will walk through the meanings of each plot for a Logistic Regression model&nbsp;example.</p> 4. Worked Example to Interpret Plots <p>This section is a walk-through on a simple AI model (logistic regression) to predict ETH price on&nbsp;Binance.</p> 4.0 Parameter Setup <p>Here is our parameter setup, via my_ppss.yaml.</p>  “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">Logistic regression</a>” is a linear model for classification (up vs&nbsp;down).  For our example, the model predicts ETH-USDT 5m candle up/down predictions by using 5000 5m candles of training data for ETH-USDT and ETH-USDT leading up to May 9,&nbsp;2024.  The model makes <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor-introducing-two-sided-prediction-bots-66bbbb53be1b?postPublishedType=repub">two-sided predictions</a>. That is, it predicts both UP and DOWN probabilities each epoch. The predictoor stakes 100 OCEAN per epoch (candle). So if the model says a 60% probability of UP, it stakes 60 OCEAN for the UP prediction and 40 for&nbsp;DOWN.  The total staked by all other Predictoors predicting the same pairs is 10,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  The simulation also includes trader parameters. Traders start with 100,000 USDT and 2 ETH and buy 100 USD per&nbsp;epoch.  Traders have a 0% trading fee in simulation and can have up to 3 open positions at a&nbsp;time.   4.1 Predictoor Profit Vs.&nbsp;Time <p>The predictoor profit plot is the first Dash plot displayed. It updates live with each iteration of the simulation. The x-axis shows time in 5min candle intervals, and the y-axis shows a positive and increasing trend of expected predictoor profit for the input simulation parameters. So far, so&nbsp;good.</p> 4.2 Trader Profit Vs.&nbsp;Time <p>While <a href="https://docs.predictoor.ai">Predictoors earn OCEAN</a> for each accurate prediction, traders earn OCEAN by buying / selling on predictions with an automated trading&nbsp;bot.</p><p>The plot below is trader profit vs. time. We can see that over this time interval, the trader has actually lost money. Yet we know from accuracy vs time plot (further below) that accuracy is &gt;50%. What’s going&nbsp;on?</p><p>The simple answer is: on average it loses more $ when it’s wrong, compared to making $ when it’s&nbsp;right.</p><p>What are ways to actually make $? Well, this is the essence of trading! Possibilities include: have higher accuracy; use the AI model’s probability information better to bound the up/down bet size; and more sophisticated strategies like magnitude of price changes, applying triple barrier method,&nbsp;etc.</p> 4.3 Accuracy vs. Time, With Confidence Intervals <p>Predictoor’s accuracy vs. time for ETH-USDT predictions is visualized below. It also shows confidence intervals (CIs). Average accuracy is 50.66%. The blue shadow indicates 95% confidence intervals, i.e. there’s a 95% chance that the true accuracy is within the bounds given by the shadow. The CI width narrows over time as the model makes more predictions.</p><p>While the Predictoor bot would make more money if its stake was higher relative to those of other Predictoors, the simulated gains are healthy when accuracy is&nbsp;&gt;50%.</p> 4.4 Predictoor Profit Distribution <p>Predictoor profit is displayed with two lines in the plot below: one as a function that the probability that a cryptocurrency price will go UP in the next 5min and the other probability that the price will go DOWN. These lines appear to be inverses of each other because the Predictoor parameters are making two-sided predictions. You can see that Predictoor profit distribution averages at 0.46 OCEAN per iteration, therefore since profit is positive, across 3250 iterations, (0.46*3250 OCEAN) = 1495 OCEAN profit, very similar to what the first plot shows except for the rounding for significant digits.</p> 4.5 Trader Profit Distribution <p>This plot shows that as the logistic regression model’s prediction probabilities become more certain (as they near 0 or 1 for the likelihood of prices going UP), then the trader bot’s gains &amp; losses become larger. Conversely, notice how around 50% the trader bot does not profit or lose much because the bets are net neutral. At the top of plot, the trader’s profit distribution average shows -$0.01 USD, which equates to -$33 USD over the approximately 3,300 iterations since the simulation started and matches the plot in section&nbsp;4.2.</p> 4.6 Variable Importances <p>The variable importances bar plot shows which tokens’ historical data the model’s prediction accuracy the most. ETH-USDT historical data affects accuracy the most; the most recent candle (t-1) has the biggest impact, and second-most-recent has second-biggest impact (t-2). This finding makes sense as looking back 1 candle’s price is most probably closer to the next candle’s price than that of 2 candles prior (see <a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/Martingales.html">Martingale Process</a>). BTC-USDT training data at the same # of look backs also has a decent amount of impact. Of course, the sum of the relative importances is&nbsp;100%.</p> 4.7 Model Response Surface (Contour&nbsp;Plot) <p>This contour plot shows how the model’s probability of up-vs-down changes as a function of the most important variables. Darker blue or darker red means higher probability of UP or down respectively.</p><p>Contour plot&nbsp;details:</p>  The x-axis of this plot is the most important variable (ETH-USDT at t-1). The y-axis is the second-most important variable (ETH-USDT at t-2). The z-axis (looking up) is the model’s response to these two variables, with the other two variables (BTC-USDT at t-1, t-2) fixed at their most recent&nbsp;value.  The white region is equal probability of UP vs down. Darker blue means higher probability UP. Darker red means higher probability DOWN.  <p>There are no curved lines because the underlying model is linear and there is no calibration. A nonlinear model or calibration make the responses nonlinear.</p><p>Scatter plot details. The plot brings additional information via scatter plot points, to show how well the model fits the training data. Blue points are for measured UP, and the model returned UP as well. Red points are for measured DOWN, and the model returned DOWN as well (correct). Yellow points are when the model got it&nbsp;wrong.</p> 4.8 Classifier metrics: f1/recall/precision <p>Earlier, we showed the plot for classifier accuracy vs. time. But accuracy doesn’t capture the full picture. Recall, precision, and f1-score help a&nbsp;lot:</p>  Recall: of all the actual “up”, how often did the model catch&nbsp;it?  Precision: of all the predicted “up”, how often was it&nbsp;right?  f1-score: geometric mean of ^ (perfect = 1 for&nbsp;each)  <p>The plot below shows all three. The Appendix below elaborates on recall, precision, and f1-score.</p> 4.9 Classifier Metrics: Log Loss vs.&nbsp;Time <p>Log loss captures another aspect of classifier performance. It accounts for how confident the model thought it was, rather than simply being correct vs wrong (like accuracy does). The ideal log loss is 0, which would indicate perfect predictions with 100% confidence in the correct outcome every&nbsp;time.</p><p>A log loss of 1.0084 suggests that, on average, the model is making predictions that are significantly incorrect or it is highly confident in incorrect predictions. The logarithmic nature of the penalty in the log loss formula means that being wrong with high confidence results in a much larger penalty. The appendix has&nbsp;details.</p> 4.10 Discussion: Opportunities for Improvement <p>Here are example opportunities to improve the model. (There are more beyond&nbsp;this.)</p>  Enhancing Data Quality: More or better quality data might improve the model’s accuracy.  Calibrating Classification: Removing noisy or irrelevant data can help increase both precision and&nbsp;recall.  Model Tuning: Adjusting model parameters or trying different algorithms might yield better&nbsp;results.   5. Conclusion <p>This post describes how we’ve improved the visualizations for Ocean Predictoor’s simulator by migrating from Matplotlib to Plotly/Dash.</p><p>It then proceeds to do walk-through of each of the plots, from predictoor/trader profit vs time to variable importance bar plots and model response contour&nbsp;plots.</p> Appendix 1: Precision, Recall, and&nbsp;f1-score <p>Precision is the model’s ability to determine that the positives caught are correct. In the plot shown, precision is moderate at 0.5076, reflecting a balance of about being correct half the time between avoiding false positives but missing true positives.</p><p>Function Recall is the model’s ability to identify true positives of predictions (e.g., all instances where the model should predict an upward movement in cryptocurrency prices correctly). A function recall of 0.3892 shows that a significant number of positives are missed since the recall is relatively low, out of&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>What is F1 score? The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, making it a balanced metric that considers both the precision and recall of a predictive model. It is particularly useful when the costs of false positives and false negatives are different, or when the class distribution is imbalanced.</p><p>The F1 score is defined&nbsp;as:</p><p>An F1 Score = 0.4406 suggests a moderate balance between precision and recall but also indicates there’s room for improvement, as the score is not very close to 1.0 (the best possible F1&nbsp;score).</p><p>Costs Associated with model performance of an F1 Score&nbsp;&lt;50%:</p><p>The F1 score calculates where both false positives and false negatives carry a cost. Inaccuracies (false positives and false negatives) can lead to poor prediction &amp; trading decisions. For example, false positives might lead to predicting/buying assets that do not increase in value, resulting in losses. False negatives might mean missing out on profitable buying opportunities.</p> Appendix 2: Log Loss&nbsp;Details <p>What is log loss? Also known as logistic loss, calculates the accuracy of classifiers. It is particularly relevant for models where predictions are probabilistic, such as logistic regression models. Log loss quantifies how far the model’s predicted probabilities are from the true class labels. Here’s the formula for log&nbsp;loss:</p><p>Where:</p>  N is the number of observations.  yi​ is the actual class label for observation 𝑖i, which can be 0 or&nbsp;1.  pi​ is the predicted probability of the observation 𝑖i being in class&nbsp;1.  log is the natural logarithm.

   by Alexei Balaganski  The million-dollar security question that has been discussed to death in recent years is: why, despite the constantly evolving market of sophisticated cybersecurity solutions and ever-increasing investments in security by businesses, the number of successful cyberattacks does not seem to be decreasing? In fact, the scale and cost of an average breach only grows each year.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The million-dollar security question that has been discussed to death in recent years is: why, despite the constantly evolving market of sophisticated cybersecurity solutions and ever-increasing investments in security by businesses, the number of successful cyberattacks does not seem to be decreasing? In fact, the scale and cost of an average breach only grows each year.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is actually quite trivial: people making executive decisions about investments in cybersecurity do not know or care much about it. Typically, this leads either to tragically understaffed and overworked security teams or, even worse, to the proliferation of the “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-cargo-cult-of-cybersecurity">cargo cult of cybersecurity</a>”, when a security solution gets purchased, but never properly deployed, operated, or monitored afterward. This is especially true for public clouds, where many customers are still struggling with the notion of “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/csp-vs-tenant-understanding-shared-responsibilities">shared responsibility model</a>”. Yes, cloud service providers usually have much more sophisticated tools and better qualified experts on their security teams, but they are not responsible for securing your applications or data – it is still entirely <a href="https://medium.com/@maciej.pocwierz/how-an-empty-s3-bucket-can-make-your-aws-bill-explode-934a383cb8b1">your problem as a customer</a>.</p>
<p>What can be done to break this vicious cycle? Well, the best approach would be to redesign your entire business processes to make them more resilient to cyberattacks. If you do not collect sensitive information about your customers, it won’t be leaked by a hacker. If you enforce the Zero Trust model across your networks, the chances of a ransomware attack would be substantially reduced. A somewhat less radical solution would be to outsource your cybersecurity to a third party, making it their concern. This works really well in certain scenarios, such as processing credit card transactions, for example. In a broader sense, however, employing a managed security service provider can be quite costly and still won’t guarantee anything (people still make mistakes, after all).</p>
<p>Would AI perhaps improve the situation? This remains to be seen – we already know that AI solutions are creating their own, entirely new kinds of cybersecurity risks. In any case, the worst enemy of security is complexity, and thus, reducing the overall complexity of your IT infrastructure and consequently simplifying and consolidating the security controls needed to protect it, should be a primary strategic goal of every digital business. Unification of technology stacks across environments, strict and consistent enforcement of declarative security policies, and intelligent automation of security operations are major factors in achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Choosing the right cloud provider that can help with it is an important first step on that journey. And it doesn’t have to be one of the “big three” – today, let’s take a look at another contender, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Being a latecomer to the cloud service market, Oracle had an opportunity to learn from its predecessors’ mistakes and design its architecture differently in several ways.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant differentiator of OCI is its unified approach towards service delivery regardless of the offered cloud model. Whether served from the public cloud, a private Cloud@Customer deployment, a dedicated commercial or government region, a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/eu-sovereign-cloud/">sovereign cloud</a> compliant with local regulatory frameworks, or even offered by Oracle’s partner using the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/alloy/">Alloy platform</a> – the services, data models, identity and security controls, and other aspects remain the same – as opposed to other providers that cannot deliver feature parity across their public and private offerings.</p>
<p>This alone allows for reducing the overall complexity of hybrid deployments dramatically, but combined with the ability to provide consistent security controls across those environments simplifies protection against cyberthreats even further. Moreover, Oracle places a strong focus on “secure defaults”, meaning that customers do not have to make each decision themselves, instead relying on best practices and controls that cannot be bypassed or deactivated accidentally.</p>
<p>Another important differentiator is maintaining an open ecosystem with not just partners and resellers, but also with 3rd party technology providers and even direct competitors. Again, as opposed to some other providers that keep their customers locked into their infrastructures with proprietary interfaces and large egress fees, Oracle strives to make their services <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/azure/oracle-database-at-azure/">available in other clouds</a> and designs services around industry standards and open protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Oracle Database services form a major part of the company’s cloud portfolio, it is unsurprising that the company invests a lot into data protection solutions – from multiple types of encryption and data masking to numerous data security controls. This includes <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev80540/oracle-data-safe">Oracle Data Safe</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/oracle-sql-firewall">SQL Firewall</a>, as well as more traditional tools like Audit Vault and Database Firewall. Oracle’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev70965/oracle-database-security-assessment">Autonomous Database</a> service turns the database into a fully managed service that delegates all administrative, operational, and security controls to AI-powered automation, completely removing human mistakes as a risk factor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/security-zones/">Security Zones</a> enable secure compartmentalization for customers’ resources and applications. All these controls are continuously updated and mapped across a multitude of compliance regulations for specific geographies and industries. Needless to say, these security controls are complemented by identity management, strong, passwordless authentication methods (including FIDO2 and passkeys), and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/deshpande/oracle-access-governance">access governance</a> tools with a high degree of automation as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/oracle-cloud-guard-from-cspm-to-cnapp">Oracle Cloud Guard</a> provides a centralized security management and monitoring hub that has evolved from security posture management towards a complete cloud-native workload protection, threat intelligence, and security analytics platform. More importantly, however, the entire OCI cloud infrastructure has been designed from scratch to incorporate security controls at every layer, from low-level network isolation to firewalls and encryption in transit. Currently, Oracle is working on implementing the industry-wide <a href="https://zpr.org/">Zero Trust Packet Routing</a> initiative across its infrastructure to provide a truly identity-aware, data-centric, self-enforcing network security architecture.</p>

			 Institutional RWA Tokenization Needs Permissioned Cash Coins 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Stablecoins are the killer use cases for the crypto space, with a market cap exceeding $160 billion according to DefiLlama. Research firm Sacra predicts that stablecoins may overtake payment giant Visa in total payment volume this quarter. However,&nbsp;financial institutions have been hesitant to embrace stablecoins&nbsp;due to regulatory concerns and the inherent volatility of the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>The skepticism surrounding stablecoins is not without basis. As highlighted in our 2022 newsletter, “<a href="https://tokeny.com/are-regulated-stablecoins-the-future-of-payments/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--J2jfyEMVeE20Ciq5G3QkxFuFVHv4THzP_n3xxsRUVr2_lzA_o52sbZV7oAInFBkyg1vHX">Stablecoins Were Not Made to Go to the Moon</a>,” the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) exposed significant vulnerabilities in certain stablecoin models. This incident underscored the&nbsp;need for stablecoins to be backed by credible and regulated entities.</p>
<p>Regulators worldwide are enhancing regulations for payment tokens, making licensed institutions like banks the most suitable cash coins issuers. Additionally, stringent&nbsp;controls are required to enforce KYC and AML rules. These controls will be needed during the full-lifecycle of the token&nbsp;and not only when they are minted and redeemed like current stablecoins. For instance, the recently introduced Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act in the US, AML legislation in Europe, and Hong Kong’s HKMA public consultation paper on regulating stablecoins all emphasize the necessity of conducting KYC and AML for stablecoin holders.</p>
<p>The future of stablecoins is likely to become permissioned, at least for regulated institutions. We expect more commercial banks to issue bank-grade digital payment coins by leveraging permissioned tokens to bring controls and restrictions that enforce compliance.&nbsp;As wallets don’t enable the proper identification of a user, banks will need advanced token smart contracts to enforce their duties, wherever the tokens are.</p>
<p>The open-source ERC-3643 permissioned token standard offers a common compliance framework suitable for both permissioned stablecoins and tokenized securities. By issuing cash and securities with the same compliance framework, we&nbsp;ensure both compliance and interoperability, eliminating silos.</p>
<p>Tokeny is at the forefront of this transformation, empowering&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;banks&nbsp;to issue and manage payment coins while upgrading operating systems for&nbsp;asset managers,&nbsp;investment banks,&nbsp;fund servicers, and&nbsp;distributors&nbsp;to bring securities seamlessly on-chain.</p>
<p>Step by step, we are solving the biggest issues in the institutional RWA tokenization industry:&nbsp;bringing cash and securities on the same ledger. This eliminates the lengthy payment process and data reconciliation using fiat rails, laying the foundation for delivering the true value of blockchain. Not only does this facilitate atomic settlement, but it also opens the door to new services like peer-to-peer secondary trading, collateralized lending, automated corporate actions, and more.</p>

<p>You can now send direct messages (DMs) to people on Bluesky! Say hi to a friend, colleague, or a crush.</p>

  

<p>These are private one-to-one messages directly within the Bluesky app. By default, your permissions allow anyone you follow to DM you. You can change these settings to allow no one or anyone to message you.</p>
 How do I send a DM? 
 
 Click the Chat icon. On mobile, you can find the icon at the bottom of your screen. On desktop, this is a chat bubble on the side bar (or go to <a href="https://bsky.app/messages">https://bsky.app/messages</a>). 
 On mobile, click the plus icon to start a new conversation. On desktop, click “New chat” in the top right to start a new conversation. Search for the user you want to message. 
 Write your message, and hit send! 
 If the app says a user cannot be messaged, they may have set their account to only allow messages from people they follow or from no one. 
 
 DM Privacy and Safety 
 Who can message me? 
<p>By default, only people you follow can send you DMs. To change this, check the settings in the DM interface. You can allow DMs from no one, only people you follow, or all Bluesky users.</p>

  
  Set who can message you, and whether you want notification sounds.

<p>Blocked users will not be able to DM you. Muted users are able to DM you. Additionally, you can easily block users right from within the DM feature.</p>
 Reporting DMs 
<p>You can report DMs directly to mods, who will review reported messages for Community Guidelines violations. Moderators are able to view the reported message and surrounding messages for context to assess the report. Infractions may result in temporary or permanent loss of DM privileges or even full account takedowns.</p>
 DM Privacy 
<p>In rare cases, the Bluesky moderation team may need to open your DMs to investigate broader patterns of abuse, such as spam or coordinated harassment. This would only be done when absolutely necessary to keep Bluesky safe. Access is extremely limited and tracked internally.</p>
<p>This first version of DMs has limited features (no images or encryption yet), but we'll be adding more safety enhancements in future updates.</p>
 Future Updates 
 
 Media in DMs: Currently, Bluesky DMs allow you to send text messages. In the future, you’ll be able to send images and other forms of media! 
 Group DMs: In the future, you’ll be able to create direct messages for groups. 
 Encrypted DMs: We intend to fully support end-to-end encrypted messaging down the line. Read more about our technical plans for E2EE messaging in our <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2024-protocol-roadmap#product-features">2024 protocol roadmap</a>. 
 Safety improvements: We’ll continue iterating on anti-harassment and safety tooling for direct messages.

<p>Join Michael Cichon, CMO, and Mike Engle, CSO of 1Kosmos, as they introduce 1Key, a groundbreaking biometric authentication solution. Learn how 1Key eliminates passwords and mobile devices, offering secure, seamless access for environments like call centers and factories. Discover its compatibility with various workstations and compliance with FIDO standards, revolutionizing user authentication and identity verification.</p>
  
<p></p>
<p>Well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, Chief Marketing Officer here at 1Kosmos. I’m joined today by Mike Engle, our Chief Strategy Officer. Mike, welcome to the vlog. I know it’s been a while. There’s a lot been happening. This is a very fast moving space. We have a new new thing to talk about. It’s called 1Key. What is 1Key?</p>
<p>Well, this is 1Key. It is a way to authenticate your users that opens up a whole new world of possibilities and usability and flexibility so let’s dive in on this thing.</p>
<p>Okay, well, we’ve talked a lot about passwordless authentication and now we have this 1Key thing so what does 1Key have to do with passwordless authentication and what is it used for?</p>
<p>Yeah, really simply way to put it, it’s a biometric authentication that you can use anywhere in the organization, so onto any workstation. So Mac, Windows, et cetera. And the idea is we’ve been dabbling with biometrics in the world. We have your face and thumb on phones now, it’s registered to your device. We’ve had smart cards, we’ve had mobile authenticators. Those things work great for some environments, but there’s many environments where you can’t use a phone, where hardware devices cannot be given to the individuals, and we can talk about those use cases. And so instead, imagine being able to walk up to a machine and have a touch ID face ID experience that doesn’t come with all of the registration challenges.</p>
<p>This is interesting. Okay, so let me get my head around this. We started whatever, two, three years ago, talking about using an app to authenticate on your mobile device. Mobile device scans a code, looks at you, recognizes you, and lets you in. Then we went to Atlas, then we went to browser, and now you’re introducing these new whatever use cases. So what are some of these environments that you’re talking about where you can’t use a mobile device?</p>
<p>Mobile device is great. We all trust and love our mobile, but there’s many environments where a mobile device does not work. For example, call centers. Would you want your call center agent when you call the bank to be able to have a mobile device to be able to… Typically they’re device free for obvious security reasons. And then there’s other environments where a mobile doesn’t work such as factory. You may have constraints, you may have legal reasons why you can’t use a mobile. And so there’s this, I don’t know, call it 20, 30% of end users out there that can’t, won’t shouldn’t use a mobile device. So for them, we’re proposing the 1Key as a way for you to be able to walk up to a machine, tap it with a thumb or finger, and you’re logged in.</p>
<p>Traditionally this has been possible where you could have your thumb registered somewhere. Biometrics aren’t new, but the usability has been challenging. So for example, if you get a new iPhone today, can you just pop your face or phone onto it without it doing anything and having it log you in, right? No, of course not. Imagine if you could. Imagine if you got the new iPhone and you just linked it back to your biometrics and you were all set up or you log in. That’s the experience that we’re creating today for those types of other environments.</p>
<p>Okay. So just to net it out briefly here, we’ve got a physical key. It’s got a biometric fingerprint reader on it. And how does this work? There’s other keys in the market. How does this work?</p>
<p>For the last couple of years we’ve been using keys that are linked to a person. For example, if I have a legacy key here and I am given this key and now it’s linked to me. The challenge with that is you now have one key per person. If I have 100,000 employees, I’m deploying 100,000 keys. And many of these keys could be given to somebody else so it doesn’t link back to a biometric. Even if it did, the biometric is typically linked to that legacy key so it still is a one-to-one mapping. Now what happens when you lose that? What’s your fallback? Well, you go through a lengthy process of getting a new key assigned to you, having it shipped to you. And in those days or weeks you’re falling back to bad practices. So this is something you can enroll anywhere and then use anywhere. And instead of one key per user, it’s one key per protected desktop.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. And the biometric, how is that tied to an identity or how is it identity-backed?</p>
<p>Yeah, so obviously my fingerprints are unique to me. My face is unique to me, my eyes and iris so it leverages best in class biometric verification. So at the time of enrollment, I just need to verify my identity, that could be done in person remotely and then I register one, two, three fingerprints. And then those are kept inside my organization. And the fingerprints themselves don’t actually go anywhere. They’re templatized, basically turned into math and that is sent somewhere, kept in the company servers for authentication later. So walk up to a machine, verify who I am, enroll and I’m done. Now I go to any one of 20,000 workstations or kiosks or whatever it would be, do that same process, tap and I’m logged in.</p>
<p>Okay. So the registration process, you said you verify your identity, that can be any number of things, right? You can self-attest your identity. You can prove it with a driver’s license, passport. However much rigor you want behind that identity proofing, you can apply it and then you tie that to the fingerprint, the biometric?</p>
<p>That’s right. Yeah. So for your existing employees, we kind of trust our existing authentication today. Let’s say I have username/password, MFA, I have all this legacy stuff, it’s okay. We know the bad guys are working on hacking that, but companies trust that many times a day across their thousands of employees. So what we do is we’ll take that and convert them to this modern enroll once, use anywhere experience, and then you can throw away the password.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So there’s a way to migrate existing users and when you need to, you could of course put them through an identity verification process. So that’s typically for new hires or just if you want to test the authenticity of a person for whatever the reason would be.</p>
<p>Got it. Got it, got it. So I understand this is a FIDO compliant key. Is that correct?</p>
<p>The authentication is FIDO. The big news in FIDO in the last year or two has been pass keys. They’ve rebranded the whole FIDO experience as pass keys and now there’s roaming pass keys versus device bound, right? And so think about this as a roaming pass key that works anywhere in the organization only. So one of the challenges with roaming pass keys out in the consumer world is my pass key can roam anywhere that my Apple ID is used or my one password account. Of course, we wouldn’t want that for the enterprise. You wouldn’t want to share your pass key with another employee or a family member so this is a controlled roaming FIDO authenticator that works anywhere inside the organization.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. And can you just run through again the differences? How is this different than the existing keys? We know it’s got a biometric reader on it, but aside from that.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. Again, let’s call out one very well known and reliable product like a YubiKey or FEITIAN. There’s a couple of them out on the internet. Again, those are given to you and they’re linked to you. So you can’t… If you lose it, you’re in trouble and there’s a lot more cost to that model. Imagine if you had a call center, their transient workers, if you had to give every one of them a hardware device that’s linked to them. First of all you have a management nightmare. So enroll once, use, then as long as they have that key, they can use it. But it’s also based on username/password and then those legacy devices would do their thing so they’re typically MFA only. Ours is a single touch experience bound to the user that they can just basically tap their thumb or finger on any device and they’re logged in. Highly trusted, highly secure. So there’s quite a number of benefits to this model.</p>
<p>Okay, and it’s up to 10 fingerprints per user?</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s really unlimited, but you’ll probably run out after 10.</p>
<p>If you cut your finger or you’ve got a band-aid on it, or maybe you broke your… I don’t know, then you can use your other digits. That’s the point.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And it’s interoperable. You take this from machine to machine?</p>
<p>You could, yeah. So these are almost, call them almost disposable. They are linked to the organization. So you couldn’t just go grab one off the internet, plug it into your company device and use it. It’s linked to the organization and this acts as an encryption, as a privacy device that can then work with the user’s biometrics in a safe way and allow login into Mac or Windows.</p>
<p>Okay, great. All right, so Passwordless biometric authentication. We no longer need a mobile device. Any restricted. So your manufacturing workers, your call center workers, anywhere where phones aren’t allowed. Maybe California, sometimes you can’t require people to use a mobile phone, right? I guess any of those environments, the 1Key is for them.</p>
<p>Exactly. You nailed it.</p>
<p>This is very cool. Appreciate your time, Mike. This is a very exciting… one of many very exciting developments that we have here at 1Kosmos so thanks for taking time today.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me. See you soon.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>The digital era demands that organizations harness the power of advanced cloud platforms while adhering to regulatory frameworks, particularly in Europe. Commercial enterprises and governmental bodies alike have shown hesitance towards cloud adoption, primarily due to the legal uncertainties highlighted by the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/there-is-no-such-thing-as-privacy">Schrems and Schrems II rulings</a>. These rulings have intensified concerns over data sovereignty and security, leading to increased scrutiny over where and how data is stored. To mitigate these issues, sovereign cloud services have emerged as a crucial solution, ensuring compliance without compromising on technological advancements.</p>
 What is a Sovereign Cloud? 
<p>So, what is a sovereign cloud, and how sovereign can sovereign be? Essentially, it’s a cloud environment designed to adhere to the strict data residency, privacy, and regulatory requirements of a specific country. Data is stored and managed within the country’s borders, ensuring it’s governed by local laws. This approach provides high levels of security and compliance, making it ideal for governmental and highly regulated industries. By leveraging sovereign clouds, organizations can enjoy advanced cloud services without the legal and security concerns tied to foreign data management.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Key principles of a sovereign cloud</p>
 The Contenders in the Sovereign Cloud Market 
<p>When it comes to meeting the high standards of sovereign cloud, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce, Alibaba, SAP, VMware, Atos, T-Systems, and Capgemini all claim promising solutions for the European markets. Microsoft’s Cloud for Sovereignty stands out, alongside Google’s partnership with T-Systems and Oracle’s EU Sovereign Cloud. However, potential customers must verify just how sovereign these solutions truly are. It’s crucial to ensure they meet the needs of highly regulated commercial entities and governmental organizations. Remember, all that glitters may not be sovereign enough.</p>
 Enter: AWS 
<p>A few years ago, AWS wasn’t keen on the sovereign cloud concept, with their Chief Security Officer, Stephen Schmidt, referring to it as “a marketing term more than anything else.” (<a href="https://www.techzine.eu/blogs/privacy-compliance/87994/aws-never-talks-about-sovereign-cloud-but-definitely-has-it-says-amazon-cso/">Source</a>) AWS believed their existing infrastructure already met most regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/security/aws-plans-to-invest-e7-8b-into-the-aws-european-sovereign-cloud-set-to-launch-by-the-end-of-2025/">this changed dramatically</a>: AWS is making a bold move with its European Sovereign Cloud, committing €7.8 billion to launch by the end of 2025 in Brandenburg, Germany. This cloud environment will be entirely separate from other AWS regions, ensuring all data and operations remain within the EU. By leveraging the powerful AWS Nitro System, it promises unmatched security and compliance for European customers. This significant investment also includes job creation and skills development, aiming to support highly regulated industries and government organizations in meeting stringent data sovereignty requirements.</p>
<p>AWS might be a latecomer to the sovereign cloud market, but their €7.8 billion investment in the AWS European Sovereign Cloud signals a significant shift in their strategy. Clearly, something has changed in their perception, pushing them to heavily invest to meet the stringent demands of European regulatory and data sovereignty needs.&nbsp;</p>
 Impact on Gaia-X 
<p>What does this move by AWS mean for the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-stoecker-enterprise-identity-eu-gaia-x">Gaia-X initiative</a>? Gaia-X itself is all about creating a federated and secure data infrastructure with a focus on data sovereignty, transparency, and interoperability with a European touch. AWS is a day-1 member of the Gaia-X group actively supporting this initiative and involved in multiple Gaia-X working groups.&nbsp; AWS’s late but powerful entry into the sovereign cloud market could either support Gaia-X’s efforts by adding robust infrastructure or challenge Gaia-X’s collaborative nature with its sheer scale and resources. Will AWS complement or overshadow Gaia-X’s goals, with both approaches navigating the evolving landscape of digital sovereignty in Europe?&nbsp;</p>
 Evaluating the Investment 
<p>So, what is the real value behind this massive expenditure? Does it truly address the stringent data sovereignty and compliance needs of German and EU customers? Additionally, will this substantial investment be sufficient from their perspective, given their high standards for data security and regulatory compliance? Moreover, how will government and public services perceive this development? Will they see AWS’s efforts as enough to meet their unique demands, or will there still be skepticism about the adequacy of these measures? These questions are pivotal as AWS attempts to secure its foothold in this highly regulated market.</p>
<p>Why now, and why with such a massive investment? Is AWS catching up with the market, or are they trying to overshadow the competition with sheer force? This Billion-Euro commitment suggests a strategic pivot: AWS might be late to the sovereign cloud game, but they’re going all-in, potentially to avoid losing market share to local providers and those already “there”. The real question is, will this investment finally deliver solutions to meet the high standards of German and EU customers by the end of 2025?</p>
<p>AWS’s extensive plans include not only building and operating the AWS European Sovereign Cloud but also creating numerous high-skilled jobs and collaborating with local communities on innovative programs. This initiative aims to accelerate productivity, empower digital transformation, and contribute significantly to Germany’s GDP. However, AWS needs to ensure they can deliver from their (actually rather late) “day one” meeting both the technical and regulatory demands of a highly competitive and scrutinized market.</p>

<p>This incident report summarizes a transaction conducted through the Aergo Swap service, which was detected as suspicious by the Fraud Detection System (FDS). The report includes actions taken and the causes identified.</p><p>Summary:<br>7.7 million Aergo tokens were withdrawn via the Aergo Swap service. All transactions were processed normally, with precise amounts transferred between the Aergo and ERC vaults. The swap service has been temporarily halted by our threat detection system due to an unusually high amount of transactions. We are conducting a comprehensive review of all systems and will resume service once everything is verified.</p><p>*Both vaults and the bridge have not been compromised by any hacks and remain&nbsp;secure.</p><p>1. Details of the Incident<br>Beginning with block 19905987 at 07:11:59 on May 19, 2024 (UTC), a notably large transaction marked the start of suspicious activity. The total Aergo tokens withdrawn in these suspicious transactions amounted to 7,706,818.22.</p><p>2. Issues and Root Cause&nbsp;Analysis</p>  The transactions were confirmed to have been made from the wallet “Am…Kp,” owned by an early Aergo investor(s).  This old multisig wallet has held tokens since the TGE and transferred funds based on a Lua Contract. Aergo scan decompiles the contract bytecode and collects related information based on Elasticsearch to provide to the FDS. A LuaJIT-related bug caused the decompile to fail, and as a result, it was not properly reflected in the Aergo scan, leading the FDS to suspect the transaction.  The failure to display transaction data correctly in Aergo scan was due to a LuaJIT-related bug that caused the decompile of the contract bytecode to fail. Consequently, the FDS did not reflect accurate transaction information.  Additionally, Aergo’s LuaJIT does not support logging for Internal Transactions, which could make funds transfers appear untraceable on the Aergo&nbsp;scan.  <p>3. Immediate actions <br>Following the detection of these unusual activities, we temporarily suspended the Aergo swap service. All functionalities have been put on hold, and emergency inspections are underway to assess and rectify the situation.</p><p>4. Action&nbsp;Items</p>  Due to the potential for manipulation of LuaJIT bytecode, which makes decompiling unreliable and poses security risks, a hotfix will be applied more quickly than planned as part of an already scheduled network&nbsp;upgrade.  The upcoming upgrade will include the addition of Internal Transaction Logging capabilities.  <p>5. Final Notes<br>We’ve temporarily halted operations on the swap service due to a false alarm caused by functionality limitations in Argoscan, which our Fraud Detection System (FDS) relies on for monitoring bridge vaults. We are currently focused on confirming the security of the funds held in the bridge&nbsp;Vault.</p><p>Upon the initial review, the issue with the bridge Vault and associated services was not due to a security vulnerability. Instead, it stemmed from a malfunction in the Fraud Detection System (FDS) triggered by an error in the explorer. This incident has been identified as a technical error, and we are confident there are no additional security concerns.</p><p>The enhancement of the Aergo Scan Explorer is actively underway. We are diligently working through the development and review processes, anticipating the completion of these improvements within two weeks following the resumption of bridge operations.</p><p>Aergo Scan does not currently show information on internal transactions, which are exchanges between contracts. Consequently, the source of funds for transactions involving multi-sig wallets may not appear on Aergo Scan. The funds originate from one of the early participants.</p><p>The swap service is expected to resume on June 5th at the latest. We are conducting extensive testing to ensure its smooth operation upon reopening.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-bridge-incident-report-317244a55b0c">Aergo Swap Incident Report (Updated-Final)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Germany has a minimum threshold of EUR 1000 for the FATF Travel Rule, requiring identification information for crypto transactions.  VASPs and crypto wallet providers must comply with stringent AML and CFT directives, including KYC and EDD requirements.  Germany monitors all virtual asset transfers, including self-custody wallets, to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  <p>Germany is a major hub of cryptocurrency activity in Europe, with over a million participants engaging in daily crypto trading. The country has a transparent regulatory environment and open policies on blockchain technology and crypto, aligning with EU and MiCA regulations.</p><p>As a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Germany also implements <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT)</a> directives, including <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p> Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Germany <p>In 2021, Germany published a bill on the transfer of crypto assets and enforced the FATF Travel Rule, requiring compliance from crypto companies by October 2021. However, once the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/understanding-the-eus-transfer-of-funds-regulation-tfr-a-primer-for-crypto-professionals">EU’s Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR)</a> is implemented, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/global-legal-monitor/2021-10-26/germany-new-ordinance-ensures-traceability-of-crypto-asset-transfers/">Germany will evaluate and potentially repeal its ordinance</a> to ensure a coordinated approach to crypto regulation within the&nbsp;EU.</p> Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>In the EU, Germany is one of the first jurisdictions to authorize the Crypto Travel Rule. To ensure the traceability of fund transfers and mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing using crypto, the country’s regulators introduced <a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Gesetzestexte/Gesetze_Gesetzesvorhaben/Abteilungen/Abteilung_VII/19_Legislaturperiode/2021-09-29-KryptoWTransferV/3-Verkuendete-Verordnung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4">the Money Transfer Regulation</a>. Germany considers all virtual asset transfers as cross-border transfers.</p><p>Under the Travel Rule, virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and crypto wallet providers must acquire, hold, and submit certain information on crypto asset transfers, making it available to appropriate authorities when requested. Licensed financial institutions, securities firms, and credit institutions that send or receive crypto on behalf of their customers must also adhere to these obligations.</p><p>Additionally, Germany follows stringent risk-based approach (RBA) policies, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) requirements. The country’s AML rules require crypto companies to follow risk management procedures, detect suspicious transactions, implement customer due diligence (CDD) processes, and engage in continuous monitoring and reporting of suspicious business transactions to the authorities.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>Germany adheres to FATF’s recommendations for the Travel Rule, applying a minimum threshold of EUR 1000 for collecting and sharing identifying information about the originator and beneficiary of a crypto transaction.</p><p>For transactions above this limit, VASPs must obtain, send, and retain the following PII:</p><p>For the originator:</p>  Name  Account number or unique transaction number  Date and place of birth or address, official personal document number, or customer identification number  <p>For the beneficiary:</p>  Name  Account number or unique transaction number  <p>However, even for crypto transfers below EUR 1000, the name and account number or unique transaction number of both the originator and beneficiary must be recorded. All this information must be provided to the official authorities or the beneficiary VASP within three business&nbsp;days.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>For a VASP to operate in Germany and offer its services to natural citizens and legal entities, it must apply for a license with BaFin, as per the amendments made to its Banking Act. Not complying with the German Banking Act makes it a felony&nbsp;offense.</p><p>When it comes to the custody of crypto, the financial regulator defines it as the custody, management, and security of crypto or the private keys used to keep, store, or transfer crypto for others. Much like a VASP, a crypto custodian also needs a license from BaFin to&nbsp;operate.</p><p>The regulator requires enhanced due diligence (EDD) for self-hosted or unhosted wallets. These wallet providers need to take risk-appropriate measures to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>As per <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Virtualassets/VACG-Snapshot-Jurisdictions.html">FATF’s latest report on the implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule</a>, Germany is “Largely Complaint.” This puts Germany in the same category as <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-canada">Canada</a>, France, Israel, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-regulations-in-the-united-kingdom-a-comprehensive-analysis">the UK</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">the US</a>, which have fully embraced the rule with proper checks and systems in&nbsp;place.</p><p>This European country strictly follows FATF recommendations in regard to the personal data that must be collected during transactions and the threshold.</p><p>However, unlike other countries, Germany has clarified rules and requires monitoring of crypto asset transfers even when users store and manage their virtual assets themselves in a self-custody wallet. In such cases, the individual is in control of their private keys and the security of their crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>German regulators see self-managed digital asset wallets “with increased risk” and believe it to be “a starting point for a suspicious transaction.”</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Overall, Germany’s implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule aims to enhance the traceability and security of cryptocurrency transactions, adhering to international standards.

<p>Every year, cyberattacks increase in severity and intensity as more and more of our collective human life is conducted online. Between 2021 and 2023, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/it-and-tech/cybersecurity-statistics/?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=Between%202021%20and%202023%2C%20data,most%20common%20vector%20for%20malware.">cyberattacks rose by 72%</a>, the fastest rise on record. The nature of these attacks is also changing: the average reader might still think of “hacking” in terms of digital theft and petty web vandalism, but we now see frequent, sophisticated, state-sponsored cyberattacks that impact physical, real-world targets – including critical infrastructure and sensitive operations - such as stealing personal data of millions of people and taking down hospital systems.</p><p>This trend poses profound risks to the basic safety and security of U.S. citizens, and 2024 has already given us a frightening example. In January, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) told members of Congress that a China-backed hacking group known as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fbi-china-espionage-hacking-db23dd96cfd825e4988852a34a99d4ea?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Volt Typhoon was working to infiltrate U.S. computer networks</a>. The group sought access to water treatment, electrical, and transportation systems, with the goal of “inciting societal panic” and compromising U.S. threat response capabilities.&nbsp;</p> Cybersecurity is National Security <p>These attacks show just how impactful cyberattacks can be and how imperfectly we secure even the most critical digital systems. As CISA head Jen Easterly told legislators, “Chinese cyber actors have taken advantage of very basic flaws in our technology … We’ve made it easy on them.”</p><p>One such flaw is the lack of verifiable digital identities that control access to everything from email servers to dams and steel mills. Current identity verification is too easily spoofed because it often relies on pre-Internet authentication concepts that are impractical and insecure in today’s threat environment. More advanced verification systems are offered by just a handful of large, centralized providers, creating single points of failure, such as those exploited in the <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/report/opm-data-breach-government-jeopardized-national-security-generation/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OPM data breach</a> of 2015. On this topic, DHS Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications Andy Ozment commented that "[if] an adversary has the credentials of a user on the network, then they can access data even if it's encrypted.” As a result, the top recommendation from the House Committee of Oversight and Reform was to move federal information security efforts toward zero trust.</p><p>To close such vulnerabilities, one tool holds particular promise: a digitally native ID system, built from the ground up to securely bridge the physical-digital gap that America’s enemies are eagerly exploit. When we increase users’ and software agents’ abilities to demonstrate who they are with high assurance to a variety of different systems, we also increase security with more granular controls over who can access what. This moves us away from singular accounts that can access large troves of sensitive data, and towards a zero trust, need-to-know basis per account, closing many outstanding security gaps in nationally important systems.</p> Critical Infrastructure and the Changing Threat Landscape <p>The OPM database is by no means the only digital “crown jewel” in the US government’s IT infrastructure. In 2013, the White House identified <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors?ref=blog.spruceid.com">16 categories of “critical infrastructure”</a> fundamental to national security. These include three broad categories of government and civilian systems: Communications and Data; Transportation and Energy; and Public Health and Emergency Response.&nbsp;</p><p>All three of those categories have been targeted by sophisticated cyberattacks, some of which can grant attackers long-term access to systems. This was the goal of the notorious Russian-backed <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SolarWinds attack</a>, and of the more recent Volt Typhoon incursions.</p><p>The compromise of these systems makes America vulnerable to a vast range of threats, from subtle to dramatic. The U.S. itself pioneered the subtler sort of attack with Stuxnet, a worm that altered control software and destroyed physical centrifuges Iran used to enrich uranium. America’s enemies might use a similar playbook to alter automated systems in a defense manufacturing facility, leading it to produce inoperable weapons. More acute and targeted cyberattacks could also<a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/lurie-childrens-hospital-cyberattack/707094/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> cripple hospital operations</a> during a disaster, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/26/nyregion/rye-brook-dam-caught-in-computer-hacking-case.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">disrupt hydroelectric dams</a> and interrupt power to millions – or even unleash devastating flooding.</p> Critical Infrastructure and the Changing Threat Landscape <p>These growing vulnerabilities are the product of a mix of technological and social changes. An increasing number of digital systems are built to allow remote access, in some cases as a product of the shift towards working from home. Even more widespread is reliance on remote “cloud computing” for data or processing. When they’re compromised, those remote services can give intruders major access to critical data and operations.</p><p>At the same time, the current confusion of access and identity systems makes these systems easier for bad actors to penetrate. Many digital identity systems rely on analog infrastructure, particularly drivers’ licenses, as their ultimate source of truth. But those pre-digital systems don’t carry all of their security guarantees into the digital world.</p><p>More advanced digital identity systems overwhelmingly rely on a very small number of commercial providers, creating a huge concentration of risk. In a 2023 incident, for instance, China-based attackers compromised Microsoft email systems by forging identity authentication tokens <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/07/11/mitigation-china-based-threat-actor/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">using a stolen “signing key.</a>"&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has generally excelled in its role as an identity manager for critical systems. But its centralized control also makes hacks of truly immense scale more of a threat. As Adam Meyers of security firm Crowdstrike has said, “having one monolithic vendor that is responsible for all of your technology, products, services and security ... can end in disaster.”</p> From Bits to Atoms: Digital Identity in the Physical World <p>Many possible cyberattacks rely on identity credentials to gain initial access to systems: According to Verizon, 91% of phishing attacks seek to <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/identity-is-key-to-stopping-these-5-cyber-security-attacks/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">compromise identity credentials</a>. In turn, 81% of data breaches make use of stolen identity credentials.</p><p>In our day-to-day lives, we frequently rely on outdated authentication methods, such as simple username-password combinations that can be easily stolen. Many would likely be stunned by how many critical systems have fewer protections than their Amazon accounts.</p><p>But what if user identities could not be remotely compromised because proof of identity was linked to physical objects, rather than only clonable strings of characters or spoofable digital tokens? This is one of the many security features provided by Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDC), which can combine cryptography and modern hardware innovations to create vastly more secure digital credentials than the current baseline.</p><p>Fundamentally, a Verifiable Digital Credential is the digitally native version of your driver’s license/identification card, professional license, or certifications, which contains verifiable cryptographic signatures from the issuer of the credential, making it provably authentic and tamper-evident.</p><p>The “cryptographic signature” isn’t just a picture of a handwritten signature, nor the cursive letters that show up in DocuSign or similar services. Instead, it’s machine-checkable evidence that a statement was made by the right entity, such as when the DMV uses a cryptographic signature to indicate that the holder of a mobile driver’s license can operate a vehicle. Unlike pictures of handwritten signatures or scans of plastic ID cards, cryptographic signatures cannot be feasibly generated by AI and are designed to be future-proof, even against quantum computers.&nbsp;</p><p>Through these new security features, digital IDs can be built from the start to assure the safety of the physical-digital frontier where many compromises occur, while ensuring privacy and user control. Breaking the protections of the secure element of a cell phone or key fob requires a high level of sophistication, such as using an electron microscope directly on the physical chip, and which is a longshot for most attackers.</p><p>Requiring a specific device to access a digital service can be used to ensure a particular person’s physical presence – for instance, in front of the control panel of a hydroelectric dam – rather than a simple badge. This is known as an “authentication factor” in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63B/AAL/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">guidance from NIST</a>, and is a widely adopted requirement to layer into security programs across federal, state, and private sector systems. Digital IDs can provide many additional improvements to identity authentication and assurance in one package.</p> Security Across Digital Borders <p>The U.S. has over 430 federal agencies, many hundreds of state agencies, and more than 200,000 government contracting firms, each with their own IT systems, technology stacks, and personnel. Significant cybersecurity risks lie at the edges of these systems: Anything from a missing USB stick to an expired contractor access card can compromise our national security.&nbsp;</p><p>Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) can help with security at the edges by providing robust ways for users and software agents to demonstrate who they are and their privileges across any environment. This is a key enabler for zero trust architectures, which allow for the granular specification of a user’s access rights - rather than “trusting” them after logging in once. VDCs can enable zero-trust interoperability because they are based on data formats and sharing protocols currently being refined by global standards organizations, such as NIST, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p><p>These standards allow many different government agencies and bodies to provision verifiable digital credentials tailored to their needs, which incorporate baseline privacy and security features. They are also usable across different agencies without the need to create a new IT super-authority.</p> Technology that Incorporates Market-Based Innovation and Democratic Values <p>VDCs can be customized for specific use cases to provide better user experiences and security properties. It is possible for many vendors to implement VDC solutions in parallel that can talk to each other, reducing vendor lock-in and increasing IT agility. In contrast to relying upon one monolithic IT system, a dynamic ecosystem of vendors each specializing in their own use cases can allow agencies to leverage competitive market forces to provide the best solutions at the lowest cost to the taxpayer.</p><p>For example, while one firm may specialize in VDCs for physical building access, another might create an identity for software packages to help prevent the next SolarWinds catastrophe. Agencies responsible for our national security will be able to pick the best-in-breed solutions for their specific problems at competitive price points.</p><p>The use of open protocols to structure a competitive market for verifiable digital credentials can create an industry that boosts domestic cybersecurity strength. These solutions can also extend to private sector use cases, ensuring a strong commercial base, as was successful for the microchip industry.</p><p>Further, when security and privacy are incorporated at the shared protocol level, all implementations can start with the same baselines for ensuring against cyberattacks, unlawful surveillance, and the creation of risky data honeypots.</p><p>This architecture can work globally across public and private sectors to increase security, protecting against cyberattacks. It can ship with base technology that encourages individual freedoms while proving of little to no value to autocratic regimes. For instance, enshrining user privacy in the foundational technical standards could render the implementing systems unusable for mass surveillance of private activity, or the implementation of “social credit” systems.<br><br>By fostering an industry of best-in-class digital identity technologies, America can retain a leadership position in the global development of digital identity infrastructure to support the security across all of its critical infrastructure sectors and beyond.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Major sporting events offer huge opportunities and risks&nbsp;for gaming operators and players. Here, we share the top five things that operators need to be aware of during Euro 2024. 



<p>Whether you’re a football fan or not, the Euros (UEFA European Football Championship) is a monumental global occasion that, for the month it lasts, captivates the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in mid-June and running until mid-July, Euro 2024 will see 24 teams compete in a series of games in cities throughout Germany to be crowned the best football team in Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Major sporting events like the Euros and the World Cup are often a time for friends and family to congregate and perhaps bet on the outcomes of games, either with each other or via increasingly popular online gaming platforms.</p>



 Surge in [legal and illegal] gambling activity predicted. 



<p>As global sporting events have such broad appeal, they tend to attract both casual and regular bettors. Plus, due to the convenience and accessibility that online platforms now offer, betting during these periods is only getting more popular. Indeed, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-to-avoid-world-cup-betting-fraud/">betting during the 2022 World Cup increased by 13%</a> compared to the 2018 World Cup. Worryingly, the surge in gambling activity was seen on both regulated and unregulated sites. For example, in the UK alone, <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/black-market-world-cup">250,000 people visited unregulated, black-market sites during the World Cup</a> compared to just 80,0000 during the same timeframe of the previous year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First-time players may be lured to unregulated platforms by ‘too good to be true’ bonus offers. However, few are aware that these platforms do not offer consumer protection measures and come with a significantly higher risk of financial fraud or data breaches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, gambling on the black market poses problems for both the player and the business. Discover the reasons [and dangers] of why some players decide to forgo KYC and identity verification checks in favor of unregulated platforms in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/">blog, ‘In the grey: So, how exactly does online gambling work in Brazil?’</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">‘Exploring black market gambling in Germany.’</a></p>



 
   
     
                     Gambling regulations 101: Europe and the UK. 
                     Discover how gaming operators can keep pace with the ever-growing multi-jurisdictional landscape in Europe and beyond.

 Challenges of operating during Euro 2024. 



<p>Although they should be concerns for operators at any time of year, there is an increased likelihood of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gnoming-multi-accounting/">multi-accounting/gnoming</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and fake documentation during sign-ups throughout the Euro 2024 tournament. Here are the top five things that gambling operators need to be aware of during Euro 2024.&nbsp;</p>



  Increase in site traffic is often used by fraudsters as a smoke screen for nefarious activities. With these sudden surges of traffic, it can be considerably harder for operators to find anomalies, which could be indicative of fraud. In addition to the above, fraudsters may conduct identity theft, or attempt account takeovers by launching phishing attacks and cyberattacks on unsuspecting users. There is also increased likelihood of more cross border transactions attempts by bots.&nbsp;  



  Unsecured public Wi-Fi networks can pose a security risk for gaming and gambling operators, when players log in to place bets. Such networks are susceptible to interception by hackers, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts, exposure of sensitive personal information and potential financial losses for both users and operators. &nbsp;  



  Rising rates of gambling fraud, with chargeback fraud a particularly common issue. While identity verification solutions can help verify the identity of users and detect fraudulent activity, preventing chargeback fraud requires additional measures such as transaction monitoring and collaboration with payment processors to identify and block suspicious transactions in real time.&nbsp;  



  Lose market share. Increased competition from illegal or unlicensed operators – many of which may offer superior UX or sign-up bonuses or offer registration without KYC – pose challenges to regulated platforms. How to capture new customers and safeguard against potentially losing existing customers should be top of mind for all operators.&nbsp;  



  Heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement to ensure operators are doing everything possible to protect end users during these times of increased betting. Those who are found to have inadequate KYC and AML and age verification controls in place may be subjected to fines.  



<p>“The challenges operators face during major sporting tournaments are not necessarily any different to their regular daily compliance challenges, but the sheer volume of new players from all around the world, coupled with increased activity is likely to cause issues for unprepared operators,” said Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Euros 2024 will be a huge opportunity for gambling platforms, new and old, so it’s essential they get it right. They’ll need to onboard huge numbers of players and verify accounts thoroughly so that they’re onboarding the right players and effectively fighting fraud</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Regulations, risks and rewards of the European gambling market. 



<p>Although all global gambling platforms are likely to see an uptick in player onboarding, it will likely be European nations that share the same time zone as the tournament (CEST), that will see the most pronounced increase in usage. But, of course, with <a href="https://copaamerica.com/en/">Copa America</a> just around the corner and many Latin American countries preparing to launch their gambling regulations, similar opportunities and challenges await the LATAM market, which is well on its way to becoming the largest in the world.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2020/11/10/81248/europe-online-gambling-market-report-2020-2025-featuring-major-players-bet365-888-holdings-gvc-holdings-kindred-group-william-hill-and-betsson/">European online gambling market is expected to grow by 9.20% by 2025</a>, fuelled not only by the rising popularity of gambling and tournaments like the Euro 2024, but also by software and hardware innovations. According to a report published by the Statista Research Department, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/586185/gross-gambling-revenue-europe-by-country/">the five European countries with the highest Gross Gaming Revenue</a> are as follows:</p>



  United Kingdom: €15.99 billion&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Italy: €13.2 billion&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Germany: €12.1 billion&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  France: €10.2 billion&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Spain: €6 billion  



<p>A special mention must also be made about the Netherlands; a market that only became regulated in recent years but has enjoyed rapid growth ever since. Learn more about the Netherlands in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/dutch-online-gambling-2022/">‘What a difference a year makes: The state of play in the Dutch online gambling market.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although regarded as a single state in relation to its economy, each of the 27 members of the European Union is responsible for passing its own laws. Because of this, online gaming regulations can be quite complex. Each European country essentially shapes its own gambling regulations.

<p>Takeaways</p>
<p>Identity and cybersecurity are converging, particularly in the context of cloud adoption.</p>
<p>Organizations of different sizes face different challenges and opportunities in managing identity and security.</p>

<p>In October 2022, Entrust published the article, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/nsa-announces-new-post-quantum-resistant-algorithm-suite-2-0-and-transition-timetable/">NSA Announces New Post-Quantum Resistant Algorithm Suite 2.0 and Transition Timetable</a>. At that time the National Security Agency was one of the first to put a firm line in the sand, publishing an aggressive timeline for the recommended adoption of post-quantum-resistant algorithms. It was a bit of a wake-up call to the digital security industry. Fast forward 18 months and we have a new updated version of the paper: <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/1/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF">The Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 and Quantum Computing FAQ</a>. Algorithm specifications, recommendations, and guidance are slowly starting to crystallize. The eagerly anticipated NIST standardized PQC (post-quantum cryptography) algorithms are set to be approved in summer 2024. You can <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization">check for updates here</a>.</p>
<p>At first glance, the algorithm suite looks unchanged:</p>

<p>Table: Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0</p>
<p>The newly assigned NIST names are now included in the table (see highlighted rows above) as we prepare to let go of the names CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, chosen originally by the cryptographers who designed the algorithms. These are now replaced by the more formal ML-DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) and ML-KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism), a set of algorithms that can be used to establish a shared secret key between two parties communicating over a public channel. These algorithms now have FIPS Publications, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.ipd.pdf">FIPS PUB 203</a> and <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.204.ipd.pdf">204</a> respectively, assigned to them. The paper also includes an informative FAQ section and some guidance on which PQC algorithms can be used in which situation. Some key areas to note include:</p>
 NIST SP 800-208 
<p>Regarding stateful hash-based signature schemes, published in 2020, the NSA has only approved LMS and XMSS for use in National Security Systems (NSS). The multi-tree algorithms HSS and XMSSMT are not allowed, although no explanation has been given for this decision.</p>
 Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard (SLH-DSA) 
<p>Known to many as SPHINCS+, despite being hash-based, it cannot be used to sign software. It’s not part of the CNSA and is not approved for use.</p>
 FIPS Approval of LMS and XMSS Signing Algorithms 
<p>Hardware security modules (HSMs) are discussed in relation to certification/FIPS approval of LMS and XMSS signing algorithms. For validating signatures, they must have passed NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).</p>
 Hardware Security Modules and the Use of LMS and XMSS 
<p>Code signing applications using HSMs will need to be validated to NIST’s Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). LMS and XMSS algorithms are stateful, meaning they use one-time signatures and when deployed can only produce a finite number of signatures before a new public/private key needs to be generated. See the illustration below for a visual of the stateful key generation process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Illustration of the stateful generation of derived keys</p>
<p>The private key is a random seed that derives a new private key for each signature. To maintain their security properties, the private key must be used in conjunction with a counter. This is what limits derived private keys to only generate a single signature. The CNSA 2.0 paper further highlights the concern that these private keys, if backed up or migrated to multiple devices, could break the “one-signature-per-derived-private-key” rule. The NSA’s opening position was to forbid export of keys created using these algorithms regardless of whether they’re encrypted or not. While some vendors still believe in the doctrine of storing keys in the box, in the physical memory of the HSM, most vendors have followed Entrust’s long-standing approach: Store keys as encrypted fragments, tokens, or key blobs – whichever terminology you prefer – outside of the physical HSM. The HSM-vendor community, including Entrust, have raised strong objections with the NSA proposal since that would create a single point of failure and severely limit the lifespan of an HSM. Deployments of HSMs are typically configured in pairs where resilience, availability, and backing up keys is standard practice. The NSA has agreed to look at supporting exports without the detrimental impact on the integrity of the algorithm’s security. We’ll continue to keep you updated on the outcome on their review.</p>
 Firmware Signatures – Begin Transitioning Immediately 
<p>The updated CNSA 2.0 paper also explains the rationale for the prioritization of firmware signatures in their timeline, recognizing that in this use case, the validation algorithm is not easily updated.</p>
 
 “Software- and firmware-signing: begin transitioning immediately, support and prefer CNSA 2.0 by 2025 where available, exclusively use CNSA 2.0 by 2030.” 
 
<p>Further, the paper explains, “even in systems that are designed for extensibility and cryptographic agility, a quantum-resistant root of trust may be required in the firmware years before the rest of the system upgrades to quantum-resistance. NSA prioritizes this in our timelines to avoid unexpected costs and security issues later in our transition.”</p>
<p>The NSA is recognizing the role that HSMs as a root of trust play in signing firmware, which then acts as the foundation layer of an organization’s cryptographic stack. With 2025 only months away, Entrust is already working on firmware that is safe from a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC).</p>
 ML-DSA for Firmware or Software Signing 
<p>The paper recognizes that firmware roots of trust are long-term and, “are a critical component to upgrade…expected to be implemented for some long-lived signatures in 2025, before validated ML-DSA is widely available.” This is impactful for Entrust and our customer base.</p>
 Deployment of CNSA 2.0 Algorithms in Mission Systems 
<p>The paper encourages algorithm deployment as soon as available and recommends, “testing in vendor and government research environments now to understand the effects of deployment of the new algorithms on particular systems given the increased sizes used in these algorithms.”</p>
 Hybrid Solutions 
<p>The FAQ section covers the NSA’s position on hybrid cryptographic solutions, using a combination of both classic and post-quantum cryptography. The idea is that until PQC algorithms are standardized and proven in the field, hybrid covers both bases – if the classic algorithms are compromised by a CRQC, the PQC algorithm will protect the data. Equally, if the PQC algorithm was found to be weak, the classic algorithm will still provide some level of protection. According to <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/1/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF">the paper</a>, “the NSA has confidence in CNSA 2.0 algorithms and will not require NSS developers to use hybrid certified products for security purposes.” They further state in the paper that, “NSA recognizes that some standards may require using hybrid-like constructions to accommodate the larger sizes of CRQC algorithms and will work with industries on the best options for implementation.”</p>
<p>The NSA explained their reservations about hybrid deployments are due to concerns on complexity, compatibility, and the fact that hybrid deployments are an interim solution and will need to be migrated in the future to solely PQC algorithms.</p>
<p>However, the hybrid approach has support in the industry. Some highlight the ill-fated SIKE algorithm, which made it to the 4th round of the NIST competition only to falter and be broken on a laptop, as an example of what can happen to emerging post-quantum cryptography. Hybrid adds an extra layer of protection in case the PQC algorithm turns out to be vulnerable. I’ve published blog posts about my colleagues at Entrust actively involved in the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/06/post-quantum-cryptography-advancesunder-the-hood/">specification of composite signatures</a> in conjunction with the Internet Engineering Task Force.</p>
<p>In summary, in the space of 18 months the PQC position has moved forward. We can anticipate some of the NIST PQC short-listed algorithms to be standardized in summer 2024. What was theoretical and fuzzy a couple of years ago is starting to take shape. Timelines are firming up and the NIST and NSA are being prescriptive on which algorithms should be adopted in which particular use case, and by when.</p>
<p>For organizations who are following NSA recommendations and want to experiment now, Entrust offers a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/sites/default/files/documentation/datasheets/entrust-pqc-option-pack-ds.pdf">PQC Option Pack</a> for use in conjunction with our nShield HSMs. It supports the NIST’s PQC algorithms identified for standardization. Customers with an nShield FIPS Level 3 HSM and the nShield Post-Quantum Option Pack can generate quantum-resistant keys inside the HSM, protected by FIPS 140-2 Level 3 Security World standard mechanisms, and carry out key signing, digital signature, encryption, decryption, and key exchange.

 BNP Paribas clients to benefit from integrated Legal Entity Identifier issuance and management, in partnership with RapidLEI service from Ubisecure. 
<p>LONDON, UK – March 16th, 2024 –&nbsp;Today, Ubisecure, one of the world-leading Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) issuer through its RapidLEI service, announces a partnership with international banking group, BNP Paribas. The bank is now approved by the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) as a Validation Agent (VA), with Ubisecure as the GLEIF-accredited LEI Issuer.</p>
<p>The VA program enables banks and other financial institutions/trust service providers&nbsp;to leverage existing client onboarding and KYC/AML processes for LEI issuance. With VA status, BNP Paribas is empowered to request LEI issuance within its onboarding validation processes, meaning the bank’s clients benefit from obtaining the LEI without having to apply elsewhere. With the LEI now required or requested by more than 200 regulations, BNP Paribas ensures compliance and uninterrupted transactions without duplicative processes.</p>
<p>Thomas Louis, Global Markets Chief Data Officer at BNP Paribas, said, “Becoming a Validation Agent to issue LEIs as part of existing procedures means greater efficiency for both the bank and our clients, enabling further value within our services and streamlining our customer experience. Our clients need LEIs to do business, and we’re already performing validation checks that meet requirements for LEI issuance. It makes perfect sense to consolidate procedures.”</p>
<p>Ubisecure is a GLEIF-accredited LEI Issuer that is one of the leading LEI issuers of LEIs worldwide. Its RapidLEI service provides an&nbsp;API for LEI lifecycle management and same-session LEI registration, making it simple for VAs to issue LEIs as part of onboarding, and also to discover, consolidate and manage LEIs on behalf of clients.</p>
<p>Paul Tourret, Corporate Development Officer at Ubisecure said, “There are many benefits for banks who become LEI Validation Agents, particularly being able to leverage established onboarding workflows. New ways to incorporate LEIs into various use cases are evolving all the time to make more transparent, trustworthy business interactions, and RapidLEI is proud to be at the forefront of such initiatives.”</p>

  <p>The emergence of cloud technology and the hybrid work model, along with the rapidly increasing intensity and sophistication of cyber threats, are significantly reshaping the work landscape. As organizational boundaries become increasingly blurred, private applications and resources that were once secure for authenticated users are now vulnerable to intrusion from compromised systems and users. When users connect to a corporate network through a traditional virtual private network (VPN), they’re granted extensive access to the entire network, which potentially poses significant security risks. These challenges have introduced new demands that traditional network security approaches struggle to meet. Even <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-13-gartner-identifies-three-factors-influencing-growth-i">Gartner predicts</a> that by 2025, at least 70% of new remote access deployments will be served predominantly by ZTNA as opposed to VPN services, up from less than 10% at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a>, part of Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution, securely connects users to any private resource and application, reducing the operational complexity and risk of legacy VPNs. It enhances the security posture of your organization by eliminating excessive access and preventing lateral movement. As traditional VPN enterprise protections continue to wane, Private Access improves a user’s ability to connect securely to private applications easily from any device and any network—whether they are working at home, remotely, or in their corporate office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enable secure access to private apps that use Domain Controller for authentication&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Private Access (Preview), you can now implement granular app segmentation and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) on any on-premises resource authenticating to domain controller (DC) for on-premises users, across all devices and protocols without granting full network access. You can also protect your DCs from identity threats and prevent unauthorized access by simply enabling privileged access to the DCs by enforcing MFA and Privileged Identity Management (PIM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance your security posture and minimize the attack surface, it’s crucial to implement robust Conditional Access controls, such as MFA, across all private resources and applications including legacy or proprietary applications that may not support modern auth. By doing so, you can safeguard your DCs—the heart of your network infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A closer look at the mechanics of Private Access for on-prem user scenario 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how Private Access helps secure access to on-prem resources and applications and provides a seamless way for employees to access the on-premises resources when they’re locally accessing these resources, while ensuring the security of the company's critical services. Imagine a scenario where an employee is working on-premises at their company's headquarters. They need to access the company's DCs to retrieve some important information for their project or make some changes. However, when they try to access the DC directly, they find that access is blocked. This is because the company has enabled privileged access, which restricts direct access to the DC for security reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of accessing the DC directly, the employee's traffic is intercepted by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/concept-clients">Global Secure Access Client</a> and routed to the Microsoft Entra ID and Private Access Cloud for authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access the DC and its resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the employee attempts to access the private resources they need, they’re prompted to authenticate using MFA. This additional layer of security ensures that only legitimate users can gain entry to the DC. Private Access also extends MFA to all on-premises resources, even those that lack built-in MFA support. This means that even legacy applications can benefit from the added security of MFA. With Private Access, the company has also enabled granular app segmentation, which allows them to segment access to specific applications or resources within their on-premises environment. This means that the employee can only interact with the services they’re authorized to access, ensuring the security of critical services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these added security measures, the employee's user experience remains seamless. Only authentication traffic leaves the corporate network, while application traffic remains local within the corporate network. This minimizes latency and ensures that the employee can access the information they need quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Private Access enforces flexible MFA to on-prem resources for on-prem users, strengthening your security posture and minimizing your attack surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key benefits: Elevate network access security to on-premises resources with Private Access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations seeking to enhance the security of their on-premises resources and protect their critical assets, including DCs, against identity threats can benefit from the key capabilities provided by Private Access—in preview. With Private Access, organizations can enable granular segmented access and extend Conditional Access controls to all their private applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access allows for the implementation of MFA for private apps that use DC for authentication, adding an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access and reduce identity-related risks. By enabling granular segmented access policies for individual applications or groups, organizations can ensure that only authorized users interact with critical resources and services. Additionally, Private Access extends Conditional Access controls to all private resources, even those relying on legacy protocols, allowing organizations to consider factors such as application sensitivity, user risk, and network compliance when enforcing modern authentication methods across their entire environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access provides granular access controls on all private applications for any user- on-premises or remote while bridging the gap between legacy applications and modern security practices. The capabilities of Private Access provide new tools to confidently enable secure access to private apps that use DC for authentication and navigate the complex landscape of modern authentication and access controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Navigating the complexities of SOC 2 compliance is daunting. Said more simply: getting SOC 2 certified sucks. It will always suck some, but it won’t suck quite as much if you’re using YeshID.</p>
<p>Certification is important and becoming vital. Certification assures others that your systems are secure, their data will be protected, and your processes align with stringent regulatory standards. More and more companies will refuse to do business with you if you aren’t SOC 2-certified. You may be familiar with companies like <a href="https://www.vanta.com/">Vanta</a>, <a href="https://drata.com/">Drata</a> &amp; <a href="https://secureframe.com/">Secureframe</a> that help with certification. We’ve gotten SOC 2 certified with their help.</p>
<p>SOC 2 certification requires well-defined access management protocols and evidence that the protocols are being followed. The first part is “relatively” easy: anyone can design a protocol. The second part is hard, and it’s where YeshID helps big-time. YeshID simplifies and streamlines identity &amp; access management (instead of cobbling together checklists, spreadsheets, and ticketing systems). And YeshID keeps track of what you do. YeshID helps you get SOC 2 (and stay SOC 2) with more SOCcess.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works.&nbsp;</p>
 CC and SOC 2 
<p>Almost everyone knows that CC stands for the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation and that it’s an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for computer security certification. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Criteria">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/index.cfm">CC website</a>)</p>
<p>Almost everyone knows that SOC 2, or Service Organization Control Type 2, is a cybersecurity framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in 2010.</p>
<p>And almost everyone knows the relationship between SOC 2 and the Common Criteria. But for the one or two readers who don’t know, we’ve spelled out some of the connections and how YeshID helps.</p>
 Logical and Physical Access Controls 
<p>SOC 2 compliance ensures that only authorized personnel can access your systems and data. YeshID excels in managing access controls:</p>
 
 Production Deployment Access Control (CC 6.1): YeshID restricts access to production deployments by controlling who can modify application access. This ensures that only authorized personnel can deploy changes to production environments. 
 Access Reviews (CC 6.2, CC 6.3, CC 6.4): Conducting quarterly access reviews is a crucial part of maintaining SOC 2 compliance. YeshID facilitates these reviews by providing comprehensive information on user access rights, helping you ensure that access is appropriately restricted and any required changes are tracked to completion. 
 Restricted Database and Network Access (CC 6.1): YeshID helps restrict privileged access to production databases and networks to authorized users with a business need. By controlling application-level permissions, YeshID indirectly restricts access to critical systems. 
 Remote Access MFA (CC 6.6): YeshID integrates with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) solutions to enforce MFA for remote access, ensuring that only authorized employees can access production systems remotely. 
 
 Enhancing Processing Integrity and System Operations 
<p>Maintaining the integrity of your data processing and monitoring system operations are vital components of SOC 2 compliance. YeshID supports these areas through:</p>
 
 Change Management (CC 8.1, CC 5.3, CC 7.1): YeshID enforces change management procedures by requiring approvals and tracking changes in access rights. This ensures all changes are authorized, documented, tested, and reviewed before implementation. 
 Log Management (CC 2.1): YeshID generates logs for actions such as account provisioning, deprovisioning, and access modifications, which are essential for auditing and reviewing system changes. 
 
 Supporting Control Environment and Communication 
<p>A robust control environment and effective communication are essential for SOC 2 compliance. YeshID helps in these areas by:</p>
 
 Code of Conduct and Confidentiality Agreements (CC 1.1): YeshID can require employees to acknowledge the company’s code of conduct and sign confidentiality agreements during onboarding, ensuring a commitment to integrity and ethical values. 
 Security Awareness Training (CC 1.4, CC 2.2): YeshID ensures employees complete security awareness training during onboarding and annually thereafter, helping maintain a high level of security awareness across the organization. 
 Roles and Responsibilities (CC 1.3, CC 1.4, CC 1.5): YeshID specifies the roles and responsibilities of employees for various systems and applications, ensuring that everyone is aware of their internal control responsibilities. 
 System Changes Communication (CC 2.2): YeshID logs changes to access rights, effectively communicating system changes to authorized internal users. 
 
 Seamless Onboarding and Offboarding 
<p>Managing employee access throughout their lifecycle is a critical aspect of SOC 2 compliance. YeshID excels in:</p>
 
 Onboarding New Users (CC 6.2): YeshID simplifies the registration and authorization of new internal and external users, ensuring that only authorized users are granted system access. 
 Revoking Access Upon Termination (CC 6.3, CC 6.5): YeshID facilitates the offboarding process by revoking access for terminated employees, ensuring compliance with termination policies and reducing the risk of unauthorized access. 
 Unique Account Authentication (CC 6.1): YeshID integrates with authentication systems to enforce unique account authentication, ensuring each user has a unique username and password or authorized SSH keys. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>With YeshID, you can streamline your IAM processes, enhance security, and ensure compliance. Our robust features help you manage employee access, conduct thorough access reviews, enforce change management procedures, and maintain a secure control environment.</p>
<p>Get SOC 2 certified and stay SOC 2 certified with YeshID. Let us help you simplify the complexities of managing employee access and achieve SOCcess. Try for <a href="https://app.yeshid.com/login?redirect=%2F">free now</a>!</p>

<p>I’ve been speaking and writing a lot recently about the newly legislated Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS).</p>
 
 <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/talking-digital-id-with-nab">Talking Digital ID with NAB </a> 
 <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-ep9-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">Conserving the IDs</a> we are already familiar with instead coming up with new ones 
 The need to <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity">keep Digital ID small</a> (and simple). 
 
 Digital ID caught between the old and the new 
<p>In some ways, AGDIS embodies fresh thinking, such as the pivot away from abstract “digital identity” to the more concrete Digital ID.</p>
<p>On the other hand, AGDIS tries to leverage the federal government’s long-standing “Trusted Digital Identity Framework” (TDIF) which was conceived a decade ago for the purposes of single sign-on to tax and human services. TDIF predates modern digital wallets and verifiable credentials. It is a creature of an earlier era.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there are mixed messages around AGDIS.</p>
<p>Will it furnish Australians with “reusable” proof of identity? Will it come with new ID numbers and a central registry? Or will it simply better protect our many existing IDs in digital form? And what is an “ID” anyway?</p>
<p>Minister Katy Gallagher has assured us that there is no new national ID, and indeed, there is nothing I can see in the Digital ID Bill about new numbers or a central registry.</p>
 The last thing we need is a novel ID 
<p>And according to Lockstep’s research, there is no fundamental need for anything new of that type. You see, proof of identity works reasonably well today using familiar IDs like driver licences, passports, birth certificates and social security cards.</p>
<p>Or I should say, proof of identity works well in real life.</p>
<p>But identification breaks down in cyberspace when these IDs are presented as plaintext to online processes. Web forms and web servers can’t tell if a plaintext ID has been presented by its rightful holder or by a fraudster who’s bought the data on the black market.</p>
<p>Almost all identity fraud now occurs online; very little fraud is attempted in person using counterfeit ID documents. So that tells us that the logic of using government IDs for identification remains sound in the digital age — if only we made the presentation in the digital realm as reliable as it is in the physical world.</p>
 Pivot away from plaintext presentation — again! 
<p>The real problem to solve is not “identity” but identification, and specifically, making the government IDs we use day-to-day more reliable online.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials technology is the solution. We should ‘seal’ existing IDs into digital wallets and then present them digitally, from device-to-server, instead of manually typing ID details into forms.</p>
<p>And the really good news is there’s a precedent for this transition. We’ve done it before! The world shifted from plaintext to digital IDs for handling credit card numbers — when chip cards replaced magnetic stripes.</p>
<p>Now we have smart phone wallets alongside chip cards, with exactly the same cryptographic security that protects cardholder details against theft and cloning.</p>
<p>Consumer acceptance today of digital wallets is high and growing; over one third of all card payments in Australia are now done via a digital wallet (Reference: <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2023/the-evolving-retail-payments-landscape.html">Reserve Bank of Australia</a>). So verifiable credentials are commonplace.</p>
 It’s all about data quality 
<p>What excites me the most is that AGDIS shows a way forward for all data.</p>
<p>The government in its wisdom is making the ACCC the Digital ID regulator. The ACCC currently governs the Consumer Data Right (CDR), Australia regulatory regime for open banking and data sharing. Now, the CDR is not perfect, but it features a strong regulatory model, it sits in the right place with the ACCC, and it is extensible to the protection of Digital IDs.</p>
<p>The CDR is essentially a governance systems for data flows, tracing where certain data has come from, where it’s going, what is it being used for, and above all, carrying consent for the data to be used in defined contexts.</p>
<p>I see CDR and Digital ID boiling down to data and metadata, in the broadest sense of that word.</p>
<p>That is, what are the properties of a data record that really matter when deciding whether to use it for some application? Where did the record come from? What is its intended purpose? If it’s a personal data record, then what consent was granted for its usage?</p>
<p>The same sort of metadata is routinely baked into verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Remember that a verifiable credential is a data record holding one or more assertions about a person or entity (i.e. the credential subject) together with details of the credential issuer and metadata such as when, where, how and why the credential was issued.</p>
<p>So, with the ACCC governing data sharing and verifiable IDs, we could see a uniform new approach to managing data quality. Remember the pattern. In any critical digital transaction, there will be something precise you need to know about the counterparty. So ask yourself:</p>
 
 What do you need to know about the party you’re transacting with? 
 Where will your transaction system get that data when you need it? 
 And how will the system check know that it’s fit for purpose? 
 
<p>If we can govern that pattern consistently across the digital economy, then we will be able to solve a set of problems that are much bigger and much more important than identity. We can take care of the quality of all data.</p>
 Governing all data quality 
<p>The same data quality questions recur everywhere we look.</p>
<p>The wicked problems with deep fakes arise because we consumers can’t tell where the data is coming from. But a governance regime is within sight to provide quality signals (i.e. metadata) about any important data.</p>
<p>Consider an online image or article, or any piece of content online: what if you could be sure where the digital data has really come from, that it’s intact and genuine? We have the technology to authenticate authors and publishers and AI algorithms, anchored in verifiable credentials with certified hardware roots of trust.</p>
<p>If this looks complicated, then let me reiterate that we have already pivoted to digital presentation of payment card data. Banks routinely provision cardholder data in the form of verifiable credentials, a growing proportion of consumers are comfortable with digital wallets, and merchants can readily accept payments from digital devices, with radically reduced incidence of card fraud.</p>
<p>Australians could soon be presenting any Digital ID with the click of a button from a mobile digital wallet, with exactly the same privacy, security and ease of use as a card payment.</p>
<p>Looking to the future of data sharing, with AGDIS and CDR under the same regulatory umbrella, I see us heading towards a united governance regime for all important data. We can be sure where any data has come from, what it is supposed to be used for, and that it’s always been in the right hands.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 1st May to 15th May&nbsp;2024 <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. Here, we will analyze the latest developments in the US and Nigerian cryptocurrency regulations scene and what these changes mean for the&nbsp;users.</p> US Inches Closer to Clear Crypto&nbsp;Rules <p>The US is all set to take a significant step with the FIT21 Act, which is headed for a House vote soon. This act aims to clear up the murky waters of crypto regulation in the US by defining what counts as a commodity and what counts as a security.</p><p>Why is this a big&nbsp;deal?</p><p>Specifically, the bill gives the CFTC more control over digital commodities — a move welcomed by many in the industry who see the CFTC as more friendly to the crypto landscape compared to the&nbsp;SEC.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/999909Frank/status/1789423489843179662">Image Source</a>)<p>The SEC has taken a more aggressive stance, evident in its numerous lawsuits against major players like Coinbase and Ripple&nbsp;Labs.</p><p>This clearer division of oversight could help companies navigate the market more confidently, knowing which regulatory body they will primarily interact&nbsp;with.</p><p>The takeaway: If the proposed bill passes, we may see a boost in crypto investments in the US as the market becomes well-regulated, as Sen. Hill noted in the Friday press&nbsp;release:</p><p>“As the collapse of FTX demonstrated, we need strong consumer protections and a functional regulatory framework to ensure the rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem is safe for investors and consumers while securing America as a leader in blockchain innovation.”</p> Nigeria to Ban Peer-to-Peer Crypto&nbsp;Trading <p>Switching gears to Nigeria, the country’s government is proposing a ban on peer-to-peer crypto trading to stabilize its currency, the&nbsp;naira.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1787853505039904810">Image Source</a>)<p>The Nigerian government believes that its currency has been feeling the heat from unregulated crypto activities.</p><p>Why does this&nbsp;matter?</p><p>P2P platforms are a lifeline for many Nigerians to access cryptocurrencies, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. By banning these, the government hopes to control currency fluctuations but at the risk of pushing crypto trading into the&nbsp;shadows.</p><p>The takeaway: This move could backfire by making crypto transactions in Nigeria less transparent and harder to regulate in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>On the one hand, we have the US, where several ongoing developments aim to provide a clearer regulatory situation for the crypto industry, be it for better or worse. On the other hand, Nigeria is now tightening controls, which might restrict access for everyday users and push trading activities underground. The impact of these differing strategies on their respective markets will be an important development to&nbsp;watch.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-mexico">Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Mexico</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-indonesia">Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Indonesia</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-nigeria">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Nigeria</a></p><p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>In previous resilience blog posts, we’ve shared updates about the continuous improvements we’re making to resilience and reliability, including our most recent update on <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-resilience-update-workload-identity/ba-p/4094704">regionally isolated authentication endpoints</a> and an announcement last year of our industry-leading and first of its kind <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/advances-in-azure-ad-resilience/ba-p/2147048">backup authentication service</a>. These and other innovations behind the scenes enable us to deliver consistently very high rates of availability globally each month. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll outline what we’re doing to help customers see how available and resilient Microsoft Entra really is for them, to not only hold us accountable when issues arise, but also better understand what actions to take within their tenant to improve its health. At the global level, you see it in the form of retrospective <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/reference-sla-performance">SLA reporting</a>, which shows authentication availability exceeding our 4 9s promise (<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/99-99-uptime-for-azure-active-directory/ba-p/1999628">launched in spring 2021</a>) by a wide margin and reaching 5 9s in most months. But it becomes more compelling and actionable at the tenant level: what is the uptime experience of my users on my organization’s apps and devices? Is my tenant handling surges in sign-in demand?  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We often hear from customers about the effect on resilience insights when they move to the cloud. In the on-prem world, identity health monitoring occurred onsite and with tight control; operational awareness happened entirely within a company’s first-party IT department. Now, we need to achieve that same transparency or better in an outsourced, cloud-based identity service and with a federated set of dependencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IT departments and developers are working hard to ensure each of their users maintains seamless, uninterrupted access that doesn’t compromise security. Enabling access for the right users with minimal friction while stopping intrusions and risk is critical to keep the world running. When an organization outsources their identity service to Microsoft, they expect us to acknowledge degradations when they happen, then take accountability to learn and continuously improve from those events. We also recognize that human-driven communication can only take us so far.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To meet these challenges, we’re increasingly embracing granular monitoring and automation. We start from the assumption that the unexpected will find a way of happening in any complex system, no matter how resilient it is. Beyond resilience, we must detect incidents, respond to them effectively, and improve as we go—and help our customers do the same. You see examples of this approach both in our rollout of in-tenant health monitoring and in our investments behind the scenes aimed at fast incident detection and communication. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s start with out-of-the-box automated health monitoring in premium tenants. Tenant-level health monitoring empowers customers to independently understand the quality of their users’ experiences with authentication and access. It also sets the stage to prompt tenant administrators with actions they can take to investigate and reduce disruptions, all from Microsoft Entra admin center or using MS Graph API calls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve taken a step in this direction by introducing a group of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-microsoft-entra-health">precomputed health metric streams</a> that enable our premium customers to watch key authentication scenarios, an early milestone in our investments to enhance transparent visibility into tenant health and service resilience. These new health metrics isolate relevant signals from activity logs and provide pre-computed, low-latency aggregates every 15 minutes for specific high-value observability scenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With their granularity and scenario-specific focus, health metrics go a step beyond the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/increasing-transparency-into-azure-active-directory-s-resilience/ba-p/2147047">monthly tenant-level SLA reporting</a> we released in 2023. Precomputed health metrics also supplement the activity log data that we’ve been providing and continue to improve on. With sign-in logs, customers can build their own computed metrics to monitor, like isolating a specific sign-in method to watch for increases in success and failure. With our new precomputed streams, customers can snap to Microsoft-defined indicators of health, take advantage of features we’re developing at scale, and dive into activity logs for deeper investigations. We encourage customers to make use of both options to get a full picture. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the initial public preview offering, we’re releasing health metric streams related to maintaining highly available:  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Multifactor authentication (MFA) &nbsp; 
 
 
 Sign-ins for devices that are managed under Conditional Access policies &nbsp; 
 
 
 Sign-ins for devices that are compliant with Conditional Access policies &nbsp; 
 
 
 Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) sign-ins  &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re starting with authentication-related scenarios because they are mission critical to all our customers, but other scenarios in areas like entitlement management, directory configuration, and app health will be added in time along with intelligent alerting capabilities in response to anomalous patterns in the data. We’re publishing the health metrics in Microsoft Entra admin center, Azure Portal, and M365 admin center, as well as in Microsoft Graph for programmatic access and integration into other monitoring pipelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about how to access the health monitoring metrics, visit the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-microsoft-entra-health">Microsoft Learn documentation</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure shows the Scenario monitoring landing page &amp; the Sign in with MFA scenario details</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even as in-tenant observability improves, customers will still rely on traditional incident communications when Microsoft-side issues happen. Like all service providers, we push messages about incidents to affected customers and post service health announcements to a website and communications feed in Azure. However, when this approach relies solely on hand-crafted service monitors and human-driven communications, it has limitations. Customers are right to have concerns about the timeliness of communication and the monitoring coverage itself.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address this challenge, we’re building increasingly sophisticated default monitoring packages attached to automated communications. The early results are promising. We’ve been able to bring times to notify customers about incidents down significantly, with service degradations and downtime being communicated within about 10 minutes of auto-detection. We’re also catching service degradations increasingly early by investing in monitoring, the results of which we track by watching customer-reported incident volumes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp; best incidents are the ones that never happen. Our goal is to find and mitigate problems before they impact our customers. So, in addition to advances, we continue to prioritize building systematic resilience measures to prevent service degradations and outages or auto-mitigate them before they affect a customer environment. We will share more on this in a future blog.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To continuously improve our services in partnership with our customers, we’re combining improvements in our service-level safety net with tenant-level monitoring. We’re also expanding our monitored scenarios, boosting our out-of-the-box monitoring intelligence, and speeding up our communication. Plus, integration with Azure, M365, and Microsoft Graph ensures that Microsoft Entra observability can happen wherever it’s needed. Together, we’re making sure everyone can work securely and seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With our already strong foundation of availability and resilience, security-enhancing recommendations, and mature service monitoring and incident communications, we’re excited to see these new capabilities take Entra health transparency to the next level.   &nbsp;</p>

  <p>In the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023">Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2023 (MDDR)</a>, we shared that on average, there are 11 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#anomalous-token">token replay</a> detections per 100,000 active users in Microsoft Entra ID each month. In addition, there are approximately 18,000 multifactor authentication (MFA) fatigue attempts observed per month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest developments in Entra ID Protection help you reduce the risks of these attacks by making it easier to deploy risk policies, understand their impact, and protect your organization from emerging threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the highlights:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Deploying Entra ID Protection just became easier with Microsoft-managed policies in your environment and an impact analysis workbook.&nbsp; 
  You can now investigate and remediate compromised users faster with help from Copilot and expansion of self-remediation to hybrid users.&nbsp; 
  You can also fine-tune the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm by providing feedback and identify and block token theft and suspicious actions taken by an attacker within Entra ID with new detections.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep reading to learn more!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Deploy with ease and confidence 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft managed policies and impact analysis workbook</p>
<p>Identity and access management is a huge responsibility requiring diligence and expertise. Between policies across identity, infrastructure, network, devices, apps, and data—and weighing the impact to end users and security—there’s a lot on your plate. To help with this, we have two exciting updates so you can get started with protecting your users faster and easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we announced in November, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/managed-policies">Microsoft-managed Policies</a> will enable some of our most valuable Conditional Access polices by default in select tenants, including requiring end users to perform MFA when we detect high risk to their sign in. This policy blocks attackers and allows your users to self-remediate their risk. We’re enabling Microsoft-managed policies slowly and deliberately to make sure we can incorporate your feedback and maximize value for you. Learn more about our approach to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/managed-policies">managed policies in our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that changes to how your users authenticate into resources require thoughtful consideration, and it’s helpful to know how the changes will affect your unique environment. Our new Impact analysis of risk-based access workbook will help you see the precise impact of turning on risk-based Conditional Access Policies so you can enable a new policy with confidence. The workbook uses historical sign-in data to allow you to immediately see the impact the policy would have had, with no report-only policy required. You can try out the new workbook <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/workbook-risk-based-policy-impact">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New dashboard generally available 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/what-s-new-with-microsoft-entra-id-protection/ba-p/3773132">Entra ID Protection launched a new dashboard</a> that presents risk insights for your tenant at a glance. We’re excited to announce today that this experience is now generally available and is the default landing page of ID Protection. The dashboard will give you a better understanding of your tenant’s security posture through key metrics, graphics, and recommended actions to improve your organization’s security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general availability, the attack counts in the Attacks Graphic are also now clickable, and you can easily navigate to them in the Risk Detections report to further investigate. The Risk Detections report has this new “Attack type” column, showing the primary attack type based on MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques for the detections. This further empowers your admins and SOC teams to understand the risks and take actions accordingly. See the risk detection to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/id-protection-dashboard#risk-detection-type-to-mitre-attack-type-mapping">MIRTE ATT&amp;CK type mapping</a>&nbsp;in our documentation.</p>

 Investigate and remediate efficiently 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On-premises password reset remediates user risk of compromise (general availability)</p>
<p>Our new feature to allow on-premises password changes to reset user risk is now generally available for Entra P1 and P2 customers. This feature allows hybrid customers to include their users in risk-based Conditional Access polices that require user password remediation. If you were waiting for GA to enable this feature, now is the time to do so to make user risk policies easier to manage. Visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock#allow-on-premises-password-reset-to-remediate-user-risks-preview">Remediate risks and unblock users in Entra ID Protection</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User Risk Investigation Copilot in public preview</p>
<p>Learning more about a user’s risk level and recommendations on how to mitigate a user’s risk is easier than ever with the introduction of the User Risk Investigation skill in Microsoft Entra, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-adds-identity-skills-to-copilot-for-security/ba-p/4081857">which is available in public preview as a part of Copilot for Security</a>. This skill summarizes the risk history of the user, how to remediate risk for that user, and how to scale and automate response and remediation to identity threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin notices that a user has been flagged as high risk due to a series of abnormal sign-ins. With Copilot for Security, the admin can quickly investigate and resolve the risk by clicking on the user in question to receive an immediate summary of risk and instructions for remediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved Threat Prevention and Remediation Capabilities 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple new detections have been introduced to Entra ID Protection that protect against new and emerging attack vectors, like anomalous graph usage, token theft, and attacker in the middle (AitM) attacks. In addition, hybrid tenants can now be confident that user risk is resolved when a password is reset on-premises, and all tenants can benefit from our new functionality that takes your feedback into account when determining if an event is risky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suspicious API traffic detection (general availability)</p>
<p>When entering an environment, attackers often search for information about users and tenant configuration to prepare for further exploitation. ID Protection will now change a user’s risk level if we observe them making an abnormally high number of calls to MS Graph and AAD Graph compared to that user’s baseline, which will help identify both compromised users and insider threats scavenging for intel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detecting token theft in real-time and post-breach</p>
<p>With token-based attacks on the rise, you need detections that help you identify and protect against this emerging threat. Two new detections in ID Protection help you do this. Our industry-first Real-time Anomalous Token Detection automatically disrupts token replay attacks in real-time when paired with a risk-based Conditional Access for sign-ins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also built an offline detection that extends coverage of Microsoft 365 Defender’s Attacker in the Middle signals. This detection will flag the impacted user with high risk to prompt the configured Conditional Access user risk policy, allowing customers to confirm or dismiss the risk on the user. The session token is also revoked in cases where Continuous Access Evaluation is enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more about our new detections at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks">What are risk detections?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Admin feedback on detections trains our ML 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hold our detections in Entra ID to a very high standard, but occasionally we do issue a false positive detection. You can now help train our ML models by acting on risky sign-ins. You can confirm a sign-in as risky, safe, or dismiss risk. Each of these will send information back to our ML model and optimize future detections for your organization. You can learn more about giving Entra ID Protection risk feedback <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-risk-feedback#how-does-microsoft-entra-id-use-my-risk-feedback">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope your organization can benefit from these new detections and features and that you will revisit the positive impact that risk-based Conditional Access can have on your organization's security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>Professor William McCarthy teaches accounting and information systems at Michigan State University and is the innovator of a new way of accounting called Resources-Events-Agents (REA).&nbsp;</p><p>In this exclusive interview, Professor McCarthy talks about how traditional accounting systems have a hard time keeping track of value flows and supporting practices that help the environment.&nbsp;</p><p>He says that the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-entry.asp?ref=blog.holochain.org">double-entry bookkeeping method</a>, which started in Venice in the 1400s, makes it harder to understand the real economy and work towards sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>So as companies face challenges with modern supply chains and the need for more sustainable economies, Professor McCarthy's work on REA offers an interesting take on the future of accounting.</p><p>Let’s dive in.&nbsp;</p> Limitations of Traditional Accounting <p>For hundreds of years, accountants have used a method called double-entry bookkeeping. This method was first used by merchants in Venice, Italy, in the 1400s. They used math and wrote things down on paper to keep track of their business deals.</p><p>But Professor McCarthy says this old way of accounting doesn't work well anymore. It doesn't show the whole story of what's really happening in the economy. When something happens, like when two companies trade goods, traditional accounting quickly turns it into simple numbers and accounts, stripping away the context and rich data of the transaction. It doesn't keep all the important details.</p><p>This makes it hard for companies to understand their supply chains and how their actions impact the environment. The old accounting method is like telling a story but leaving out key parts. And Professor McCarthy thinks it’s time for change.&nbsp;</p> The REA Accounting Model <p>Professor McCarthy has a different idea. He calls it Resources-Events-Agents, or REA for short. REA is like a new language for accounting that focuses on telling the whole economic story. "We often characterize REA as economic storytelling," Professor McCarthy explains.</p><p>In REA, instead of just writing down numbers, accountants keep track of all the important stuff. They look at the resources being traded, the events happening, and the people or companies involved. It's like writing a detailed story that doesn't leave anything out. "I found a new way of [telling economic stories] using Entity Relationship modeling, and later other things, that was called R E A, because “R” means the two resources that they were going to swap; “A” means to two agents who are at arm's length with each other; and “E” very simply means the process of sending things across this way." Professor McCarthy explains.</p><p>With REA, it's easier to see how things are connected. For example, if a company sells something, REA would keep track of what was sold, who bought it, and how it affects things like inventory and contracts. This gives a clearer picture of the economy. Imagine a visual story… "You have a customer called Charlie who will make a sale of inventory. And we put an object into the system, and it's described as a sale or shipment," Professor McCarthy elaborates.</p><p>Professor McCarthy says REA is like building a big, detailed map of how a company works. This map can help companies make better decisions and understand their impact on the world around them.</p> Implications for Regeneration and Sustainability <p>REA accounting could be a game-changer for companies trying to be more sustainable and regenerative. By tracking the flow of resources, events, and agents across a supply chain, REA provides a more comprehensive picture of a company’s environmental and social impact. "The best example I've seen of the supply chain example is Lynn Foster's examples for an apple pie," Professor McCarthy says, referring to a <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/assets/ValueFlows-Story.pdf?ref=blog.holochain.org">case study</a> on the Valueflows <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/?ref=blog.holochain.org">website</a>.</p><p>Traditional accounting makes it hard to see how business actions affect the environment, discounting “externalities”. But REA keeps track of important details that show the full impact.</p><p>Additionally, professor McCarthy believes that REA accounting is becoming increasingly important as customers and regulators demand more information about how products are made. People want detailed information about the origin and processing of the products they buy, from the farming and dyeing of cotton to the processing of olive oil. They want assurances about the absence of certain chemicals in the soil and the testing done at various stages of production.</p><p>It’s this demand for transparency driven by a growing awareness of the social and environmental impacts of business that has customers shifting to companies which are optimizing for sustainability rather than profit.</p><p>In response to these concerns, we are seeing changes in regulations, particularly in the EU and North America, that require companies to provide more detailed information about their supply chains. REA accounting is well-suited to meet these requirements because it allows for the flow of contextualized data, not just numbers on ledgers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, changing accounting systems is not easy. "The biggest barrier to all of my work for years has been computational viability," Professor McCarthy admits. But with new technologies and a shift in mindset, REA could help companies tell a richer story of their impact on the world.</p> Innovating for the Future of Accounting <p>Despite the challenges, Professor McCarthy sees hope for the future of accounting innovation. He believes that new technologies, like Holochain, could help make REA accounting more viable.</p><p>In many ways, Holochain is an ideal technology for REA accounting because of how it leverages decentralized data storage — making it affordable and easy for smaller players in a supply chain to participate.</p><p>Professor McCarthy believes that small, innovative groups could lead the way in changing accounting. These nimble, environmentally and socially aware organizations might be able to make a real impact.</p><p>However, he also acknowledges the challenges ahead, particularly from large, established players in the accounting software industry. These companies may be resistant to change and could even try to acquire innovative startups to maintain their dominance.</p><p>As the accounting profession faces a choice between evolution and obsolescence, the work of visionaries like Professor McCarthy and the potential of new technologies like Holochain offer a glimpse of a more regenerative and sustainable future. The path forward may not be easy, but the stakes are too high to cling to the status quo.</p>

			 Adrian Corcoran is Head of Sales UK&nbsp;at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>I love sports and have been active all my life. For the last 15 years, I played rugby but hung-up my boots last year because recovering on Sundays was getting too hard! Now, I play squash most early mornings and do Muay Thai 3 or 4 times a week with my youngest son. Between my girlfriend and I, we have 4 boys, aged between 17 and 23 years old. They certainly keep us busy! </p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked as Head of Institutional Sales for a FinTech, and prior to that, I led Institutional Sales and Partnerships at a decentralized data cloud storage start-up. Before entering the Web3 space, I owned my own headhunting business for over 12 years, focusing on Wealth Management and Private Banking, with a notable crossover into Investment Banking.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Working at Tokeny is both challenging and rewarding. There’s never a dull moment, as our fast-paced environment ensures that there is always something to do. Our industry is very dynamic and innovative, so there are always plenty of opportunities to learn. Being part of Tokeny means being at the forefront of tokenization tech, which I get to explore with a diverse and talented team.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>There are too many to name, but if I had to choose just three, they would be:</p>
 
 Family. My sister and I come from a very close-knit family, and those values have carried over into our own families. 
 Work. I now know what I want to be when I grow up! 🙂 Many people spend years searching for their true passion; I consider myself fortunate to have found mine. 
 Sports. I get irritable when I don’t play sports because staying fit and healthy is important to me. Plus, it’s a great way to release stress and maintain balance. 
 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I’m already living the dream! I am very lucky and have a great life; there’s not much I would change.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>If you’re passionate about Web3 and Tokenization and you apply yourself, you’ll do really well.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Tokenization is the future, and Tokeny is at the forefront with its innovative platform. As we move towards standardization and wider adoption, the possibilities are endless.</p>

				  Know-your-Customer (KYC) processing just became easier and less expensive. With new decentralized identity technologies important client information is collected once, and can be reused repeatedly by using verifiable credentials to hold and share data.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>What is KYC?</p>
<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) refers to the data collection process that financial institutions do to authenticate customer or client identity, assess financial risk, and attempt to avoid fraud. establish</p>
<p>KYC can be broken down into three steps that most financial institutions will take when opening an account or qualifying a customer for a loan.</p>
 
 Customer Identification Program 
 
<p>Financial firms must obtain four pieces of identifying information about a client: name, date of birth, address, and identification number (usually taxpayer identification number).</p>
 
 Customer Due Diligence 
 
<p>This is the process where all of a customer’s documents are collected to verify their identity and evaluate their risk profile for suspicious account activity.</p>
 
 Enhanced Due Diligence (optional) 
 
<p>Sometimes additional information is collected for customers that are suspected to be at a higher risk of infiltration, terrorism financing, or money laundering.</p>
<p>KYC is also regulated by several government agencies to reduce money laundering, and is often associated with Anti-Money Laundering policies (AML).</p>
<p>The drawbacks of traditional KYC</p>
<p>KYC’s main drawback is that it is time consuming to do, and becomes even more time consuming when you have to do it multiple times for multiple applications or organizations. For example a bank will need to do KYC to open an account for a customer, and then need to do it again to approve them for a loan. If the bank needs to refer this customer to a partner organization that organization will also need to do their own KYC to verify that customer. This is a lot of documentation for the applicant to collect and repeatedly submit, and takes considerable time, effort, and expense to repeatedly verify.</p>
<p>Each instance of KYC costs a financial institution <a href="https://seon.io/resources/cost-of-kyc/#:~:text=A%20single%20KYC%20verification%20can,bank%20%2460%20million%20per%20year.">between $13 and $130 per customer, with </a>corporate clients costing considerably more —&nbsp;one survey reported between <a href="https://resources.fenergo.com/blogs/the-cost-of-kyc-compliance-in-finance-how-digitalization-helps">$1,501 and $3,500 per review</a>. With banks having thousands of customers, and each customer potentially needing to do KYC multiple times, the average spending on KYC per bank hovers around <a href="https://seon.io/resources/cost-of-kyc/#:~:text=A%20single%20KYC%20verification%20can,bank%20%2460%20million%20per%20year.">60 million dollars annually.</a></p>
<p>The time it takes to do KYC for a customer or client can be anywhere from 31 to 180 days.</p>
<p>Re-usable KYC through Decentralized Identity&nbsp;</p>
<p>KYC is necessary (and regulated by the government) so it’s not going away, but we can make it much more efficient by reducing the amount of duplication.</p>
<p>The key value proposition presented by decentralized identity is that once you have verified the relevant financial data that same data can be verified repeatedly with the same level of assurance. How is this possible?</p>
<p>Once the KYC process has been conducted satisfactorily, a financial institution issues their customer or client with a verifiable credential containing all the details and relevant data from the initial KYC process. This information is digitally signed.</p>
<p>When the customer or client wants to share their KYC data with another party (or even the same financial institution), the authenticity of the credential is verified through cryptography (by checking a record on a distributed ledger) and the digital signatures provide proof that the data presented in the credential hasn’t been altered.</p>
<p>A verifiable credential is like a cryptographic wrapper that can seal any kind of information. Try to change the information and the seal is broken. The nature of decentralized identity is that the source of the wrapper can always be known and cryptographically verified, which means if you trust the source’s KYC process — such as that of a financial institution — you can trust the information presented by the credential holder.</p>
<p>A KYC credential can contain all kinds of information that could be necessary for a financial institution to have, but annoying or time consuming for a customer to acquire, for example: Proof of address, government ID number, proof of employment, proof of annual income, and more.</p>
<p>Once this process is more automated with decentralized identity, this information only needs to be collected one time or if the credential is set to expire. We can remove the need for partner organizations or other departments to re-do work that has already been done, saving customers time and stress, and organizations millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Collect once, verify often.</p>

  <p>Seventy-five percent of cybersecurity professionals say the current threat landscape is the most challenging it has been in the last five years, according to the <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Insights/2023/10/ISC2-Reveals-Workforce-Growth-But-Record-Breaking-Gap-4-Million-Cybersecurity-Professionals">2023 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study</a>. You’re probably on the hook to secure access for your organization – preventing identity attacks and securing least privilege access. And we know it’s intense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the ways we strive to assist you is by providing accurate, reliable, and timely information to monitor and optimize the strength of your identity and network access security posture. This transparency gives you visibility that’s necessary to assess performance, tenant health, and your plan for improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, we’ve released a series of innovations reinforcing our commitment to transparency. This blog recaps these improvements for you in three parts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Transparency in updates: Helping you know what’s new and coming soon for Microsoft Entra;&nbsp; 
  Transparency in adoption: Providing recommendations and license utilization insights; and&nbsp; 
  Transparency in operations: Tailored insights on SLA performance, scenario health, and sign-ins. &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, all features highlighted in this blog are demonstrated in our video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1ruDHdFdWk">Trust via Transparency</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>  <p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope these added capabilities help maximize the value you receive from Microsoft Entra as you consider, deploy, and measure the progress of your Zero Trust approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Transparency in updates 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the world of technology, change is constant. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-s-top-50-features-of-2023/ba-p/3796392">In 2023, we released over 100 Microsoft Entra updates and new capabilities</a> and communicated this information across announcements, quarterly blogs, and multiple docs locations. Our first investment area of transparency aims to streamline this communication, helping you find and filter the product update information most relevant to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s New hub in Microsoft Entra admin center 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>”What’s New” in Microsoft Entra gives a clear and complete view of Entra product innovation so you can stay informed, evaluate the latest innovations, and eliminate the need to manually track updates. Product updates are categorized into Roadmap and Change Announcements. The roadmap includes public previews and recent general availability releases, while Change Announcements detail modifications to existing features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Transparency in adoption 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second investment area, transparency in adoption, focuses on helping you get more value from your Microsoft Entra licenses, giving you visibility to intelligent recommendations for improving configurations and protecting your organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra license utilization insights 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra license utilization insights help you optimize your Entra licenses, as well as stay compliant by getting insights into the current usage. Today, you can see usage and licenses for Entra ID capabilities such as Conditional Access and risk-based Conditional Access. In the future, we will expand the license utilization insights to other products in the Microsoft Entra product line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Transparency in operations 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transparency in operations focuses on what we're doing to help customers see how available and resilient Microsoft Entra really is, to hold us accountable when issues arise so we can keep improving, and to understand when they have actions to take within their tenant to improve its health. Let’s look at recently announced functionality in reporting, health, and monitoring:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant-level SLA reporting 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monthly tenant-level SLA reporting enables you to monitor your tenant's performance against our Entra ID SLA promise of 99.99% availability in authenticating users and issuing tokens within your tenant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Precomputed health metric streams 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new health metrics isolate relevant signals from activity logs and provide pre-computed, low-latency aggregates every 15 minutes for specific high-value observability scenarios. The first scenarios we’ve enabled are multifactor authentication (MFA), sign-ins for managed or compliant devices, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) sign-ins. We're starting with authentication-related scenarios because they are mission-critical to all our customers, but other scenarios in areas like entitlement management, directory configuration, and app health will be added in time, along with intelligent alerting capabilities in response to anomalous patterns in the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Copilot-assisted assessments 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our third example of our commitment to transparency in operations, we can help you understand how users interact with your organization's resources. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/copilot-security-entra">Microsoft Copilot for Security is embedded in Microsoft Entra</a> so you can more efficiently assess identities and access, plus investigate and resolve identity risks and even complete complex tasks. A great example of this assistance is asking Copilot to give you sign-in logs for a specific user for a specific amount of time, saving you the reporting time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tell us what you think 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my team, transparency isn’t a buzzword; it’s our commitment. As we continue to enhance Microsoft Entra, earning your trust through transparency remains our guiding star.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to you trying these new capabilities and hopefully making them part of your ongoing experience to reduce complexity and effectively manage your identity and network access security solutions.

<p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the capacity to create new opportunities, disrupt how we work, and change how we think about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2024/03/ai-regulation-at-a-crossroads/">AI regulation</a>. Some predict it will be as disruptive, if not more so, than the widespread adoption of the internet. But with new opportunities come new challenges and threats. While GenAI continues to dominate the attention of businesses, the media, and regulators, it’s also caught the attention of fraudsters.</p>
<p>Recent technological advances mean it’s never been cheaper or easier to be a fraudster. In this brave new digital-first world, fraudsters have more tools at their fingertips than ever before. And it’s set to cost. Online payment fraud losses are <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/research/fintech-payments/fraud-identity/online-payment-fraud-research-report/">predicted to increase</a> from $38 billion in 2023 to $91 billion in 2028.</p>
 The rise of the GenAI fraudster 
<p>Fraudsters generally fall into two groups: 1. the lone amateur and 2. organized criminal enterprises. Traditionally the latter, with more resources at their disposal, has posed a higher threat to businesses. But GenAI offers even the most amateur fraudsters easy access to more scalable and increasingly sophisticated types of fraud.</p>
<p>The evidence is in the data. Over the last few years, less sophisticated or “easy” fraud dominated. Proprietary data from <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/entrust-completes-acquisition-of-onfido">Onfido, an Entrust company</a>, found that between 2022 and 2023, 80.3% of fraud caught fell into this category. The remainder was classed as “medium” (19.6%) or “hard” (0.1%). But recently there’s been an increase in more sophisticated fraud. Comparing these figures to data from the last six months finds a jump in both medium fraud (accounting for 36.4%) and hard fraud (accounting for 1.4%).</p>
 How fraudsters are using generative AI 
 deepfakes 
<p>GenAI programs have made it easy for anyone to create realistic, fabricated content including audio, photos, and videos. Deepfake videos in particular, sophisticated synthetic media where a person’s likeness is replaced with someone else’s, are becoming increasingly common and convincing. Fraudsters have started using deepfakes to try and bypass biometric verification and authentication methods. These videos can be pre-recorded or generated in real time with a GPU and fake webcam, and typically involve superimposing one person’s face onto another’s.</p>
<p>This type of attack has surged in recent years. Comparing 2023 with 2022, there’s been a <a href="https://go.entrust.com/identity-fraud-report-2024">3,000% increase</a> in deepfake attempts. This is particularly concerning in the realm of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/digital-onboarding">digital onboarding</a> and identity verification, where the integrity of personal identification is paramount.</p>
<p>Currently, a few fraudsters are responsible for creating deepfakes at scale. But the growing popularity of “fraud-as-a-service” offerings (where experienced fraudsters offer their services to others), combined with improvements in deepfake software, suggests their volume and sophistication will increase in 2024.</p>
 Document forgeries 
<p>Many customer due diligence processes involve the authentication of identity documents. But image manipulation software, and the emergence of websites such as OnlyFakes — an online service that sells the ability to create images of identity documents it claims are generated using AI —&nbsp;have made it easier for fraudsters to fake documents.</p>
<p>There are four different ways for fraudsters to create fake documents:</p>
 
 Physical counterfeit: A fake physical document created from scratch 
 Digital counterfeit: A fake digital representation of a document created from scratch (i.e., in Photoshop) 
 Physical forgery: An existing document that is altered or edited 
 Digital forgery: An existing document that is altered or edited using digital tools 
 
<p>Historically, most fake documents were physical counterfeits (fake documents fraudsters created entirely from scratch). In 2023, Onfido identified that 73.2% of all document fraud caught was from physical counterfeits. In the last six months, that’s dropped to 59.56%, with digital forgeries accounting for a larger proportion of document fraud than prior years (34.8%).</p>
<p>This increase in digital forgeries can be attributed to the emergence of websites such as OnlyFakes. Fraudsters have wised up to the fact it’s a faster, cheaper, and more scalable way to create fake documents.</p>
 Synthetic identity fraud 
<p>Synthetic identity fraud is a type of fraud where criminals combine fake and real personal information, such as Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and names, to create a new identity. This new, fake identity is then used to open fake accounts, access credit, or make fraudulent purchases.</p>
<p>Generative AI tools offer a way for fraudsters to generate fake information for synthetic identities at scale. Fraudsters can use AI bots to scrape personal information from online sources, including online databases and social platforms, before using this information to create synthetic identities.</p>
<p>With synthetic identity fraud projected to generate <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions/2023/financial-institutions-synthetic-identity-fraud.html?id=us:2el:3dp:wsjspon:awa:WSJRCJ:2023:WSJFY24%3Fid%3Dus:2el:3dp:wsjspon:awa:WSJRCJ:2023:WSJFY24">$23 billion USD in losses</a> by 2030, businesses are adopting advanced fraud detection and prevention technologies to root out synthetic fraud. Keeping fraudsters from entering in the first place with a reliable identity verification solution at onboarding is the foundational element in this detection framework.</p>
 Phishing 
<p>During phishing attacks, fraudsters reach out to individuals via email or other forms of communication requesting they provide sensitive data or click a link to a malicious website, which may contain malware.</p>
<p>Generative AI tools offer fraudsters an easy way to create more sophisticated and personal social engineering scams at scale. For example, using AI tools to write convincing phishing emails or for card cracking. Research has found that the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/data-breach-identity-fraud-trends-reveal-deepfake-and-generative-ai-threats">top tools used by bad actors</a> in 2023 include the dark web, fraud as a service, and generative AI. This includes the tool wormGPT, which provides a fast method for generating phishing attacks and malicious code.</p>
 Combatting GenAI fraud with… AI 
<p>The advancement in GenAI means we’re entering a new phase of fraud and cyberattacks. But the good news is that any technology fraudsters can access is accessible to those building fraud detection solutions. The best cyber defense systems of tomorrow will need AI to power them to combat the speed and scale of attacks. Think of it as an “AI versus AI showdown.”</p>
<p>With the right training, AI algorithms can recognize the subtle differences between authentic and synthetic images or videos, which are often imperceptible to the human eye. Machine learning, a subset of AI, plays a crucial role in identifying irregularities in digital content. By training on vast datasets of both real and fake media, machine learning models can learn to differentiate between the two with high accuracy.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of using AI to fight deepfakes and other GenAI fraud is its ability to continuously learn and adapt. As deepfake technology evolves, so too do the AI algorithms designed to detect them.</p>

<p>Today’s healthcare relies on digital health ecosystems—a network of interconnected digital services. These ecosystems need to accommodate any type of user to support a variety of digital healthcare use cases and innovation. User types not only include consumers, providers, workforces, and partners, but also connected IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) such as remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices, wearables, and medical equipment. And now in the age of artificial intelligence, users also include AI sessions and agents. Digital health ecosystems also include cloud services and third-party partnerships and application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interoperability is a fundamental pillar within this intricate digital web. As healthcare systems evolve, the seamless exchange of health information across diverse digital ecosystems and stakeholders—such as providers, payers, pharmacies, patients/members—is critical. It’s been proven that shared data exchange improves care by informing clinical decisions that result in better patient outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Healthcare interoperability refers to the ability of different health information technologies to communicate, exchange, and use health information in a coordinated manner, both within and across organizational boundaries, in order to improve healthcare delivery. As discussed below, multiple regulations mandate interoperability. And achieving it is a complex endeavor. For example, interoperability relies on advanced cybersecurity capabilities, a standard called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for data formats and APIs, legal agreements for data sharing, and governance models to manage the data exchange of medical records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interoperable systems are essential to optimize patient care and streamline healthcare delivery. Health information exchange across digital health ecosystems hinges on secure integrations and access management of clinical data, such as electronic health records (EHRs), across various information systems and interfaces. At the heart of this endeavor lies identity and access management (IAM). Healthcare IAM (also known as healthcare identity management) is a crucial component for both achieving healthcare data interoperability and complying with the regulations that mandate it.</p>

   The EU's Digital Identity Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) offers a starting point for digital wallets. It aims to support user control over personal data while meeting legal and cybersecurity requirements. But to get there from here, you need to know what you don't know: the functional and non-functional requirements, along with interfaces and integration points for digital identity wallets

<p>Digital wallets and the credentials they hold are ALL the rage these days. Understanding how to make them work in today’s world is where the EU’s Digital Identity Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) comes in.</p>



<p>If you’ve read my posts about verifiable credentials (<a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/03/verifiable-credentials-and-mdocs-a-tale-of-two-protocols/">this one</a> and <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/15/more-on-the-options-and-diversity-of-verifiable-credentials/">this one</a>), the next logical step is to discuss how those credentials are stored in a digital wallet.</p>



 What’s a Wallet? 



<p>OK, so digital identity wallets may be all the rage, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that people—even techies—have a common understanding of what they are. According to the Open Wallet Foundation:</p>



<p>“A digital wallet is a container where you can store and access digital assets, credentials, and other useful items, such as tickets and keys. Another software component, most often called an agent, can put items into a wallet, take items out of a wallet, or process items in a wallet. While the wallet is the container, the agent is the mover and shaker.” — Gordon Gram, “<a href="https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/LF%20Research/OpenWallet%20Open%20Digital%20Wallet%20-%20Report.pdf?hsLang=en">Why the World Needs an Open Source Digital Wallet Right Now</a>,” Open Wallet Foundation, February 2023.</p>



<p>That’s a good functional definition, though it doesn’t quite help determine the standard technical specifications for the container. But that’s a topic for a future blog post.</p>



 A Framework for Many Moving Parts 



<p>Governments, businesses, and individuals are all concerned with how to give an individual agency over their personal data. This concern is a natural response to the privacy laws that have rolled out worldwide in the last 5+ years. That said, coming up with a structure that supports user agency over their own data while still supporting other legal and cybersecurity-based requirements is a challenge. There are just SO MANY moving parts!</p>



 
 There are the entities that are responsible for the wallets themselves (i.e., the Holders). 



 There are the entities that are responsible for the data that goes into the credentials stored by the wallet (i.e., the Issuers). 



 There are the entities that want to ask for the credential (or some of the data that the credential holds) (i.e., the Verifiers). 
 



<p>But wait, there’s more! There are device manufacturers that have to have equipment capable of managing the cryptography associated with complex digital signatures. Services responsible for building a trusted registry of entities participating in this ecosystem. Entities providing audit services to make sure everything is running securely and according to current legal requirements and best practices. And so on.</p>



<p>With so many moving parts and personal data, is it any wonder the EU decided that further guidance was necessary? How many ways this can go wrong is more than a bit terrifying. And yet, the promises of privacy, security, and agency can’t be ignored. And the ARF is where that work starts.</p>



 Enter the EUDI Architecture Reference Framework 



<p>The ARF is an outline that provides the first blush of a framework for how digital wallets will work in the EU. The European Commission kicked off the work through a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/03/26/european-digital-identity-eid-council-adopts-legal-framework-on-a-secure-and-trustworthy-digital-wallet-for-all-europeans/">Commission Recommendation</a>&nbsp;from June 2021 that urged Member States to develop common standards, technical specifications, and best practices in response to the eIDAS 2.0 regulation. EU Member States sent their experts to join a collaborative process to build the framework.</p>



<p>The work was done very openly via a public&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework">GitHub repository</a>, letting people see and comment on the changes as the work developed.</p>



<p>While using the framework isn’t required to comply with eIDAS 2.0, it’s still the best way to help meet the goal of an interoperable environment for digital wallets. Other countries and companies should see this as a great place to start.&nbsp;</p>



 Highlights 



<p>The ARF isn’t a particularly long document—it’s a comprehensive outline, after all, not the complete guidance— but it is dense with information! Here are a few highlights:</p>



<p>1. Functional Requirements Are A Thing: If your organization is exploring using digital verifiable credentials, then you could do worse than start here. And if you are interested in using digital verifiable credentials AND have a presence in the EU, then you REALLY want to start here. A wallet needs to be able to do a variety of things. From the ability to perform electronic identification, store and manage qualified and non-qualified electronic attestations of attributes, and provide mutual authentication capabilities, this isn’t something you want to get wrong. Given that, the level of detail in the ARF is great kickstarter guide for developers and stakeholders on the technical expectations and capabilities required for the EUDI Wallet. It’s an opportunity to mitigate “you don’t know what you don’t know” when making plans in the digital wallet world.</p>



<p>2. It’s Not All Technical Details: The ARF outline includes space for non-functional requirements, including guidance on security, privacy by design, and user control over personal data. Having a presence in the EU and a reliance on government-issued credentials means playing in the digital wallet and verifiable credential landscape. The ARF puts the framework in a context that will help you comply with the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks while providing a secure and user-friendly experience.</p>



<p>3. But if You Want to Talk about Interfaces and Integration Points: The framework will specify various interfaces and integration points for a digital identity wallet (specifically the EUDI Wallet) with external entities like Member States’ infrastructures, identity cards, and trusted registries. You probably could go a trial-and-error route to figure out how to integrate with this digital ecosystem, but life is too short. Use the guidance to save time; it’s freely available.</p>



 What Happens Next? 



<p>As with any v1.0, you can expect changes. The ARF will evolve from an outline to a complete Architecture and Reference Framework. The authors intend to expand this outline into a comprehensive framework as set out in the Commission Recommendation, and it will be aligned with the outcomes of the legislative negotiations regarding the proposal for a European Digital Identity Framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As noted earlier, the ARF has its own GitHub repository, and you are free to offer feedback if you have ideas and experience that will help improve the framework.</p>



 How Globally Applicable is the ARF? 



<p>If you ask me (and it’s my blog), deployers can and should use the ARF as the basis for large-scale wallet deployments worldwide. But others may not agree. The US, in particular, is much more chaotic regarding wallet deployments as each US State is deciding independently of others whether they will build their own or use ones from Google or Apple. The US Federal Government’s Department of Homeland Security is also <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2023/06/22/st-seeks-solutions-privacy-preserving-digital-credential-wallets-verifiers">doing amazing work</a> in the verifiable credential and digital wallet space. Still, they don’t have the same level of mandate that regulations like eIDAS2, GDPR, etc, provide in the European Union.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p>This Advisory Note examines the paradigm shift towards modern identity &amp; access management (IAM) frameworks that support digital business initiatives, including zero trust and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), and the imperative for organizations to modernize their IAM infrastructures. It highlights the necessity of transitioning from legacy systems that are ill-equipped for the demands of cloud computing and diverse user groups, towards more agile, scalable, and integrated IAM solutions. This transition is not merely technical but strategic, ensuring IAM systems can support a wide array of identities, from employees to customers and devices, and play a critical role in securing digital interactions across various platforms and services.
